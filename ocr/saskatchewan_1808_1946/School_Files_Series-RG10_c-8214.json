The walls are in need of whitening and the woodwork should have a coat of varnish.\n\nThe toilet requires whitewashing and window glass.\n\nThe boys' toilet must have a new water trough.\n\nMalcolm McIvor,\nTeacher,\nOttawa, July 28th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teacher of the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, in his report for the June quarter, last, states that the roof over one of the cloak rooms is leaking badly. He also states that the interior walls of the classroom are in need of whitening, and that the woodwork should be washed and given a coat of varnish. He further states that the toilet requires to be whitewashed and that some window glass should be supplied, also that the drain in the boys' toilet is in need of a new water trough.\n\nI have to request that you will report as soon as possible on the recommendations made by the teacher, and state what repairs, if any, you would recommend be carried out. The approximate cost of any work which you recommend be done should be stated. Please reply as soon as possible in order that if it is decided to have any of this work undertaken it can be completed during the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSaul Putnam, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your favour of the 28th inst., no 31-2-5, re repairs to Village school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I would recommend this work. The woodwork will require two coats of varnish and the window sashes a coat of white paint. The roof of one of the cloak rooms needs shingling and the ceiling of this room will have to be re-plastered as the leak in the roof has destroyed the plaster. The walls all require whitening. One of the storm windows should have three panes of glass. The toilets need whitewashing and two panes of glass. The boys' toilet should have a new water trough and the doors need new latches.\n\nI have made a careful estimate of the cost of this work, and would say that it would cost from one hundred and fifty to one hundred and sixty dollars, and would recommend that it be done as soon as possible.\n\nIt would appear that there has been a lot of money spent since I took this office, but apparently these buildings have been neglected and the work that I have recommended is absolutely necessary.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you recommend that certain repairs and painting be carried out to the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost of same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the woodwork given two coats of varnish, and the window sashes and trimming a coat of white paint. The roof of the cloak room should be reshingled, and the ceiling of this room replastered and the walls whitened. You may also arrange to have three panes of glass put in the storm windows. The toilets should also be whitewashed, and 2 panes of glass installed. A new water trough should also be installed in the boys' toilet, and latches placed on the doors.\n\nIf possible, you should arrange to have all of the above work done by day labour, you to arrange for the purchase and delivery of the materials required. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed. These you should certify and send to the Department for payment, together with vouchers, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint, shingles and other materials. We note that you estimate the cost of all the above work to be approximately $160.00. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the work completed in the most satisfactory manner and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nThe above work should receive your early attention, and, if possible, should be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

You may make the necessary arrangements to have this new furnace installed during the coming summer holidays. You should obtain prices for the supplying of either a McClary or Gurney furnace, and arrange to have the one which you consider would be the most satisfactory and could be installed at the lowest price obtained. The Department will expect you to see that the new furnace is satisfactorily installed, and, when the work is completed, you should forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost of the furnace and the installation of same.\n\nIf the present old furnace can be disposed of, you should endeavour to sell same and forward the money received to the Department for credit of Band funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

One has only to see their deportment in the classroom to be assured that good progress is being made.\n\nThis school needs some repairs and the following are recommended:\n\nIn the basement a door is required between the furnace room and the steps leading to the rear basement entrance. The lack of a door makes the classroom very cold. The building should be painted inside and out next summer. It is showing signs of wear. It will need two coats of paint.\n\nThe teacher would like to have a map of North America.\n\nThos. McGookin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, recommends that, in the basement, a door be installed between the furnace room and the steps leading to the rear basement entrance. He states that the lack of the door makes the classroom very cold.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to have a door installed. A lock with key should also be supplied, if same is considered by you to be necessary. You should see that this door is installed in a satisfactory manner, that no expense is incurred, and that the work is completed before the extreme cold weather sets in. After the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that this building be painted, both inside and outside, next summer, as it is showing signs of wear. He states it will require two coats of paint. I have to request that you will draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, giving full particulars as to the amount of paint required and the approximate cost of the material and labour. If the out buildings require painting, you should also include them in your estimate.\n\nThe Inspector speaks highly of the work being performed by the teacher at this school, and states that the pupils are interested in their studies.\n\nAn order is being placed with the Government Stationery Office here to forward to the teacher a map of North America.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n| Item Description | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------|----------|-------|\n| V siding         | 45 ft    | $5.00 |\n| Lath             | 3       | $7.50 |\n| Plaster          | 60 sq ft| $2.25 |\n| Cement           | 8       | $5.20 |\n| Lime             | 3       | $2.25 |\n| Bricks           | 2       | $1.20 |\n| Roofing          | 2       | $1.00 |\n| Shingles         | 5       | $0.30 |\n| Nails            | 2       | $0.38 |\n| Glass            | 38 lbs  | $19.20|\n| Masonry          | 26      | $10.40|\n| Pipes            | 4       | $1.00 |\n| Galv pipe        | 5       | $0.35 |\n| Labor            | 5 hrs   | $3.75 |\n| Repairing        |          | $51.57|\n\nTotal: $51.57\n\nJW\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n| Dec. 24th | Authorized by Dept. letter No. 31-2-5 dated November 17th, 1930.

The pipe needs to be lengthened by 6 or 8 feet.\nThe playground is very bumpy and uneven. It should be plowed up, levelled and seeded down.\n\n---\nOttawa, June 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his recent inspection of the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, states that the following repairs are required:\n\nCeiling in both clothes closets should be repaired.\n\nEavestroughing on the entrance porch is disconnected and should be repaired as soon as possible.\n\nPump is out of order - pipe needs to be lengthened 6' or 8'.\n\nYou should arrange to have the above repairs carried out during the coming summer holidays, keeping all expenses for the purpose as low as possible. When the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector states that the playground is very uneven. He recommends that it be plowed up, levelled and seeded down. I shall be pleased to have a report from you as to the work you would recommend be carried out in the levelling of these grounds, and the approximate cost of same.\n\nI may say that we will have no funds this summer for the painting of the school building, both inside and outside.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter no. 31-2-5, dated June 8th, 1931, with reference to repairs required to the Saugeen Village Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to say, the playground in connection with this school is divided, part being for the girls and part for the boys, it is very uneven and should be plowed and seeded down. The soil is very light and sandy, if it was plowed it may require a coat of heavier loam to keep it from blowing away, I would recommend that one side be plowed at a time, if the girls side were plowed this summer it would be ready for use next year when the other side could be plowed, It would cost around $25.00 to have the one side plowed, leveled, top dressed and seeded down.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDon.

The total cost of having this playground plowed, levelled, top dressed and seeded down should not exceed approximately $25. The work in connection with the playground should be carried out when the repairs authorized by official letter of the 8th ultimo are being done.

M. Knetchel, teacher, 18 on roll, 15 present. Average for April, 15. Classroom clean and tidy. Discipline good. Pupils look healthy and tidy. No complaints were made to me regarding the teacher's work on this visit. The school property generally is in good condition.\n\nThe interior should be redecorated when funds are available.\n\nThe furnace room floor - 108 sq. feet, should be cemented.\n\nThe south side of roof will soon need reshingling. It will be alright for another year.\n\nPart of the ridge board is off. This should be replaced at once to avoid damage to the roof.\n\nHalf a dozen wall pictures for classroom would add interest and appearance to it.\nOttawa, May 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his recent inspection of the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, recommends that the interior of the building be redecorated, also that the floor of the furnace room be cemented and that the part of the ridge board which is off be replaced, in order to avoid damage to the roof.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the repairs required made to the ridge board at an early date. When this work is completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nRegarding the redecorating of the interior of the school and cementing of the floor of the furnace room, I would request that you state whether you consider this work to be urgent, or if it could remain over for another year. If you consider that any of this work should be carried out at the present time, I would request that you forward full particulars of the work you would recommend be performed and the approximate cost of any materials and labour required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nD. Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill,\nOnt.\nEXTRACT from Report of Inspector J.M. Game, regarding his visit to the SAUGEEN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on May 10th, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 31-2-6.\n\nThe school building is a substantial brick building in a good state of repair except for a few rather important features. The walls and ceiling of the classroom require redecorating badly and the plaster in two places is loose. Parts of the roof require reshingling.\n\nThe water closets should have boxes provided so that cleaning might be effected more readily.\n\nThe furnace was so crudely installed that it is impossible to keep the basement near it neat. More cement work is required around it.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 31-2-5, dated May 26th, regarding repairs required to the Saugeen Village Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to say, as there is no floor in part of the furnace room it makes it hard to keep it clean, a cement floor would cost about $11.00, which I would recommend being done.\n\nRegarding the redecorating of the interior of the building, this work should be done but before it is carried out the south side of the roof should be reshingled; the shingles on this side have rotted and during recent high winds a number of them have blown away leaving the sheeting bare. It would cost around $85.00 to reshingle this side of the roof. I would recommend that the roof be reshingled during the coming holidays and the redecorating left over for another year.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDon. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 25th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, regarding the repairs required to the Saugeen Village Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging to have a cement floor installed in part of the furnace room. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the material and labour to be, approximately, $11.00.\n\nThe Department will also approve of your arranging for the reshingling of the south side of the roof.

I believe it is necessary to do this as I believe the frame in pointed tower is rotten and should not be in a fit condition. This would not cost any additional expense for the new timbers of main frame which would be about $10. Should the kept approve of this arrangement make my estimate $181.25.\n\nAlso enclosed find tendered estimates for the redecoration of the inside walls and woodwork throughout the school $125.00\n\nYours truly,\nRobert McVittie\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 31-2-5, dated November 23rd. Regarding repairs to the Saugeen Village school.\n\nI beg to say, I had Mr. Dan McVittie, go over the furnace, he was unable to find any hole in the top of the fire-box but done some repairs to the furnace and pipes. I am also enclosing the estimate for reshingleing the north side of the roof and re-decorating the inside of the school, this estimate has been furnished by Mr. Robert McVittie, Southampton. Regarding the window shades, there are six shades required, five of these would cost $4.00 each and one extra large one $13.50. The well is all right, plenty of water. There are two or three window panes cracked in the basement, I consider they would do until warm weather as the pane is only cracked and not broken out. I have asked the caretaker to have the top part of the windows cleaned, these storm windows are the full length of the casement and hung on hinges from the top, one man cannot handle them to take them down, the caretaker has asked to have a man to help him at this work.\n\nEnclosed please find vouchers amounting to $5.00 in favor of Dan McVittie, Southampton, Ont. for repairing the furnace.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department next spring. If funds are available, authority will then be given to have the work done.\n\nI note that certain repairs have been carried out to the furnace and pipes. It is hoped that same will be satisfactory for the balance of the present winter.\n\nRegarding the window shades required, I have to say that you may obtain prices from firms on the approved list and arrange for the purchase of the six shades required. It is considered that they could be obtained at a lower cost than the estimate given by you. However, you should purchase satisfactory shades at the lowest possible cost and have them installed. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the shades, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe account which you enclosed, covering the cost of the repairs to the furnace, will be paid in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 28, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to certain repairs which you consider advisable at the Saugeen Village Indian Day School.\n\nThe estimate forwarded in your letter of December 20th, last, showed that it would cost approximately $350 for shingling the roof and decorating the interior of this school. Owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to authorize such a large expenditure on the Saugeen School.\n\nIf minor repairs could be made to the roof so as to keep it habitable, you might let me have an estimate of the expenditure that would be sufficient in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Gane's report on his inspection of the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, I beg to say that you may replace the broken glass where necessary, also the latches on both water closets, and forward a voucher, in triplicate, covering the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 31-2-5, dated June 28th, regarding repairs to the Saugeen Village school.\n\nI beg to say, I had Mr. McVittie from Southampton out and we went over the north side of the roof. The present shingles are so decayed that when you move around they fall away. Mr. McVittie states that it would be a waste of money to try and patch it. If funds were available, I would suggest that the north side be reshingled and the decorating the interior left over for another year, the reshingling would cost about $165.00. There is a high spire on this side of the roof which I would suggest be lowered to an ordinary bellfry; this could be done at the time of reshingling at no extra cost.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

He states the plaster is almost black in places and is off altogether in a number of places in the classroom and porches. He suggests that paint rather than kalsomine be used in redecorating, and that white ceilings and cream or buff walls, which are recommended in the Ontario Regulations, should be the colours used.\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Department of the work you consider should be carried out in redecorating the interior of the school building and the cost of same. You should also state how you would propose that the work be carried out.

I do not think Indian labour would be satisfactory on work of this kind. I had Mr. W. H.

The boys' closet is untidy.\"\n\nThere is no reason why the Inspector should report that the closet is untidy as it should receive attention from the janitor of the school and should always be kept in good condition.\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of redecorating the walls and ceiling of the class room.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I may say that this class room was redecorated in 1935 at a cost of $85.01 but both material and labour is more expensive at the present time.

If the material required costs over $50.00 you should forward a requisition to this office for what is needed in order that purchase may be made through the Purchasing Branch. In connection with labour I would prefer to have Indians employed. Surely they could do the work under your supervision.

In connection with labour, I could employ one or two Indians but would have to have a painter along with them, the Indians have no equipment whatever for this work and it would hardly pay to purchase it for small jobs, Mr. Indoe could do this work before school reopens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

Harvey has recommended to your Department that a piano be purchased for the Saugeen village school.\n\nIn visiting this school of 37 pupils I see the need of a piano in teaching them music and singing. Mrs. Logan, the teacher, is doing good work. She has an old organ, unsuitable for school work. She is commencing her training with them for the Christmas programme, and a piano would be a great asset.\n\nA good used piano can be purchased for $150. We got two pianos this year for our churches for $100 each.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.W. M. Langley, missionary\nOttawa, 14 November 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th instant suggesting the purchase of a piano for the Saugeen Village School.\n\nIt has not been our practice to supply pianos to Day Schools and at the present time we do not feel disposed to change our policy in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Would it be possible\nto have this piano soon so that practice for the Christmas concert would be greatly facilitated and a greater desire for singing obtained than now possible.\n\nThere is another want or need I should say, that of a good picture of the King and Queen (we have a calendar picture of the Queen) at the front of the class.\n\nA good clock would be a fine addition, as a battered alarm clock that sometimes stops is now our time piece.\n\nI sincerely hope our needs will not be too great or many for your kind consideration.\n\nI do wish to give the pupils\na fair deal and advance their interests to the fullest extent.\n\nYours truly,\n(Mrs) M. M. Logan.\nOttawa, November 21, 1946.\n\nDear Mrs. Logan:\n\nIt is sincerely regretted that we are unable to supply a piano for your school. It has not been the practice of the Department to provide pianos for one-room schools. We have supplied pianos for three and four room day schools and for a residential school. When you realize there are over 250 day schools of the one-room category in Canada, you will understand the reason for the above policy.\n\nWe are writing to your Indian Agent concerning your request for a clock.

The situation may be all right while Mrs. Logan is teaching at this school, but if a change in teachers occurs and the new teacher wishes to occupy the residence, then there is considerable difficulty.\n\nIn view of the above, could you please inform us whether it is Mrs. Logan's intention to return to this school next year.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Farley's tender for the teacher's residence will provide satisfactory lighting for the teacherage but we are anxious to conform to Ontario Hydro Electric plans in wiring the classroom.\n\nWe also understand that the wood range in the teacherage is in very bad condition. I would suggest that you submit a requisition for a new stove for her kitchen.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. J. E.

The total of these returns shows an outlay by you of $1,262.33. I would call your attention to the return for the week ending August 16th, which you totalled at $68.00 when the correct amount is $79.00.\n\nIt is noted that from the week of June 14th to that of August 30th, you have paid out $62.00 to Edith Longe, presumably for office work, and exception must be taken to this payment as the same was not authorized by this Department and does not necessarily come under the class of which might be called labour in connection with the teacher's residence. These payments to Miss Longe must be disallowed unless good reason can be shown why payment should be made and in any event her services should not have been retained by you without obtaining the permission of the Department.\n\nIt is noted that some weeks George Nickel, mason, was paid seventy-five cents an hour and sometimes eighty-five cents an hour; an explanation is required why the difference in rate of payment.\n\nYou were advanced to pay for the erection of this residence $1,552.33, made up as follows:\n\nSaul Putnam, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\n2.\n\nCheque No. 1163 for .................. $ 500.00\nCheque No. 2747 for .................. 800.00\nCheque No. 3654 for .................. 141.93\nCheque No. 5242 for .................. 110.40\n\nOf these advances made to you, you have paid $1,262.33 for labour and $300.00 to Mr. Diebel for lumber or a total of $1,562.33, but as you have paid Miss Longe $62.00 without the authority of the Department, there is to be refunded by you the sum of $62.00.\n\nThis residence which was estimated to cost $2,500.00 has cost to date $3,205.17, less $62.00 to be refunded by you as pointed out above, or $1,353.17 more than the estimate, so that the Department would like an explanation from you why the cost has been so excessive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter 31-2-8 of the 4th inst.\n\nWith regard to the first paragraph of your letter, would you kindly send me a copy of the time sheet for week ending August 16th, as I sent both copies.\n\nRegarding paragraph 2, in your letter 31-2-8 of May 13th, you authorized me to have office help. While this work was going on at the teacher's residence and French Bay culverts I was working fifteen and sixteen hours a day all through holiday time. I worked ten hours a day at these two places the same as the other men. The foreman, Mr. Aitchison wanted to quit three times, as the Indians are very hard to get along with. It was absolutely necessary for me to have office help.\n\nRegarding George Nickel, the first time I employed him was at $5 an hour for plastering. I started with Indians, who told me they could plaster, but found they could not without a practical man to lead them. Nickel wanted $1.00 an hour as that is the regular price paid plasterers, but agreed to come for $5. I was acting foreman at the time the plastering was going on. The foreman I had, Mr. John Aitchison was an all round man, but not a mason. I let him go while the plastering and putty coating was going on, for I could foreman that part of the work as well as he could. The reason I got Nickel for 75\u00a2 per hour was he said he would come for the putty coating for 75\u00a2 an hour if I would get a white man to work with him, as he did not like working with Indians. I knew of another man Bruce McKay, of Fort Algin, and employed him at 75\u00a2 an hour. My reason for having the two plastering, I had to have a tender for them, and it would cost the same for the two as for one.\n\nRegarding teacher's residence costing $3905.17, there sure is some mistake, as we have roughly $200.00 for extras to pay yet. It seems impossible to get these people to send in their accounts. I had to put up a she to keep the lime and tools in, as there was nothing on the lot, and if things were not kept locked up they would be taken away. I dug a well and put in a cheap crib to hold the sand back, as I wanted to test this well and it held out O.K. I also had to put up a closet, which took lumber, and I have about five hundred feet left. Would you kindly send a copy of accounts paid, as I feel sure there must be a mistake. When I send in an account you send the cheque direct to the person, and I do not know if the account is paid or not, as I receive no word of this cheque being sent.\nSir \u2014\n\nI have had a good many responsible positions, and never was accused of keeping any person's money, and I do not think at my time of life, it would be worth while.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

I may say that we do not provide stables at Indian day schools, but I shall be pleased to have a statement of your views as to whether you would recommend that a stable or outbuilding suitable to meet the requirements be erected or not. If any large expenditure would be involved, it is unlikely that we would be prepared to authorize this work.

This matter has been brought up in the Council, and it was left to be considered at the next meeting.\n\nMr. McIvor has nothing of any kind to put in a stable except a second hand Ford car, which I think belongs to an insurance company, nor is he in a position to buy anything. As for transportation, there is a bus passes his door twice a day running between Owen Sound and Southampton, and the jitneys run out here for the fee of ten cents, and I think for Mr. McIvor's own interests he is better without anything. There are buildings of this kind at Scotch Settlement and French Bay that are going to wreck more than if they were used, and if Mr. McIvor wants a building of this kind I would recommend him to transfer to French Bay.\n\nI have the honor to remain, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 20th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the building of a stable in connection with the new residence which was completed last fall for the use of the teacher of the Saugeen Village Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to have your report on this matter, and in view of your opinion that it is not necessary to erect a stable, you may inform the teacher that the Department is not prepared to undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As there are two stoves owned by the Department in the French Bay teacher's residence, Mr. McIvor wants a cook stove, which would cost about seventy-five dollars.\n\nThere is no stove in the teacher's residence at the Village school, owned by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 14th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the application made by the teacher of the Saugeen Village Indian Day School to be supplied with a cook stove for the use of the residence in connection with the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to supply a cook stove, but it is considered that the amount mentioned by you, viz. $75, is excessive. Please obtain prices from a number of dealers for the supplying of a small cook stove, and submit same for the consideration of the Department. When we have these quotations, consideration will be given to authorizing you to make the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSaul Putnam, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter 31-2-8 of Dec. 14th. I wish to inform you that Mr. McIvor would not be satisfied with a small stove, as he has one now that doesn't give very good satisfaction, and a range could not be bought from the local dealers for less than from $65.00 to $75.00. It could no doubt be got cheaper from Eaton's catalogue, but I do not know anything about these stoves if they are good or not. Mr. McIvor is satisfied to leave the matter over for this winter.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

J. Wesley sec. by Paul Williams that a Committee be appointed to look into the matter of papering the teacher's residence of the Village school. Carried.\n\nRe Motion one, neither the Council of myself are in favor of papering this house, as it has not been lived in for two years yet, and should not need papering so soon.\n\nSaul Putnam.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nTwo years ago I built a garage on the property in connection with the residence provided for the teacher. Part of the lumber used had been dug out of the field by the resident but I bought the rest of the lumber, all the shingles, nails, scantling and doors etc., cost me all told about $45.00.\n\nThis came to mind for a woodshed or garage. There are no other buildings outside the residence.\n\nI also had a cement lip put on the well in October so we could not use it until this was done. I had asked the agent to have the door hung to prevent recommendation anything that I asked for. If I had been obliged here I intended paying for this.\nThis work was not authorized by the Department, but under the circumstances I would respectfully ask you to allow me for this or give me the privilege of moving the garage.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMalcolm McLeod\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nAllardt, Ont.\n\nAsk Mr. Parker.\n\nRemarks are correct\nlet him move garage\n\nR.H.\nOttawa, December 14, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the building which you erected as a garage and the building of a cement top on the well at the Saugeen Village Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may remove this garage from the school property. The part of the lumber used in its erection and which was left over from the building of the teacher's residence will serve as compensation for any expense incurred by you in the building of the cement top on the well.\n\nWe are informing the local Indian Agent of the authority granted you to remove this garage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If he intends to do so, you may arrange for the purchase of a small cooking range and a heater, also the window shades required. You should obtain competitive prices for the stoves and window shades, and make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. When the shades arrive, you should arrange to have them installed on the windows.

You may, however, arrange to have the entrance to the cellar properly covered, and it is thought that if boards were nailed over same it would be sufficient. You may arrange to have eaves-troughs, which we note would cost about 15 cents per foot, installed. While a satisfactory job should be completed, it is not intended that any unnecessary expense be incurred, but only sufficient eaves-troughs installed to prevent the water damaging the building. This work should be done before the painting of the building is carried out.

He is occupying same on the condition that he will move out at any time it is required for the use of a teacher.\n\nOf course suitable notice must be given to Dept. should engage trained single teacher without full consideration.\n\n3/5/29\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6160, file 425-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEXTRACT from Report of Inspector J.M. Game, regarding his visit to the SAUGEEN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on May 10th, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 31-2-6.\n\nThe teacher's residence is being used by the resident minister as the teacher lives at home in Southampton. All buildings are owned by the Reserve.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Walter Knechtel, teacher of the Saugeen Indian Village School, has applied for the use of the teacher's residence from September next.\n\nI beg to say, Mr. Weir the Missionary, has been using this house since 1928, Mr. Weir expects to be moved to the Brantford reserve this summer and a new Missionary will be appointed for Saugeen. By Department letter No. 4031-MI, dated July 18th, 1928 the Missionary was allowed to use the teacher's house until such time as it was required for the teacher. Mr. Weir has a garage of his own in connection with this house which he wishes to sell to the Department at a cost of $25.00.\n\nWould you kindly advise me if any arrangements will be made for a house for the Missionary and also if the Department wishes to purchase the garage from Mr. Weir.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 22nd., 1934.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, reporting that Mr. Walter Knechtel, the Teacher of the village school, will require the teacher's residence from September next. This residence has been occupied by the Missionary on the understanding that any time that it is required by the teacher, it will be vacated. You should accordingly notify the Missionary that the residence should be vacated in August at the latest so as to be available for the teacher on the 1st September, or a short time before so that he may get the place in readiness for occupancy.\n\nThe Mission House is being occupied by a Saugeen Indian on the understanding that at any time it may be required, he will vacate it. You should accordingly notify him that the Mission House will be required before the 1st September. I understand that the Mission House is not in fit state for a Missionary to live in, and I would ask that you look over the property and make a report of what is required to make it habitable. This is on the assumption that the Missionary will occupy the house, but if he desires to secure another house, there is no need of disturbing the Indian.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary.\n\nHon. Robertson Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 31-2-8, dated May 22nd, regarding the Mission House on the reserve.\n\nI beg to say, I interviewed Mr. Weir, the Missionary, and also Mr. Barner, regarding the house. Mr. Barner stated that the Missionary would be staying in a house in Southampton for a time until arrangements were made for repairing the Mission house on the reserve. It would cost almost as much to repair this house as it would to build a new one. I may say that at a meeting of the Saugeen Band held November the 19th, 1928 there was $2500 voted for building a Mission House from Band Funds, by Department letter No. 4031-M I, dated December 10th, 1928, this expenditure was not authorized. Mr. Barner stated that he would be in the Department in the near future and discuss this matter.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Walter Knechtel, teacher of the Saugeen Indian Village Day School, has applied to me for two rugs, seven window shades and some paint, for the teacher's residence.\n\nI beg to say, Mr. Knechtel moved into the residence in October, the furniture that is in the house belongs to the missionary, excepting the stoves, which belong to the Department, there is no covering on the floors and the window shades are done. The teacher also asked for four pair of window curtains. The rugs would cost about $10.50 each, the window shades about $1.20 each, the curtains about $1.50 per pair and the paint required about $6.00. Mr. Knechtel would do the necessary painting himself.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 13th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase for use at the teacher's residence at the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, two (2) rugs at $10.50 each; seven (7) window shades at $1.20 each; four (4) pairs of curtains at $1.80 a pair; and paint to the value of $6.00.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Knechtel will do the painting without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAs P.

The only furniture in the teacher's residence is two rugs, two stoves, window shades and curtains on the downstairs windows.

The other charge of dealing in timber was merely admitted and it was ordered to be stopped. It was not at the time thought necessary to dismiss Burr from his position as teacher and the Indians have laid no additional charge against him, but simply state that they wish to have a change like the other two schools on the reserve.

I have been offered $50.00 per year to go to Manitoba and if I cannot get an increase I will be compelled to tender the Department of Indian Affairs my resignation. I have been teaching on the Saugeen Reserve for nearly Twenty-two Years during that time I have supported ten of a family but in order to do it I was compelled to work out in holidays.\nI think that I should receive enough salary for teaching to support my family without manual labor on the farm during holidays. The legislature of Ontario has passed an Act to increase teachers' salaries and I think that the teachers in Indian schools should receive the benefit of the law as well as others.\n\nIn conclusion, I hope that the Honorable Gentlemen of the Department of Indian Affairs will see their way clearly to grant the teachers an increase in their salaries.\n\nI am\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Burt,\nTeacher\nScotch Settlement,\nSangues Reserve.\nOttawa, January 31, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. John Burr, teacher of the Scotch Settlement school has written the Department applying for an increase of salary.

The schools at French Bay and the Scotch Settlement are models of neatness, cleanliness and good order and would put to shame many of the public schools throughout the county.

There is a stable on the land in connection with the dwelling, which Mr. Burr erected at his own expense. The building will accommodate a cow, horse and a dog or two hens.

The Department wishes to obtain a married teacher, if possible, and, if successful, the house would be required at an earlier date than that above mentioned.\n\nFor your information I may say that the nomination of a teacher for this school rests with the Methodist Church. There will, however, be no objection to your making inquiries with a view to securing a successor to Mr. Burr, but the teacher should be a member of the Methodist Church, if it is possible to obtain such. No action must be taken, however, without the sanction of the Department.\n\nIn reference to the stable I beg to say that the Department is not disposed to allow Mr. Burr to remove it, but is willing to pay him a reasonable price for it.

There is a suitable teacher's residence close to the school, with good water and between two and three acres of land.

He also states that he has had applications from three teachers but that they are not members of the Methodist Church. However as it is highly desirable that the School should be in operation, if the Department does not hear from you at an early date it will take steps to appoint a Teacher.

Communications from the former teacher, Mr. John Burr, stated that it was very desirable that the teacher should be a married man, prepared to keep house, as there is not suitable boarding accommodation on that Reserve. The applications received in May were from women. I had advertisements put into the papers again recently, but so far no applications have been received. As I am not familiar with the conditions at Scotch Settlement I am taking the liberty of writing to the Indian Agent, Mr. John Scoffield, to secure his advice as to whether a married teacher is necessary or whether a lady teacher could be suitably accommodated. I am also requesting him to let me have the names of the teachers from whom he has had applications.\n\nAs I have been appointed General Secretary of the Missionary Society in succession to Dr. Sutherland, it is my intention to get into personal touch with all our Indian Missions and schools as soon as circumstances will permit. Any assistance which the Department can give me at this time in the securing of a suitable teacher for Scotch Settlement school will be appreciated.\n\nI have just received a letter which was forwarded to the Secretary of Home Missions and handed to me by him, in which an application is made for appointment to the Scotch Settlement school by Mrs. M. McDonald, Southampton, who holds a third-class District certificate, and has taught school on the Manitoulin Island for over ten years, and for a short time was teacher in one of the mission schools on that island. She asks for a salary of $450. I understand, however, that the Department requires that teachers shall hold a second-class certificate.

I fear that Mr. Duffy cannot fully appreciate the character of the school which is under consideration, and that he might be disappointed if he went there. His educational standing and experience seem to warrant him taking up superior work to that of an Indian Primary School.

As it is necessary that this position should be filled without any further delay the Department has decided to avail itself of Mrs. Robb's services. You will be good enough to inform her that she may take charge of this school till the 30th of June, next, her further retention in the position will be dependent upon the inspector's reports received. Should they be satisfactory her services will be retained, she will be paid at the rate of $500.00 per annum and she should open the school on January 3rd, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. E. Egerton Thore,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nChippawa Hill Feb 27-11\n\nSec. Indian Affairs Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI feel it is becoming to close & according to request I submit my report. We are progressing a little. We have rather better attendance obtained however by an almost constant fight. That is the only word that will express the state of affairs exactly. My Tenant Officer dislikes going the rounds so often & I cannot see the use of allowing a child to remain out a week or two before sending after it. So we differ. I believe he intends to have the situation discussed at the approaching Council. Whatever that may mean I know not. I am determined to do my duty faithfully while I remain here. Council or no Council I expect the pupils to stand by me just as faithfully. We have no late pupils now. I think dingy in the morning has encouraged them to make an effort to be on time. Yesterday or rather on Saturday I ordered from Mr. Cameron a little over $5 supplies for domestic material. You will receive bill shortly. I hope to make that an incentive to diligence & more regular attendance & have informed pupils that any made up material will be given to a pupil requiring the services of Tenant Officer to enforce attendance. I took the liberty of procuring some goods.\nto be made into pocket-handkerchiefs so that in an article they all require a more porous. I shall be obliged to give each pupil one so that there can be no excuse for uncleanness. Inspector McCool visited us last week. You will hear from him. We need say nothing on that subject. We badly need modern seats. I have not room for all as they are at present. How I wish we had a building like the one at Saugus. There is room there to accommodate every pupil in the reserve, basement etc., all up to date. I believe a consolidated school would be a good thing. Then Manual Training, Domestic Science & English education could be successfully carried on & boys & girls would be benefitted alike. I have been teaching hygiene every day since I came but do not have any time set apart for that specially. It would only be wasted time here as they do not understand the language well enough to benefit by it. I insist on clean hands, nails, faces, heads &c & talk to them about keeping feet dry &c &c but I have to illustrate to make them understand my meaning. Average this month is 18 so far I have 31 names on roll. So there are a good many to stir up still. Yours faithfully,\n\nMrs. B. Robb\nOttawa, March 3, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report of the 27th ultimo upon your work at the Scotch Settlement School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the same has been read with a good deal of interest. I may say that Inspector McCool's report, which is of a very commendatory character, has been received.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the accommodation are noted and action will be taken to provide new desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nChippawa, Mar 10/11\n\nI have the honor to state in reference to Official Letter stating the wishes of the Department regarding more strict enforcement of regulations relating to the education of Indian Children.\n\nThere is no doubt of the willingness of the Truant Officers to do their duty. I think this has been done in the past. They cannot compel regular attendance and should not be expected to be on the road three or four days every week. The duties of a Truant Officer is very disagreeable and it is not easy to get an Indian to take it; any one of the three officers on this reserve, is willing at any time to resign, if a more suitable person can be secured to take the place.\n\nThe Teacher has always been consulted in the appointment of the Truant Officer, and if any teacher wishes a change, and will name a more efficient Indian who will accept the position the change can be made.\n\nThe following is a report of three cases of neglect of coming children to attend.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs Office.\nto attend school.\n\nFred Amegagabough was summoned on the 3rd March to answer to the charge of neglecting to send his children to school. He appeared before me on the afternoon of the same day. Acknowledged the offence was fixed $2.00 + costs. The cost being due Inward Office Rich Moon, travelling 2 miles to serve summons @ 10\u00a2/mile, serving summons 25\u00a2 to travelling from Scotch Settlement to Agent's Office to attend hearing of the case 4 miles @ 10\u00a2 = 40\u00a2 Total fine and costs = $2.85\n\nFred Wahbegee summoned for similar offence on the 4th. He appeared before me on the 6th, he also pled guilty and was fined $2.00 + costs. The cost due Inward Officer Rich Moon for serving summons 25\u00a2 total fine and costs $2.25\n\nJohn Beito summoned on the 4th Mar., for similar offence. He appeared before me on the afternoon of the 6th, pled guilty of the charge and was fined $2.00 + costs due Inward Officer Richard Moon in this case travelling 5 miles to serve summons 50\u00a2 serving.\nServing summons 25 cts\nTravelling from Scotch Settlement\nto Agent's Office to attend hearing\nof the case 4 miles @ 10 = 40 cts\nTotal fine & costs $3.15\n\nIn none of the above three cases\ncould the defendants pay the fine\nand costs, but were willing to\nrequest the Dept. to authorize\nthe Agent to retain from their\nInterest-money due March 31st 1911\nI would recommend that this be\ndone.\n\nThe total amount of fines &\ncosts are\u2014\n\nBand No. 136 Fred Amegagabough $2.85\n\" \" 135 Fred Wahbeze 2.25\n\" \" 19 John Besito 3.15\n$8.25\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Scoffield\nAgent.\nOttawa, March 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant reporting that you found three Indians who neglected to send their children to the Scotch Settlement School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in this matter is approved and you may withhold the amounts mentioned when making the next interest distribution and refund them to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIt is scarcely time for another report but I am daily having my eyes opened wider & wider & must relieve the pressure by pacing on the campus. Monday March 6 only my school called to order\u2014showing having no less than 31 pupils in it. My average for that week was 27+ and I had 28 yesterday & 27 today. I am extremely annoyed by the irregularity of one family & something must be done to correct it as the truant officer seems powerless\u2014all my threats have no effect on them & certainly tend to lessen any influence over the others. The father's name is Fred Walgeezee. He has 3 children\u20142 boys & 1 girl aged respectively 14, 12 & 8 all in the first form. The boys are only a shade better than wild animals & spend most of their time racing over the reserve behind two great dogs which they have trained to draw them about. I think a hint that it may be necessary to remove them to some institution where they would be under proper control might be beneficial.\n\nTo return to that Monday I had some new comers, one 12 years old\u2014a great strong girl who had scarcely ever been inside the school & I know there are others in the same predicament for on my walks I see children who have not been inside the school since I came here. There is surely something wrong when careless parents are allowed to neglect their children so shamefully in this Christian country.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI have had 4 new seats or rather old seats renewed put in & am still obliged to put 3 in one seat. Am very much pleased to hear that we shall have new seats & please let it be soon. I would advise about 10 simple desks of medium size. I believe that arrangement would be better than grated sizes for this small building.\n\nThe girls have taken to sewing little darts to water & are very earnest in their efforts to master the science. I require a table for the school on which they may be taught cutting &c. Kindly order it to be provided at once.\n\nI believe that singing & sewing are going to be an incentive to better work in ordinary branches for the threat that those who miss regular lessons must miss either or both of these usually results in perfect spelling &c &c. As such I could think of something to catch the boys.\n\nWe are impatiently awaiting the arrival of our last orders. It must be thousands & thousands of miles from Ottawa to Chippawa Hill. Unless something unforeseen occurs this spirit will suffice for March. Thank you for your kind encouragement.\n\nYours respectfully,\nMrs B Robb.\nOttawa, March 27, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the attendance at the Scotch Settlement school is rapidly improving.\n\nWith regard to the family of Fred Wabesee I have to ask you to be good enough to bring this matter to the attention of the Agent. In this connection the Department would like to impress upon you the necessity for exercising great discretion in dealing with these Indian parents and children. No doubt in time you will be able to overcome the apathy of these parents and wherever possible persuasion is much preferable to compulsion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, April 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo in reference to compulsory attendance at the Saugesen school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your remarks in regard to the attitude of No. 19, John Besito, have been noted. In this connection I would say that it is not the intention of the Department to allow this man to neglect the education of his six children. I would ask you to report fully upon the number of children, the kind of home that he has and the care that he accords them and, should he persist in refusing to send them to school regularly, the Department may take into consideration the question of committing them to an industrial school; of course this will not be done unless conditions fully warrant such action, but, as stated above, the Department must insist upon the children receiving the advantages of an education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nI have the honor to acknowledge official letter re John Beito's children.\n\nIn reply I would say that Beito sent his children to school the next day, and they have been attending fairly regularly since. He has 5 children, 3 are of school age & Boys & 1 girl. He has a small frame house and gives his children about the usual care that Indian children get.\n\nThe Indian parents are all kind in some ways to their children, but neglect them in many ways.\n\nI will inform Beito of the instruction of the Dept. & will report him or any other person who persists in neglecting to send their children to school.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Scofield\n\nAgent.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 27, 1911.\n\nSIR,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in reference to the attendance at school of the children of John Basito.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that the action taken will have the desired effect; if not you will kindly report at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scofield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nAnother month has rolled round & another report is due from Scotter Settlement Indian School of this time I can say that I am satisfied as far as average attendance goes. It stands 28 for the month with 35 on the roll. That result is fair considering the season. I am greatly encouraged by the attitude of the parents toward me. Those who were most opposed to my \"sharpness\" being now my most earnest helpers. Our school officer so practically out of business & at late \"pupil unheard of. Indeed they annoy me by being on hand before I go over to ring the 5 o'clock bell. I am sadly in need of those promised seats. Since I came 5 desks & seats have been resurrected & temporarily fitted there to accommodate 10 pupils & still I am short of space & have to shift here & there when a pupil chances to be off for a day. The desks referred to were taken from the cellar of the house occupy & the seat being tacked on do not hold up & are consequently very uncomfortable & inconvenient. Everything I applied for has been received excepting the arithmetics & these we are much in need of as black board space is so limited. Thanks for liberality & I do not succeed now! The Department cannot be blamed. The children are delighted with the drawing books & paint but I can scarcely say that I am with their artistic effusions so far. Drawing is also a drawing card. The girls like it.\nI sincerely believe they would rather quiet their breath than the singing in the morning & I would be grateful for a supply of suitable old fashioned school songs & hymns. The Melodies & Sacred Selections Nos. 1-2-3-4 are good. We have no musical instrument here, that is why I would like the old family music. A couple of chairs & table for cutting etc., also a bench for a class seat which would be gratefully received. We are progressing in Reading, Spelling, Writing & Arithmetic & an interest is being aroused in Geography but Grammar & Composition are hopelessly failures. Not knowing the language accounts so that I suppose & I am endeavouring to get the pupil to speak English to each other during school hours but that too is an almost hopeless effort, that is the bright side. And for the other, in your last reply you asked me to refer the Wabesee case to the Agent. I referred to the agent before I complained to you & got no satisfaction for doing so. I shall not quarrel with him & the only way to prevent doing so is to allow the Department to refer to him themselves. If the Agent had done his duty all along I should have had no reason to refer to him or any body else when I tell you that 27 of my pupils are in harm & some of them 15 years of age you have proof enough that what I have said is true. I have 2 pupils aged 10 & 12 respectively who have not been 2 months in school in their lives & both are healthy girls. Mr. Wabesee came to me the other day & complained that his boy was being ill treated away from school by a boy.\nwhom I had not heard until that moment (although I got my list in the agent's office) & who is I should say 12 or 13 years old. I saw him for the first time this evening. He is an adopted son of Joseph John. Wallace has moved over to Saugus but has left his little girl here to attend school. One boy is also in the neighborhood but does not come to school. The other is roaming as usual having been just one day in school this month. This Jerry John came on to the playground where our boys were having a game of ball after school & a small crowd went with him to the church shed. Pandemonium reigned until I strolled down to investigate. It was then I saw the boy for the first time. He is a bright looking little fellow with a withered (left) arm. Later in the evening the district officer called at the house & asked me to write upon concerning these 3 boys. Now I have done so & expect my hands of the whole business but I sincerely hope you will not allow these 3 to undo all that has been done here for certainly unless these are straightened the others will not stay straight. If you will send me a new register I shall send Mr. Burns' latest records to you & unless I am incapable of counting correctly you will find his returns & names & fabrications from beginning to end. My discipline were doomed by the Indians claiming about the attendance being so much greater. I took a look over his entries found just what I have said. Remember correspondence is strictly private but I am prepared to back up every statement made.\nIf it should become necessary to do so, however I would prefer spending my little day here in peace with the men but I wish the Department to understand that the trouble is none of my making. I am in for the \"effect\" but the \"cause\" dates away behind me or rather before. While I remain I shall do my duty conscientiously & honestly without fear or favour. I am looked on with disfavour simply because I have refused to allow this gross injustice to continue. I have too much sympathy for the poor children who are suffering now because it has gone on so long. The Indians are no fools. They understand the whole matter & know that they have been allowed to deprive their children of the only means of bettering their condition. They are a strange childish race, but you know them better than I. It was not my intention to write a book when I began but less might have served the purpose. Hoping I have not exhausted your patience I remain\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 4, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the department is pleased to learn that there is such an improvement in the attendance at the Scotch Settlement school.\n\nThe Agent will be written to in regard to the desks and the Department of Public Printing and Stationery will be asked concerning the arithmetics. Mr. Stafford will be authorized to purchase for you a couple of chairs, a table and a bench. A register will be sent you from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nAnother quarter is passing at close & another report due to the Department. Everything in & about the school is running smooth. Attendance continues to improve in spite of some drawbacks. The aggregate for May until to-night is 698, which gives an average for 20 days of exactly 34.5.\n\nI have really only 32 on my roll now for the Walbees & have moved over to Saugan & are attending there Mr. Schofield informed me today. Jerry John (the neglected) came regularly for 15 days, the 24th proved too much for him however & he is again wandering not having showed up since. I find with rather bright & docile on school but outside his record is not so savory. His language is bad & he is extremely rough at play. On the 2nd day of his attendance I was obliged to administer a dose that kept him in perfect order the remaining 13 of the 30 with him. I feel very sorry for the poor child little fellows will do all they will or for him provided he attends regularly, but I cannot allow him to come & go when it pleases him as the others would very soon be taking leaves out of his book.\n\nThis afternoon Mr. Joseph Cameron called to tell me that he is leaving the Reserve for the Summer that removes 2 more from pupils so my attendance will be lower for a while.\nOne little girl was removed last night on the 8th. Another left school very ill today. I fear she will not be long. More cases will be for consumption has her marked as a victim. I have a whose eyes should be attended to & several whose teeth are in dreadful condition. Their Dr. has not called since quite a while. We received Arithmetics, Music Books, Pogs etc. Thank you for promptness this time. I shall send old Regulator at end of quarter. Mr. Dehofffield spoke of seats today. Our room is certainly small but would the double deck with single deck really take less space? I have asked him to move the stove nearer the door & enclose it in fine screen, as it is at present, it is a menace to the health of all seated near it. Could you give me the exact space required by each deck? I much prefer the singles especially for these Indians. Take the case of the poor girl who was ill today. Her cough so bad & her breath worse yet another little girl is obliged to put up with both so we cannot afford to give her a seat to herself. If she is far from being the only one in that condition although she is the worst. However use your own judgment as you have had longer experience in that business than I. But I do know that very soon this building will not accommodate the families unless they die or more suddenly than might be expected. I can name over half a score who should be coming this time next year & not one here now will be ready for disposal by that time. There is a platform on which my clerk\nis standing which could be removed also a small 2 x 2 cupboard in the corner which could be placed higher up on the wall or done away with altogether & a larger one by some will doubtless be added. This might necessitate a little fresh paint but the Dominion of Canada is good for that I believe on experiencing due consideration before commencing the improvement so that there may be no \"repenting at leisure\" necessary after the work is completed. It would be much better without the platform I have stated & the desk itself could be boarded up & some drawers or shelves placed underneath or better still a more modern affair could be put in & the old one transformed into a cupboard for copy books &c. Becoming practical &c &c. Am expect to view situation would be the proper move. Poor Mr. Selkirk knows nothing about the matter but he has a few stubborn ideas which are immovable. He seems very much afraid of starvation for the Department after his death & is carefully saving to & every chance he gets. What in itself is all right, I do not believe in waste any more than he does but when I am talked at as if I ate too much disposed of them in some other nutritious way. I begin to feel restless & want to have a little room in my way but I may be obliged to squall the agent instead of brooms in order to get it. I wont quarrel with times don't fear that you remember the old definition of a line that is only there is precious little length either. I express my sincere only to the Dep't however who likely know him better than I.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSchool re-opened on Tuesday morning with an attendance of 25 pupils. They seemed pleased to see me again and said they were glad to be back at their studies. Jerry John is missing. John Reiter's whole family also. The last are Clay pulling at Longham & Morristown respectively & Jerry is hiding in the bush.\n\nOn Wednesday evening a young married woman (sister of said Jerry) called & asked me to teach her to read. I consented to try & since then she comes every evening to my house carrying her primer & copy book. She is 20 years of age.\n\nPovesh, I think, that the Indians are becoming interested in education. At our picnic on the last school day before vacation the children sang & were repeatedly encored. We also had a small exhibition of their drawing, every pupil putting his or her best effort. These sold for about 10\u00a2 each & totalled $1.50. Two or three of my bunch will make artists of no mean calibre. I shall send by this mail a copy written by Jerry John since May 1st. Let me know what you think of it. Please, I think their drawing would compare very favourably with anything exhibited at Toronto. I am sorry we had not begun earlier & entered in competition. I am pleased to notice that they have forgotten very little during vacation.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nThe new desks are here & are not yet nailed down. If I had my way they certainly never would be either. Had I known the \"double desk\" was our portion I would have retained the old ones. They have been sent in 3 different sizes, the smallest being decidedly too small for any pupil here at present. There are 6 desks of that small size. Then instead of removing the platform as I requested a new one has been put in. The stove has not been moved far enough forward. A new screen has been provided. I requested single desks of medium size, the removal of the platform & a pine casing round stove. About the stable nothing has been done. Your agent seems determined that nothing shall. I am alone here & would not under any consideration put either horse or buggy in that tumble down old rookery of a stable. A new stable is required. No matter who teaches here. However I have said my say on that subject you can now arrange matters to suit yourself. I do wish that some member of the Department would pay a visit to this settlement & take note of existing conditions. Compare for instance the agent's premises with that which at least one teacher is obliged to occupy. I am not obliged to go begging for a situation & shall not let my soul further grumbling over what evidently cannot be cured. I am fairly however for I have just lately begun a work which I would\nlike to test a little further. During vacation I visited schools in Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, Regina & Port Arthur & picked up some ideas which I think would work out well here. I had intended acting you to provide me with material for book making & binding. This I believe would be interesting to my Indian boys & would enable me to keep them busy while the girls are sewing post card albums, music holders etc. Could be easily made & would sell well also. My plans are all \"tried & tested\" but the Dominion Treasury will be just so much \"in\". Our new blinds are satisfactory & we have fresh gravel round the building. How nice to have two things to be pleasant about. Thank you for sending my last quarter's check so promptly. In my haste to get off I neglected even informing you of its receipt. Pardon the neglect. Shall not repeat again this month as the quarterly report will give you all necessary information.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs B Robb.\nOttawa, September 21, 1931.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant and also the two copy books written by pupils of the Scotch Settlement School. The work in these books is certainly most creditable.\n\nWith regard to the desks the Department did not consider it advisable to place single desks on account of the lack of accommodation and the sizes ordered were those approved by the Ontario Department of Education for children ranging from seven to fifteen years of age. The smaller seats are intended to accommodate those between seven and ten and should be satisfactory.\n\nThe Agent will be asked to have the stove jacketed. He has also been again communicated with in regard to the stable.\n\nI would ask you to let the Department have a detailed list of the material for book making and binding to which you refer with an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher,\nScotch Settlement Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, November 3, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Public School Inspector in his last report on the Scotch Settlement School speaks very highly of the work being done there. The Department appreciates very much your efforts at this school and is pleased to see that you are meeting with success.\n\nThe Inspector suggests that a library be provided for this school. I have to ask you to be good enough to state what books you think would be suitable and also whether you have any place to keep them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher,\nScotch Settlement Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAnother month has rolled by & I had almost forgotten my promise to write; perhaps because I had nothing particular to grumble about. The stable is under way but I fear it will not be finished this year. Seats are at last installed & although not satisfactory must be endured, I suppose.\n\nThe work I thought of taking up with the boys cannot be carried on in double seats so I shall have that much less to think of. I wish to be allowed to purchase some more material for girls' sewing. We have a number of small chaps just beginning & these will only be able to them for some time. Handkerchiefs are always in demand. That is the easiest also for beginners. I also require some more flannelette. I would like to have material also for a few dainty aprons &c &c &c\n\nI would like to prepare some work for exhibition next fall. Kindly permit me to choose this. The girls are all eager to \"try\" for a prize.\n\nWe are making fair progress in all our studies. Grammar expected. That helps me, I can do nothing with them beyond saying, \"Don't say this or that.\" They do not know enough English to distinguish one kind of word from another.\n\nThe store has been facilitated on a kind of basis. It is certainly a smoothly botched piece of work. The pump & one house are still untouched.\n\nThis last quarter has been a record breaker for attendance. Our average was almost 30 (Thirty-three) thirty-four are most uncommon. I am obliged again to\ncall to your recollection the case of Jerry John. Your Agent tells me that he has represented him to you as being physically unfit to make his living even with an education. That is not the question as he is he is little better than a wild beast. I have had him in school for a few days & have found him brighter than the ordinary Indian child. He cannot read, he writes what he knows in excellent style. In arithmetic he is quick & fairly accurate, & why should he be allowed to do as he pleases? He is a thief & house-breaker by reputation already & will not likely be anything else unless taught something different. His adopted parents do not attend Church. He is just sent to Sunday School even & besides all that. Other Indians think if Jerry is allowed to do as he pleases their children should be also. I believe that a fine or two would make the matter all right. My Tenant Officer will not go after him. He is afraid of his father. The Department are morally responsible for the future of that boy. Please ask you to look after him.\n\nTwo of our brightest pupils have very defective eyesight & a number of them suffer very much from tooth-ache so it only duty to request the Dr. to call at the school & attend to these. I have spoken of them many times to the Agent, but have never had an opportunity of interviewing the Dr. Kindly advise me what course to pursue. The books I asked for are ordinary library books but I cannot give you the prices as I have no catalogue here. Yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robb,\nTeacher,\nScotch Settlement Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, November 11, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Scotch Settlement School has brought to the attention of the Department the case of Jerry John, a young lad twelve or thirteen years of age, who has been attending the day school somewhat irregularly. Mrs. Robb states that in her opinion this boy should be placed in some institution. No doubt you are quite familiar with the circumstances and if you concur I would ask you to take up with the Reverend Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute the question of having him enrolled at that school as a pupil. Kindly report to the Department what action you take.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scofield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAnother month is nearing its close. Have delayed answering your inquiries re. Public School Library in order to carefully consider the proposition. The use of a few good books containing simple well-told stories would be a boon to the children. I asked some time ago to have \"Canada Birds\" & \"The American Wild Animals\" also \"Our Domestic Animals\" all illustrated, sent to me. You wrote asking price etc. That I could not give then nor can I do so now. I sent for some catalogues but these do not appear to be catalogue Books, these & pictorial books would greatly aid my pupils in understanding my meaning. They are fond of pictures & grasp ideas very quickly when presented in that form, but I find they may read a whole page & not get a single idea, that means they do not understand the language. I would advise getting in a few books carefully chosen, not too many at first, or with the understanding that they are to be used only in school.\n\nI would not care to handle books that had been in some of the homes for even so short a time, besides few of the parents read. We have no place to put books & need a case badly. You would require to let me order that to fit our space. Our room is limited. We must very soon have an addition to the present building. If we ever had a basement, it would not be so bad. I have 35 pupils almost every day now & we have only about 17 x 24 floor space. I have had three illustrated works on other subjects & think they are $1.00 or $1.50. I forgot to mention Canadian wild flowers in same line of binding etc. We have the art series, and are certainly making use of them. As instructed I asked Dr. Williams to call. He did so & examined pupils & will forward report to you. The medicine he has sent to\nme if I purpose giving it myself so as to be sure they get it. That will be all right, will it not? I judged from his remarks that his treatment will not kill the till. He found only 1 set of sound teeth in the mouth. Most of them are in a dreadful condition. One child is suffering from adenoids. Poor little creatures. Their inheritance is surely a sad one. If we could keep them away from these \"Disease & Diet\" infected homes, these people love their children, but they are murdering them just as surely as if they gave them a few grams of strychnine. The immorality is appalling. Here they appear to have good land & yet few raise even the potatoes they require. Two or three in each section work. These have well fed, well clothed children & they pay their debts but the majority live from hand to mouth. Never a stick to be seen round their doors & their poor cattle roaming the fields day & night. Winter Summer little food & less shelter. Their children barely better off than few of their houses are ruined. I firmly believe the principal reason for their regular attendance at school is because they are comfortable while there. I have inspected all their shoes at least being kept in good condition and tried to advise them when in need of new clothing to purchase flannel & I must say they are in rather better shape this winter. But I may as well not grumble. I worry of worse & this shake myself & wonder if it's worth while. I know I'm green at this business still & cannot drown the thought that there is a \"more excellent way\". I have no reason to grumble about attendance. My average for this month is almost 81 notwithstanding bad weather.\nI am now preparing for a Xmas entertainment that is taking a great deal of time & interfering sadly with our programme. Still I believe in the end we will be gainers, i.e., if they keep all the promises they have made.\n\nApplication for me after Xmas vacation.\n\nThank you for the expression of appreciation received some time ago & can assure you that the said appreciation takes the form of an extra $100. For next year I shall not refuse it & I certainly think I am earning it. Would you kindly send my Xmas check to 283 Wellington St. Stratford so that I may be able to place it in safe keeping while at home? Please send it as soon as possible.\n\nYou have obliged me in that way before & I thank you for that deed. I shall be obliged to procure a horse if I stay another year. I am thoroughly tired of the driver's life & I have endured for too long, the stable is finished & will still be comfortable but it is as far from the house as it could be put which will make it hard for me in winter. I asked your agent to put it as close as insurance regulations would permit but he didn't do so. I have also asked to have the closet belonging to the teachers residence put into more modern shape & Mr. Ritchie would gladly have done the work while here at the stable but was not allowed. Will you kindly have this attended to at once, before the lumber which was left over is all carted away? I have forwarded the yearly report as you requested & hope it is satisfactorily filled.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nOct. 13, 1936\nChippawa Hill\nJan 1st 1912.\n\nMrs Robb\nTeacher Scotch Settlement\n\nDear Mrs Robb,\n\nI received your quarterly school report between 5 & 6 o'clock Saturday the 30th. In examining it, I find it is not correct, as there are 65 school days in the quarter, and there are 6 holidays in the quarter.\n\nThe other days the school was not open has to be accounted for in the columns for remarks.\n\nI have no blank forms now on hand but expect them soon as they have been sent for & will send them to you as soon as they arrive.\n\nYours Truly,\nJohn Sheffield\n\nPlease sign the signature.\nChippewa Hill Jan 8\n\nThe Rev. Dept. Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time before Xmas vacation I asked you to send my check for quarter's salary to Stratford. I did not receive it nor have I yet done so.\n\nOn Dec. 22 P.M. I filled out the enclosed reports & as I left by train at 6 A.M. on 26th gave them to Miss Skurrell to deliver to the agent. She received them on the following day.\n\nThe lady to whom they were given having evidently forgotten them. On Saturday 6th they were returned to me with the note enclosed.\n\nI have tried to find out the error but have failed. I taught every day during the term excepting the two days associated with Thanksgiving Day. I cannot make 65 days in my school. In Oct. there were 22 days & I taught 19. The three holidays occurring in that month, Nov. 22 days & I taught every day in Dec. 16 & I also taught on all of these 22 + 22 + 16 = 60 according to my addition.\n\nAnd of these my school was open 57. My pupils were there every day also. I am sending the whole fabric directly to you first as it stands. Advise me if I am wrong. I have filled out a good many school reports & have never had one returned until now. The failure to receive my hard earned check has caused me a great inconvenience besides the loss of interest as I had promised it to a party who was willing to pay a high rate for a small loan.\n\nHere I am 44 miles from P.O. even & 6 from any Bank. With snow a couple feet deep it is impossible to reach work.\nThe P.O. cannot entrust money letters to Indians while neighbors are still away. Put yourself in my position and then say whether it is fair to be treated with such evident suspicion. I am a conservative and have endured unfair treatment from your agent ever since the end of my first month here. I have made good there and am still doing so and do not intend to put up with it any longer. He knows that I have proved conclusively that he fears he has not done his duty. I had no trouble with the Indians. They were so kind to me. The pupils like their school. Our Board Officer has not had an order from me in months. My every duty is performed to the very best of my ability. I have more pupils than before, to work with than either of the other schools, indeed I believe almost as much as both together. Yet I do no more for it and have been treated most unceremoniously at every turn. The sole reason being because I choose to assert myself. I refused to slip into the rut into which my predecessor had been jogging along. This is a new beginning for a new term but the fault is not mine. I have made any mistake I am willing to make it right but this everlasting insolence and bullying I will endure nothing. My register is kept for inspection of the whole school also. Strictly point out my errors of error there is yours respectfully,\n\nMrs. M. Robb,\nTeacher, Sackett Settlement.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This has reference to the number of teaching days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher,\nScotch Settlement Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, January 13, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the return of attendance at the Scotch Settlement School for the December quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there would appear to have been undue delay in transmitting this return. Mrs. Robb has forwarded the Department a communication from you to her dated January 1st in which you state that there were 65 school days in the quarter. You must be aware that this is not the case, as, even if no holidays were allowed at Christmas, there would still be less than 65 teaching days and from your experience as Indian Agent you are perfectly aware that the usual Christmas holidays are allowed. Mrs. Robb taught 59 days, counting the two on which she attended the Teacher's Convention as teaching days, and in this respect the return was correct and would have been approved by the Department had you forwarded it direct, as you should have done, with any remarks that you wished to make.\n\nIt is also noted that in your letter to her you states that you have no blank forms. This is a matter that you should have attended to and a requisition should have been made early in the quarter, so that there would have been no delay in forwarding the return. The Department desires to see its employees paid as promptly as possible and especially\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa, Hill, Ont.\nespecially at that season of the year it was a great inconvenience to Mrs. Robb to be without payment.\n\nMrs. Robb is evidently an enthusiastic teacher and doing good work in the school and the Department will expect you to give her such assistance as you can to have matters run smoothly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of official letter re delay of Teacher's return of attendance at the Scotch Settlement School for Dec 1911.\n\nIn justification of my action in the matter I would inform the Dept. that I am informed that Mrs. Robb left her school report in the care of Mr. A.B. Skerritt on the evening of the 22nd Dec., as she was going away for her holidays the next morning at 6 o'clock A.M. on the train. I did not know what she had done with it, nor did I receive her report till between 5 & 6 o'clock P.M. Saturday the 30th which was too late then for mailing that evening.\n\nI understand by article 5 of instructions to teachers on the 1st page of quarter school return, that the number of school days in the quarter are all days exclusive of Saturday & Sundays which was 65 in the quarter referred to. There were also 6 authorized holidays which left 59 days that the school was open.\n\nI express regret if I have misunderstood Article 5 and caused delay in Mrs. Robb receiving her salary but as the other two school returns were made.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nWe made out\u2014in the way I have referred to\u2014that is 65 school days + 6 holidays. I was convinced that I was correct.\n\nWhen I visited the schools last in December, I left the blank registers & reports with the teachers and as Mrs. Robb's school was the last I visited I found I had only one form left as I had left one too many at one of the other schools. But\u2014as she had an extra form on hand\u2014it was thought she could use it.\n\nI have always recognized Mrs. Robb's energy & ability as a teacher and good work in the school. I have given her all the assistance I could but I have reason to believe that it was not always acceptable. No person has a stronger desire than I, for matters to run smoothly on the Reserve and I think that the Dept may trust me to use my very best endeavor to accomplish that end.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Scottfield\n\nAgreed:\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Scottfield\n\nAgreed:\nScotch Settlement No. 31 - 12\n\nTo the Sec'y Dept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the end of the fourth as usual I submit my report. The weather as you know has been unfavourable to regular school attendance. Some changes have also taken place here and have practically only 34 names on my records. This term so far at every day this week but one 34 pupils have been present. My aggregate for the 21 teaching days. All appear to like their School certainly with a couple of exceptions all are making progress. Received the check sent on 27th. It is here just as I got it still. I cannot get even to Southampton until we have more modern roads or even then I do not know that I can do anything with it. I fear it will have to stay as it is until Easter which is considerable lost to me though no fault of mine. Received last night most of the articles mentioned in my last requisition. We are in great need of brooms but none were sent. Some time ago I asked permission to purchase some things required in our sewing department. You have not mentioned the matter. We are at a stand still through lack of supplies. I do not know whether I neglected to ask you folks up, with my preparations for our house exterminated almost all we had disappeared. I am using my last sheets to night. Kindly send 3 or 4 pieces as soon as possible. You mentioned once that the pictures of King & Queen & Sitting & Green had been sent. They have not reached here yet. About that library business I believe we could convert one of our 8 windows into a book case & still have more light than we require in this small room. A few well chosen books would help us out materially now.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Several of the older pupils would like to know more about the characters mentioned in their reading lessons. They are intensely interested in stories of Eskimos, Chinese, etc., I am sorry that you have been unable to send me \"Canadian Birds\" & Canadian Flowers with coloured pictures. You asked me for prices, I do not know for sure but think about $1.50 or $2.00 each. A book containing animal pictures & transcripts would be greatly appreciated. We use everything we get & use them every day. The medicine left by Dr. Williams is all done & I would like him to call again & note results. He says he is not a dentist so what to do about their teeth I do not know but I certainly put the little mortals in a dreadful condition.\n\nAbout Jerry's son, he is still here & I am informed has been refused admission at Duncan. I cannot understand that. He passed the Dr.'s examination & certainly belongs to this band. His father & mother both being residents of this reserve. The present Chief is his great-grandfather & noticed in Mr. Schiefeldt's paper name is called. Not known. Name of Mother & Father. Often this is certainly not true unless almost everybody in the neighborhood speaks falsely. This book must be removed from here & put where he cannot harm the children whom I am endeavouring to impress. Parents are continually complaining of the mischief. Thanking you for prompt attention to last order & for advice. I am Yours respectfully,\n\nMrs. B. Boltz,\nTeacher.\nMy usual month end report is as follows. Attendance good. Considering the weather, aggregate for month 588. Average 28. I have 34 on roll. 2 pupils have been ill almost all the month & 2 have had toothache so often that their attendance has been very irregular. I have a long distance to come & during the latter part of last week & the whole of this one have been unable to attend on account of the depth of snow. I had over 30 regularly until the storm but the day after that only 6 pupils were present. That is the lowest I have had here. We had Mr. McCool on the morning of Feb 20. We had 31 present I think that day & 32 the next. Since then our average has become lower. His report will be before now so that it is needless to say anything about our progress.\n\nWe had an enforced holiday on Monday recently. Our stove jacket about which I complained when it was put in took fire in the middle of the forenoon & I was obliged to dismiss & send for the agent. It has been fixed temporarily until warmer weather. We are completely out of brooms & soap. The large stores are also needed. Our sewing is at a stand still for want of thread, tape, elastic & some new material. I have so many small girls that hemming is about all they can be put at & new handkerchief material is wanted. You referred me to the agent. He has not been here this month & I am told he is very ill. It is much easier to refer to the agent.\nFrom your office that from mine I am 4 miles, either agent or post office at this winter have been completely shut in by almost daily storms, have been in Southampton only once this year. It was at your suggestion I started the sewing but if I cannot be trusted to get what is required it had better be discontinued. I certainly cannot work without material any more than I can sweep without brooms or keep the children clean without soap. I asked for 2 dozen brooms some time ago if a stock had been put in then the present scarcity would have been avoided. Mr. Scofield is not able to do his own work yet, perhaps he never will again. I have not seen him myself these reports are \"Indian\" & may be exaggerated but whether they are or not if I am to work I must have material provided to work with. About that library Mr. McCool thinks it would be better to put on a regular case & not close up the window, the reason I suggested the window was simply lack of space, but sent it along we'll manage it in some way. Jerry John has been supplying some of my pupils with clothes. Some little boys 6 or 7 years old. Something must be done with this boy? I don't know. Would you kindly give me name of minister at head of Band?\nOttawa, March 5, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report for the month of February, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to know that the satisfactory attendance at the Scotch Settlement School continues.\n\nIn view of the illness of the Agent, as reported by you, you may purchase yourself the supplies mentioned for the sewing classes, the three brooms, some soap and a dozen large slates.

Mar 29-12\n\nSee Dept Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs my quarterly report goes in this week I scarcely regret to send my usual month end epistle. I may just say that we are doing ahead. Every pupil is doing his or her best. Almost all are progressing rapidly. Some are badly handicapped by physical defects which personally I can do nothing to relieve. Have treated several cases of sore eyes successfully & kept pupils in school who otherwise would not have been able to be there. There are some cases of adenoids, these sufferers simply cannot learn. One in particular seems positively incapable. I have done my best with her but can report no progress. The agent reappeared this month.\n\nI go home for Easter vacation as usual. Would you oblige me by sending me a check to 283 Wellington St. Streetford by Monday 8th April if possible. My reports are in agent's hands. Steady attendance this month average 29+.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nMrs. R. Robb.\nAt the close of another month, I submit my usual report. My average for the 15-day school was open is 3/5. The ice carried both bridges away during Easter week, and I had to cross the river in a small row boat. On Saturday so much ice, etc., was going down the river that I deemed it wiser not to attempt to cross and was 1 day behind time in re-opening school. My largest attendance for 15 days during month was 33 & smallest 28. Have no difficulty in securing regular attendance.\n\nAm again obliged to complain of the Jerry John nuisance. As soon as the weather became mild he began his watch for my pupils after four. His language, actions, influence are simply vile. Parents complain to me. I have acted again and again that something be done. He will do something desperate before long for certainly he is every day getting worse. Kindly attend to this matter. I have enough to contend against without that continual worry.\nWe have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of that promised library & also our royal pictures. Since our maps came I have had encouraging success with my geography class. I am again making an effort to get up an interest in grammar but am fearful of results. When library is sent, a half dozen each of new Geography & History Readers might be helpful. Indians are extremely fond of change & enjoy everything that is new. I expect 4 new pupils at the beginning of a new month.\n\nYours Respectfully,\nMrs B Robb,\nTeacher,\nScott Settlement.\nOttawa, May 21, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo reporting upon your work at the Scotch Settlement School for the month of April.\n\nWith reference to Jerry John I beg to say that it would appear necessary to take steps to remove this boy from the reserve and the only apparent course is to have him committed under the Ontario Statutes. I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether, should the Department initiate action, you are prepared to go before a judge and give evidence, as it will be necessary to prove that the boy is an undesirable character before a commitment can be made.\n\nPictures of the King and Queen are being sent you under separate cover.\n\nThe Department does not appear to have any record of having promised a library for this school. The Geography and History Readers will be ordered upon the receipt of the usual requisition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. B.

Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of May 21st, I beg to state in reference to the case of Jerry John that I certainly am not prepared to go before a judge & give evidence. As you know, I only had charge of this boy for a few days. He was then taken to Cake Croker by his foster-parents. After his return I tried repeatedly to have him compelled to come to school. I had no trouble in managing him & he certainly was quite bright & could learn apparently with ease. His deformity did not prevent him from writing or doing any work at his seat, about his capability in arithmetic I cannot now remember. However, that does not matter now. Since that time I have complained time after time when annoyed by him. Only last week a little 7 year old was off a day & a half in his company. His excuse when he came back was \"Sick\". I sent the Locust Officer to inquire & discovered that his parents knew nothing of his absence. Other parents have complained to me about Jerry meeting their children after school &c. &c. His language...\nis dreadful as I am told, but remember I have not spoken to him since he left school. He invariably goes out of sight when he sees me. He has broken into several houses & has stolen repeatedly. I understand his foster father has no control over him. The boy was spoiled before I came here. I tried in every possible way to have him reformed. Had he been compelled to attend school regularly I would certainly by this time have acquired an influence over him. If Our Institute at Muncey has no room for him, they should be compelled to make room. Let the Agent & those who allowed this boy to become the nuisance he is, attend to this matter. I have done my duty strictly every moment since I took this situation & have been obliged to quarrel with the Agent in order to be able to do it. Jerry's perversity was not caused by any neglect & I am surprised at being requested to have anything to do with his reformation. I am sorry for the poor boy. He looks too good to be allowed to become a criminal. Still I cannot permit his influence to mar the good work I am doing here.\nThis is not \"losing my own horn\" at all. I have worked hard to bring my pupils to the point of appreciating their privileges & am only just beginning to enjoy the fruit of my labour. I had 36 pupils in school today. We have just passed through an epidemic of influenza which has lowered our average for this month but any school is liable to that kind of interruption. I have now 37 on the roll. There are still others old enough to come but I cannot take any more. We have seats for only 36. Our floor space is 17x24. We have air space of 5100 cubic feet. Only enough for 20 pupils. No ventilation system. Simply doors & windows. You will readily see that something must soon be done to provide accommodation. My pupils like to attend & certainly enjoy their studies. Our school is now well equipped in almost all lines & we are making good use of everything within reach. In a year or two we will be all white, not a vestige of Indians left.\n\nAbout the library. Long ago you asked me to say what accommodation we had for one. At that time I rather discouraged your sending it as so few could read. Now it is different. They begin to want to know the end & beginning of the stories told in their readers.\nSince becoming interested in Geography they also desire to know more about the inhabitants of other lands. I hope you will not disappoint us in this matter.\n\nThe picture of King & Queen has been received, thanks. I would like to get those of King Ed VII & Queen Alexandra also. We have Victoria. I understand that Mr. Burr had sent for the two I mentioned & that they were sent on to his new home & have not been returned.\n\nThis is all, I think, that it is necessary to mention this matter. I hope that you will take immediate steps to have something done with Jerry. He is surely an undesirable. Every day he is becoming more so & unless a halt is called will cause trouble.\n\nYours Respectfully,\nMrs. B. Roth.\nOttawa, June 17, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThere is at the present time a Saugesen Indian boy about thirteen years of age whom the Department wishes to place in an industrial school. The parents of this boy are Methodist, but the Mount Elgin Institute at the present time has its full quota of pupils. The boy has been somewhat wayward and will not attend the day school regularly or the Department would leave him upon the reserve. It would seem necessary, however, to see that he gets a proper education and if you are willing to receive him the Department will make arrangements to have him sent to the Shingwauk Home. I shall be glad to hear from you by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. B. P. Fuller,\nPrincipal,\nThe Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste.

He has been enticing the pupils away once more. He lies like a snake on the grass at noon & night makes signs for others to join him. Smaller boys are easily led off by him. One evening last week evidently imagining I was not at home he came with 3 others (older fellows) into the school yard & began playing ball. Just a short time ago the agent came with a complaint about the school closets. I had never paid any attention to them as the agent comes here every month & I supposed he attended to all that kind of thing. However on inquiry I found the mischief had been done by boys not attending school at all. I had the buildings thoroughly cleaned at once & again the walls have been written on. No one appears to know anything about it or who did the deed & as these boys were probably round long before I noticed them I have laid it at their door. Something must be done with that.\nidle, good for nothing boy. Another pair are giving similar trouble. They came here about a month ago for the first time. The girl has been here 3 days & the boy about 8 since their admission. Previously they were supposed to be attending Elainore school (while) they were not wanted there & only went a day now & again when they took a notion. The boy is 10 & knows nothing, the girl is 12 & can read very well, both have good English from association with white children. The boy carries tobacco or did & the girl is accused of telling bad stories to smaller girls. I have had the tenant Officer interview their parents twice however they were absent again today & cannot insist on others attending & allow these to go. I demand regular attendance & with one or two exceptions get it. My average last week was 36%, you will kindly give these 3 cases your attention & please do it promptly.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nMrs. B.

The Bishop this year coming for that purpose in June. The Prayer Clerk (I think he called him) here had not been doing his duty & they were quite unprepared. At first I refused but after thinking the matter over knowing that Catholic children are allowed 5 holidays a year for Holy Days &c & seeing that mine have never taken any since I have been here & as the priest has been of great assistance to me in securing regular attendance of Catholic pupils & gives every year 5 $ for prizes (there go to all creeds) out of his own pocket. I told him as far as I was concerned he might take them & promised to write informing you of the reason of their absence. I had no power to refuse anyway for although the days were not holy days it is better that they should be kept regularly on those holy days & I will I think interfere less with their progress in school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He tells me the father of the Kehbejee children has decided to send his children back to Selinore School. Now I know that they have not attended Selinore regularly & do not suppose that they will do so now. He told our Tenant Officer that \"I was no good as a teacher.\" He found that out very quickly as his girl attended 4 days & the boy 16 in all. This is simply another Jerry John scheme to get out of being compelled to attend regularly. If this is allowed I shall cease to be so careful to compel or insist on regular attendance. I have battled for that until I am almost exhausted & now that I have secured it I shall not allow my toil to be rendered useless in any such fashion. I know the agent never has stood in with me, & if the Department now fails to do its duty in this matter I may as well give up the struggle.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMrs. B. Robb.\nOttawa, June 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has decided that it would be in the best interests of the Scotch Settlement School if Jerry John were sent to an industrial school and arrangements have been made to have him taken in at the Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie. You will be good enough, therefore, to have an application made out and signed by the parents. If they are not prepared to do this you will take steps to commit the boy under the regulations.

I would\nhave had about 36 average had all been\nhome. We are making rapid progress\nnow. Our regular attendance is\nto the Indian exactly what it is\namong white children. One little\nboy who came to school for the\nfirst time after my engagement\nis now reading nicely in the\nfirst book. He can add almost\nanything & subtract anything\nin mechanical work. Knows his\nmultiplication table to 7 times 7.\nMultiply correctly that far? I have never had a white child simple do any better. This little fellow, a great of course does not understand classes all he reads yet, but will very soon. I have also an exceedingly clever little girl. She is in the same class but knew her letters when I came. I have never set a task for three two that they did not accomplish. So my class pupil this week I have given the late entrance paper in writ she worked every question but only got 2 exactly correct. 2 were correct for 1st part & some were misunderstood but I consider that good work seeing that she knew only\nsimple rules a year ago. They all take a great interest in geography since I placed books in their hands, pictures of animals & persons from another land arouses their curiosity & the wish to learn about their country. I am in my requisition asking you to send me Mother Goose Rhymes & several books for the purpose of helping them to acquire English faster. I can now make them understand fairly well all I say but they remember only when they learn for themselves. Their interest in Colours never abates & when they are tired of study their drawing books always receive attention.\n\nI wish I had only good reports to send but now my annoyance by that very man takes my interest away & causes me endless trouble & anxiety. I have forbidden my pupils to even play with him but he is a big boy & will not allow me to know what that means. Last Friday he took off a small boy all day. This boy lives near him. An Indian told me on Sunday that the little boy's father is trying to get a house near the school where he can watch his boy. Every night this ferry lies in wait for the children in the Church Shed & when I go down he simply hides & lets the others...\nsuffer for his misdeeds. Sometimes must be done with this boy before my return or I shall rebel.\n\nLast night I walked to Elsmore to find out whether these Nakotse children have been attending school. They have not been one day or hour. When passing the store the girl who was coming there with a basket spied me & immediately disappeared over a fence. They know they are doing wrong & keep out of sight. These children must be compelled to come here. I shall not agree to their Elsmore quarters for that is all it is. The agent would rather take things easy than trouble but I have to suffer for his carelessness & thus refuse to do any longer.\n\nJerry has proved my side of the case beyond a doubt.\n\nWishing you a pleasant holiday.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs. B.

Dept. Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDetailed account of attendance for the year 1912. I wish you to examine the record carefully and judge whether my efforts to build up this school have been successful or otherwise. I have to complain of the Kambajee children, Victoria 12 Riley & they will very soon be as bad as Jerry John. They also are influencing the family of John Beato. Mary, Eliza, Willia & Seploctter aged respectively 15, 14, 9 & 7. These children have been a continued trouble to me ever since I took charge of this school. Their father should not be allowed to do as he has been doing any longer. His children are growing up more like wild animals than human beings. The list shows where they stand in class & they really should not be even there, but to encourage them I allowed them to go on with the others. I have endeavored to manage without complaining because Mrs. Scoffield has not been able to attend to business. However, I can not endure any longer. These six have not been in school for 3 weeks. The Beatos were ill for one week & the others were able to be here every day in the year. Unless they are looked after at once I fear as well as for others are becoming careless & I am powerless as long as these are allowed to go. Mr. Tenant Officer refused to go after them the last time I asked him & besides spoke to me in a manner not permitted. I complained to Mrs. Scoffield long ago but nothing had been done. This man has done nothing for me this quarter & unless he apologizes for his conduct shall not be allowed to enter the school again. It is time we had someone to look after these Indians. They begin to think\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThey are running the reservation, I am altogether alone here & certainly cannot allow any Truant Officer to speak to me as Mr. Stock did before the children. Besides he said a great deal in Indian that I did not understand. I have also another matter to lay before you. After waiting for 3 weeks for David Beale to secure the school, I asked Mr. James John to do it for me. He did the work on Saturday Nov 23rd when he applied to Mr. Schofield for his pay, he says that it was refused. They did the work at my request. I did not get it done even as soon as I should. With the floor space that we have here & the number of pupils attending, not taking the wet weather into consideration, the floor should be scrubbed once a month. It is positively dangerous to allow it to go as long as we have been obliged to do. The windows had to be cleaned as well & the whole work was well done. Mr. John must be paid. Very soon I shall not be able to get anyone to do the work for Mr. Beale always came grumbling to me about the trouble he had getting his pay. Why Mr. Schofield should refuse Mr. John I cannot understand. I have not seen Mr. Schofield myself. His health been in so precarious a state that I understood they kept business worries from him, however, he saw Mr. John himself & told him he would ignore the claim. Kindly look after this as soon as possible also. The statement shows our average for the month just ended.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss B. Robb.\nOttawa, December 9, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mrs. Robb, teacher of the Scotch Settlement School, in which she states that she asked Mr. James John to do some work in connection with the cleaning of the school and when this Indian applied to you for his pay it was refused.\n\nIf this man did the work and is entitled to the pay you should see that his account is forwarded to the Department and, if not, you should give to the Department the reasons for refusing it. Kindly give this matter immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Scoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAnother month has passed & I herein submit my usual monthly report. Although I have sent several & as reply has returned & I am in ignorance of how they are received. Still as I agreed to send them without came here I, at least, will keep myself of the contract. My attendance during Jan was good by all excepting the pupils complained of in every report made during the year & also in my annual. I have decided that I shall not allow my work to be interfered with any longer by those pupils. They are only a hindrance & drawback to regular attendants. They come a day now & again & time has to be spent distributing books etc. At the end of the day every class is away behind with the usual daily routine. I have about 30 on whom I can depend to be in their places every day unless ill or detained by parents for necessary duties at home.\n\nDuring Jan. the largest attendance for Monday was 18 & the lowest 24. Average for month 29.\n\nWith my cramped surroundings, large class etc. I am kept busy every moment of the day.\n\nMy school is becoming more like a White School than an Indian. The children are neatly & cleanly clothed; not merely outside but from the other out. They have good shoes, stockings, mittens etc. I insist on. I invite inspection any or every day by any important to judge.\nMy class will compare favourably with any white school in Bruce County or any other country school for that matter. My little children know more now than the grown-ups did when I came or do well for that matter for they are certainly a difficult proposition when allowed to remain in ignorance until 12 to 16 years of age. I will gladly do what I can for those (wild animals) deprived of the department to their part of see that they are compelled to attend with fair regularity. On the other hand unless they do I shall insist on their removal to some institution where they will at least be kept free from open vice.\n\nThe morals of this reserve certainly require a renovation to say the least. A little firmness would make everything right, at least openly & that is all that is done in even white settlements. Remember the Indians are not ignorant, they know their duty and know also when placed in authority over them do theirs. I know they do not like to be compelled to toe the mark, yet in the end it pleases them for they soon see result.\n\nThe Nakhkejee children & John Beattie's I again recommend to your attention. Fred Keeley's & Petahnequett's are influenced by these and are suffering in consequence. We have the whooping cough in our part of the reserve & so far bad weather in Feb so that our attendance this month may be diminished however all schools are liable to that kind of interruption. As far as the majority\nOf my class is concerned, I do not care whether I get another truant officer or not. They come in all weathers and sometimes not very fit condition. There are little boys whose heads are half off with those dreadful sores on their necks. I question the wisdom of allowing them to attend but the little brothers in the same family are quite free from anything of the kind. Therefore, I reason that the rest of us will not be affected.\n\nMy school is kept clean and well ventilated. I get bottles of medicine from Dr. D., and administer it regularly with good results to those requiring it. Dr. Scott is a success among the Indians. He attends them care fully and advises them faithfully. I have only seen him twice but I know from others the good work he is doing. The bottles he has sent to my school have been just the cure for those requiring treatment. I wish he could be induced to attend to the teeth cases of my class. I have some bad cases of adenoid and only one good mouthful of teeth in the whole class. 3 cases also of defective sight require attention which I have reported ever since my advent.\n\nI intend sending a photo of my class which I wish shown to every member of the Department from the Minister down. I think when they see what I have to mould into better citizens they will be convinced that it is worth while spending or being spent.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs. B. Robb.\n\nYou can return the photo when you have seen it. What do you think?\nScotch Settlement\n\nThis was not a dress parade\nsimply an ordinary, everyday\nattendance in the early fall.\nBefore the very small pupils\nat a distance were obliged to be\nabsent.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher,\nScotch Settlement Indian School.\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the close of another month I again submit my report. Attendance during this quarter has fallen off considerably. Shooting coughs what the children call \"Sick teeth\" being the principal cause. Their teeth are in dreadfully condition & when the weather is mild & wet as it has been the greater part of this winter they suffer from toothache & great deal. My aggregate was 508 of average 25. The lowest attendance during the month was 18 & the highest 30. I had 30 only for one day. I have a class here awaiting promotion into the 2nd Reader. Last month I sent for boots but they have not yet arrived. I had no regular supply sheet & have none now & so was obliged to use what I had. We are entirely out of Chalk & Soap. Kindly send as soon as possible. Young Mr. Scofield brought me Quarterly report blanks but had no requisitions. Besides what I sent for last month I now require 100 W. Copy Books. Have not one left.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nMrs. B. Robb\nTeacher\nAt the end of another month I submit my report. This has been the \"dinner\" month since my installation in Sept. Settlement School. There are 37 names on the roll. School was open 22 days being all the regular teaching days of the month. 18 pupils attended every day, 9 for 21 days & 4 for 20. The lowest attendance for any day during the month was 28 & the highest 35. The average for April is 33 1/2. Aggregate 736. Victoria Kukkuk has attended 4 days. Riley Kukkuk, not one. She has again changed her abode & has again caused the same disturbance going home from school. She is a vile creature, following closely in her mother's footsteps. She has been taken over to Saugan after being driven off from the mill & attended school there for a few days. Mr. Simon, their trusty officer, carted him back here last Friday evening because he had been stealing eggs & making himself a nuisance generally. I again ask that these two be taken charge of by the department. Certainly their mother is not a fit or proper person to care for them. She should be removed also to someplace where she would be obliged to work for her living instead of leading the horrible life she is leading & causing others to lead here. Of course that is I suppose, not in my line of business but nevertheless for the sake of the homes she is wrecking & the children she is despoiling I must do so. About the Trust Officer he has failed to comply with my demands & I refuse to acknowledge him as Officer.\nOr to allow him inside my school until he does. He metted & interfered with me before the school & I require his apology to be made in the presence of my pupils. I also require him to sign a statement acknowledging his misconduct to the Department. I wrote & informed the Department at the time he transgressed. The Department never acknowledged my letter but some time after I received a communication asking me to make peace with the Agent Officer as I had been too peremptory in telling him to perform his duties. Let me now explain. I sent boys to his house 3 times asking him to go after those children twice he sent notes back saying he was sick. I waited each time until I saw him out of the house as usual & sent again. This time I heard nothing from him. I went on Saturday to Mrs. Scofield (Mrs. Scofield was too ill to be told) & she told me if he refused to do the work we would get someone who would. I sent him the note then which he evidently sent you. I'm not I said exactly what I meant by mean what I said. It was after that he interfered with the pupils in school & talked to me as he did. Because Mrs. Scofield was laid aside he evidently thought he could do as he pleased. He was instructed by the Chief & Agent to apologize. He came to my house before 8 o'clock one morning & I refused to hear him there & told him to call when the pupils assembled & that I would have the paper ready for him to sign. He never came back.\nAfter my return at Xmas he, without any order, called at 2 places. At one of these it made no difference but the other (Fred Wesley) is a \"touchy fellow\" easily managed if he is honoured a little. I utterly arrange if rubbed the wrong way. His children were both ill (who could I had their fathers promise that they would be sent us soon as they were able to come. These children had not attended school previous to my becoming teacher here, one is 13 the other 9. I have encouraged ever since they came to school to keep on the right side of their father & have succeeded. They attend regularly & are usually first here in the morning although they live about 1/2 miles to come. Had I not heard of Mr. Moon's call on the very day he made it, I would have been minus one two pupils. I at once sent word to Mr. Wesley that Mr. Moon had no authority to go to his house & pay no attention to his call, to send his children when they recovered etc., they returned this month & have been here every day. My attendance is all that could be desired without the assistance of Mr. Moon. The dotted settlement children, as a rule, come to school because they like their school. The parents too careful not to keep them at home unless it is absolutely necessary. Those who are going to work have always done so. The Department must see to it that they are brought to time. My register & reports tell plainly who they are. The pupils who attend regularly are as anxious to learn as I am to have them do so & what is more they are learning very soon.

I found all the children present with the exception of two suffering from enlarged tonsils, adenoids, and sore eyes. This condition is bound to result in a great deal of sickness and without doubt numerous deaths among these children.\n\nI would strongly advise having a throat specialist visit these children and operate on them before the weather gets worse. A great improvement in their health by the children would result and many lives would be saved.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nLaird.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform the Dept. that I had Dr. C.J. Land visit Scotch Settlement school and make a report of the condition of the pupils he examined and I am forwarding his report for the Dept.'s consideration as there are some of the pupils certainly need medical attention and I have invited on some of the parents to take their children to a specialist but could not persuade them to do so as they claim they have no money to pay a specialist.\n\nI have the honor to be at your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nAttorney General\nOTTAWA, July 7th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing a report from Dr. Laird regarding the condition of health of the pupils he examined at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, and recommending that the children mentioned by him receive the proper medical attention.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is anxious that these children receive the necessary treatment, and that the operations be performed in the cases requiring it of those children who have enlarged tonsils and adenoids. It is difficult, however, to decide as to the least expensive manner to be taken in having these operations performed. Those parents who are able should bear the expense and the others at least part of the expense, and in cases where they are unable to do so, the Department will provide the funds.\n\nYou should consult Dr. Laird and ascertain his views as to whether, if the services of a nurse are engaged for a short period, he would not be able to perform the operations and give the necessary treatment in the cases requiring it. It would be prohibitive to engage the services of a specialist and send him to the Reserve to have this work done.\n\nYou will be good enough to take this matter up with Dr. Laird and after obtaining his views inform the Department as to whether he will undertake, if a nurse is engaged, to give these children the necessary attention, and if possible, you should state approximately the cost involved.\n\nIn the cases where the parents are unable to pay the whole, or part of the cost, it might be charged to their interest money or charged to the funds at the credit of the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nT. A. Stout, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform the Dept.\n\nThat Leonard Kahgee is 15 years old and almost a man and his father was anxious to have him to assist him as he is his only help. Wilbur John has run away from the Reserve and has been away for some time and we have heard that he is at Long Island and his father has gone for him and we will try and have him sent home when he returns as he has a dread of the teacher. It would be useless to try and have him attend Ochota Settlement School. Since John has not attended school for some time so no matter how often he was taken to school he would run away so we will have an application form filled out for his admittance to Duncan. The two youngest children have not attended. Michael is only about 7 years old but Nora is about 12 years and since her mother died about a year ago her father has had no control over her. I could not say whether she would be admitted to Duncan or not as she has one eye that is blind but do not think that it impairs her health.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nT.

One exceedingly bright and clever chap has adenoids and enlarged tonsils of the very worst type and although I had the Doctor come and examine the school and he sent his report to the Department, yet nothing has been done to relieve the trouble. This boy has stomach and kidneys affected badly from his head disability and I feel sure in a short time, unless prompt measures are taken, he will pass on to a higher school. Two girls each lost an eye from neglected cataract. One has now a glass eye. The other is very badly disfigured and does not come to school, although she cannot even read. My sympathy is all with these suffering children. There are at least 5 belonging to this division, besides the one mentioned, who have eye trouble as well as enlarged tonsils for Dr. Laird found only one sound throat in school. I do not know what the Department can do under the circumstances, but if you could only visit us you might at least suggest a solution of the problem.\n\nKindly write any time now and I promise to answer promptly and to the best of my imperfect knowledge.\nOTTAWA, January 31st, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 21st instant, regarding those pupils in the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School who require operations for adenoids and enlarged tonsils, and in other cases, who require treatment for eye trouble, and glasses, I beg to say that the Department in July, last, took this matter up with Mr. Agent Stout with a view to having these children receive the proper treatment. At the time, Dr. Laird stated that he was unable to undertake the work, as he was not equipped with the necessary instruments, and also because there was not a suitable place to have the work done. The doctor stated that the Indian homes had no conveniences to take care of children after an operation, and the further consideration of this matter then dropped.\n\nThe Department has since learned that a specialist visits Southampton at different times, and it might be, if the worst cases were taken there, that the specialist would be able to perform the necessary operations and give the treatment required.\n\nI would be pleased if you would give your personal attention to a consideration of the best means of arranging for the proper treatment being carried out in the cases of those children who are in the greatest need of a doctor's attention. If you would ascertain to date on which the specialist visits Southampton, and if he would perform any operations required, also the expenses that would be involved, and whether you could have the Indian parents take the children to Southampton, the Department would, when full information is received from you, be in a position to decide what should be done towards supplying medical attention in cases where required.\n\nThis matter may give you some trouble, but I am sure that, in the interests of the children, you will use your best endeavours to ascertain and inform me as to the best arrangement that can be made, and at the lowest expense to the Department.\n\nAs soon as your reply is received, we will then be in a position to further consider the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

You no doubt wondered why the delay in answering yours of Jan 31. Just a word explaining my surroundings here. I am living in the Centre Division of the Reserve, am between 5 & 6 miles from Station Town or Post Office. Have no Telephone or any means of communicating with outsiders unless by driving out. Being a Teacher Saturday is my only day available. Besides I live altogether alone. Have my school furnace, swamp etc to attend to. Have my own house, meals also keep a horse & a few pens that have to be cared for. I drive out every evening 1/2 mile for mail, milk etc so that in the short winter days it is hard for me to keep up. I also knew that it would not be possible to have anything done with these eyes, throat etc during the cold weather. We have had constant snow since before Xmas until this week. The sunshine is beginning to tell on the snow & once more the roads are almost bare. In the mean time I interviewed as many of the parents.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I said Mr. Root, he will soon be gone any way unless something is done for him. We left it at that. The boy is clever & very anxious to learn but he is out so much usually stomach trouble. This week he was out 3 days with a bad voice. Tubercular. Fear.\n\nThe girl with the quart eye, who entered my school in Oct 1916. Since that date she has attended at intervals 347 days. Sometimes a year between times attended. So you may judge how much she knows. She could read in first book Pt II, & write a little & when I tell you that that child who cannot be more than 13 is married you will understand that certainly a crime has been committed. The Agent informed me in Feb that she was married before Xmas.\n\nThe next eye case has been out of school since last fall. She had a stroke of some kind & could not walk but was otherwise fairly well. Just now she has been + is at present much worse, pains at back of neck &c. Fear she will not recover. I cannot say whether trouble was caused by eye strain or not.\n\nThe 3rd who is totally blind in one eye & has trouble with the other has been at Pickeral on North Shore since last fall but is expected home any day now. He is just requiring glasses. I think, is here + is backward on her school work. Suffering\nmuch from headache & has a weary, drawn look on her face which is sad to see. She is a nice little thing & I have been hard on her believing her simply lazy & only recently discovered that her sight was at fault. You have Dr Laird's report & know what the throat cases are like, or rather were when he examined them. One boy has been out of school for 4 or 5 weeks, attacked on ship all winter has had a cold. It was simply wicked to hear him blow his nose (not a nice thing to consider about but it has to be done). I have 2 or 3 others almost as bad in that respect. I now shall tell you I am interviewing with Dr Laird last Saturday. He said that two specialists come to Southampton but not at any stated times, just when they are sent for or wish to visit. One is his brother Dr Laird & Evelyn. The other is Dr Parker of Toronto & I think this one has a summer home at Southampton Beach & is a regular summer visitor. Dr Laird had spoken to Parker about three Indian children & asked about cost of operation. His charge is $50 for a single case. But if a bunch could be operated on at one time he would only charge $10 each. It is Dr Laird's opinion that much of the eye trouble, dulness, lack of memory, stomach sickness, eruptions of the skin leading finally to tuberculosis in some form.\n\f\nOne of those who had been my pupils during the 11 years I have taught & who are now gone.\n\nActual deaths of those attending \u2014 29\nIn one family I have attended \u2014 4\nAnother \u2014 2\n\nSo on...

R. 2.\nBruce Co.\nApril 26th, 1922.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nACTING DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the very serious health conditions among the children on the Saugesen Reserve. These conditions were first brought to our attention by Mrs. Robb, teacher of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, who is a very intelligent woman, and one of our best teachers.\n\nWe took this matter up with Mr. Agent Stout last summer with a view to arranging with Dr. C. J. Laird, the medical officer for the Reserve, to give the necessary treatment and to perform the operations necessary. Dr. Laird informed the Agent that he was unable to undertake the work as he was not equipped with the necessary instruments and that there was no suitable place to perform the operations required in the Indians' homes and no one to give proper care and attention and diet to the children after the needed operations were performed. The doctor stated that a specialist frequently visited Southampton, and that the worst cases might be taken there and attended to by the specialist.\n\nIn January, last, Mrs. Robb again drew our attention to the illness among the children, and she was asked to give her views as to the best means of arranging for the proper treatment to be given the children who were in the greatest need of medical attention. In her reply she gives a list of the various cases that require immediate attention, and suggests that they be sent to Southampton to be treated by the specialist who visits there occasionally. Mrs. Robb furnishes a statement of the deaths among the pupils in her school during the eleven years she has been teaching. She states that of the number who have been enrolled during that time twenty-nine have died.\n\nI had today a personal interview with Dr. Clark, of the Department of Health, in this matter, and he stated that their Department would be prepared to send one of their specialists, Dr. Heagerty, to the Reserve to make an examination of the Indians and to furnish a report and suggestions as to the best means of treating the cases requiring the same. Dr. Heagerty's services would be given free, the only charge being for his expenses. In carrying out the necessary operations and treatments recommended by Dr. Heagerty, the Department of Health would be prepared to assist in the expenses, and if the cases requiring treatment are the result of venereal disease, they would be responsible for the entire cost.\n\nAs it is necessary, in view of the reports we have received regarding health conditions on this Reserve, that some steps be taken to give treatment, I would recommend that the offer made by Dr. Clark, of the Department of Health, to loan the services of Dr. Heagerty to examine these Indians and furnish a report together with suggestions for treatment, be accepted, and that I be authorized to request the Department of Health to allow us to utilize the services of Dr. Heagerty.\n\nMrs. Robb's (the teacher) letter regarding the cases requiring treatment is hereunder.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Laird, Southampton, Ont., states that he is unable to undertake this work, as he is not equipped with the necessary instruments and that the Indian homes are not suitable places in which to perform operations, and that there is no one to give the proper care and attention and diet to the children after such operations are performed.\n\nIf, at the convenience of your Department, Dr. Heagerty could visit the Saugeen Reserve, we would be prepared to pay his personal expenses, it being understood that his services would be given without charge to this Department. He should examine those cases that require medical attention, and advise what methods should be adopted to give the treatment required at the lowest possible cost.\n\nThere are about 400 members, including men, women and children in the Saugeen Band. We are more especially interested in the health of the children than in the older members of the Band, who, in most cases, should be able to provide for their own medical treatment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nAs directed by this Department, I visited the Saugeen Indian Reserve. I arrived in Southampton Thursday night and met your agent, Mr. T.A. Stout, who conducted me to the reserve Friday morning. I went direct to the school which is in charge of Mrs. Robb, examined the pupils and found that the following require attention:\n\nBeatrice Wesley, requires an operation for removal of tonsils and adenoids, examination of eyes and dental attention.\n\nLeila Williams, requires an operation for removal of tonsils and adenoids.\n\nIsaac Roote, requires an operation for removal of tonsils and adenoids.\n\nMabel John, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\n\nAllan John, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\n\nEddy Kahgee, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\n\nGarfield Wesley, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\n\nCaroline Williams, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH\n\nOTTAWA,\n\n- 2 -\n\nStewart Kahgee, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\n\nWillis Kahbage, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\n\nRachel Kahbage, examination of throat and nose by specialist and treatment of discharging ears.\n\nSarah Besitou, removal of tonsils and eyes to be tested.\n\nVyora Wesley, dental attention.\n\nJoseph Cameron, dental attention.\n\nPercy Wesley, dental attention.\n\nEliss Williams, dental attention.\n\nAmbrose Besitou, dental attention.\n\nLouisa Elliott, dental attention.\n\nArthur John, dental attention.\n\nMichael K. Kewahghezig, dental attention.\n\nGerte Cameron, dental attention.\n\nHannah Thompson, dental attention.\n\nThe Wesley family and the Cameron family should, if possible, have a blood test performed (for the presence of syphilis.) This can be done free of charge at the venereal disease clinic at Owen Sound, which is in charge of Dr. H.G. Murray.\nI next visited the Indian Village School in charge of Miss Ruxton and found that the following children require attention:\n\nWilbur Richie, removal of tonsils.\n\nLucy Moses, removal of tonsils and dental attention.\n\nWillie Noon, removal of tonsils.\n\nSusan Mitchell, dental attention.\n\nLouis Moses, dental attention.\n\nEleanor Kahgee, dental attention.\n\nPercy Petonquot, dental attention.\n\nEva Joshua, dental attention.\n\nHarry Ritchie, dental attention.\n\nWillie Kewakuon, dental attention.\n\nArchie Kewakuon, dental attention.\n\nNancy Williams, dental attention.\n\nRosanna Nagun, dental attention.\n\nLizzie Stawbedies, dental attention.\n\nFlora Stawbedies, dental attention.\nAt the French Settlement School I found that the following children require attention:\n\nWilfred Ritchie, dental attention.\n\nLewellyn Ritchie, dental attention.\n\nJohn Thompson, dental attention.\n\nAllan Mitchell, dental attention.\n\nElsie Kewakuon, dental attention.\n\nEthel Mitchell, dental attention and examination of eyes by specialist.\n\nLena Ritchie, dental attention.\n\nIsaac Nashkoway, dental attention.\n\nHaving completed the schools on Friday afternoon, the agent, Mr. Stout, asked me to see a boy named Thompson who was absent from school and who had injured his foot. While examining this boy, I noticed that his little brother, who was nearby, looked rather pale and thin. I examined him and found that he was emaciated, was suffering from tubercular abscess in each axilla and, on examining his lungs, found that he was in the last stages of tuberculosis. He would probably live for another month or so. I examined Mrs. Thompson and found that she, also, was tubercular.\n\nThe agent then asked me to see Eva John, a former pupil of Mrs. Robb. This girl, although only 13 years of age, was married and deserted by her husband. She had had an eye removed some years ago. On examining\nher I found that she was suffering from tuberculosis in a very advanced stage. She, also, will probably live another month or so. I examined her sister, Mrs. Nashkuaws, who was nearby, and found that she, also, was in the early stages of tuberculosis.\n\nIn driving along the road we met Luke Kewakuon who complained of a cold. On examining his lungs, I found that he, also, was tubercular. We stopped in to see another old Indian who was sick and found that this old man was suffering from pneumonia. He had had a visit from Dr. Scott about three weeks previous and had absolutely no attention. This completed Friday's work.\n\nSaturday morning I was taken to see Hazel Williams. I found this child suffering from keratitis (inflammation of the eyes), probably syphilitic in nature. She had an old tuque pulled down over her head to shut out the light from her eyes. She was absolutely without medical care or attention of any kind, as her mother is dead and her father is alone. I examined her sister and found that she was suffering from opacities of the cornea of both eyes, which is evidence of old inflammation of the eyes. It is probable that this condition in both children is due to congenital syphilis.\n\nI next saw Irene Nashkewa and found that this child was almost totally blind and, in addition, was suffering from paralysis of the left arm; this probably, also, the result of congenital syphilis. The agent then took me to see Karl Ritchie. This is an idiotic child who is subject to fits. I also saw Nora Joshua who requires to have her tonsils removed.\nDuring my stay in Southampton, I interviewed Dr. Laird.* The impression made upon me by Dr. Laird was not a good one.* He impressed me as being addicted to the use of alcohol. Subsequent enquiries confirmed my opinion, that he is not a man in whom one could place much confidence. He stated, with regard to the operations for removal of tonsils and adenoids, that these operations could be performed during the month of June by Dr. Park of Hamilton, who summered at Southampton, that his fee would be ten dollars for each case and that, in addition, it would be necessary to provide an anaesthetist, (Dr. Laird himself) and nurses, whose fees were not specified. In addition, it would be necessary to provide a building wherein the operations would be performed, beds, bedding, hospital equipment, surgical equipment, hot and cold water, bandages and a physician to remain in attendance until the cases were convalescent. The whole thing to me seemed to be most impracticable and inadvisable.\n\nI found that there is a bus service from Southampton to Owen Sound thrice daily. This bus passes through the Indian Village. The fare is ninety cents from the Indian Village to Owen Sound. I took the bus to Owen Sound. The bus is a modern motor bus, inclosed, with all modern conveniences and quite suitable for the transportation of well or sick individuals from Southampton to Owen Sound.\n\nArriving in Owen Sound I called on Dr. Geo. S. Burt, who is a specialist in eyes, ears, nose and throat. I had made enquiries at Southampton concerning Dr. Burt\nand found that he was reliable in every way. I enquired his fee for removal of tonsils and adenoids and he informed me that his fee was $30.00. On explaining the nature of the cases to him, and the fact that there would be a number to be operated upon, he agreed to cut his fee to $10.00 a case.\n\nHe rang up the anaesthetist who also agreed to cut his fee of $5.00 to $2.50. The hospital fee for public patients is $.50 per day. Each of our patients would be obliged to remain in the hospital two days for the operation.\n\nSunday morning I visited the hospital and interviewed Miss McCarthy, the superintendent. I found that there was an operation fee of $4.00 for each case, but when the circumstances of the case were brought to the attention of the president of the committee in charge of the hospital, it was agreed to waive this charge. Therefore, the entire charge for each operation for removal of tonsils and adenoids would be as follows:\n\nBus from reserve to Owen Sound and return........$1.80\nDr. Burt's fee..................................$10.00\nAnaesthetist's fee.................................$2.50\nHospital charge..................................$3.00\n\nTotal...............................$17.30\n\nThis rate is for five or more operations. Dr. Burt will also cut his fee in two for all eye examinations. These examinations are to be made in his office. The treatment of teeth can be carried out at Southampton and the fees\narranged for by the agent. I believe he has, at a previous date, made some arrangements concerning the matter. Should the Department consider these charges satisfactory and agree to have the operations performed, it will remain only for Mr. Stout, the agent, to obtain permission from the parents of the children to have the operations performed. The children can be sent over to Owen Sound in batches of five or more. The bus will accommodate at least ten. I was unable to carry out a more complete survey of the adult population, owing to the fact that ploughing and seeding are now going on and it was, therefore, impossible to see the Indians individually. It can be readily seen, however, that the health of the Indians on the reserve has been neglected. Tuberculosis would appear to be very prevalent and there would also appear to be a number of cases of syphilis. This does not augur well for the future of the Indians on this reserve.\n\nConfidentially, I may say that I do not think either Dr. Scot or Dr. Laird deserving of confidence. Should it be necessary to provide a physician for the Indians, I think it would be better to bring one in from Owen Sound.

He reports the case of a young boy named Thompson, whom he states, is suffering from tubercular abscess in each axilla and that he was in the last stages of tuberculosis. He examined Mrs. Thompson and found that she was also tubercular.\n\nHe also reports on the case of Eva John, who, although only 13 years of age, is married and has been deserted by her husband. He states that she is in an advanced stage of tuberculosis, also that her sister, Mrs. Nashkoway, is in the early stages of tuberculosis. The Doctor also reports on the case of Luke Kewakwun who is tubercular. If possible, arrangements should be made with Dr. Laird to see that these tubercular patients receive treatment and an effort, at least, made to ameliorate their condition.\nMay 22nd, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nDr. Heagerty, of the Department of Health, who recently visited the Saugeen Reserve, has forwarded to this Department his report on the cases among the children requiring operations for the removal of tonsils and adenoids, examinations of eyes and dental attention. We are today forwarding Mr. Agent Stout a list of these cases and the treatment recommended by Dr. Heagerty to be carried out in each case. A list is also enclosed for your information.\n\nDr. Heagerty has made arrangements with Dr. Geo. S. Burt, a specialist in eyes, ear, nose and throat, and the hospital authorities in Owen Sound to have the necessary operations performed. A special rate for this work has been arranged, provided the children are forwarded in batches of five or more at a time. We are also instructing Mr. Agent Stout to make arrangements with a dentist at Southampton to give the necessary dental attention. It is considered that if all decayed teeth were extracted, this would be sufficient and that it would not be necessary to have any filling done.\n\nWe are also requesting the Agent to consult you when making arrangements for having this medical treatment carried out, and I shall be pleased if you will use your influence with the parents and assist in every way that you can in the successful attempt to have the children sent to Owen Sound, and in having those requiring dental treatment brought before the dentist, who, it is thought, should perform this work at the schools.\n\nThe parents should understand that if they do not avail themselves of the opportunity now offered to allow their children to receive treatment, we will be unable at a later date to make other arrangements for having this work done. It is hoped that the Agent and yourself will be able to influence the parents, and that, as a result, the health of the children will be greatly benefitted. Thanking you for any assistance you may be able to render.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher, Scotch Settlement Indian Day School,\nR.R. #2, Allanford, Ont.\nMay 22nd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nDr. J. J. Heagerty, of the Department of Health, who recently visited the Saugeen Reserve, has forwarded to this Department the names of the children in the three schools on the Reserve who are in urgent need of medical attention. A number of these children require operations for the removal of tonsils and adenoids, others require to have examinations and treatment for their eyes and a large number require dental attention. I enclose herewith a list giving the names of these children.\n\nRegarding the cases that require operations for the removal of tonsils and adenoids, Dr. Heagerty made arrangements with the authorities of the hospital at Owen Sound for their admission, and he also arranged with Dr. Geo. S. Burt, of that city, who is a specialist in eyes, ears, nose and throat, to perform the operations required in each case. Dr. Burt agreed to perform these operations at a very moderate charge and much below his regular fee, provided the children were sent in batches of five or more at a time. The services of an anesthetist were also arranged for, as well as the hospital charges.\n\nDr. Heagerty states that there is a bus service from Southampton to Owen Sound thrice daily, which passes through the Indian village. The fare from that point to Owen Sound is 90 cents.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will take the necessary steps to have the children mentioned on the enclosed list who require operations sent to Owen Sound in batches of at least five at a time. You should consult Mrs. Robb with a view to having her act with you in carrying out these instructions, and in an effort to persuade the parents to allow their children to go to Owen Sound to be treated. You should impress upon the parents the necessity of their children receiving proper medical attention, and that, if they do not take advantage of the opportunity offered to have their children attended to, it will hardly be possible to make other arrangements, and the opportunity now offered will not occur again.\n\nThe fees to be charged for these operations as arranged for by Dr. Heagerty are as follows:\n\n- Bus from Reserve to Owen Sound and return ... $1.50\n- Dr. Burt's fee for operation .................. $10.00\n- Anesthetist's fee ............................ $2.50\n- Hospital charges - 2 days ..................... $3.00\n\nTotal rate is for 5 or more operations.\n\nT.

(RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDr. Burt will also cut his fee in two for all eye examinations. These examinations are to be made in his office. If glasses are required by the children upon the advice of Dr. Burt, arrangements should be made with an optician in Owen Sound to supply the same. Spectacles, in steel mountings, are to be provided in each case.\n\nWe are communicating with Dr. Burt and the hospital authorities in Owen Sound, informing them that instructions have been given you to have the children taken to Owen Sound for treatment.\n\nAccounts covering the expenses incurred should be handed to you, which you will be good enough to certify and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nRegarding the children who require dental treatment, you should endeavour to arrange with a dentist in Southampton to perform this work. He could visit the Reserve and treatment could be carried out in the schools. Dr. Heagerty advises that all decayed teeth be extracted, and that no filling be done. You should endeavour to have the dentist do this work at the lowest possible figure, either on a per diem allowance, or a small charge for each tooth extracted.\n\nThe success to be achieved in having the operations and dental work performed will depend entirely upon the action taken by yourself and the teacher in persuading the parents to allow their children to be treated. You will, therefore, use every endeavour and tact in persuading the parents to allow their children to take advantage of the opportunity now offered, and point out to them that it is in the interest of the health of their children to have this work done.\n\nI will be pleased to have a report from you at a later date as to the success achieved and the names of the children who have been treated and the nature of the treatment in each case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He states that he visited your hospital and arranged for these operations to be performed there. He also states that he arranged with Dr. Geo. S.

A. Stout, to make the necessary arrangements to have the children requiring operations taken to Owen Sound in batches of at least five, and we hope that he will be able to persuade the Indian parents to allow their children to go.\n\nWhen these operations have been performed, I will be pleased if accounts, in duplicate, for the hospital charges are forwarded to Mr. Agent Stout, who will certify the same and send to the Department when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dr. Heagerty also states that you agreed to cut your fee in two for all eye examinations, and that he arranged for the services of an anesthetist, who agreed to cut his fee in half, viz: to $2.50, and that the hospital agreed to waive the usual operating room fees.\n\nWe are instructing our Agent on the Saugeen Reserve, Mr. T.

I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will undertake the necessary operations in the case of the children who are taken by the Agent to the hospital.\n\nWhen these operations have been performed, you will kindly make out your account and hand it to Mr. Stout, who has been instructed to certify the same and send to the Department when payment will be made. I shall be pleased if you will instruct the anesthetist to also hand his account to Mr. Agent Stout.\n\nWe sincerely hope that the Agent will be successful in persuading the parents to allow their children to go to Owen Sound for these operations, and I have to thank you for your kindness in making a special rate for these operations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am pleased to know that the Deptt. is not going to let the matter of the Indian children's health drop without an effort to give them a fighting chance in their struggle for existence in this good world of ours.\n\nThe Indians on my division were much pleased with Dr. Wagner's visit and pleased also that the Deptt. sent a Dr. from Ottawa. A little attention like that goes a long way with an Indian. They are very fond of changes and as you know they have the same agent, same teachers, same Dr.'s year after year. I don't blame them for getting tired of us all.\n\nI, too, was pleased with Dr. Wagner's expert, thorough and interested manner in doing the work intrusted to him by the Deptt. His report tells the need for action. I'm very sorry that this comes too late to save some of our very best. I wish to correct one error. Nora John, who is dying, is not the 13-year-old girl who is a deserted wife. Dr. Wagner only did not see her. I asked Mr. Stout particularly to take the Dr. to her father's home where she then was but although they passed the place at least 3 times he did not take him in. She is the Nora Kawahghez with the blind eye which disfigures her very much, the eye being covered with a perfectly white film, which\n\nIndian Affairs.

This girl or woman has only attended school 407 days in her life, if I remember correctly. I know & recite her total attendance at the time I sent in the report of her marriage. Mr. Weagerty's report as far as my pupils are concerned is correct in every other case. I am sorry that I did not close school when he was through with his examination here & go with him to some of the homes. These homes need attention in a few cases very badly.\n\nLet me assure you that I am ready & willing to do everything in my power to assist the Department in an effort to better the condition of these children. They are the only hope of the Indian race. The last generation are in many cases past redemption. Many however are glad to hear of a movement to clean up this Reserve & will I know do their best to help in the good work. I have a few very promising pupils just now & should be sorry to see them fall by the way as so many have done in the past 10 years. I shall endeavour to talk to the parents & explain their need of action now. The future results will then rest on their own shoulders.\nI do wish Dr. Heagerty could have talked to one of them.

We also hope that the Indians will avail themselves of the privileges offered and that the Agent and yourself have been able to persuade them to send their children to Owen Sound for the necessary treatment.\n\nIf possible, you can arrange to send Nora Kewahghezic to be treated by Dr. Burt for eye trouble.\n\nThe interest taken by you in the children is appreciated, and it is hoped that good results will be in evidence after these children receive treatment.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear at a later date as to the success which has been achieved, and the names of the children who have received treatment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

In May, last, they sent Dr. J. J. Heagerty, an officer of that Department, to the reserve. He examined the children and furnished a report to this Department giving the names of the children and the operations and treatment required in each case. He also arranged to have this work done by Dr. George S. Burt, of Owen Sound, who is a Specialist in Eyes, Ears, Nose and Throat. Dr. Burt agreed to perform these operations at a very moderate charge, much below his regular fee. The services of an anaesthetist was also arranged for, as well as the hospital charges.\n\nThere is a bus service from Southampton to Owen Sound thrice daily, which passes through the Indian village. The fees to be charged for these operations, as arranged for by Dr. Heagerty, are as follows:\n\nBus from Reserve to Owen Sound and return ... $1.80\nDr. Burt's fee for operation .................. 10.00\nAnaesthetist's fee ........................... 2.50\nHospital charges - 2 days ..................... 3.00\n\n$ 17.30\n\nDr. Burt will also cut his fee in two for all eye examinations - these examinations to be made in his office.\n\nRegarding the children who require dental treatment, Mr. Agent Stout was requested to arrange with a dentist in Southampton to perform this work. He was to visit the reserve where treatment could be carried out in the schools, and the fees paid were to be either on a per diem allowance or small charge for each tooth extracted.\n\nThe arrangements made with Dr. Burt and the fees charged by him, as well as the fees of the anaesthetist and the hospital charges are very much below the regular rate charged. Dr. Burt's regular fee for removal of tonsils and adenoids is $30.00, and in the case of the Indian children he agreed to cut it to $10.00 a case. The anaesthetist also agreed to cut his fee of $5.00 to $2.50. The hospital has agreed to waive the operation room fee of $4.00 in each case.\n\n- Our agent -\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have no information as to whether these operations have yet been performed or not, but consider that the arrangements made by Dr. Haugerty are most reasonable and greatly below the regular fees charged white patients. Besides, he had arranged for necessary treatment after all operations.\n\nDr. Park, for whom application is now made to undertake these operations, is a specialist from Hamilton who visits Southampton during the summer months. There is no suitable place in Southampton, or on the reserve where these children could receive the necessary treatment after the operations are performed, and it is for this reason that arrangements were made with the hospital in Owen Sound to have the work done there. Presumably, a number of these operations have already been carried out, as our agent and the teachers on the reserve were requested to have the parents allow their children sent to Owen Sound and to have all the necessary operations and treatment required administered, as soon as possible after receiving the Department's instructions.\nIndian Affairs.

I do not think that the Indians have had adequate medical care during illness lately, as many of them would not send for a doctor when in need of one when they would have to pay the doctor bill, especially, in confinement cases where they should have a doctor in attendance, by all means. I would be in favor of making payments on account for medical services rendered, as when a doctor is paid a salary he is very often imposed upon and I have known the doctor to be called in some cases when it was not necessary, but when the doctor was paid a salary they expected him to come some times for a trifling matter and as both Dr Laird and Dr. P.J. Scott are very reasonable in their charges to the Indians, I do not think that they would over charge for any medical services rendered to the Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd) T.A. Stout\nAgent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRe Medical Attendance for Indians of the Chippewa Band of Saugeen.\n\nAgent Stout of the Saugeen Reserve was requested to inform the Department whether he considered that the Indians of that reserve have had adequate medical care during illness. This action was taken by your instructions and indirectly as the result of inquiry (by request of this Department) made by Dr. J.J. Heagerty, of the Department of Health, into conditions on the reserve.\n\nIn making reply Mr. Stout has stated that he considers that the Indians have not had the necessary care which has been necessary and he adds that they will not send for a doctor, especially in confinement cases knowing that they will have to pay for his services.\n\nThe agent recommends that the Department arrange for medical attendance for these Indians to be paid for on accounts. He states that if a salaried doctor is employed, he will be requested to render too frequent attendance, or to furnish services in cases of trivial ailments.\n\nThere are approximately 45 Indians in the band and considering that in the past many of them have been able to pay for a doctor's services, it is considered that if the Department undertakes to pay accounts for services and medicines up to $500.00 a year, the requirements of the situation will be met. The condition of the Band's Interest Account will admit of payment being made at this rate.\n\nAgent Stout has remarked that Drs. Laird and Scott, of Southampton, who it is understood have furnished such attendance as the Indians requested, are reasonable in their charges, but Dr. Heagerty (as stated in Mr. Sutherland's memorandum hereunder of the 16th May) has reported confidentially that he lacks confidence in either Dr. Laird or Dr. Scott and has suggested bringing a doctor from Owen Sound. Dr. Heagerty is quoted as saying that Dr. Miller of that place visits Allenford twice weekly and could go from that point to the reserve. From an examination of the map of the country, it appears that a doctor resident at Southampton should be given the work. Allenford is four or five miles distant from the reserve and if a doctor is there only a couple of times a week, he might not be able to render prompt attention to the particular class of cases specially mentioned by Agent Stout.\n\nI would suggest making a trial arrangement with Dr. Laird for six months, under which he should render attendance when necessary, it being understood that he be paid on accounts and\n\nJune 23rd., 1922.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nthat his charges for that period are not to exceed $250.00. If he is employed by the Department, he should give special attention to confinement cases and to cases where children are the patients, as it would appear that children of school age have not up to the present been receiving the attention which is necessary.\n\nAccountant.\nJune 20, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from the Honourable the Minister of Militia and Defence, covering communication addressed to him by Mr. James Dixon, regarding proposed medical treatment of children of the Saugeen Indian reserve adjoining Southampton, I am inclosing herewith a memorandum from Mr. Sutherland, of the Schools Branch, which shows in detail the action which the Department has taken and the negotiations that led thereto. Under the circumstances it would not appear practicable to now place or to have placed this work in the hands of Dr. Park. It would appear that in the interests of economy the best course possible was followed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| DATE       | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------|\n| 1922       |        |\n| July 1     |        |\n| Authorized by Dept. letter No. 33-3-1 dated May 22nd 1922 |        |\n| To Jane for 18 Indian children |        |\n| To Owen Sound & return @ each |        |\n| 50 cents each |        |\n| To Mr. Smith |        |\n| To Mr. Murray |        |\n| Paid Jane Root for bringing children from French Bay to Chipawa Hill |        |\n| $33.90 |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I took them on my own car and waited at Owen Sound till they were operated on so that if anything serious occurred I could go for the parents and I also had a good deal of travelling through the Reserve getting the parents consent to let the children go and to get them prepared to get them ready.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nT.

The Indian Department should authorize Mr. Robertson to advertise in the Globe, Toronto, and the Owen Sound Sun Times to try to find a teacher.\n\nThe only satisfactory way to get a teacher is by advertising. Mrs. Robb is anxious to get away as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn McKird,\nPublic School Inspector East Bruce.\n\nP.S. I have received $50.00 change for $5.65 from J. D. Lea. For the balance, send check for $5.65.\n\n[Stamp: \"POOR COPY\"]\nOttawa, October 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that we are requesting Mr. Donald Robertson, Indian Agent, Chippawa Hill, to place an advertisement in the Globe, Toronto, for a teacher for the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School to succeed Mrs. Robb. He is to forward any applications he receives for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRelative to cheques in payment for your services in inspecting the schools referred to by you, I beg to say that cheques in payment have been sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Inspector recommends that you place an advertisement in the Globe, Toronto, as he does not know of any suitable teacher for this school.\n\nYou may place an advertisement in the Globe for three issues for an experienced teacher, Protestant, having at least a second class professional certificate, to begin duties on November 1st, next. You should state that the salary allowed is $90 per teaching month, with living quarters provided. The replies should be sent to you and should be received by a date which you should name. You should send all applications received to the Department for consideration. Please place the advertisement as soon as possible. You should obtain an account from the Globe covering the cost of the advertisement, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is hoped that you can arrange with Mrs. Robb, the present teacher, to continue her services during the balance of the present month.\n\nWe are informing Mr. McCool that you have been authorized to place an advertisement for a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I went up to see her Sunday morning and had her in to see the Doctor, G.J. Laird of Southampton. He ordered her to stop teaching and go home at once as her heart was in very bad shape. Miss Corbett left for her home at Ailsa Craig today and does not think she will come back to teach. On receipt of Department telegram I engaged Mr. Albert M.C. Wells to take the Scotch Settlement School Tuesday morning May 5th at a salary of $90.00 per teaching month. Mr. Wells lives with his mother in Southampton.

The Department will approve of his temporary appointment, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. If Miss Corbett is unable to resume duties at the beginning of the next school year, favourable consideration would be given to the permanent appointment of Mr. Wells provided his services, in the meantime, are satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As Miss Corbett is still in poor health she will not be back to teach after the holidays. Mr. Wells who has been filling in as teacher since May the 6th, is looking for another school. Would you kindly inform me if I should engage a teacher locally for this school. Miss Corbett has one month and six days salary due her, from April 1st to May 6th.

The Department is willing to offer you the post of teacher at a salary of $85 per teaching month. Most of the children are of Church of England faith, but there is no church control over the school itself. There were 26 enrolled during the past year, with an average attendance of 17. The school house is a good, brick building, on a cement foundation. The teacher's residence is frame and is a 7-room house. Two Indians perform the duties of truant officer and janitor.\n\nThis post is really quite suitable for a married man, as there is plenty of accommodation. However, there is no reason why you would not be happy there. Of course, you would have to batch, but there would be plenty to occupy your attention, as you might want to make use of the rather decent barn that is on the property, where a horse and a cow could be kept.\n\nThe Department will hold this position open for a few days, but I should be grateful for a reply as soon as you arrive in Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nSam. Waller, Esq.,\nC/o Church House, 604 Jarvis St.,\nTORONTO 5, ONT.\nOttawa, July 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the vacancy at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School. It will not be necessary for you to advertise for a teacher, as there are several who have applied to the Department for schools in Ontario. If any suitable applications come to you, please forward them promptly for the Department's consideration.\n\nMiss Corbett's salary cheque will be forwarded to her at Ailsa Craig.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I hold a Second Class permanent certificate and have had nine years experience as a teacher in Ontario schools. Last fall I substituted for four months in the Scotch Settlement school when the regular teacher was absent on sick leave. My work then was entirely satisfactory. In corroboration of this I refer you to Mr. John McCool, Walkerton, Ont., School Inspector.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Annie V. Cook.\nChippewa Hill, Ont.

J. McLean\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that I have been requested by Mr. M.J. McIver, teach at the Scotch Settlement Indian day school, to apply for his January salary amounting to $85.00. McIver states that he would like to have this amount by February 1st, if possible. He also asks that I recommend that his salary be raised equal to that or the other teacher's on the reserve. He claims that as he taught some four years in the village school he should be entitled to the same salary. I would not recommend this as I think matters of this kind should be for the Department to consider and not for my recommendation. Mr. McIver has no certificate for teaching and is paid $85.00 per teaching month. Mr. R.H. Gentleman has no certificate for teaching and is paid $100.00 per teaching month and I must say that McIver takes far more interest in his work than Gentleman. Would you kindly advise me as to the Department's view in this matter?\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nDon Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the request of Mr. W. J. McIver, teacher of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, to be granted an advance of $55 on his salary for the current quarter, and also for an increase in his salary.\n\nRelative to the advance asked for by Mr. McIver on the current quarter's salary, I have to say that our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely exhausted, and it is regretted that we will be unable to make any advance at the present time. Mr. McIver will have to make other arrangement for financing until after the 1st of April, next, when our appropriation for the next fiscal year will be available, and his salary in full for the quarter will then be paid.\n\nRegarding his request for an increase in salary, I have to inform you that the Department will allow an increase at the rate of $5 per teaching month from the 1st of January, last. This will make the salary allowed him from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month. This is the full amount we can allow.\n\nPlease advise Mr. McIver in accordance with the contents of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon.

J. McIver, who is teaching at the Scotch Settlement school, has requested me to write concerning his. Mr. McIver has 33 pupils on the roll, he receives $90.00 per month which is $10.00 per month less than the other teachers on the reserve. If the 10% reduction did not affect Mr. McIver he would be on the same salary basis as the other two teachers and that is what he desires. Would you kindly advise me of the Departments ruling in this matter?\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

Generally it would be deep enough to deepen the well without removing the stone which would replace the gold coast six or seven feet. I should think that an additional depth of three feet, which would cost about $50 in gold, would ensure a constant supply of water.\n\nI would advise that every care be taken to sinking a new well as it would cost less and it would be difficult to determine just where water could be procured.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I also had the school grounds leveled, a new board fence put all around the ground, 3 new gates, 2 small, one 6th foot gate.\n\nThe foundations at the north-west corner, where the water had got in & the floor heaved it repaired, also 2 wooden pipes to conduct the water from the caves away from the building.\n\nFor leveling the ground I had it graded so that the fall from the school house all around is one inch per foot.\n\nAll the material used was new except the water closets. The gates had tin coated parts all well bolted, new hinges & new latches.\n\nThis work was let at a cost of $9 dollars, an extra of one dollar was asked for for building a 3 ft. plank walk from the steps atte\nOttawa 27th May, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the dry earth closets erected at the Scotch Settlement School, and also with regard to the fence built around the School grounds, I have to request that you will be good enough to explain why you did not furnish the Department (as you were requested to do by official letter of the 25th June last) with an estimate of the cost before proceeding with the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have instructed the Trustees & Teacher to account that the dry earth is used.\n\nIn explanation of having the work done without first furnishing the Dept. with an estimate of costs, I would say I tried to get offers to do the work of fencing & building a new water closet in accordance with plans received from the Dept.\n\nI had different offers to build the fence the lowest of which was $32.00 but to build a dry earth water closet according to the Dept. plans double. Contractors would tell me that it might cost $36 or $40 but would not bind themselves to any definite cost therefore I had nothing definite to submit to the Dept.\n\nThis spring wishing to have the old closet removed from being in such close proximity to School House, I proposed to the Indian Council to use the old water closet but have it removed to a greater distance from the School House.\n\nThey at once passed a resolution appointing a day for one to go to the school grounds & explain to the Indians who gathered there the work to be done & let said work to the lowest bidder. As there was only three days from the time that it was proposed to have the work done in this way until the contract was let, it gave me no opportunity of submitting an estimate of costs to the Dept. I may say my estimate of the work done was $538.00\n\nI herewith enclose the other offers.

It is thought that the proposed arrangement of thirty-six seats would altogether overcrowd the floor.

She found great fault because of the different sizes which makes such a variation in the height of the desks.\n\nI requested Mr. McKenzie to send her the seats placed as the teacher wished them on Sat. 9th inst., she sent 2 messengers and directed him to send them to raise the desks & seats to the height required.\n\nWhen Mrs. Robb found that she could not place the seats to suit her, on the amount of floor space available, she refused to have anything more to do with the placing of them.\n\nShe then picked up her tools and went home.\n\nI again visited the Sch. this afternoon and found Mrs. Robb as dissatisfied as ever.

These desks are the standard sizes for pupils from the ages of 7 to 16 as provided for in the Regulations of the Ontario Department of Education. The smaller ones are the proper sizes for pupils from 7 to 10; the No. 4's are the sizes for those from 9 to 12 so, and it is not considered that it should be necessary to make any alterations at all.

Am sorry to be obliged to again enter a protest against slant seats. They are still sitting on floor without fastening & have been and are a great annoyance to me. With regard to space, I had the stove moved forward over 4 feet which gives us a good center aisle & the platform removed from front which greatly increases our floor space. The reason I asked for single desks was because having taken up sewing, drawing etc. with my pupils, I had found it exceedingly difficult to arrange work satisfactorily on the double. I had also discovered that in order to prevent copying it was absolutely imperative that pupils occupy separate seats.\n\nI had arranged (in my mind) the desks as follows:\n\n1. Rows on outside close to wall & seats each.\n2. With narrow passage between them & outside rows of 8 seats each then 2 wide aisles of a single row of 6 seats making on all 40.\n\nI wanted 5 rows of 5 fronts & all to be the Ball Bearing Adjustable Desk No. 2, which can be adjusted to suit any pupil I have or am likely to have. These should be proof for generations & could be moved to any building that may have to be erected in the future. On the seats but there are 4 sizes, 6 of the very small (almost useless here), 6 a little larger, 3 still larger & 8 of the No. 1; nearly one half pupils seated on high seat with low desk in front, a very unhealthy position. The 3 rear are all high & there are no fronts. The connected seats taking up space merely. We have been unable to either write or draw during the months as the desks balance on center casting & are continually changing positions.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOur attendance has dropped away down. 4 of our Indian families are away pulling flax. There are 9 of our pupils in that bunch. Another family of 4 has measles so that although I have 37 names on register our average will be down to 22 or 23, perhaps even less. This is most discouraging. Those who are away are the very ones that give all the trouble when here, & certainly they do not better themselves financially by going. I have also to report no sign of new stable. Pumps not touched. Stone still unfinished & neither light nor air in my cellar all summer. Am here alone & am obliged to keep windows nailed as there is neither wash nor lights. Truly I am developing into a chronic humbler but not without reason. I shall not say anything about the book-binding material at present as I can do nothing with that until these deals are screwed down. I have to report a little on the bright side also. The children in attendance are beginning to speak a little English outside & are well behaved & obedient in school. They are much brighter & decidedly cleaner looking than when I first came among them. They are improving a little in every way. The great drawback is not understanding the language. It is not much trouble to teach them the words but it is very difficult to get them to grasp their meaning. There are a few books I would like to have, Canadian birds with coloured plates, Canadian flowers & Our Domestic Animals.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nGeo B. Roth\nOttawa, October 4, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department trusts that you will be able to have the school desks at the Scotch Settlement School fastened to the floor and have the stove jacketed as soon as possible.

I had 36 pupils today. 19 girls & 17 boys. I have exactly 36 seats & was obliged to seat a boy & girl at same desk. That will not do very well. I have not space for any more seats. Am likely to have that number until Xmas vacation. Sure in Spring I shall have 6 or 8 more than that. You should have built the large school here. I have almost as many as the other schools can muster together. Wet or cold will not affect my drove for we are practising for a Xmas entertainment & they are eager to be here because they enjoy the change. Advice me. I am pleased to see them in their places every day yet am at my wits end to know how to place them. The other schools have the pictures of the late King & Queen & also the present Royal pair. We have only Victoria \"the Good\" & that a very old frame. The picture is good however. We also require a good up-to-date dictionary.\n\nYours Respecfully,\nMrs. B. R. S.\n\nScotch Settlement School.\nOttawa, December 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMrs. Robb, teacher of the Scotch Settlement school, has written to the Department stating that she has not sufficient seating accommodation. I would ask you to try to make at once some temporary arrangement. Could not some of the old desks be used for this purpose?\n\nPictures of the King and Queen are being sent you and you will be good enough to have them framed and placed in the school-room. It might be that the teacher could arrange to have some of the Indians frame them in birch bark.\n\nA dictionary for the use of this school is also being sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Geoffield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, December 15, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nReplying to your communication of the 4th instant I beg to say that the Agent has been asked to make arrangements to provide some temporary seating accommodation for the Scotch Settlement School.

Robb,\nTeacher,\nScotch Settlement Indian School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to state in connection with the seating accommodation at Scotch Settlement school Sangen Reserve that I visited the school. The teacher said that all the pupils in the Section excepting one, were present then in the school. And she did not want any of the old desks replaced in the School Room.\n\nAll the inconvenience I could see, was one little boy + one little girl had to sit together at one desk.\n\nLately Mrs Robb had 5 pupils from Bay Section attending her school, 2 of them were visiting in the Scotch Settlement Section, for two days. 2 of them are authorized to be sent to Mount Elgin Institute after the Xmas holidays, and one is living at Scotch Settlement until her guardian is released from jail, which will be soon.\n\nI told Mrs Robb that as she knew all the circumstances I did not think she was justified in complaining to the Dept. in regard to the seating. She replied that it was her School and she would allow no one to dictate to her what she would do in connection with the School.\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nJohn Scofield\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Original on File 153977-6.\n\nBUILDINGS and PREMISES.\n\nThe present building is altogether too small for the number of pupils in attendance. It is too narrow and too short, and the best results cannot be obtained under the circumstances. The present attendance would almost justify an assistant if that could be possible. Some of the old seats have to be used for pupils right beside teacher's desk.\n\nx x x\n\nSomething should be done in the way of providing more room so that her work may be more effective.\n\nThe fence needs to be fixed part of it being down.\n\n(Sgd.) John McCool\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 4, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nYour remarks in regard to the lack of room in the Scotch Settlement School are noted and I should be glad if you could suggest any way that more space can be provided without having to rebuild. This school is constructed of brick and from the returns on file has not sufficient floor space for the number of children now in attendance. The Department would be willing to enlarge the building if it can possibly be done.\n\nThe other matters referred to in your report are being dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

D. M. Lean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Indian Agent,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nReply to No. 10-3977/5 - November 4th, 1913.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your communication regarding Scotch Settlement Indian School, the only way in which more space could be obtained would be by having the school enlarged. All available space is at present taken. I am not an expert in matters of building, but doubtless an expert could easily furnish a plan. One side wall might be removed and enough built to each end to have the present width become the length. I enclose a very simple drawing. If the building were to be enlarged, would the expense be much more to have a basement and furnace?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn McCool,\nPublic School Inspector East River.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This does not give the required amount of floor space and the air space is far short of what the children should have. The school-house is an old brick building which might be enlarged, but it would be much better if a new building could be erected next summer. It is now too late to do anything this fall. The Saugeen Indians have plenty of money and I think that they might be induced to vote some funds for this purpose.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

No. 2 Corridors plan was to extend the width to 10 ft. to gain room for hanging children's clothes, material for buildings, stone is very convenient but bricks would have to be drawn 9 miles, and I think that sand could be got convenient but lime would have to be got at a distance, and if the Dept. makes the extension to the school I think that it would be a difficult matter to get anyone to undertake the work over and have it completed for the opening of school Sept. 1st 1914 so the situation is not convenient hoping this explanation is satisfactory.\n\nSecretary Dept.\nIndian Affairs\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nP.

I would like some provision made whereby my class may be assembled at the usual time. It is ruinous for Indian pupils to have too long holidays. I have so long insisted on having them on hand at beginning of term that I hope it may not be necessary to allow a departure from the usual regulation.\n\nI have a good fourth class & you know how difficult it is to keep them after the period of enforced stay. I am sorry also that the whole basement has not been dug out. I had visions of a good room down there in which to teach domestic science. Yet the grilly expensive wind which they could never hope to use, but just the making of good bread & plain biscuits & pie. Also to give them a knowledge of putting down fruit & making pickles etc. They pick berries all summer, sell to store keepers who preserve them & then sell them back to Indians in the winter. In that way they get only a very little pay dear for it at that.\n\nI would like to ask the Department also to furnish simple desks for at least the larger pupils. They draw large\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nPictures & it means a continual changing of seat during the drawing period. The desks we had were almost all too small for any pupils we have had since my advent & they had to be raised on cants & blocks which made sweeping & cleaning the floor exceedingly difficult. Could not these desks be sold & modern simple substituted? These are in good repair.\n\nAbout the raised platform too. Would it not be better to do away with that altogether? I prefer being on a level with my pupils if necessary a bench for reaching to top of blackboard could take its place. We badly need benches for class seats anyway. I hope the Dept will not think me presumptuous but I am on hand here everywhere & can see little defects which accurately would be an improvement & one I might mention is the lack of windows in the basement. Only two small ones & both on one side appear in the specifications. It will make a very dark little furnace room beside being close having no direct draft.\n\nHoping the Dept will consider these suggestions kindly & take action.\n\nYours Respecfully,\n\nMrs. B.

Robb,\nTeacher,\nScotch settlement School,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I happened to go past the Scotch Settlement Indian School, Sturgeon River the day last week, I noticed that building operations were proceeding. As Inspector, I was interested and called to see the plans, which seem to be very good in the whole. I was sorry to notice that the plan called for double seats for 48 pupils. I should think that\nInstead of the two double rows on each side of the school there was single seats could be placed and thus would accommodate nicely 36 pupils. It would be very satisfactory when such radical changes are being made if the single desks were installed. Single desks are good for at least three things (1) in practical work on the part of the pupils (2) steadiness of pupils may be improved (3) discipline is easier, whispering is not so easily done.\n\nIf the Department could see its way to keep single instead of double seats I am certain that the pupils would benefit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn McCool\nOttawa, September 2, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo suggesting that single desks be placed in the Scotch settlement school instead of double desks.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mrs. Robb, the teacher, has requested that single desks be supplied for at least the larger pupils.

I have been busy preparing for tomorrow's lesson and have arranged for two good school desks. The desks I have used before have been satisfactory, but they are expensive. However, the school desks shown appear all right. If we could have 24 seats, the larger size would be more suitable for Indian children who are larger than ordinary pupils.\n\nI think three rows of single desks would suffice, but two double rows would be too small for our pupils. The desks had to be elevated on wooden bases which rendered sweeping and cleaning difficult. I would not advise placing any of these small ones in the new room. The type we had were the single desk, which have very narrow backboards and very elaborate carving on the metal sides.\n\nI am almost certain our room cannot be ready by the 15th. The mason work is not yet finished and carpenters only began work this morning.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn reply to your question, I beg to state that I certainly did refuse to have the books, maps, etc., stored in my house. I know also that the party who informed you had done so in a way plainly intended to cause me trouble or will. The surprise indicated in your question I shall now give you my reason which I am sure will show that it was not done with any arbitrary motive.\n\nI occupied my house this summer for the purpose of caring for my garden & premises generally. When the farmers were about, I also entertained my friends here during vacation. I certainly would not cook, eat or sleep where those dusty, germ laden furnishings were stored. The books have been stored there because the school for 5\u00bd years & as quite a number are & have been 4th Class students. They have a number of books etc. each. Now at least of these pupils have sore necks. Sometimes positively rotten, 3 or 4 have sore eyes, & 2 or 3 have running ears. I have endured the combined odors in a room unventilated & unlawfully small 17x24 & having an average of over 30 as you know. Besides there were, at that time, 2 empty houses not more than 20 rods from the school; one across the road has been occupied for 4 weeks by a man who came here to work on the job & who has\nNow moved back to his own home. The other is in the same field as the school yard & has been empty for about a year & likely to continue so for some time. My own house is not in a fit state to occupy as it is. Two years ago I asked to have the kitchen, pantry & a room upstairs papered. Nothing came of the request & I shall not ask again. The paper on both kitchen & pantry is hanging in disgraceful condition. We have strapped & tacked it up as well as we can. When it becomes impossible to do so any longer I can go home. My house & furnishings are still in my possession. The only furniture we brought here were the piano, sewing machine, a brass couch-bed, & our trunk & clothing so it will not be difficult to move back if we are obliged to. I do not ask for anything until it is really necessary & do not take a \"let turn down\" with good grace, especially when others on the staff appear to get repass when asked for. I am doing my duty as faithfully as any of them & deserve at least the same consideration. I hope to see some members of the Department here when this building is finished & they can then see for themselves just how things are.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs. B.

Mrs. Robb, the teacher, has applied for 24 single desks and, as they have now 18 fairly good double ones in the school, you should find out what further equipment is necessary in the way of desks. You might inform Mrs. Robb that no equipment will be supplied until after your report is received.\n\nMrs. Robb also refers to the application she made to have her dwelling house repaired. You might see what repairs are necessary to make it comfortable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nR. M. Ogilvie, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPort of Southampton, Oct. 30th, 1916.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary, Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Stout, Indian Agent of the Saugeen Indians, has advised me that rebuilding of the School in the Scotch Settlement is about completed. I thought I should advise you, so that you could get the Fire Insurance adjusted, as I well know the department has expended quite a sum. Should you decide to have this insurance increased, I will be pleased to attend to it for you. You can have the old policy cancelled and rebate pro rata granted and a new policy issued, or you can have a policy issued covering the increase you desire, concurrent with the one you have. I think the first proposal is the best. But however that remains for you to say.\n\nI have the Honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The kitchen is erected as a wing and has become separated from the main building breaking the plaster and permitting the cold to enter the building. The wall paper is nearly all off the walls and ceilings of both kitchen and pantry and as one of the walls of kitchen (side of main building) is of wood battened and painted, I have instructed the Agent to repair the plaster after removing paper and to paint the walls as this treatment will prove more durable than the paper under existing conditions. Repairs are also necessary to the chimney and the Agent has been instructed to have these made while the contractor is at the school where he has the necessary materials for doing the work.\n\nThe walls of this building where covered with iron siding are showing signs of wear, the metal showing through the paint which will soon rust through unless painted early next season on the arrival of favourable weather.\n\nThe boundary fence between school and residence is in bad condition as stated in the school report and the Agent authorized to make the necessary repairs thereto.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, November 7, 1916.\n\nMemorandum for Mr. Scott.\n\nOn October 28th I made an inspection of the new Scotch Settlement School the contract of which is now nearing completion.\n\nThe building is of solid brick construction on stone foundation with basement (under new portion) furnace heated and ventilated in a satisfactory manner. The interior of the building is completed except the placing of black-boards, and the exterior with the exception of painting and grading around the building which has been delayed owing to the constant wet weather there which would not permit of this work being done satisfactorily.\n\nThe completed work is first class in every particular as far as can be judged from inspection in a finished condition without personal knowledge of the work under construction.\n\nThe class room accommodates 40 to 45 pupils and is well lighted, heated and ventilated. The hardwood floors are oiled and varnished in a sanitary manner. The two cloak rooms for the sexes are also floored in hardwood and the trim finished in oil and varnished as is the small teachers' entrance room. The ceilings throughout are of metal neatly tinted.\n\nThere is a staircase to basement giving entrance from both out and inside with locked doors which permits of the basement being kept in a sanitary condition without entering the school room etc. while doing this work.\nThe fences and grounds surrounding school require some attention as some of the fence posts have rotted away allowing the fence to fall, and the yard requires some grading and ploughing. I have instructed the Agent to have these put in order, also to provide a few loads of gravel immediately surrounding the school entrances.\n\nThe pump platform was found in bad condition with flow of surface water towards the well. The Agent has also been instructed to take off the defective wood platform and build up in concrete extending the wall of concrete at least 4 feet below the surface to prevent frogs, toads and worms entering the well.\n\nWhen these repairs have been completed the school and surroundings will be first class in every particular.\n\nThe equipment of this school is deficient to the extent that 43 pupils are enrolled with seating accommodations for 36 and for 4 of these the seats and backs are not the required size for the desks, the seats being so high that there is no space to permit the scholar to occupy the seat with comfort. New backs of the proper size should be provided.\n\nThe additional 7 single seats required can be taken from the village school, Saugeen Agency, which have a large excess of seats over their requirement and of the size necessary.\n\nA desk and chair for the teacher is also necessary and should also be provided as the ones now there are useless for the purpose.\n\nArchitect.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Ogilvie,-\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 17th ultimo in which you were asked to find out what further equipment is required in the Scotch Settlement school in the way of desks and also what repairs are necessary to the teacher's dwelling to make it comfortable.\n\nI should like to know as soon as possible what desks are necessary for this school.\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nNOV 13 1916\nARCHITECT.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Ogilvie, Architect of this Department, who visited the Scotch Settlement school lately reports that the fences and grounds surrounding the school require some attention. Some of the fence posts are broken away and the yard requires grading and ploughing. He found the pump platform in a very bad condition with the flow of surface water towards the well. He states that he instructed you to have these matters attended to and it is hoped that this has been done.\n\nMore desks are required for the school-room and, as there are more than are needed in the Saugesen Village School, you may take the desks required from there and you should consult the teacher as to the sizes and the number of desks needed.\n\nYou may order from the Globe Furniture Co., Limited, Waterloo, Ont., for this school a teacher's desk No. 121 in their catalogue and a teacher's chair No. 1563 in their catalogue. The price of the desk is quoted at $12.50 and the chair at $4.00. The accounts for these, in duplicate, should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nMr. Ogilvie also states that there are four seats in the school which are unsuitable, being so high that there is no space to permit the scholar to occupy the seat.\n\nT.

If you will advise the Department as to the sizes of the desks which are fitted with these unsuitable seats and gives the names of the makers new ones will be ordered.\n\nThe Department wishes you to have the repairs to the teacher's dwelling which Mr. Ogilvie instructed you to have made attended to at once as well as the repairs to the fence between the teacher's residence and the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nJULY 11 1917\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, July 27, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Abraham in a recent report stated that water was seeping into the basement of the Scotch Settlement school from the higher ground in the rear of the building, and Mrs. Robb in her report on the school for June, also states that the water is standing continuously in the basement of the school causing the furnace to rust badly.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will have a drain dug at the rear of the school extending along each side to the front and thence connected with the drain from building towards the road. The drain should be about three feet away from the building and at least one foot below the basement floor and filled with small stones and gravel for a depth of one or two feet so as to intercept the water from hill and allow this to flow to the drain from building.\n\nThis work should be undertaken at once and completed as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The basement has not yet been properly drained, hence the iron of the furnace is very rusty. It would be very advisable to have the basement thoroughly drained before the wet weather of fall sets in.

You may also purchase two brooms.\n\nThe asbestos which is off the pipes in the basement should be replaced, and you should arrange to have this done. The Department will approve of the expenditure required in having the frame supporting the bell renewed and placed in good condition. You should attend to these repairs and have them completed before the extreme cold weather sets in. You should also arrange to have the furnace and pipes cleaned in order that the heating equipment will be in good condition for the coming winter's use. You should also arrange to have the door of the barn repaired.\n\nAll of the above requirements should receive your early attention, and, when completed, properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She states that the interior of the school building requires cleaning and painting and that the stairway to the basement needs repairs. She also states that the closets have not been whitewashed for two years and are badly in need of being cleaned and that the steps at the entrance need repairing. She further states that the fences and gates need repairing and that it would be advisable to have the school building painted next spring.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange to have the steps at the entrance to the closets put in good condition and these buildings cleaned out. Please furnish a report as to what you would advise be done with reference to the painting of both the interior and exterior of the school building, also what repairs, if any, are required. You might also furnish a report as to what repairs are needed to the fences and gates. Your attention to any urgent repairs required to put the school building and closets in good condition for the winter is requested.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands to have any repairs carried out which you consider necessary and at the lowest possible cost, and you should furnish a report later as to any painting which you would recommend be carried out to the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSam Putnam, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill,\nOnt.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Robb in connection with repairs for Scotch Settlement school.\n\nI wish to say that this report is greatly exaggerated. The closets were cleaned last fall, and the steps are not in need of repair. The gate and fence may require some attention next spring. Mrs. Robb did not mention white washing the closets during the summer or autumn, and it could not be done now. I asked Mrs. Robb to fill out requisitions for supplies and repairs, and none of this was asked for. She is caretaker of the school, and in the other two schools the caretaker looks after these small repairs without additional expense.\n\nI will report at a later date on the painting of the interior and exterior of the building next spring.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nLept.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from Teacher's Annual Report on the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School for the Year Ended March 31, 1925. See 1925A-1F, Ont.\n\nBuilding,- We have water in the basement every spring from three to four months.\n\nDrainage,- After this dry winter with little snow, we have water in basement two months.\n\nMrs. Barbara Robb,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teacher of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, in her report for the current fiscal year, states that there is water in the basement of the building every spring for a period of from 3 to 4 months. I have to request that you will forward a report as to the cause of the water entering the basement and what you would suggest be done in order to provide proper drainage facilities. Please state the approximate cost of any work you would recommend be done in order to prevent the water from remaining in the basement. A full report will be expected at an early date, giving as full particulars as possible, as well as the cost involved, in providing drainage for this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSkul Putnam, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill,\nONT.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter 31-3-5 of March 30th.\n\nI wish to say that this report is greatly exaggerated. There is some water in the basement, but for it being there three or four months is not true. I think the cause of the trouble is it leaks through the foundation at the floor. I have been paying particular attention to this basement all winter, but could never find out where the water came in, and Mrs. Robb herself cannot explain it.\n\nThere is a drain from the bottom of the basement on the south side of the school running south for about a hundred and thirty feet. There is another drain on the outside along the north and west side of the foundation and empties into the drain running south. Mr. Besito who did the work was in the office last night, and he informs me that the north and west side of the foundation on the outside are plastered with cement, and this extra drain put in, and still the water comes in.\n\nI have men working at it at present, and Mrs. Robb was well aware that I was going to do this work when she wrote the Department, as you gave me authority in your letter 31-3-5 of December 30th. I had men working when I received your letter of March 30th. I am cleaning out the bottom of the drain on the south side, but if this will help matters, but if it does not, the only way I know of would be to plaster the inside of the basement wall with cement, putting in a new floor of cement, raising the floor from the north, west and east sides, so as the drain would run out of the south side. The floor of the basement has none if any fall to the drain. I think the drain running south from the school was never put in properly, for the south end drain should take the water away off the floor, and also from the drains from the outside. I think this drain will have to be taken up, and put in larger tile, as I notice it is falling in, in some places. With regard to the cost, I think it would cost about one hundred and fifty dollars to do the job properly.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If it is found that this will not overcome the difficulty in properly draining the basement, the question of plastering the inside of the basement wall with cement, putting in a new floor of cement and raising the floor on the north and west sides, in order that the water can run from the drain on the south side, will receive consideration. It is hoped, however, that the action now being taken by you in repairing the drain from the bottom of the basement on the south side of the school will overcome the difficulty.\n\nPlease report at an early date the result of the work now being undertaken by you in providing proper drainage for this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Basement under water for four months in which was soaking and moulding bark and dirt from several cords of short wood thrown in at different times from February until end of April. Basement requires thorough renovation, whitewashing, etc. Schoolroom also must be thoroughly cleaned this holiday. Pumps are both out of order at present. Fence also... We have no flagpole. Where attendance was regular progress has been good, pupils willingly doing work assigned. I would ask that David Thompson be not allowed to leave his family of 6: 4 boys and 2 girls; ages from 14 to 6 alone here, while he and his wife go around country peddling baskets and begging. I ask this for sake of girls. Charlie John is nearly always away from home. He takes his family but they are neglected as far as education is concerned. These neglected children keep others back and take too much of my time from the others. Notice their ages and standing in school.\n\nMrs. B. Robb, Teacher\nSir,\n\nIn reference to the enclosed report I beg to report as follows:\n\nMrs. Robb taught on June 23rd and school was closed on Friday June 26th. She did not teach on June 30th and I think that she should not be paid for it.\n\nThe cold air pipe was slightly damaged by children throwing wood in the basement for Mrs. Robb's convenience, but the pipe was not open.\n\nThere is some water in the cellar at times but there is a good woodshed and this wood should not have been put in the basement. The school is built on a springy hill and it would cost considerable to drain the basement.\n\nCharles Johns was away from the reserve for about a year and I had a letter from a teacher near Markdale certifying that the children had attended school regularly.\n\nAs to Mrs. Robb's report of sickness I wish to say that I admit that there has been less sickness during the past year than for many years.\n\nIn conclusion I might say that Mrs. Robb is caretaker of her school and the pupils do practically all the work and she gets the salary.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to previous correspondence, your letter 31-3-5 of April 8th, re drain at Scotch Settlement school. I have been up looking over the schools, and I found the drain from the south side of the school must have caved in, as I think it was put in with clay tile. The closets need whitewashing, and an ewe trough, and the cold air pipe need repairing. I think $58.00 would cover the whole thing. I think the new drain would have to be put in with cement tile, as the clay ones are no good.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 31, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant, relative to the repairs required to the drain at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School. From the information which you give, the Department is unable to determine the amount of work that would be required to have this drain placed in a satisfactory condition. However, we notice that you estimate the cost of repairing the drain, whitewashing the closets, providing an eavetrough and repairing the cold air pipe would be approximately $58.00.

I think it will cost a hundred dollars. We have dug down to the bottom of the drain and it had never been put in right. The main drain that takes the water was only four inch tile, and did not have enough fall, and were completely plugged up with dirt and etc. These tile had to be dug out. This drain will be a hundred feet long, and will have to have six inch tile with a collar on so that they will join. This drain is over six feet deep, and the ground is the hardest clay I ever saw. Every shovel full has to be picked, and the men wanted to quit several times, as they were discouraged picking.\n\nAll the rest of the work at the school is finished but the drain.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

The cost was $2.00, as I had to take up a hardware man from Southampton, and went myself. Could I have authority to pay him this amount.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 1st instant, I beg to say that the action taken by you in having the bell, pump, etc., repaired at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School is approved. We note that the cost incurred was $2.00. Please forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering this expenditure when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSaul Putnam, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to enclosed quarterly report for Scotch Settlement school. This report is greatly exaggerated.\n\nRegarding the health conditions I have never had a report of any epidemic of any kind of sickness in Scotch Settlement. We had an epidemic of whooping cough in the Village, but there wasn't any in Scotch Settlement. Regarding the boy, who she says is literally dying on his feet, Mrs. Robb has never informed me of this case, and I do not know who the boy could be. Neither do I know why the four girls are that she mentioned have goitre. The girl she mentions who is blind in one eye is Mary Cameron, who was in the hospital in Owen Sound from April 14th to June 27th under the care of a specialist Dr. Hurt, and he didn't recommend glasses, and he ought to know better than Mrs. Robb whether she needs glasses or not.\n\nWith regards to water in the basement, I don't know how there could be any, as there was a drain put in this summer, one of the best, that I ever saw in a cellar. It was put in with six inch tile. Mr. Parker examined this drain when he was visiting the reserve last fall, and I think he will back up my statement. I visited this school on the 22nd inst. and Mrs. Robb did not mention any water in the basement. She did not make a complaint of any kind, and it is the only time since taking this office that I was up there without Mrs. Robb having a complaint of some kind.\n\nRe the pump, she had been complaining of the pump, and last month there was some glass to be put in, and the bell to fix, and I took a man up, an expert, I went up with him, as he would need help to lift it out, and he said there was nothing wrong with it. She sent word to me with the truant officer that the pump was not working.\n\nRe the house cleaning, I wish to refer to your letter 14-31 of May 16th, 1924, where you said Mrs. Robb was caretaker, and it was up to her to keep the school clean. Her salary was raised at that time for that purpose. It would be impossible to please this woman, and she has had trouble with every agent who has been here in her time.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 5, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nYour return for the December quarter, showing the attendance, etc., at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, has been received.\n\nIn your remarks, you state that there is a boy, 12 years old, who is \"literally dying on his feet.\" You state, further, that four girls have a well developed goitre. I have to request that you will give the names of the children referred to, stating their ages. The agent states that he has no knowledge of the boy reported as \"literally dying on his feet,\" nor does he know who the four girls are that you state to have goitre.\n\nThe Department cannot understand, after all the work that was performed last fall on the drainage of the basement, why there should be water in the cellar.\n\nRelative to the pump, the agent states that he took a man up to the school to inspect this pump and he reported that there was nothing wrong with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nR. R. No. 2,\nAllenford, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of Jan. 5th, I hereby state the names of pupils asked for. The boy Elijah Thompson age about 13, son of David Thompson, an almost blind man, who has a family of 6 children, 4 girls & 2 boys to provide for. These are all attending school except the youngest child, a boy. Elijah had a severe sickness about a year ago, since when he has been apparently anaemic seldom strong enough or too listless to join in the games of the others. He is very, very thin, lips & ears colourless, gets up & sits down like an old man & certainly requires more nourishment than he is getting to enable him to recover.\n\nThe girls are named in order of apparent progress of the disease.\n\nMabel John, age about 10, large lump on right side of neck, very dull, cannot remember anything, is thin and troubled with sore eyes.\n\nJeane Thompson, also 10, lump on right side neck, pale & thin but lively enough & doing fairly well at school.\n\nElijah Thompson, age 14, neck enlarged on both sides otherwise in good condition.\n\nDinah John, half-sister Mabel, about 7, growth on one side of neck showing as Mabel's appeared 2 years ago. The Thompson girls are sisters of Elijah, the delicate boy. I also have a little boy here who has a very bad ear, this week it has been again discharging a watery fluid which drops on his clothes. This occurs whenever he has a cold, looks quite miserable.\n\nAnother boy, age about 8, has been out of school for some time suffering from enlarged glands & stiff swollen neck.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI do not know what is the matter. He is the last of a family of 6. Two boys died of consumption & two girls & boy of this. Mother dead also & this little man looked after by his aged grandmother.\n\nThese Indians appear to be very scarce of money this winter & a number of children are certainly undernourished. A school nurse or doctor should visit them occasionally. Other schools have regular attendants who advise parents & teachers so that existing wrongs may be righted.\n\nAbout that basement.\n\nThe work put on that ditch was, as far as I am able to judge, positively useless. A larger tile & little deeper ditch at south side of school was all that was changed & since fall rains that ditch has fallen in about a foot & lies ready to hold surface water to make matters worse. Since school was built in 186 we have had water in basement. Two large water pipes from cisterns at west end of school pour their contents above ground & water or ice is there whenever rain falls or snow melts. The wall at North West corner was wet from top to bottom two months ago & since then we have water lying in basement. When I came here after vacation I spoke to Chief Solomon, who did the work, about the necessity of extending those water pipes down into the tile along bottom of walls. He said he had spoken to the Agent about it but the agent refused to change his plans. So there the matter ended & here the water lies as usual & I do not see that the larger tile has carried off any more water & I know that the party who supplied tile made 3 trips here when the whole thing should have come in one.\nAbout the Pump.\n\nWhoever said that there was nothing wrong with the pump certainly said what was not true. Since the pump was put in, it worked perfectly until Sept. 1924. It is an iron pump and so constructed that it cannot freeze in cold weather and it has not frozen at any time. But the pump has worked loose and rattles round every time the handle is used and has had to be primed every morning and several times during the day since Sept. 1924. Never before that. This priming business when performed by sometimes not very clean Indians is to say the least not appetizing and this has had to be done winter and summer. In winter when weather is frosty, ice gathers on the pump until boiling water has to be used for priming. The agent brought a man here but snow and cold were here and I know they did not look into the well to examine the pump, probably the pump did not require priming at that particular moment. However, that can no figure for the agent has been told repeatedly about the trouble.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nB. Robb\n\nTeacher.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the health conditions among the pupils of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, I now beg to inform you that the teacher states as follows regarding the children who need medical attention:\n\n\"Elijah Thompson, age about 13, son of David Thompson, an almost blind man, who has a family of six children, 4 girls and 2 boys to provide for. These are all attending school except the youngest child, a boy. Elijah had a severe sickness about a year ago, since then he has been apparently anaemic. Seldom strong enough or too listless to join in the games of the others. He is very, very thin, lips and ears colourless, gets up and sits down like an old man and certainly requires more nourishment than he is getting to enable him to recover.\n\nThe girls are named in order of apparent progress of the disease.\n\nMabel John, age about 10, large lump on right side of neck, very dull, cannot remember anything, is thin and troubled with sore eyes.\n\nIrene Thompson, also 10, lump on right side neck, pale and thin but lively enough and doing fairly well at school.\n\nEllie Thompson, age 14, neck enlarged on both sides, otherwise in good condition.\n\nDinah John, half-sister Mabel, about 7, growth on one side of neck showing as Mabel's appeared 2 years ago. The Thompson girls are sisters of Elijah, the delicate boy.\n\nI also have a little boy here who has a very bad ear. This week it has been again discharging a watery fluid which drops on his clothing. This occurs whenever he has a cold, looks white and miserable.\n\nAnother boy, age about 8 has been out of school for some time suffering from enlarged glands and swollen neck. I do not know what is the matter. He is the last of a family of 6.

Please request the doctor on the occasion of his next visit, to examine each of these children and furnish a report to the Department, through your office regarding each child and what he would recommend to be done to give them the treatment which their case requires. This matter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nThe teacher further states that the pump is still in a very poor condition of repair, it being necessary to have it primed every time it is used. It would appear that the pump has worked loose. I have to request that you will again examine this pump and have the necessary repairs carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

Peter Petahnequott aged 8 son of James Petahnequott was absent from school so I had not the opportunity to examine him.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter 31-3-5 of the 21st inst.\n\nI went to the Scotch Settlement school on Monday, January 25th, and made arrangements to have the children all come to school the next day. The doctor went out the following day, and enclosed is his report, with the exception of Peter Petonoquot who was not at school.\n\nThe weather has been very stormy, but as soon as it clears, will either have the doctor go to see him, or have his father bring him into the doctor.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 2nd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing the report of Dr. Laird on his examination of the children who require medical attention at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School. We note that the Doctor states that suitable medical treatment will meet the present needs of each case. It is hoped that he will see that the children who have goitre receive the necessary treatment and remedies. If a small quantity of iodine salt was supplied, and the necessary instructions given the teacher, she would, no doubt, see that the same is given, as prescribed by the Doctor, to those pupils who have goitre.\n\nIt is also considered that if those pupils who are undernourished would receive milk it would be of benefit to them. The teacher would, no doubt, see that they get a moderate supply each day. You might arrange to have the amount required delivered to the teacher at the school, and she should see that the children who require same receive a small quantity each day. Please consult the teacher regarding the serving of the milk, and inform the Department as to the number of quarts you would recommend be delivered, and the cost per quart. If any utensils are required for the serving of the milk, the same could be obtained after you have forwarded the Department a list of what is required.\n\nPlease take up with the Doctor and the teacher as soon as possible the question of supplying iodine salt, and milk, and inform the Department definitely as to whether you would recommend that the above suggestions be carried out.\n\nWe note that Dinah John requires dental attention. You might state whether you can arrange to have a dentist give the treatment required, the approximate cost of the work and also whether this girl's parents can pay the cost of the dental work.\n\nThe Doctor should give the necessary treatment to Ernest John, who has a discharging ear. Please also state whether arrangements can be made to have this boy sent to the hospital in Owen Sound for the removal of his adenoids, and the approximate cost of the operation and hospital expenses. It may be that the same arrangements could be made for this operation as were made in the case of the other pupils who were operated on sometime ago.\n\nPlease give the above matters your early consideration and report fully to the Department regarding the supplying of milk, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

At present we can get the milk from Mrs. John, an Indian, who will deliver it at the school for 12\u00bd\u00a2 per quart. It is hard to get milk at this season of the year and if anything happens that we can't get the milk we can get a substitute, which Mrs. Robb uses herself. I would also recommend iodine salt or a suitable treatment for goitre given the children by the teacher.\n\nI took this matter up with both the doctor and the teacher. The required utensils are four drinking cups and four teaspoons.\n\nWith regards to the dental work and the operation for adenoids, I can't give the approximate cost at present, as I will have to look further into the matter and get the parent's consent.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 12th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the case of the pupils at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School who have recently been examined by a Doctor and the treatment they should receive.\n\nWe note that the Doctor has now examined the Petonoquot boy and has excused him from school as he was found to be tubercular. It is also noted that the Doctor has given this boy's parents the necessary instructions to be carried out in his case.\n\nRegarding the undernourished children and your recommendation that they be supplied with milk, I beg to say that you can arrange for the delivery of 2 quarts of milk per day to Mrs. Robb, the teacher to be given to the children. We note that an Indiana milk deliver this milk at the school for 12 cents per quart. You may purchase 4 drinking cups and 4 teaspoons for the use of the children. Mrs. Robb should keep an accurate account of the milk delivered each day and hand the same to you at the end of each month, when you should prepare vouchers covering the cost and send them to the Department for payment. The statement as to the quantity of milk delivered each day should be attached to your vouchers.\n\nYou may also purchase a small quantity of iodine salt and deliver the same to the teacher, who should administer it to the pupils as per instructions of the medical officer. The supplying of the milk should only be continued until the end of April, next, and it is hoped that as a result of the supplying of the milk and iodine salt, there will be a marked improvement in the health conditions of the children requiring attention.\n\nWe note that you will endeavour to arrange with the parents to have the necessary dental attention given in the case of Dinah John, and the operation that may be required by Ernest John for the removal of his adenoids carried out. Before taking any action, you should furnish the Department with the approximate cost involved and what arrangements you can make to have the necessary dental and medical attention given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When he was taking the milk there before I used to pay him almost every week, but he never came in with this account until the 12th inst. I can see no other way than to pay for it, as the Indian can't afford to give this milk away.

John Sr., for milk supplied to pupils of the Scotch Settlement School between the 3rd May and the 11th June, inclusive, and in reply I may say, in view of the fact that the Department granted authority to have milk supplied to the 30th April only, of which fact you advised both James John Sr. and Mrs. Robb, teacher of the school, the voucher mentioned is not being paid. James John should not have supplied milk after the 30th April, and, when he did so, Mrs. Robb should have drawn your attention to the matter instead of allowing an account to be incurred which was not authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The cold air pipe of the furnace is in two parts and the air in the basement and hallway going down is very foul. The cold air pipe should be fixed at once as this cannot be healthy for the children.\n\nThe pump is very hard to work and requires priming. It does not seem nearly as easy to operate as the former pump.\n\nThe inspector noticed that some of the children had not any great nourishment for dinner. In cold weather and in winter time, a hot lunch would be a great blessing here for the children. The children would be attracted to the school and their study would be improved.\nOttawa, October 13th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McCool, in a report on his recent inspection of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, states that the cold air pipe of the furnace is in two parts, and that the air in the basement and hallway going down is very foul. He recommends that the cold air pipe be fixed at once, as, under the present conditions, it is not healthy for the children. Please enquire into this matter and arrange to have any repairs required to place the cold air pipe in a satisfactory condition.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the pump is very hard to work and requires to be primed each time it is used. Please examine this pump and arrange to have any repairs or alterations made in order to put it in good working order. The Department will expect you to attend to this matter at an early date.\n\nAny expense incurred should be kept down to the lowest possible point, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded by you covering the cost.\n\nLast winter, as you are aware, two quarts of milk per day were supplied for the children. The Inspector recommends that the pupils receive some nourishment at lunch time. Please report as to whether you can arrange to obtain this quantity of milk each day and have it delivered to the teacher to be given to the children. If Mrs. Robb, the teacher, would prepare and serve hot cocoa at lunch time to the children, the Department would be prepared to authorize the purchase of the supplies required for the purpose. You might ascertain from her whether she would prepare and serve this drink and advise the Department. Your early reply is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

As there is a considerable strip of land in connection with this school and Teacher's dwelling which is not being used, I would suggest that a plot of this ground be cultivated and used as a school garden so that every pupil could have an equal interest in it. In order to do this two new gates would be required at the entrance to the grounds as the ones that are there are broken down; these gates would cost around $8.00 each, the fence around the place would need to be fixed up some, which would take a man about one day.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the conducting of a school garden in connection with the Scotch Settlement Indian Bay School. In this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have plowed the plot of ground in connection with the school and teacher's dwelling, and the manure required supplied. You may also purchase and have installed two new gates at the entrance to the grounds, and arrange to have the fence repaired. You should consult the teacher as to the garden seeds required, and you may then arrange to make the purchase of same locally, obtaining a good grade of seed as cheaply as possible.\n\nAfter you have the ground plowed and the fence repaired and the new gates installed and the seed purchased, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nPlease give your attention to the above at an early date, in order that the garden plot will be ready for seeding as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The day I was there 26 pupils were present out of a roll of 30. The classroom was very tidy and clean. The pupils were bright and happy looking. Very satisfactory progress is reported here. The school property is in very fair condition. The closets need jacking up and new sills put in. The school needs painting both inside and out. The closets should also be painted at the same time. The ground in front of the school is very rough and uneven. The hay was not cut this year. At very little cost it could be plowed up, levelled and seeded down. This would add very much to the appearance of the property. The grounds cover about three acres. The fences need some new posts and the wire stretched and stapled.\n\nThos. Mc Gookin,\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his recent inspection of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, states that the closets need jacking up and new sills should be put in; also that the school building needs painting, both inside and outside, as well as the closets. He further states that the ground in front of the school is very rough and uneven, and that the hay was not cut this year. He states that at very little cost the grounds could be plowed up, levelled and seeded down, and that this would add very much to the appearance of the property. He also states that some new posts are needed in the fence and that the wire should be stretched and stapled.\n\nIf not too late this season, you may arrange to have the closets repaired and new sills put in; also the fence posts put in where required and the wire stretched and stapled. While seeing that a satisfactory job is completed, you should keep the cost as low as possible. If the work is carried out this fall, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRelative to the painting and levelling of the grounds, you should draw these matters to the attention of the Department early next spring, giving particulars in detail as to the work you would recommend be carried out in each case, the cost of all materials, etc., required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

J. McIver, teacher.\n\n26 pupils present at 9:30 on the day of my visit. Attendance has been very good, averaging 25 out of a roll of 28 for the month of April. Discipline and deportment in the classroom was very good. The classroom is bright and airy, and well scrubbed. A school garden was being prepared for planting.\n\nThe outside of the school building needs painting.\n\nBoth closets and screens should be jacked up and straightened, and a coat of paint applied. Door of boys' closet needs rehanging. 5 new window blinds for classroom. A softball for the girls. New 91 flag. Four pictures for classroom. A supply of Truant Officers Forms Nos. 139-140 to be sent to Agent Robertson.\n\nThe roof of the woodshed, used by the teacher for a garage, is in poor condition and needs to be reshingled.\nOttawa, June 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his inspection of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, states that both closets and screens should be jacked up and straightened, and a coat of paint applied, and that the door of the boys' closet needs reconditioning. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of November 17th last. The Inspector also recommends that 5 new window blinds be supplied for the windows in the classroom.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you should arrange during the coming summer holidays to have the closets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good, sanitary condition. The screens should be repaired. You may also arrange for the purchase and installation of 5 new window blinds for the windows of the classrooms. In carrying out the above work, you should keep all expenses as low as possible, and you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Inspector has further recommended that the school building, both inside and outside, be painted. In this connection I have to say that we will have no funds this year for this work.\n\nRegarding the grounds, which are stated to be rough and uneven, I shall be pleased to have a report from you as to what you would recommend be done in having the grounds levelled, and the approximate cost of the work.\n\nYou may arrange, if the work has not already been attended to, to have the fence repaired and any new posts put in and the wire stretched and stapled, forwarding the usual certified accounts covering the cost.\n\nInspector McGookin recommends that a softball for the girls, 4 pictures for the classroom and a 9' flag be supplied. It is considered that, as the school will soon be closing for the summer holidays, the supplying of this equipment could stand over until the school reopens, at which time you might forward a requisition for same.\n\nA supply of forms for teacher's report of absences and for truant officers will be sent under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

With reference to the repairs required to the closets and screens, Would you kindly advise me if I should use some of the lumber which is on hand from the Indian mill to repair these buildings or should I purchase lumber required.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDon.

It is noted that you estimate the cost of this work to be approximately $6. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible, and all expenses in levelling the grounds and in the other work which you were authorized to have carried out should be kept as low as possible. This work should be carried out when you are having the repairs authorized in official letter of the 5th ultimo done.

It was moved by Noah Wahbezee second by Alex Root that the account in favor of Harry Eagles, Southampton, Ont. for lumber supplied for repairing the shed at the Scotch Settlement United Church amounting to $4.50 be paid from Band Funds, Carried.\n\nI beg to say, this lumber was got in December by the caretaker who repaired the shed.

The plaster has given way in places. The outside woodwork, windows, doors and under eaves - is deteriorating badly from lack of paint. The under half of one of the windows has been so badly damaged by a dog left in the classroom over night, it will have to be replaced.\n\nThe two old closets are beyond repair. They have been patched and jacked up so often nothing more can be done with them.\n\nIf funds can be procured the classroom and outside woodwork should be painted and two new closets erected during the summer holidays.\n\n[Signature]\n\nINSPECTOR.\nOttawa, January 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reporting on his recent inspection of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, Inspector McGookin states that the walls and ceiling of the classroom require re-decorating, also that two new closets are needed.

You should, also, inform the teachers of the three schools in your agency that dogs should not be left in the classroom over night.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Repairs to the window referred to would cost about $2.00. I would also suggest that the outside of the school be painted, this would cost about $50.00.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

February 15th. 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith vouchers amounting to $6.87 in favor of Wm. Eagles, Southampton, Ont. for window sash and guards for the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School. I beg to say, these windows are very near on a level with the ground and it has been hard to keep glass in them; I had these guards made to fit the outside of the window and protect the glass. The one sash had been broken.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

Mr. McIver would also like about three quarts of paint for the residence, the covering for the well, evertroughing and paint would cost about $25.00. Would you kindly advise if this work is to be done during the holidays.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

This work was all done during the past summer holidays and I do not understand Inspector Game reporting them as not having received attention. The covering on the well was replaced with a cement covering, the eaves have been repaired, with an outlet at each corner of the building, having a pipe from the eave down with an elbow at the ground, and the doors on the closets close perfect. This work was done by Mr. Dan McVittie but to date I have not received his account.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nMemorandum for file:\n\nIn letter of April 6, 1938, on file 31-1-5, Indian Agent Robertson wrote as follows:\n\n\"I would like to have the classroom at the Scotch Settlement School redecorated this year as it is very dull. This would cost about $75.00.\"\n\nIn official letter of April 12, on file 31-1-5, Agent Robertson was instructed to write the Department about the middle of July at which time further consideration would be given to the painting of the interior of the Scotch Settlement School.\nExtract from Inspector Game's report on the Scotch Settlement School visited on May 18, 1938:\n\n\"The seats in both water closets are filthy. A thorough scrubbing is urgently required and a wooden button is needed for one of the doors.\n\n\"The walls and ceilings of the class room are in a disgracefully dirty condition. Redecoration should be carried out without further delay - in fact it should have been done years ago. White ceilings and cream or buff walls are recommended. The class room lighting would be greatly improved were the westerly of the two maple trees opposite the school windows removed.\n\n\"A good school garden is in prospect again this year. Most of the planting has been done.\"\n\n(Sgd.) J. M. Game,\nInspector of Schools.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 31-1-5, dated April 12th, regarding the painting of the interior of the Scotch Settlement School.\n\nWould you kindly advise me if it will be possible to have this painting done during the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant with reference to painting the interior of the Scotch Settlement School. As you were informed in official letter of April 12 an amount of $300.00 is available for repairs and improvements at the three schools in the Saugeen Agency.\n\nWe have already purchased materials at a cost of $89.44 for re-siding the teacher's residence at French Bay. We are not yet aware, however, what the cost of the labour will be. In addition you requested in your letter of July 20 authority to paint the French Bay teacher's residence. As yet we do not know the cost of this. If there is sufficient money left after paying for the re-siding of the French Bay teacher's residence and the exterior painting the Department will have no objection to painting the interior of the Scotch Settlement School.\n\nIf you feel assured that the expenditures already authorized will not require more than $225.00 the amount necessary for painting the interior of the Scotch Settlement School will be available and you may proceed with this work. Material and labour should be obtained from firms on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

You visit this school regularly and the Department is surprised that you do not arrange to have the toilets kept in proper condition.\n\nPlease make immediate arrangements for cleaning the toilets at this and the other schools in your Agency if required. You should also advise me why you have neglected this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD.

I had this done on December 3rd. I may say that apparently the young people of the district make use of these closets during the night and leave more dirt than the school children.

Date of Visit P.M. Oct.26,1938.\nPost Office address of school....Chippewa Hill.\n\nTeacher...Malcolm McIver.\n\nA splendid lot of vegetables was produced in the school garden this year.\n\nThe boys' water closet is the filthiest and most foul smelling that I have ever inspected. It is a positive menace to the health of those using the building. The fecal matter is even on the floor and is being tracked into the school. The vault is too high and no urinal has been provided.\n\nThe interior of the school building is disgracefully dirty and should have been redecorated years ago. The room would be much better lighted were the westerly of the two maple trees near the windows removed.\n\nJ. M. Game.\nInspector of Schools.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter NO. 31-3-6A, dated December 8th, regarding neglect of duty on my part in connection with the Scotch Settlement School.\n\nI beg to say, both letters referred to were correspondence, letter NO. 31-3-6, dated June 15th, was reported to on July 7th, with an estimate of the cost of repairs required, letter NO. 31-3-6, dated November 13th, was reported to on November 15th. These repairs were done by Mr. Dan McVittie, Southampton, and were paid by voucher NO. 92 amounting to $22.45, dated December 8th, 1937.\n\nI have personally placed a urinal in this closet twice, both times it has been taken away. On my visit to this school on October 25th last, I noticed the urinal was gone and arranged for another one, the closet had been recently cleaned, on my visit on November 30th, the urinal had not been installed nor had the closet been cleaned, both these were looked after on December 3rd.\n\nApparently the young people make use of these closets during the evening and nights and leave more dirt than the school children, to avoid this in the future I have purchased pad locks for use on both doors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nDecember 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy attention has been directed to a very serious neglect of duty on your part in connection with the Scotch Settlement School in your Agency regarding which I require an explanation from you by return mail.\n\nOn 18th June, your attention was directed to a section of the School Inspector's report, having reference to the condition of the boys' toilets, and, no reply having been received, a further communication was sent to you on 15th November last, which you have also ignored.\n\nTo neglect to reply to correspondence is discourteous to say the least, but neglect to give immediate and adequate attention to a matter of such urgency and importance as is disclosed in the Inspector's report on this school is reprehensible.\n\nYou will be good enough to reply to this letter by return mail with an explanation as to why you have neither replied to correspondence nor taken the necessary steps to correct the disgraceful condition complained of.\n\nI may add that only a reasonably satisfactory explanation will be acceptable to the Department, but satisfactory or not, see that it is not delayed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDon Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCHIPPEWA HILL, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent\nof Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my inspection of the Saugeen Agency on November 30th and December 2nd.\n\nSCOTCH SETTLEMENT SCHOOL\n\nThis is a stone building. The outside woodwork is very badly in need of paint. Two of the porch standards are rotting away and should be replaced. The classroom is dingy; the walls and metal ceiling should be painted and two spots where the plaster is broken, repaired. Nothing has been done to the building for years. As a result, the outside woodwork is deteriorating badly. The closets, particularly the boys', were in a filthy condition. I ordered the closets cleaned and a urinal placed in the boys' immediately. This has been done. The agent and teacher are both at fault for allowing such conditions to exist. The closet screens should be straightened and both closets and screens given a coat of red paint.\n\nThos. McGookin,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOntario.\n| Account | Forwarded |\n|---------|-----------|\n| 1       | 6/3       |\n| 2       | 9         |\n| 3       | 1/2       |\n| 4       | Welding furnace door | 50 |\n|         |           | 162 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Robertson, Indian Agent, Chippawa Hill, Ont.\n\nIn reporting on his recent inspection of the Scotch Settlement School Inspector Game recommends:\n\n1. Connect the cold air duct in the basement.\n2. Completely rebuild the screens around both toilets.\n3. Place a tile around the school foundation to keep water from seeping into the basement.\n4. Plow and fertilize the garden.\n\nIf the garden has not been plowed you should arrange for this at once. It should not be necessary for the Inspector to comment on a matter such as this, as it is expected that all Indian agents will encourage the planning of school gardens and, of course, this involves plowing the ground.\n\nItems 1, 2 and 3 should also receive early attention. The Department would appreciate your advising when you have carried out these instructions.\n\nYou might also obtain an estimate of the cost of redecorating the interior of the classroom.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to refer to Department letter No. 31-3-5, dated May 12th, regarding the Scotch Settlement School.\n\nRegarding Nos. 1 and 2. I arranged with the local plumber and carpenter last spring to have this work done but as there is only the one local plumber and carpenter it is hard to get them to do work on the reserve, especially small jobs, however this will be completed as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding No. 3. No doubt the Inspector is unaware that there is already a tile around the foundation of this school and also a six inch drain from the basement.\n\nRegarding No. 4. There were very few local gardens plowed on May 3rd, date of his visit, the garden has been plowed, planted and is up and weeded. I do not see why the Inspector should comment on the garden not being plowed on May 3rd.\n\nThe redecorating of the class room would cost about $100.00. This class room was redecorated in 1939.\n\nDon. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1944.\n\nMr. D. Robertson, Indian Agent, Chippawa Hill, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the Scotch Settlement School. In this case too you state that the classroom could be redecorated for $100, but you do not state whether it is a quotation or if materials will have to be purchased. Please let me hear from you regarding this matter.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to refer to Department letter No. 31-3-5, dated June 2nd, regarding redecorating the class at the Scotch Settlement school.\n\nThe estimate of $100.00 was received from Mr. Levi Indoe, painter and decorator, Southampton, Ont. This estimate includes material and labour; it will require three gallons of white and three gallons of cream paint also one and a half gallons of varnish.\n\nDon.

Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 10, 1945.\n\nMr. D. Robertson, Indian Agent, Chippewa Hill, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, in which you express the belief that the barn at the Scotch Settlement School site should not be sold.\n\nPlease advise John Kahbeje that the Department has considered his request and has decided not to dispose of this building at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 23, 1945.\n\nMr. D. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\n\nWhen reporting on his inspection of the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School on May 15, Inspector Game writes:\n\n\"Improvements still required:\n\n1. Toilet seats could and should be kept cleaner.\n2. Attention to the toilet screens by a handy man with a hammer and nails.\n3. Connect the cold air ducts to the furnace. There can never be efficient circulation of air or heating until this is done. Attention was drawn to this a year ago.\n4. The basement floor and walls are wet. This condition would probably be eliminated by placing a drain tile around the outside of the foundation well below ground level.\"\n\nThe first three suggestions will not involve any heavy expenditure and you should arrange to have the work carried out immediately.\n\nWith reference to No. 4, you should let me know the cost of a drain around the outside of the foundation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** May 9, 1945\n\n**For:** Scotch Settlement School\n\n**Agency:** Sang Zeer\n\n**NOTE:**\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES                  | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS |\n|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| garden rake               |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| garden hoe                |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Sand containers from garden store |            |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| water pails               |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| thermometer               |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Red paint                 |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Brown                     |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Paper towels              |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Kleenex                   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Ammonia                   |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Lifesaver Soap            |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| Sunlight Soap             |                |                       |                 |                   |         |\n| P.O.

With regard to the condition of the building he has made the following comments:\n\nImprovements noted: (1) New screens by the toilet doors.\n\nRecommendations:\n(1) Wash class room walls. The pupils and teacher will clean the windows.\n(2) A new furnace or at least extensive repairs to the present one which has no cold air ducts, a broken door, and a cracked pot which permits smoke to come into the classroom.\n(3) Attach door on one toilet. These toilets both continue to be downright and unnecessarily filthy - a disgraceful condition to say the least.\n(4) Glass for basement windows. The furnace room is very dark as the windows are boarded up.\n\nIt is suggested that glass be put in the basement windows and that they then be screened with heavy wiring. This is now obtainable and you are now authorized to have this work done during the summer holidays. This wire will have to be well fastened down and should be covered at the edges with boards.\nIt is presumed that we will hear from you with regard to the other repairs necessary at the school.\n\nI would ask that you speak to Mr. Wells with regard to the conditions of the toilets, and tell him that we will require daily inspection of these toilets. If necessary he should select toilet monitors and make them responsible for cleaning these toilets each night. If these monitors are retained for work it will soon be found that all children will acquire an interest in the maintenance of cleanliness in these buildings.\n\nIf they are being used by adult Indians, you are authorized to purchase heavy locks for them now.\n\nBernard F.

I would not have allowed them on my own responsibility if the council had not sanctioned it. The repairs were all necessary. The roofs were decaying consequently leaked. The cellar had no window on it. The stove pipe went through a hole in a partition without a chimney which made it very dangerous for fire. The kitchen needed the repairs inside to make it fit to live in on the winter time. The material used for that purpose is of the cheapest kind and the work only cost $5.00. The painting of it inside might have been done without but it would not be comfortable living in a room ceiled with lumber without it being painted. This is my reason for recommending the payment of this bill.\n\nDeputy Sup't General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

As requested I herewith enclose estimate cost of repairs of Teachers' dwelling and fence at the Scotch Settlement.\n\nIn explanation I would inform the Dept. that there never was a soft water system in connection with the dwelling and I think it necessary to the comfort & convenience of the family.\n\nThe fence has been erected for 16 ft. 18 feet & consisted of a 10\" board at the bottom, strands of smooth wire and a pole on top, the posts are 10' apart. The posts are too far apart for smooth wire and the wire too far apart on the posts, any animal as small as a sheep can go through the fence. Mr. Burr has kept the pigs out by making on boards at his own expense.\n\nAbout one half of the post & top poles useless & requires new gates.\n\nThere is a quantity of stone lying at the fence and in heaps on the grounds. I propose building them into the fence between the posts 3' at the bottom 2' high and 2' at the top, using the smooth wire that is on the present fence on top of the stone, putting it close so that the animals cannot go through it.\n\nThis will\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nThis will make a good fence and dispose of the stones which cause so much trouble to cultivate the land around them, and the smooth wire which is no use at the bottom of the fence, I think I can build 30 rod or more of this kind since the balance of the 90 rod I would recommend to be of woven wire.\n\nThe roof of the dwelling required some repairing; I think by spending eight or ten dollars it will last a few years longer. The most of the corn-drying is very badly decayed.\n\nEvery room in the house requires papering and I think it should be done. Mr. Burr informs me it has never been done at the expense of the Dept.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Deoffeldt,\nAgent.\nMeeting held at Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 23rd June 1902\n\nClerk:\n\nAre there funds ($237.37) for repairs and fencing for teachers dwelling and school settlement?

The amount of stone on the property built more fence than I had estimated for, and as it cost as much more as the woven wire. The cost of the work done will be $866 more than I estimated, but as it makes a much more durable fence also removes the stone, and makes the land more valuable and I consider that the money is well spent.\n\nI would therefore recommend that Mr. John Burt's a/c $866.00 be paid.\n\nI let the contract of the gates & wire to Mr. H.

It is large enough to hold four head, floored with rock-elm planks two inches thick. There is an additional part which, with the space above, will hold three tons of hay. There is a building at one end for cows and a shed at the other for a buggy and cutter. All the buildings are roofed with iron by Mr. H.

You are no doubt aware that Deech Settlement School is 4 miles from P.O. 6 or 6\u00bd miles from Southampton. At least 2 miles from a dwelling inhabited by whites. I am living here alone and have no means of getting out even excepting \"looting it.\" I purposed bringing up a pony after Easter but when I visited the Stable on the premises found it positively unfit for either horse or pig. The Indians assured me they would make that all right after their Council but Mr. Sheffield informs me they turned the matter down by a vote of 25 to 25. I do not know whether he had the casting vote or not, but certain it is whoever had it failed to use it. I cannot tell whether it is their duty to provide a stable or not but as it stands I know no other course to pursue than to appeal to the Department. There is lumber enough about this big tumble-down affair to build a nice tidy little stable & drive house provided it is not too much warped to be of any use.\n\nHoping you will give this matter prompt attention.\n\nI am Yours Respectfully,\n\nMrs. B. Robb,\nTeacher.\nChippewa, June 18\n\nLe Petit Indien Officer\n\nSchool House\n\nSome time ago I wrote regarding a site for school site at Scotch Settlement.

They refused to undertake the expenditure saying that the present building was good enough. They refused to erect a new building at different times for Mr Burr.\n\nThe present building certainly appears dilapidated. The previous teacher kept 5 animals and about 40 hens in it the winter before he left.\n\nThe building is about 25 years old or perhaps should be replaced, but we cannot erect a building to suit every teacher; it is built principally of hemlock and any person who has handled hemlock timber knows that when the old building is taken apart, the lumber will be but little use.\n\nIf the Dept decides to erect a new building, it will take for stabling and dwelling house, building 32' x 25' and 14' high and will cost over $2000.\n\nSecretary Dept \u2014 I have the honor to be Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Dehoff\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has been asked to take the matter up when you return to the reserve to re-open the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. B. Rebb,\n283 Wellington St.,\nStratford, Ont.\nChippawa Hill\n\n359468 Sep. 9th 11\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state in reference to the matter of stable accommodation at the Teacher's dwelling, Scotch Settlement, Saugee Reserve. I interviewed Mrs. B. Robb on the matter. She said she did not wish to have the old building repaired, but she did want was the old building to be taken away, and a new one erected about 60 ft from the dwelling house.\n\nShe said that the Dept had informed her that the Agent had been authorized to erect a new stable. I have not understood from any other letter received that I was authorized to erect a new building.\n\nIf the Dept intends building a new stable, I would not advise it to be erected so near the dwelling house as Mrs. Robb proposes as it would affect the fire insurance.\n\nWill the Dept kindly let me know what further action should take in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Deoffield\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department would like you, however, to state definitely whether you consider that repairs to the present building would answer the purpose. If it is beyond repairing it would appear to be necessary to erect a new building. It seems only reasonable that adequate stabling accommodation should be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Sanger.\n\nI do not think it advisable to spend money in repairing the present building. I therefore brought the matter before the Indian Council at its regular meeting held on the 3rd inst. The following resolution was unanimously passed, the Chief and three of the four Council being present:\n\nResolved, That this Council would request the Dept. to erect a new stable for the use of the Teacher at Scotch Settlement Samson Reserve. The stable to be the same size, excepting to be two feet higher than the one at French Bay School and the cost be taken from the Band funds.\n\nCertified Correct.\n\nCarried\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think it would be a mistake to do so. I cannot be present to keep a record of the men's time, a competent foreman will not cost less than $3 per day and other workmen $2.50 and when men are paid for time they do not always occupy the time as they should.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the work be done by contract for a lump sum.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Scofield\nAgent\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 13th, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant in which you state that you do not approve of having the work of the erection of the stable at the Scotch Settlement School being done by day labour.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if the work is to be done by contract it will be necessary for you to furnish a full description of the building and obtain a price from some reliable contractor to be submitted for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

S. G. of I. A.\n\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\nT. O. Scott\nAgent\nI am obliged to make a protest against the treatment which I have been and am receiving at the hands of the agent.\n\nThe last time Mr. McQuillan was at my school I took both over to the house & pointed out the condition the house was in caused by smoking chimneys & defective chimney. I have spoken to the agent about them every time he has been here since the close of the war as his excuse at that time was \"no one to do the work.\" It is four years at least since Mr. McQuillan ordered him, in presence of my daughters, to have the matter attended to but has not been touched. To-day the water is pouring in over every thing in the shed! The clock even cannot be used; this summer I had a bag of chips that cost $1 moulded & destroyed. I have been afraid to leave home for fear of rain pouring into parlor (as it always does when the wind is West or North or Southwesterly). I have a piano for which I paid over $500 & certainly it has had a good many moves to find a place where it would not be splashed by dust. The paper on the house is proof enough that what I say is true & it takes almost all summer to get the smell & smoke out of the clothing we in the house. The kitchen door & windows are so open that snow blows across the room during winter storms. The house outside requires re-painting as it is ruined almost past saving. Several who have seen the chimney have said that it is a menace to both life & property. Pieces of blackened brick come rattling down & soon the whole fabric may tumble.\nThe table too requires repairs. It has become so open & cold, the roadway up to the house & the culvert at the gate. The gates need by. The children are locked up because they will not close & have been for 4 years. We have to be kept in & Indian cattle kept out as I have pasture & garden to guard.\n\nWe also need a new fence around school yard & a flag pole. When the Agricultural representative (Mr. Harlowe & think his name is) was here I took him over with Mr. Stout & showed a piece of zinc piping my summer visitors nailed up on the parlor window so that the drip would all come down in one place. It is still there.\n\nIf it is not the agent's business to look after these things kindly advise me to whom I must appeal. Certainly things are in a dangerous as well as disagreeable condition. I never pays to leave anything until it is past repair especially in these H.C.L. days.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nR. Robb.\nTeacher.\n\n[Stamp: DEPT.

You should make report in the matter stating under what authority, if any, the work was done, and in this connection I have to remind you that you should be particular to obtain authority from the Department before you incur expenditure.\n\nBefore the voucher can be paid, it will be necessary for it to be supported by receipts from the men whose services are charged for.

Mr. Connelly from the Department was here at the time, and we both agreed this was the best thing to do. If you are not satisfied, send the vouchers back, and I will pay for the chimneys myself.\n\nSaul Putnam,\nIndian Agent.\nSir.\u2014\n\nI have the honor to refer to your letter #31-3-5 of the 23rd inst., and beg to state that I was out looking over the public buildings of the Reserve, and found one chimney of the Scotch Settlement school residence in dangerous condition, and I ordered the necessary material, I thought at the time we might as well get them all repaired at the one expense, as they were all in need of repair. We had a lesson with the Agent's house, being almost on fire as a result of dangerous chimney.

We desire that this residence be partially furnished for the new teacher, who is being appointed to succeed Mrs. Robb. I have to request, therefore, that you will at once forward a list of the furnishings that will remain in the building after Mrs. Robb leaves. You should prepare a list of any further requirements, giving, if possible, an estimate of the cost of supplying same. I shall be pleased to receive full particulars with reference to the furnishing of the residence at the earliest possible date. Miss Corbett is being informed that it is expected she will provide her own bedding and a reasonable quantity of dishes, cutlery, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

Re. furnishing Teacher's residence at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to say, the only piece of furniture which will be in the house after Mrs. Robb leaves is a cook stove which is burnt out, it is one of the old style stoves, and I do not think it could be repaired. To furnish a living-room, dining-room, bed-room and kitchen it would cost between $450.00 and $500.00 including window shades and curtains, this would purchase the cheaper line of furniture including a cook-stove and heater. Please advise if this is what the Department considers doing, as there is no furniture in the house whatever.\n\nI might also state the house needs a new roof and decorating inside from top to bottom, in some of the rooms the paper is hanging from the ceiling.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nFurniture and bed shading 40.\nWindow curtains 476.\nCurtains' rug 600.\nStoves 200.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is considered that this amount is excessive. The Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase and supplying of furniture, including bed and bedding, to an amount not exceeding $200. You may also expend the sum of $40 in the purchase of kitchen utensils; $40 in the purchase of curtains and rugs and $60 in the purchase of two stoves.\n\nYou should, if possible, obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers for the supplying of the above equipment, and you should place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price. While serviceable articles should be obtained, it is not intended that any expensive furnishings should be supplied. It would be advisable for you to consult the teacher and prepare a list of the articles needed, and you should then obtain prices. The above authorized amounts must not be exceeded, as it is considered that the furnishings required can be obtained for the amounts mentioned.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. You should attach to the accounts the quotations which you received from the merchants whom you asked to quote.\n\nRelative to the repairs required to the roof and the redecorating of the residence, I have to request you to state whether it is absolutely necessary that the roof be repaired at the present time. If so, you should state the nature of the work required and the approximate cost thereof. You should also give an estimate of the cost of the redecorating required to the interior of the residence, stating the work you would recommend be carried out. Please give this matter your prompt attention and inform the Department at an early date as to what is required. You might state whether you could arrange for the purchase of the material required and for the labour, if it is necessary to reshingle the roof and carry out any redecorating in the interior of the residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

G. Parker,\nInspector.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of November 19th, 1928, and your reply thereto of the 30th of the same month, relative to the repairs required to the teacher's residence at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School. Please furnish a report as soon as possible as to the repairs required to the roof of the building, any interior decorating, also to any painting that may be required to the exterior of the building. You should, if possible, give an estimate of the cost of any work you recommend be carried out, and you should state if you could have same performed by day labour under the charge of a competent foreman, you to arrange for the purchase of the material required and to oversee the work. It is intended this summer to place this building in good condition.\n\nThe Department understands that the school building requires a certain amount of whitewashing. You might also report regarding this matter, giving your recommendation as to what work you would advise be carried out, and, if possible, an estimate of the cost. The work should be carried out at the same time as the repairs to the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD.

(RG 10, Volume 6161, file 426-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter No. 31-3-8, dated June 4th, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Scotch Settlement school.\n\nI beg to say, this dwelling requires a new roof and the kitchen which is built onto the house needs new sills as the present ones are decaying and the kitchen is falling away from the main building. It will require 14 square of shingles to cover the house and kitchen. No. I, XXX British Columbia shingles cost $7.00 per Sq. and it would be $25.00 to place new sills under the kitchen. I could have this work all done by day labour cheaper than by contract as I could have Indians do the shingling. There are three rooms and a hall downstairs which should be repapered and the woodwork painted which would cost around $60.00. As the present teacher does not use the upstairs I do not think that part of the house need be redecorated at the present time. I will forward an estimate of the whitewashing of the school at an early date.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, June 13, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the repairs required to the teacher's residence at the Scotch Settlement Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost of the work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the roof repaired and new sills placed under the kitchen. You should also have the three rooms and hall downstairs repapered and the woodwork painted. This work should be performed by day labour under your supervision. Proper time sheets should be kept of the labour employed. You should arrange for the purchase of all material required, obtaining same at the lowest possible cost. Should you require an advance to pay the labour, same will be sent you upon request. It will not be necessary at the present time to carry out any redecorating of the upstairs portion of the residence. You should see that all work is carried out to your satisfaction. You should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all material supplied. The time sheets should be signed by the individual labourers employed and certified by yourself. They should be forwarded in duplicate. I am enclosing herewith a supply of forms for the purpose. Please keep all expense as low as possible, having in view the supplying of a good grade of material and the satisfactory completion of the work.\n\nIt is noted that you will forward an estimate of the cost of the whitewashing required at the school building at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Last winter I supplied Mr. McIver with 16 cord of 14 inch wood for fuel, he has only about two cord left, I could purchase 14 inch wood from some of the Indians at the present time for $2.50 per single cord.

Last year, a great many Indians belonging to different reserves came to work at the new mill, and they camped there with their families. They are going to do the same next year, so I send another missionary. But also for the many children who will be there in six months, it would be much desirable to have a school. The teacher at Moosominaging (Reverend River House) might be removed there for the time being, and for a place to teach in, I found a fairly good house that we might buy or rent. I would be obliged to you if you would let me know as soon as possible what the Department is ready to do to help me by contributing and thus I may obtain more than half of the probable expenses, to add a little to the purchased house and to make desks and seats. I suspect I have to see 25 children there \u2014 and most likely, for a few years it will be the same. That is why I would rather buy than rent the house.\"\n\nRespecting the matter, the Department\n\nI beg respectfully to state that I would hardly feel justified in concurred with the reverend gentleman in his proposal to establish a school at Garden River, for the reason that any Indians who would go to the new mill for employment,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Office.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Artus of Garden River in which that gentleman asks that the teacher of the Serpent River School may be allowed to carry on the school at Cutler while the Indians are working at the mill at that place; and in reply I beg to say that if, as is stated by Father Artus, the greater part of the Indians remove to Cutler during the summer, the Department will not object to the proposed change being made, on the distinct understanding that it is not to be called upon to contribute anything towards obtaining accommodation for the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.W.

Sup't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am advised by your Department to place a certificated teacher at the Serpent River Indian School. The chief and the Indians here have placed in the school a half-breed woman that has no certificate to teach. They claim that they have been authorized by your Department to do so and will not part with her because she knows the Indian language, as they themselves do. Her name is Josephine Biaillon. She is here with her husband and children, among whom a baby. She created a great disturbance here, having persuaded the chief and the other Indians, that your Department does not require certificate teachers for Indian schools, that such is but a notion of my own. Please let Indians know if they are to continue Josephine Biaillon in their school or not, and oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. R. Richard,\nIndian Missionary.\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n\nWe have made a great mistake by appointing our teacher, but we are not altogether to blame, for we were sure that what Mr. Ross told us was sufficient. We would have made more inquiries but both Father Richard and Father Pauquin told us that they had nothing to do with the school. The chief asked Father Pauquin but he told me he had nothing to do with the school in the presence of a lot of others. Mr. Ross advised us to have a meeting among ourselves and all of us to sign our names and to send it to him and he would arrange the matter with the Department, and it is what we done and we asked Mrs. Beaulieu to be our teacher and she agreed. She was leaving here the very day she made our agreement with Mr. Ross we also told him whom we had for our teacher and he recommended her as being a good teacher and he seemed to be pleased about it.\n\nOn the 16th of November we advised Mrs. Beaulieu to begin teaching which she did. On the 27th of November Father Richard arrived here and found Josephine Beaulieu teaching he was real angry about it and he put teacher and children all out of the school. He told us the wish of the Department was to have a certificated teacher but we did not know what it meant. We then received a letter from Mr. Ross which stated that the Department would give us a teacher and that Mrs. Beaulieu was teaching without authority. Mrs. Beaulieu has no certificate and she explained to us what it was. We find her to be good and agreeable and can also speak in our language and help us a lot.\nFather Richard advised her to keep on teaching till further instructions from the Department. We would very much like her to stay there is not one of us that is not wanting her, so we beg your assistance to let her stay although she has no certificate. Please let us know as soon as possible what we must do and please let us please give her a trial, let us have our wish for once. She has been recommended to us by a good many.\n\nWe Remain\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nChief Robert Ojibway\n\nLouis Mauvais\n\nWilliam Kalmewon\n\nJoseph Sagamiga\n\nLouis Kalmewon\n\nJacob Silaboo\n\nPeter Silaboo\n\nJoseph Mitchell\n\nSobishogig\n\nKahdahkoh\n\nLouis Cajijowan\n\nJames Simpson\nDear Sir,\n\nI mailed another letter to you today about the Serpent River Indian School.

Ross, the agent at Manitowaning, of what had been done. Therefore, in the case you should not approve of her appointment, I would, at least, beg that she would be paid for the few weeks she has taught school.

Many thanks for your kindness. I trust my health will be better so I can take a school again. I have taught now over 15 years. I have been told that teachers that taught over 10 years or a certain number of years have received an extra pay after they stop teaching if there is anyone getting their pension please try to get it for me as I claim that it is the most difficult school to teach an Indian School where the parents does not speak English and sometimes are very indifferent & disrespectful to the Language.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nHelen Reed\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nMary Coda\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are in trouble for our school.\n\nMrs. Ross, the Indian Agent was here sometime in October, and we asked him to change our teacher Mrs. Mary Ada, and we asked that Mrs. Josephine Beallows take her place. His answer was that he was willing that she may teach, that he had known her as being a good teacher, and he advised us to have a meeting among ourselves and sign our names to our agreement and send it to him (Mrs. Ross) and that he (Mrs. Ross) would forward it to the Department. We took it for granted that Mrs. Beallows was to be our teacher.\n\nShe was in this place when Mrs. Ross was here. She was leaving this place for her home with her husband in a sail boat the day Mrs. Ross was here. We inquired to Mrs. Ross at once if she could be our teacher, and as he said he was willing we turned back to tell Mrs. Beallows that she was to be our teacher. They had already left the landing place and were about 20 yards from the shore when we made them turn back, and told them to be sure and come back and to bring their furniture that we would furnish them a house. They were away three weeks when they arrived again the 8th November; in a week's time they were settled and we advised her to begin to teach school Monday 16th November. Before we had seen Mrs. Ross we spoke to Father Pauquin about changing our teacher; he told us to ask Father Richard. When Father Richard arrived she was anxious about having another teacher; he said he had nothing to do with the school and that he did not want to have anything to do with it.\nanything to do with the school, so we thought our Ross had all\nto say about school teaching and did not consult priests any more\nabout it.\n\nWe thought everything was going on smoothly when on Friday\n27th Nov. Father Richard arrived here and walked us the school\nhouse and put teacher and children all out of the school. In this case\nwe are very much displeased. Father Richard says we are to have a\nteacher with a certificate. She talks nothing but the English. We do\nnot want to part with Josephine Rosati as she is able to speak in\nour language and can do more good than a teacher with a cer-\ntificate or that talks only English. She has been teaching only\ntwo weeks and we already find a big change in our children.\nThere is not one of the Indians that can read or write so we al-\nways depend on the teacher to do our reading and writing. So we\nbeg your assistance to let us keep her for at least a year.\n\nMrs. Cada has been teaching our school all put together for the\ntime she taught must be about 9 or 10 years and our children\ndo not know any more than if they had never been to school.\n\nPlease give us our satisfaction for this time. We think we\nare sure that we have a good teacher.

They have been learning to read by the phonic system, about half of their time is spent in education, teaching...\nwas that if a word was written on the R.R. they could not recognize it. Thus the great change has proved too much for the Indians in which the children to be given their books. An Indian named Mr. Mowat came to the school last Thursday morning and commenced abusing me for not teaching like his former teachers. The children he said are taught nothing only what is written on the R.R.\n\nThen the names of objects around them, the names of the different parts of their bodies, then from pictures, and Lastly to form phrases and sentences. Previously the Indians have employed as teachers half-breeds who can read and write, but who have never received any training to prepare them as teachers. The children were given their readers T.H. and F. and allowed to memorize the lessons, the result\nThey are not allowed to use their books and consequently the parents he said are going to keep their children at home. When school was opened in August the children could not speak one word in English, nor tell you such a word as cat or an if written on the blackboard. While the Inspector who visited my school about a month ago can confirm this. Ask Mr. Henderson etc., who visited the school in June, about the\nprogress of the children in the English language. He will tell me as Mr. Steele told me that the children could not be persuaded to buy our word, yet many of those children had attended school for three years. The teachers whom you are employing in your Indian schools, and to whom you have been paying salaries for years, are untrained, and ignorant of the first principles of teaching. The money which has been paid out for\nI met a few days ago a man who was on his way to take charge of an Indian school, that man who keeps the store here had previously earned his living by mending shoes, and thinks he can fill both positions now. A gentleman who is teaching in an Indian school not very far from here, was one day teaching the children the multiplication table of seven. It was written on the B.B. and he and the pupils were repeating it.\n\nThe education of the children of this school has been thrown away. The gentleman who keeps the store here will tell you that previously when coming to buy anything they could not be forced to ask for an article in English, now most of the children can talk quite well.\n\nA missionary who has just returned from visiting his Indian missions was telling me last night that scarcely one of the teachers has any qualifications to teach.\nhappened to be shading seven times seven; consequently they all kept repeating seven times seven are fifty-four, until he turned round and discovered that $7 \\times 7 = 49$. Many other instances may be quoted, such as the teachers to whom you are paying salaries. Of course the salaries paid are too low for qualified teachers, but if you give the matter due consideration I think you must come to the conclusion that it would\nas the Indian children are much harder to teach than the White. I am delighted to see the progress made by the children from day to day and the greater regularity in attendance. We have now twenty-two names on Register. But my qualifications entitle me to a much higher salary, and if I can secure a better position at Xmas I shall accept it. You are paying the same salary to a teacher who has never attended a training school, as you.\nIt much better to employ only one half the number of qualified and energetic teachers. This could be done by doubling the present salaries. Then we could hope that the Indians would in time improve their condition. But so long as the present state of affairs exist, the Indians' annuity might better be increased by the salaries which are now being paid to the teachers.\n\nHigher salaries should be given to such schools.\nas the Indian children are much harder to teach than the Whites.

You are paying the same salary to a teacher who has never attended a training school, again.\nare to one holding a formal School Certificate.\n\nI hope that you will consider the matter also write a letter to Mr. Neawasiga explaining to the Indians the superiority of the present instruction, as they have the idea that their children can learn nothing without their books.\n\nI am, Sir, with much respect,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.

The Department is of opinion that if you used your influence with the parents, advising them of the benefits to be derived from the educational advantages offered and urging them to send their children with regularity, a better attendance would be obtained.

I was in hopes that after teaching so long teachers might receive a pension or a gratuity. The first ten years I was not able to save, as the salary was small, and it was so expensive to live west at Nepigon.\n\nPermit me in tendering my resignation to thank the Department for all courtesies received, all three years.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJessie H. MacKay.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nMrs. Jessie H. Mackay, who has been in the employ of the Department for the past twenty years as an Indian school teacher, has resigned her position as teacher of the Serpent River Indian School. I would, therefore, recommend that, in view of her long and faithful service, the Department allow her a full quarter's salary ($100.00). It is most likely that this school will be closed, as any of the Indians who remain at Serpent River can send their children to the Spanish River Industrial School. The mill at Serpent River, which afforded employment for the Indians, has closed down and most of them have to seek employment elsewhere.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, July 8, 1914.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Mrs. J.

Father Rensud reports that there are 26 children of school age in Outler and asks that the school be re-opened. This is in Mr. Hagan's agency, but he knows nothing of the conditions there, as it is 53 miles west of Thessalon where he lives. If there are a sufficient number of children permanently on the reserve the school should be re-opened after the New Year. A teacher could be had, as there is accommodation for one in the school-house.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cause of the fire is unknown to me as it first broke out in the front wall, but I can only believe that the rats must have carried matches and started it, as the stoves and pipes were 16 ft. removed from where the blaze was first discovered and there had been no fresh fires made for 2 hours previous.\n\nI had just left there a few minutes before to come to Cutler and while here was informed that it was burning. I received such a shock that it was a few minutes before I could hurry to the scene.\n\nWhen I arrived, the Indians had broken the door and were at work moving furniture, my personal belongings, etc., They had found it impossible to quench the fire as it was running along the dry pine boards.\n\nIn a very few minutes a large number of people were there and succeeded in saving everything except the bare building. They even removed window frames without breaking the glass, took off doors and moved both stoves and stove pipes.\nI phoned Mr. Agent Hagan and found him quarantined on account of Influenza, so he asked me to give you a detailed description of the fire.\n\nWe stored the bed, my desk, and books in the church but there was no room for other furniture there, so it is outside without any covering so far.\n\nI am going out today to see if I can find some place to store it till you advise what will be done about re-building school or building a small shed to store the furniture in; as I am sure that if we do secure a place it will be only temporary.\n\nActing on Mr. Hagan's advice I closed school Oct. 22nd as quite a number of my pupils were suffering from Influenza and there are quite a few cases at present, but not as many deaths as in the neighboring Indian towns. Dr. Robb thinks it will be almost a month before we could resume class work. I am sorry to say that all the deaths were a result of scorning Dr. Robb's advice as to medicine, nursing, etc.\n\nOn account of an impending nervous break-down I had decided, before the fire, to ask you to accept my resignation at the completion of this quarter and had a letter written to this effect yesterday and was on my way to the Post Office with it when I heard that the school was burning. So I decided to wait and report on the fire and tender my resignation at the same time.\n11/6/18\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nSheet #3\n\nI take this opportunity of thanking the Department for the many favors granted me and the courteous attention given to every request made during my stay in Kenabutch.\n\nPlease advise at your very earliest what we will do as regards getting a building for store-house and also if we will try and arrange any way for holding class after this epidemic has passed over.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\nOttawa, November 9, 1918.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant informing the Department that, during your absence at Cutler on the 5th instant, the Serpent River School was burnt and stating that everything was saved except the building and that the bed, your desk and books have been stored in the church, but there was no room for the other furniture there and that this is outside without any covering.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there should be vacant buildings in Cutler where this furniture could be stored. You will be good enough to make further inquiries and make the best arrangements possible for storing this furniture. The Department will be prepared to pay a small amount for the care of it.\n\nYour resignation as teacher of this school is accepted, to take effect at the end of the current quarter.

But, in this place, there is no private boarding house where I could stay, or would stay, and as for doing as Miss Gallagher did it is impossible as there is no room in the present building.\n\nI am paying $1.00 per day for board, and from now on it will be increased to nine dollars per week. You know, Mr. Sutherland, on my present salary it is impossible...\nto pay such a board bill. I would rather an increase in salary to twenty dollars or that much paid on my board bill.\n\nAnother thing is, I had to buy a pair of rubber boots in order to come through the woods as they are now. They were $3.45 in the store here and I do not think I should have to pay for them myself. And also, my room at the boarding house is hardly cold, but I cannot make any complaint to the company, as those rooms are just for their employees and most of them have stories. I need a little coal oil stove to heat mine, and I think the Department should furnish same, and the oil that would be used in it.\n\nI think this is very little considering all things Miss Gallagher had all the furniture and housekeeping affairs arranged and by living as she did, will do so much cheaper than I can do now. All these things are true now being in no case, and I don't think it is fair that I should be under such expense and embarrassment. I may justly say, by staying in the boarding house.\nI have signed my classification card regarding the bonus, but have heard nothing more about it.\n\nMr. Lutheland, I trust the Department will give this letter its consideration and arrange those matters satisfactorily as soon as possible.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOct. 13, 1919.\nOttawa, October 14, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the requisition for the articles required by you has been sent to the Government Stationery Office. A requisition was also received sometime ago and the Stationery Office has been requested to have on the articles on that list sent as soon as possible. It is hoped that you will receive this stationery in a short time.\n\nWith reference to your request that the Department increase your salary, as the boarding house in Outler where you are staying has increased your board, I beg to say that the Department is now paying you a salary at the rate of $600.00 per year. You will also be entitled to receive a bonus, which will be paid you from May 1st last, the date on which you began duties. This bonus is at the rate of $150.00 per annum for the present fiscal year, ending March 31st, next, and you will receive the proportion due from the first of May. The salary and bonus combined will make an amount in excess of any salary paid to former teachers of the Serpent River School. In view of this bonus being paid, the Department cannot grant an increase in salary, and it is thought that you will be able to provide the oil stove which you require and the rubber boots at your own expense. It is expected that a cheque for the bonus to September 30th will be sent you very shortly.\n\nIt is regretted that the accommodation which you have\n\nMiss Cecilia Brennan,\nTeacher,\nSerpent River Indian Schools,\nOutler, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is at present receiving $600.00 per annum and bonus at the rate of $150.00.\n\nMiss Brennan has a Quebec Elementary certificate. The enrolment is 25 with an average attendance of 17. Separate School Inspector Bennett states that she is capable, earnest and devoted to her work, also that owing to the scarcity of a suitable boarding place she is now paying $36.00 per month for board and room. He states that the management of the school is satisfactory to him.\n\nMiss Brennan will complete her second year as teacher of this school in June next. Her salary is payable from band funds and I would recommend that she be allowed a small increase of say $50.00, from April 1st, next.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Sutherland\nSir,\n\nI am taking the liberty to address you on behalf of a friend. Our teacher at Kenabosch Reserve, I beg to say that Miss Celia Brennan taught every day. She taught during the Easter Holidays so, as she thought, she could get away a few days sooner at the Summer Holidays but she cannot get away until she pays her board bill and she has no money to pay it with. The lady has no money only as she earns it and it would be nice if the Department could see its way clear enough to advance her enough money to pay her indebtedness and I am sure she would be grateful if I had the money to spare I would lend it to her but I am not burdened with money. She is a successful teacher and I would like to have her come back. I hope you will not think me impatient in this matter as I sympathize with the little girl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSamuel Rayner\nIndian Agent\nThessalon\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Brennan in the past frequently asked for an advance and she was informed of the exception made thereto by the Auditor. She should endeavour to arrange her financial affairs in order that it will not be necessary for her to ask for an advance, except a very strong reason is given for making the request.\n\nMiss Brennan should prepare her quarterly return as soon as the school closes for the summer holidays and forward it to you for transmission to the Department in order that the balance of salary due her may be paid.

A.\nINSPECTOR OF SEPARATE SCHOOLS, 47 BROWNING AVE.,\nTORONTO, Ont. Dated April 27, 1922.\n\nOriginal on File #32-2-6.\n\nSERPENT RIVER INDIAN DAY SCHOOL:\n\nMiss McAndrew, the teacher is very capable and earnest. It would be fine for the Indian schools if such was always the case. On enquiry, I find that this teacher will hardly remain; chief reason is the condition of boarding facilities in Cutler. Beyond a doubt, if a teacher's residence was here, it would be an inducement to remain. Maybe this teacher could be engaged as principal of Garden River Indian School. I would recommend this, for the following reasons:\n\n1. A strong principal is needed there.\n2. Children would attend better.\n3. Standard of proficiency would be raised.\n\nHowever, a residence should be built at Cutler or rather at Kensbutph? It would aid in retaining the services of a good teacher, like Miss McAndrew.\nOTTAWA, May 5th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Serpent River Indian Day School, states that the present teacher, Miss McAndrew, who is very capable and performing good work, intends to give up duties at the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th, next. Her reason for resigning is on account of boarding facilities at Gutler, and the cost of board paid by her. The Inspector recommends that strong inducements be offered to Miss McAndrew to remain.\n\nIt is thought that it might be possible to arrange for the rental of a house from an Indian on the Reserve near the school, which could be fitted up, and a moderate supply of equipment provided, for the teacher. Kindly make enquiry into this matter and ascertain if a house could be secured and the rental that would be charged. If a house can be obtained, it should be rented from the last of September, next, and we could have a few supplies installed, sufficient to make it comfortable for the teacher, before the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nI will be pleased to have your views regarding the above suggestions, or as to what other arrangement could be made for providing accommodation for a teacher. It is hoped that, if this can be satisfactorily arranged, Miss McAndrew will decide to remain.\n\nI may say that we have no funds available from which to erect a residence for a teacher at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find school report for Kenaheteh School, Cutler, Ont.\n\nThe teacher, Miss McAndrews, has not made up her mind as yet what she is teaching another year. I explained to her the contents of your letter of May 1st and my next visit she will decide.\n\nThere is a house very close to the school at present occupied by Mr. Bleek, which we might obtain. Mr. Bleek is not well so have asked the doctor to give me a report on his condition. It would done at night be a hospital case for his eye is very bad and maybe could arrange for her to live with her nephew. I sent the house for the teacher will report if no person can be arranged.\n\nDept. Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour student servant\n\nB.

Besides, as the Indians live close to the school a janitor could always be found.\n\nHoping the Department will grant my request and favour me with an early reply.\n\nI am, Mr. McLean,\nMost respectfully Yours,\nJean M. Demotte.\nOttawa, June 18, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, applying for a transfer from your present position as teacher of the Mississauga to the Serpent River Indian Day School for the next school year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Rothera informed the Department that you had made a similar request to him. He was advised that the Department had no objection to your transfer at the same salary as you are at present receiving, viz.: $650 per annum supplemented by any bonus that may be provided by law. You should take this matter up with the agent, and, if he concurs in your transfer, the Department will approve of the same. The agent will, no doubt, inform us definitely as to whether your transfer has been arranged or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Jean McDermott,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nBlind River, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Letter of June 11, 1924, re transfer of Miss M.

The salary allowed will be at the rate of $650 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law, payment to be based on ten teaching months in the year.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss McDermott that approval has been granted for her transfer and arrange with her to be at the Serpent River School in time to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, on or about September 2nd, next.\n\nThe Department learns from Miss McAndrew, the former teacher at Serpent River, that it may be difficult to obtain living accommodation in Cutler as the boarding house is being closed. It is hoped that Miss McDermott will be able to arrange for her living accommodation and board.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWhile at Cutler the other day made inquiries re obtaining about 6 more seats for the Kenabutoch school.\n\nThe Manager of the mill at Cutler told me that owing to the mill being burnt down there will not be many attending the Ruthe school so he thought that we could obtain 6 seats from the Trustees reasonably. I asked him to let me know the price but to date have not heard. We are in need of the seats just now & would be a good chance to obtain same.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nSee Dept of Indian Affairs Officer\nOttawa, November 4, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, informing the Department that you can arrange with the authorities of the public school at Cutler to obtain 6 desks for the use of the Serpent River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that there is need for this number of desks at the Serpent River School. If you can obtain these desks from the public school authorities at a reasonable cost, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of the same. You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the amount to be paid for these desks. Please state on the voucher in whose favour the cheque in payment for the desks is to be drawn and the address to which it should be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

If she intends to give up duties she should forward her resignation in time for the Department to arrange for the services of a successor. We hope, however, that Miss McDermott will reconsider the matter and that she will be able to arrange for living accommodation and remain for the balance of the school year ending June 30, next. It is hoped that it will be possible to arrange with an Indian family near the school to provide board and accommodation for Miss McDermott, and I shall be pleased if you will endeavour to arrange for same. Please inform the Department not later than the middle of December, next, whether Miss McDermott will remain or not, and also what arrangements have been made for boarding accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is noted that the teacher is at present sleeping in the classroom and that she will be satisfied to do so until the Christmas holidays.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether it would be possible to obtain the small cottage near the school referred to by you. If it is possible to rent this building at a reasonable rate, and if you consider it satisfactory, it would solve the problem for sometime of providing suitable living accommodation. Please inform the Department as soon as you can get in touch with the owner as to whether he will rent this building. You should state the rent that would be charged and the period for which he would agree to lease the same. Please also state whether there are any furnishings on hand which were supplied for the use of the teacher's residence in the fall of 1922 that could be utilized in this building. If it is impossible to obtain the house mentioned by you, the question of building an addition to the school building to be used as a teacher's residence will receive consideration, but it would not be possible to undertake the work until next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

August 3rd, 1925.\n\nThe Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRegarding the Serpent River Day School. On June 8th, Mr. Rothera, Indian Agent, advised me by letter that he had rented a cottage in Cutler, quite a distance from the School, for teacher's use for the year beginning September 1st, 1925. I wrote him on June 12th, that owing to long distance of Cottage from the School I had better again ask the Department for a transfer. As I have had no reply to said letter, may I trouble you to advise the Department's decision whether a change has been given me, or if I am to return to Kenabutch September 1st.\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\nJean M. Dermott\n\nAddress\nBox 1387,\nSudbury, Ont.\nOttawa, August 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a letter dated the 3rd instant, Miss Jean McDermott asked the Department if she is to return to the Serpent River School on September first. She states that, when you advised her that you had rented a cottage for the use of the teacher, she requested you to apply to the Department for a transfer to some other school. In your letter of July 16th, last, you stated that Miss McDermott had forwarded her resignation. Apparently she was only desiring a transfer, but we are not re-appointing her until a further report is received from you.\n\nWith reference to a residence for the teacher at this school, the Department was not aware, until the receipt of Miss McDermott's letter, that you had arranged to secure a cottage in Cutler. An official of the Department expects to go to Spanish next week and it is the intention for him to arrange to meet you in Cutler and give consideration to the question of securing proper quarters for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I note that your letter states that she has resigned. Please refer to the first paragraph of my letter of the 6th instant in this connection and let me have a recommendation. There is no vacancy to which Miss McDermott could be transferred, but the Department is willing to re-appoint her at Serpent River unless you report to the contrary. Please give me an immediate answer in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. F. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to letter of Aug 10th 1925, Miss M. Bennett, the teacher of the Indian school at Kennebunk on the Seiput River Reserve, told me she would have to resign owing to ill health and not being able to walk from Cutler to Kennebunk a distance of one mile. I took her before the Department and inquired for a housekeeper another school where there would not be any walking to do.\n\nI saw the manager of the Company who owns the house at Cutler and we inspected same and was promised a cottage if other arrangement could not be obtained. I also saw Mr. Bell partner of the lumber company and he told me that he would see if arrangements could be made for some person to take the public school teacher and the Indian school teacher. This conversation was last week and am expecting these from them any day now.\n\nIf Miss M. Bennett is willing to take the school again she will have the work as before and quite willing that she be given the school again but if she is unable to walk the distance during the winter or autumn months, would recommend a younger person.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Chief's family is one and his brother the other. The school is in the centre of the Reserve and believe that the attendance will be alright when the road is completed and the camp broken up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Would recommend that this be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I beg to say that the Sagamook School will not be ready by September 1st.\n\nMiss Bush has been in our employ for many years, and the School Inspector has always reported favourably regarding her services. The Department is, therefore, not prepared to dismiss her from the Serpent River School, and she should begin duties on September 1st, next.\n\nWhen the Sagamook School is built, further consideration will be given to the advisability of transferring Miss Bush to that school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nOttawa, May 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is an extract from Inspector Greening's report regarding his visit to the Serpent River Indian Day School on the 7th ultimo:\n\n\"While I was in the district, certain representations were made to me in regard to this school.\n\nIt would appear, (and I am quoting entirely from hearsay), that Miss Bush has formed some connection with a resident of Blind River, and has a habit of proceeding to Blind River, on week-ends, to visit him. He, for his part, reciprocates occasionally by coming up to Cutler to visit the teacher.\n\nThe relations are most likely purely platonic, but some of the Indians place a less charitable construction upon the matter, complaining that the example presented to their children is not of the best, and, as a result, petitioned the Department for a change of teachers - the Department can readily check the accuracy of this latter statement. Moreover, the affair forms a succulent morsel for conversation along the line.\n\nI am not, personally, very prone towards taking such notice of neighbourhood scandal, but, in this case, there are two points bearing upon the efficiency of the Indian school system: (1) If the situation is as stated, is the teacher showing just the example desired in Indian schools? and (2) What effect is being made upon public opinion in regard to such schools?\n\nC. Rothera, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThessalon, Ont.\nWere it not for these two points, (and this is not the first time that they have been called to my attention), I should not be inclined to interfere with any individual's personal affairs. As it is, I am merely reporting that such representations have been made in order that the Department may make such enquiries, (if any), upon its own account as may be deemed worth while.\n\nI should merely like to say that, in my opinion, Miss Bush, in a situation where the counter-attractions are not too strong, is capable of doing really efficient work with Indian children, and it might be a good plan to exchange her with a teacher more remote from Blind River.\n\nPlease report fully regarding the Inspector's remarks and state whether or not you are aware if there is any truth in the remarks that the Inspector has heard.\n\nWould you consider it advisable to transfer Miss Bush to the Sagamock School and send Miss Kelly to Serpent River after the holidays, or do you believe it would be in the best interests of the work to dispense with the services of Miss Bush?\n\nThe Department would appreciate an early reply in which you should state your views as fully as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nCuller Ont May 12/36\n\nMr Chas Rothera\nTheescalon\nOnt\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI am writing you in regard to our conversation a few weeks ago also what I wrote you during the winter about. That lie about some false reports some around here is spreading about my conduct. I don't know who it is, but would like awfully well to know, as perhaps you may have heard something.\n\nI wonder if they can come forward and prove other statements which I think they should be made do in order to protect the teacher.\n\nI have a friend belonging to a respectable family with whom I have been keeping company for about three years that used to come down occasionally to visit me for a few hours. That's what the talk is about. They say it is giving scandal to the Indians, but I can't see where else I could talk to anyone. These people must be very devil minded. When they are so ready to see the evil side of everything, I can truthfully say they have no reason whatever to talk. As you know I am just young girl, and go out very\nLast September Rev. Mr. Dwyer approached me and said this was giving scandal and I couldn't have my company coming here. He himself came in to visit for a couple of hours.\n\nI am glad when someone comes in to talk of an evening, as I'm alone all the time.\n\nHe wasn't pleased at my returning last year, as I understand he wanted Miss Burns here. He sent her down home to see me last summer she asked me to go to Sagamok as she wanted to come here. I believe they had been in the Dept before that\u2014 I don't see why it should make any difference to him who's here?\n\nI am doing my work, and any extra work he wants me to do\u2014\n\nBut, I don't know who is doing the talking, am just telling you this so now I wish you would look into this for me, as I need my school, and talk like that should not be let continue.\n\nTrusting to receive a reply.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA. Bush\nDear Sir;\n\nIn regards to Miss Bush teacher at Cutler, spoke to her some time ago re reports that a certain gentleman from Blind River was going to the reserve to see her at the cottage. She said she was keeping company with him, and she on week ends had been invited to Blind River, and was very glad to have the opportunity of being able to go some place for a change. Miss Bush is not a young girl and have found her to be a respectable person and cannot think otherwise. She is living at Cutler and her house is the only place she could receive her friends and those that are doing the talking about her am sure have nothing to prove that she has misbehaved in any way.

However, my certificate is out of date (Third Class, 1915) and am allowed only a temporary permit where a fully qualified teacher is not obtainable. I am a widow, a Catholic, 45 years of age. My only son is a flying instructor here in Canada. Incidentally, he feels I am sort of 'going out of my way' (and his) to teach in the north, so I would still have to convince him!

I wish to submit my application for this position.\n\nI am a Roman Catholic child, nineteen years of age on March the twenty-sixth. At present, I am completing my Middle School course by repeating two subjects: Latin, Physics, and I have also begun Upper School.\n\nIf, however, you will grant me this position, I shall delay my personal studies for a time in order to take advantage of the opportunity of acquiring practical experience in teaching. I also wish to attend Normal School next year. I have already taught at St. Joseph's school here in Blind River, i.e., taking a sick teacher's place. For reference, you may write to Rev. Sister\nMarie Arthur, principal of St. Joseph's School.\n\nHoping to receive a favourable reply at your earliest convenience,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely Yours,\nPaul Berthelot\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYou will please find enclosed herewith for your consideration application for position as teacher of the Serpent River Indian Day School which was forwarded to this office by Paul Berthelot, Blind River, Ontario.\n\nLast year Berthelot made application for the vacancy in the Mississauga Indian Day School which was approved by Departmental letter 36-1-1 dated February 17th and then cancelled by telegram dated February 19th, 1944.\n\nR.

He should begin duties immediately and forward the usual forms.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF W. J. GREENING, School Inspector, following his inspection of the Serpent River Indian Day School, dated March 23, 1945.\n\nI now venture to recommend that Miss Robicheau be offered the Serpent River School at Cutler. I spoke to her when I was at Batchawana, and she agreed that she would like the school. Even at that, I was a little late. Mr. Agent Laurence had already been consulting her about taking the Serpent River School. The Indian Schools Branch may therefore be assured that both the Agent and the Inspector strongly favour the appointment.\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen I sent in my application in January for this teaching position, I stated that I was willing to sacrifice my fifth form subjects but not my fourth form subjects. They are \"Latin and Physics\" which I have been taking by myself and with the help of our High School principal in Blind River up till now. I find it impossible to be able to keep it up especially now and in the month of June. I have examination papers to prepare and correct for eight grades. I have plenty of work to do since the pupils are so far behind. This is my third year repeating in \"Latin\" and my second year repeating in \"Physics\". Is it possible to secure educational credits in those two subjects? I would be very grateful because it is my intention of attending Normal School next year. A speedy reply would enable me to decide upon my future.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nPaul Berthelot\nTeacher.\n\nP.S. For reference you may write to Rev.

Their offices are in Toronto. This Branch does not issue teaching certificates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Paul Berthelot,\nTeacher,\nSerpent River Indian Day School,\nCutler, Ont.\nOttawa, June 30, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Serpent River Indian Day School,\nNo. 427.\n\nPlease note that Mr. Paul Berthelot will not be returning to the above-noted school for the coming academic year.

You may say: \"That is vital above work.\" Well, so is teaching; since so many teachers are wanted today. The demand for them is very great.\n\nI deduct from all this, that you could at least try to intercede by the Department of Education for me. If you insist to the department that you really need me and that almost complete my year and June is the hardest month, I think my point is clear and reasonable and would consider it as a favour. Please make a quick move answering because I cannot afford to lose any more time. It is of no use studying now since I have too many things in my head at present.\nI am but nineteen years of age and wished to get somewhere.\n\nIf the Department of Education refuses to grant me credits, I will be obliged to quit my job at the earliest date possible. After all, my future comes before anything else.\n\nYou could very well explain to the Dept. that it is my intention of going to Normal School next year. The Dept. could write to my principal for my standing in school.\n\nHoping that you will take quick action in this matter,\n\nThanking you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\nPaul Berthelot.\nOttawa, June 11, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of May 30.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nSerpent River Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 7-39-9 (13) of April 12 -\n\nThe contents of your letter and attached resolution of the Chief and Council of the Serpent River Band have been noted. We have also placed Miss Robicheau's name on our list of teachers for whom a transfer might be considered this summer.\n\nHowever, we will not give this matter high priority in view of your statement that the majority of the parents are apparently quite satisfied with Miss Robicheau. After my inspection of this school, I felt that Miss Robicheau could be better employed as the junior teacher in a two-room school. It is quite evident that her interest lies in these junior pupils and that the senior pupils, while not neglected, are not receiving a sound education. While they are strong in spelling and arithmetic, they seem to be weak in language, literature and composition. We will carefully consider the next Inspector's report upon Miss Robicheau and will write you further at that time.\n\nBernard F.

For the September quarter the Department follows the practice of paying for the actual number of days taught. In your case you taught 20 days in the September quarter, and you were paid $70.00 of your yearly salary of $700, or $70.00. For the December and March quarters teachers are usually paid one-quarter of their yearly salary for each quarter. This was done in your case, and payment of $175.00 was made for each quarter.\n\nIf you continue in charge of this school until the end of the current quarter, viz: June 30th, next, the amount necessary to make up your full yearly salary will be paid. In your case, the amount due you, and which will be paid on the receipt of your June quarter return, is $280.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I sent the former teacher, Mr. Smith, down there and there was no place to hold school, and the priest-in-charge will not open the church; rather than let the teacher go, I rented a house for one month until I could hear from you about the schoolhouse which they said to build. The whole band are unanimous in wishing to build a schoolhouse and it was unanimously decided and unanimously they would do the work of building if the chief would buy the material out of his funds. Lumber is very high and it would cost about two hundred dollars or perhaps a little more. Please let me know if done right in renting a house for school purposes I agreed to pay four dollars per month.

I notified Miss Moran herself that she kept this school part month and May, but not come back since. I had to send some body else to take her place.\n\nWhile I was at Butten, the Indians told me that orders had come from Ottawa to build a school house and another house for the teacher. May I respectfully suggest that it would be less expensive and quite as comfortable to the teacher, if one same building contained a room large enough for class purposes, and two smaller ones for the teacher, with a shed for wood.\n\nThe chief is not now at Butten. Besides, I do not think that he or any other Indians of that reserve could properly do work. It would be better that Mr. Agent Sam Hogan give the contract to some reliable men among the white people of Butten or Thessalon.\n\nRemain dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord\n\nJ. Q.
