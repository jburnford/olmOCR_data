As this is closer to Cornwall and has good transportation facilities, we decided to advise you of this vacancy also, in the event that it would suit your requirements better than the Chenail School.\n\nOur new salary schedule has been approved and we can now offer you a higher rate than previously. If you wish details concerning the Cornwall Island School, I would suggest that you write directly to Mr. Bonnah.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss M.B.

These children not only graded well in the achievement tests which I administered but their deportment and bearing is a great credit upon the work done there by the Sisters of St. Ann.\n\nI took an opportunity of having these Sisters visit the new two room school with attached teacher's quarters which has just been completed on the Chenail section of the St. Regis Agency. I will say no more except that I feel that these teachers were impressed with the very modern building which we have erected.\n\nI feel that it would be to the benefit of the Church, the Indians and the Department if we could persuade the Sisters of St. Ann to assume the responsibility of teaching the children in the area served by this new school. We would have approached you long ago with this proposal but have hesitated because we could not offer your Sisters the Daily Mass required by your Order.\nWe would be glad to offer one large basement room for conversion as a chapel. I have discussed this matter with Reverend Father Jacobs S.J., and I understand that he will try to personally bring to your attention the advantages which would be yours if the Sisters of St. Ann could accept this new mission field.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary\n\nRe: Cheneil School\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th, file 33-3-1 (E), please be advised that the Mother Provincial visited the new school on Thursday the 15th. I endeavoured to obtain from her something definite but was unable to do so. She advised me, however, she would notify you within a few days.\n\nMy personal opinion is that they would much rather take over a year from now when they would have an opportunity of getting everything prepared. However, we should keep in mind that if the Sisters of Service or St. Martha are available in a year from now, it would seem more advisable to accept their services. I would suggest that if you do not receive a definite commitment from the Sisters by the time you receive this letter, arrange to hire Miss Comeau and stall the Sisters off until the fall of 1949. In the meantime, we might get favourable news from the Sisters of Service.\n\nT. L. Hannah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nCampbellton, N.B.,\nMay 11, 1948\n\nMr. Bernard J.

I do hope that you will be able to reach a favourable decision by the 1949-50 academic year.\n\nI still feel that it would be to the benefit of all concerned if the Sisters of Saint Ann could assume the responsibility of teaching the children in the area served by this new school. Even though we have had to abandon our plans for this step for the 1948-49 year, I earnestly hope that we can make suitable arrangements with you for next year.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

We then confidently rely on you to supply the needs of our sisters, both temporal and spiritual, and to render such conditions of life acceptable to them so that their work be of benefit to all concerned.\n\nIn closing, I wish to thank you for the laudatory remarks you wrote regarding the work done by our sisters at the Saint Regis Village School.\n\nHoping that this new state of affairs will turn to the satisfaction of all parties concerned, I remain\n\nVery devotedly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperior General\nSisters of Saint Ann\nGeneral Administration\nLachine, Que.\n\nJuly 29, 1948.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur letters of recent date regarding the Chemail Indian Day School crossed on their way as yours was received just as mine had been mailed to you.\n\nI understand that our acceptance to staff the Chemail School for the coming academic year as stated in my letter of July 23 is cancelled by the fact that you have already hired two lay teachers. As you reiterate your request for our services, I wish to say that our decision to cooperate with the Department of Indian Affairs in the sublime work of Education among the Indians is not revoked, and we shall be most happy to assume the responsibility of teaching the Indian children of the Chemail area for the 1949-50 academic year.\n\nThe two sisters for the Chemail School had already been appointed but they have now assumed duties elsewhere, and I am glad that a year's postponement is afforded us as the lack of subjects in our Community obliges us in many cases to limit our activities.\n\nWishing you success in all your undertakings, I remain\n\nVery devotedly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperior General\nChenail Indian Day School.\n\nReverend Mother General:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 29 and sincerely regret that we were forced to take action in hiring two lay teachers before the receipt of your previous letter of July 27.\n\nHowever, we will regard your offer of two teachers for the 1949-50 academic year as a definite commitment.\n\nWe will make arrangements to transfer the two lay teachers elsewhere and will be very pleased to hand over the responsibility of teaching these Indian children to the Sisters of St. Ann on the first of September, 1949.\n\nI am glad to hear that you have been able to assign elsewhere the two Sisters whom you intended to appoint to the Chenail School. I only hope that this year's postponement of our plans will not delay the educational advancement of these Indians.\n\nI look forward to an opportunity of visiting you at Lachine in the near future and of discussing with you the situation both at St. Regis and at Caughnawaga.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

It would be appreciated if this matter could be attended to immediately as it is very difficult to keep harmonious relations these days with conditions like that existing. It must be kept in mind that we have to work a month before getting any pay and, with the cost of living as high as it is today, unless an independent income exists, the salary cheque is generally required to keep one eating.\n\nYour early attention to the above would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

In the absence of definite information, I have requested Sister Zita some time ago to take up with her superior the question of the Chenail School. I have now received a letter from the Provincial Superior. When the Superior was at St. Regis last Fall, this matter was discussed and it seemed that unless the Sisters could have Mass in the Chenail every morning, they would not be able to stay there. The suggestion was made by the Superior that they should live at St. Regis and be driven to and from their work as is done in some of the rural schools at Dorion, Saraguay and St. Jerome. At the same time, an arrangement would be worked out whereby the girls from the Village could be taken to the Chenail to participate in the Sewing and Cooking classes. To do this, however, I should imagine, would require a station wagon.\n\nI had suggested to the Superior that it would be a good thing if it were possible for the Sisters to take an interest in the younger women after school hours. In her letter, the Superior suggests the appointment of a Principal who, together with the two teachers employed in the Village and two in the Chenail, would mean five teaching Sisters staying at the Residence in the Village.\nThe Superior suggests that a Principal would be in a position to help the other Sisters by coaching backward pupils and also teaching Sewing and Cooking as well as organizing sewing groups among the younger women in the Village.\n\nI do not know what the policy of your office is concerning the transportation requested by the Superior but I should like to add, however, that I have made no commitments whatsoever to the Sisters in this regard. Whether or not the sewage disposal system at the Village will accommodate additional Sisters, I do not know. The lot is so small that there is hardly room to get a truck in to bring in the fuel and, of course, the disposal bed had to be cut to a minimum.\n\nAs it would seem there are many things to be straightened out yet, I believe it would be advisable to have a definite understanding before we think about placing any of our other teachers.

Neary\n\nDuring our recent telephone conversation, you will recall the differences which have arisen between Miss Comeau and Miss Francis of the Chenail School was discussed. At the close of the school term, the teachers concerned do not appear to have made any reconciliation. Prior to school closing, this matter was discussed with each teacher with a view to having them mend their dispute. It was pointed out that disputes between teachers would eventually have a detrimental effect upon children and we were not in a position to condone a situation of that nature. A few days before school closed, the matter was again discussed with Miss Comeau and she stated that while she would like to return to the Chenail School she doubted very much if she would if the same arrangement existed between her and Miss Francis. In other words, if Miss Francis teaches at that school next year, Miss Comeau will likely not be here. While it is difficult to get at the root of their dispute, information obtained would lead me to believe that the teachers concerned are making a mountain out of a molehill and neither is willing to admit their fault.\n\nAs previously advised, it may be possible that Miss Francis may enter religious life and, if so, perhaps another teacher could be hired to take her place. Whether or not there would be agreement between them is difficult to say.\nKnowing the local circumstances, and in view of our telephone conversation, I approached Miss Chisholm of the Cornwall Island East School to learn if she might be willing to go to the Chenail School if arrangements could be made to employ her sister. I understand the two sisters get along very well together. With an arrangement of this nature, we might then be in a position to put Miss Francis at the Cornwall Island East School. As I previously mentioned to you, I hate to see Miss Chisholm leaving the Cornwall Island East School as she is badly needed there and I know she would like to return. In view of the situation, however, and if matters do not right themselves, Miss Chisholm would go to the Chenail School providing her sister was appointed to that school also. In discussing this situation with Miss Chisholm, I have made no commitments that might alter any plans you have in mind. The matter was merely discussed with her with a view to finding, if possible, a solution in the event that Miss Comeau and Miss Francis could not be reconciled to teaching in the same school. Insofar as the latter two are concerned, both are, in my opinion, good teachers. I do not think, however, that Miss Comeau would be interested in teaching in an eight-grade school and she has expressed that opinion to me already.\n\nYou might let me have your views concerning the above.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nJuly 5, 1949.\n\nMr. T. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 987, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nChenaill Indian Day School.\nCornwall Island East Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 6-1 (33) of June 29\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, it would not be to the advantage of the Department to have Miss Francis and Miss Comeau teach in the same school next year.\n\nI think your suggestion of having the two Misses Chisholm at the Chenaill School is a sound one if Miss Comeau can be persuaded to take the Cornwall Island East School.\n\nIf not, then the new Miss Chisholm and Miss Comeau could handle this school while the other Miss Chisholm could continue at Cornwall Island East.\n\nI suggest you mention this matter to Miss Comeau and ascertain her reaction.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nIn answer to your letter of June 10th, file 306-1(E) and July 5th, file 306-1(E), please be advised that we have been advised by Miss Comeau that it is her intention \"to continue on at Chenail School next year with my former class and with a teacher who would help to keep existing the harmony you mentioned which is essential in any school\".\n\nInsofar as Miss Francis is concerned she advises today she is interested in teaching in the Junior room of the Chenail School. She was very interested to know if Miss Comeau was returning to the Chenail School and received the only answer we are at present in a position to give her.\n\nAfter reviewing all the facts at your disposal you may deem it advisable to go ahead with plans to have Miss Comeau and Miss Chisholm take over the Chenail and Miss Christeen Chisholm at the Cornwall Island East School. Incidentally, Miss Francis was asked if she would be interested in the latter school and she replied in the negative.\n\nIf you deem it advisable, perhaps a position might be offered Miss Francis in another agency. We have had no complaints here as far as her work is concerned.\n\n[Signature]\nA. L. Hannah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nJuly 25, 1949.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 987,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nChenaill Indian Day School\nCornwall Island East Indian Day School\n\nReference your 6-1 (33)\n\nI note from the contents of your letter that both Miss Comeau and Miss Francis are interested in returning to the Chenaill School - but not together.\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have any attractive positions in Ontario which are vacant for Miss Francis just at this time.\n\nPlease speak to her concerning her interest in a school in the Prairie Provinces. We have a real shortage of teachers there, and if she would like to try a school there for a year, I could arrange a transfer at once.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your file 306-1 (E), July 25th, please be advised that I have consulted Miss Francis with regards to accepting a position in the Prairie Provinces. As this, perhaps, came as a surprise to Miss Francis, she was not in a position to reply at the moment but stated she would give me a definite answer in a few days. I doubt, very much, if a position so far from the Reserve would appeal to Miss Francis.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that we can not find a place to open a classroom at the west end of Cornwall Island until we can get another school built in which case we could put Miss Francis in charge of the junior grades.\n\nWhile I have not discussed this matter with Miss Francis, I would like to suggest that, to relieve the situation at the Cornwall Island West School, Miss Kelly be placed in charge of the senior grades teaching a shift from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 noon. Miss Francis could be put in charge of the junior grades and teaching a shift from 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. In this way, I feel quite sure that the children will get much more attention than they are able to get under our present system and it will be a lot easier on the teacher. Present indications are that we would have even a greater attendance at the Cornwall Island West School in September and, with two teachers working on the basis as noted above, I believe we would be in a better position to carry on until a new school can be opened.\n\nYou might advise me concerning the above at an early date.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nMiss Margaret Kelly,\nVenosta, P.Q.\n\nDear Miss Kelly:\n\nAs you are aware, we are planning to erect a new school at Cornwall Island West to provide an extra classroom in addition to the present building. It has been recommended that in order to relieve your present heavy teaching load, we plan to operate two shifts pending the completion of the new building. These shifts would operate as follows:\n\n(a) the senior pupils, under your teaching, from 8.30 a.m. to 12.15 or 12.30 p.m. daily,\n\n(b) the junior pupils, under Miss Francis, from 1.00 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. daily.\n\nI would appreciate your immediate acceptance of the above proposals as I believe the suggestion is in your own best interests as well as that of the pupils of Cornwall Island West.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

There are 30 or 40 children in the vicinity of this schoolhouse who are not attending school simply because they are too far from either of the Indian schools now in operation. The Indians are anxious to have the old school repaired and I would strongly recommend that it be put in order and re-opened the 1st of September next.\n\nThis visit was made at the request of the Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. M. Lean, Esq.\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 3, 1909.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\n\nMr. Agent Long forwards a resolution from the Chiefs of the Cornwall Island band in council, requesting the Department to repair and reopen the Chenail Indian school.\n\nFor many years there was a school in operation there, but it was closed thirteen years ago, chiefly on account of small attendance and in the expectation that Indians who desired to do so would send their children to the school in St. Regis village. This expectation has not been realized and the children from this section of the reserve have ever since then been growing up in ignorance.\n\nIt is not stated in the census return how many children of school age there are in this locality but in the resolution the number is given as between 30 and 40. If this estimate is correct, it seems unfair that they should be deprived of the means of receiving some schooling. It is claimed that the distance is too great for them to possibly go to St. Regis and even if they could do so they would have to cross water, which would endanger the lives of small children. I consider that the application of the Chiefs is worthy of attention and would suggest that someone from the Department should visit the place and make a full report on the situation, which should\nstate definitely the condition of the old building and verify the claims of the Indians for the re-opening of the school.\n\nMr. Public School Inspector Gilman endorses the application and in the meantime the Agent should be advised that full enquiries will be made. If it is decided to reopen the school, it will be done after the summer holidays.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6055, file 306-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:\nAsst. Deputy Supt. General.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 28th ultimo, I went to the Chenail on the St. Regis Reserve. The Indians had requested the Department to repair and re-open the school there, which has been closed for the past thirteen years. There were a number of Indians present to meet me and they all expressed the wish that the Department would give them a school as their children, up to the number of about 35, are growing up in ignorance; there being no school near enough for them to attend.\n\nI consider the request of the Indians should be acceded to as I am satisfied that a school is needed at this point.\n\nThe old school building can be repaired for an outlay of about $200.00. It fronts on the main road and is centrally located for all the Chenail Indians, as well as those living on Yellow Island directly opposite. The building is 16' 8\" X 23' 8\" X 8' 6\" inside measurement, and is 18' at the gables and 10' at the sides outside.\n\nThe following repairs require to be made:\n\nA new foundation all round, sunk 3' below the level and 18\" above the ground.\n\nSills repaired, where necessary.\n\nRoof re-shingled. Outside clapboarded over tar-paper.\n\nNew Front Door 2' 9\" X 6' 9\".\nThere are 6 windows 2' 9\" X 3' 10\". New sashes are needed for two of the windows; new stops for the others.\n\nNew floor laid over the old one.\n\nClosets, Coal bins and desks would also be required.\n\nThe frame of the building is in good condition with the exception of a portion of the sills.\n\nOne of the Indians, Mr. Alex. McDonald, of the Chenail offered to do this work for $175.00 but Mr. Agent Long told me that he had neither the material, tools or experience to do the work properly, and he advised me to see a builder in Cornwall. I called on Mr. Smith, the Member, who recommended me to Atchison & Co., Saw Mill Owners and Contractors. I saw Mr. Atchison and he told me that if requested to do so he would give a detailed Estimate, and if he undertook the work would have it completed in time to open the school this Fall. I would suggest that Mr. Atchison be communicated with, as even if the Indians were given the work, the Department would have to go good for the material, and it is doubtful if it would be completed in time or done satisfactorily.\n\nThe Indians expressed themselves as willing to take advantage of the school if re-opened and were willing to have the regulations enforced if necessary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you are aware, they have been absent from duty since the schools re-opened after the Christmas holidays on account of having contracted the itch from the pupils.\n\nBoth these teachers state that if they are supplied with a quantity of antiseptic soap and ointment they will instruct the mothers of the Indian pupils to use the same with a view to eradicating this infectious disease. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange for the purchase and delivery to the teachers of 4 dozen cakes of Parke-Davis antiseptic soap and 4 dozen 4 Oz. jars of sulphur ointment. You can obtain these from some druggist. You should obtain accounts, in duplicate, which please attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department, when payment will be made. Both these teachers have been informed that when these supplies arrive they may arrange to close their schools for one day in order to visit the homes and instruct the mothers in the use of the antiseptics.\n\nYour early attention to the purchase of the above should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I went down to this school, and my opinion is, that it would hardly pay to have the roof patched; the old shingles are pretty well rotted, it should be shingled new.\n\nI also may say, that if the Department intends painting this school and the St. Regis Village School, an Indian, Martin Friday living in the Chenail, would like the job. He is an experienced man in painting and shingling. I also may say, that if this painting was done now, there are no flies to bother.\n\nI Am,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW.C.

Your letter crossed ours of the same date in which you were authorized to arrange to have the roof of this building reshingled.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of the shingles, obtaining competitive prices, if possible, from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should see that a good grade of singles is obtained. You may also purchase the shingle nails required. As requested, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the shingles, etc., and also proper vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the labour in reshingling the roof of the building.\n\nRelative to the painting of this building, I shall be pleased if you will forward an estimate of the cost of the painting and other materials required and also for the labour in having the work done. You should also state whether any painting is required to the interior of the building, and, if so, the cost of the work should be stated.

You should arrange for the purchase of the quantity of paint, brushes and other materials required. You should see that a good grade of paint, etc., is obtained. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained from a number of firms and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price.

I had this clock repaired once before, and I don't consider it worth repairing again. Alarm clocks at schools don't seem to stand long, I expect due to getting knocked on the floor, etc. A wall clock is more satisfactory, and cheapest in the end. A good reliable clock can be purchased for around ten or twelve dollars, and would recommend one purchased for this school.\n\nIf purchase of clock is approved, please authorize me to purchase one. At present Miss. Fitzpatrick is using my timepiece.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 19, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, requesting that a water pail and clock be supplied for the use of the Chenail Indian Day School.\n\nRelative to the clock, I have to say that the type we supply is an alarm clock of the Big Ben make. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase and delivery of one alarm clock of the type mentioned and a galvanized water pail. After you have made the above purchases, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A.

If the order is a small one he is paid 25\u00a2. If a large one 50\u00a2.\n\nIn this case the company, Smith Hardware, omitted noting on a previous account, 50\u00a2 for cartage. The Indian was paid for carting two lots, and which was marked on this particular account.\n\nI may add, that when school supplies are transferred from Cornwall to St. Regis, that there is yet a charge for delivery to the schools. If the school is a long distance from St. Regis, such as Chetlain School or St. Regis Island School, I generally have the supplies delivered for 50\u00a2, or if it is in the fall or early spring, sometimes I am obliged to pay 75\u00a2.\n\nIf I was to hire an Indian to make a trip to Cornwall for school supplies, it would cost $2.00 or more, but by having the cartage done through the mail carrier, Angus Latour, I get it done much cheaper.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. MacGibbon,\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, submitting the report of the St. Regis Council in which the Indians offer to dig a well at the Chennail Indian Day School and guarantee an adequate supply of water, including the stoning, for the sum of $60.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the digging of this well, and it should be at a suitable location near the school. You should employ Indians who are out of work to perform the labour. The Department will allow payment at the rate of $1.50 per day for supplies while they are engaged in the work. It is to be understood, however, that each man employed will do a fair day's work. You should keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, of the labour employed, and these should be signed by the individual labourers and properly certified by you. You should also forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the supplies furnished the men employed. These accounts should show separately the supplies issued to each man. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and that the well is properly stoned. You may purchase and have installed any equipment necessary to complete the well and place it in a good, serviceable condition. If possible, you should keep the cost within the above stated amount, viz., $60. The work in digging and stoning the well should be carried out before the school reopens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nN. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nReferring to your letter of the 20th July last in reference to the digging of a well at Chenail Indian Day School I beg to say that I took this matter up at the Council Meeting on the 8th inst.\n\nYour letter states $1.50 per day for food supplies while engaged in digging the well, but you do not state what daily wage the workmen are to get, unless you expect the work done just for the food supplies supplied.\n\nChief Dick Lazore and Mitchell Lazore, Chenail Indians who are interested in having a well at this school, and who need work, say that they are prepared to commence the well at a daily wage of $1.50 each, or they would dig the well at $2.00 per feet, including the stoning of it.\n\nI think the $2.00 per foot would be the best offer, for if they could not go deep enough to strike water, it would be their own lock out. However either by the day or by the foot should not cost a great deal.\n\nThe Indians say that around Chenail School, that water can be got at a depth of about 20 Ft, but that there is a possibility of striking quick sand. If quick sand was struck at near the finish of the well, this would mean some lumber for boxing purpose. If any lumber would have to be purchased for this purpose, it would be understood that the Department would pay for it.\n\nThis is about the best I can do on this well question.\n\nPlease advise me if you wish this well commenced on either of the above terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the digging of a well at the Chenail Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the $1.50 per day allowed for food supplies while the Indians were engaged to perform the labour in digging the well was in lieu of payment for their work. It is considered that the Indians, instead of obtaining relief supplies, should, when the opportunity is offered, perform labour. The providing of relief supplies for the labour in digging the well is in the nature of payment for their services, and no extra remuneration will be allowed other than the relief supplies to the amount of $1.50 per day. If the Indians refuse to perform the labour in digging the well on these terms, you should strike their names off the relief list and furnish them with no further supplies.\n\nIf any lumber will be required for boxing purposes, you may purchase same from a firm on the list to receive consideration. As instructed in official letter of the 20th ultimo, the well should be properly stoned and a pump and other equipment installed. All costs should be kept as low as possible, and you will see that the Indians engaged do a fair day's work in the digging of the well.\n\nThe account covering the cost of the supplies furnished the Indians who do the work should be forwarded as requested in official letter above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Repairs constitute a few hours of labour and some screw nails. The remainder of the desks that I think the Inspector has reference to are beyond repairs.\n\nI think the most practical way, if it is the desire of the Branch not to expend much money on this school, would be to transfer some of the double desks from the Junior Room of the Village school and purchase new desks to replace the same, thus gradually getting all single desks in this school. To do this we would need two fronts and two backs and twelve single desks No. 4, as manufactured by the Globe Ftr. Co of Waterloo.\n\nWhile it is granted by doing this we would run to some expense we would nevertheless be bringing the Village school up to some measure of uniformity insofar as desks are concerned. At the same time we would be in a position to settle the seating problem at the Chenail school, where all desks are doubles.\n\nI need not impress upon you the desirability, from a teaching standpoint, especially in the Village School, of having the pupils seated singly. I trust you will see fit to treat the enclosed requisition with the greatest of consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Can.\n\nClerk in charge\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAugust 16th, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nSt. Regis Village Indian Day School.\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 12-415\n\nSHIP TO: D.P.

Also supplementary estimate covering approximate cost of construction of school to replace the present Chenail School.\n\nRegarding the condition of the present school in this locality I might say that the possibility of shingling the school at this time will not in any way put the building in an A-I condition as the building itself is beyond repair. It would at least keep a dry roof over the children's heads.\n\nThe question of erecting a new school to replace the present one has been the subject of discussion many times. If by any chance this has been under consideration by your office at this time with the intention of starting construction in 1942 then it would not be good policy to expend money for shingles at this time. However both requisitions are being forwarded with the hope that something will be done in this respect. I would appreciate any comment you might care to make in this respect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Can.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOctober 25, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Chenaill Indian Day School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 10-691\n\nSHIP TO: Mr. D.F.

In regards to this item I would advise that from the accountable advance in the amount of $125.00 which was forwarded to us for labour in connection with shingling of the Village School, we have a balance from this job in the amount of $39.05. This amount will suffice to take care of labour on the Chenail School.\n\nPlease advise by return if it is in order for us to use this balance to pay labour on the Chenail School, or if it would be necessary to return the balance and ask for a new advance for this work. Should we still have a further balance at the close of the work on the Chenail school it could be returned when the work is finished.\n\nYour early reply is awaited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.A.

Repairs to the building are greatly needed as well as the rebuilding of both toilets and coal shed; an amount has been placed in the estimates to be used for school buildings repairs, and I think that there will be sufficient to do the most urgent repairs to this school and possible minor repairs to other schools.\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1942.\n\nEXD\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his recent visit to the St. Regis Agency, Inspector Thibault recommends the erection of two new toilets at the Chenail School. He also states that the shed requires repairs.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $500.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at all the schools in your Agency and, in discussing the need for repairs at the Chenail School, Mr. Thibault considered that if approximately $300.00 were spent at Chenail it could be placed in reasonably good condition. This amount, of course, would include the cost of the two new toilets.\n\nPlease give this matter your immediate consideration and forward a requisition for the material that you require. At the same time you should state if Indian labour can be secured or if it will be necessary to employ white men.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. D.F. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of May 21, concerning repairs required at the Chenail Indian Day School, St. Regis Agency, please find attached requisition covering materials needed to make the necessary repairs as well as the construction of toilets at this school.\n\nMaterials required can be supplied by the firm of Hodgins Lumber Co., of Cornwall Ontario at a price of $196.59. This price covers materials supplied of good quality.\n\nThe labour question has given us some concern as at the present time we have not an Indian on the Reserve capable of doing the work properly. After due consideration the above firm has been approached with a view of supplying the labour as well as materials. A price on the labour has been quoted at $130.00. However this can be reduced to a great extent by us supplying means of transportation for the carpenters from Cornwall to St. Regis via boat, thus reducing cost for bridge toll, passports, etc. A final price arrived for the labour supplied by Hodgins is $95.00 which along with $196.59 for materials gives a total cost for the job by this firm for the amount of $291.59. This price of course does not cover the labour cost of any painting involved but on that item Indian labour can be hired. Some stone will be required for foundation repairs but this item should not exceed $10.00, total cost involved.\n\nIn view of the circumstances involved I would strongly recommend that the above firm be permitted to go ahead with the work without delay as we feel confident that not only will good quality materials be supplied but good workmanship performed as well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nIndian Agent.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nChenail Indian Day School, St. Regis Agency\n\nVOTE...76 Allotment...10-691\n\nSHIP TO...D.F.

At this writing there seems little hope that this school will be replaced by a better building for some time to come and it is felt that a paint job inside as well as outside would give the building a much better appearance to stand for at least a few years longer. While the labour is only an estimate you will observe that the estimate for this item as well as materials required will exceed the amount we have left to spend on schools. The following materials are needed:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 5 Gals. outside white paint #728 Japalac | . . . . . | $25.00    |       |\n| 1 Gal. raw oil        |          |            | $1.50 |\n| \u00bd Gal. turps.         |          |            | $.50  |\n| Labour (2 coats)      |          |            | $30.00|\n|                       |          |            | $57.00|\n| 1 Gal.

At the present time, only one school on this reserve\u2014the Cornwall Ild. E. School\u2014is using this system, and that only in a limited form. We are contemplating trying to weave it in with the program of \"Indian Scout\" club now being organized in the Village.\n\n[Signature]\nA. L.

A new building is required and should be erected in a more central location - about on Lot No. 91 - the new building should provide for a two class school, with teachers' living quarters. This would do away with the CHETLAIN School, situated at the very end of the Reserve.\n\nCHETLAIN SCHOOL\n\nThis building is in good state of repair.

Bonnah,\nIndian Agent,\nBox 987,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Bonnah:\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of this morning, I enclose herewith copy of the plans of the two room school with residence.\n\nThe specifications will not be available until some time next week. As soon as we secure them they will be sent to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nMemorandum:\n\nFOR FILE\n\nOn Wednesday, July 23rd, Mr. Bonnah, Indian Agent, St. Regis, phoned and stated that L.C. Dalgleish, 228 3rd St., W., Cornwall, Ontario, was interested in quoting on the construction of the two room school and teacher's residence to replace the present school at Chenail.\n\nPlans of this building were sent to Mr. Bonnah on July 23rd and he was advised that the specifications would not be ready for another week. The latter information was obtained by Mr. Doucet from the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nIn his telephone message Mr. Bonnah referred to a proposed nursing station he thought would be erected on the Reserve. I spoke to Dr. Proctor about this and he advised that funds for the purpose were not available in the current year's appropriation of the Health Service.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to your letter of July 23rd, File 33-1-5 (W.T. 1), please note the following concerning the proposed two-room school in the Chemall.\n\nI can get Mr. L. Givogue of 25 Belmont Street, Cornwall, to put this school up. He will supervise the construction himself at $1.50 per hour and will hire key carpenters himself at $1.30 per hour plus $2.00 a day to cover bridge toll, etc. We would have to supply the balance of labour and also hunt up materials. Regarding the latter, I have interviewed Mr. Hodgins of the Hodgins Lumber Company of Cornwall and the latter advised me that they will do everything in their power to see that materials are laid down on the job in sufficient quantity to keep the thing rolling as soon as construction starts. This, of course, depends on whether or not you want the job done this way. Mr. Hodgins himself advised me he would not take any contract insofar as construction is concerned but would certainly make every effort to supply us the necessary materials. He would have to know, of course, at least three or four weeks ahead and that would mean within the next few days if we want construction to start by the middle of September.\n\nAnother alternative is the Farley Construction Company of Ottawa. This firm has under construction a large school in the city of Cornwall, and will, while in the vicinity, probably have other jobs to do. In conversation with the representative of this firm the other day, I am advised that they are prepared to take over the job of supplying materials and complete construction. This firm can be contacted in Ottawa. In this regard I might say that such an arrangement would appear to be most satisfactory as we have now reached the point here where it is getting almost impossible for me to divide my time much more than I am doing.\n\nThe last suggestion I have to offer is a Company recently formed by Mr. L.C. Dalgleish of Third St., Cornwall, Ontario. In conversation with this man I believe he would be prepared to undertake the job on a cost-plus basis or perhaps otherwise.

E. FARLEY CONSTRUCTION CO. LTD.,\n\nAEF/p\n\nPres.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to your letter of July 23rd, File 33-1-5 (W.T.I.), please note the following concerning the proposed two-room school in the Chena\u00ef.\n\nI can get Mr. L. Givogue of 25 Belmont Street, Cornwall, to put this school up. He will supervise the construction himself at $1.50 per hour and will hire key carpenters himself at $1.30 per hour plus $2.00 a day to cover bridge toll, etc. We would have to supply the balance of labour and also hunt up materials. Regarding the latter, I have interviewed Mr. Hodgins of the Hodgins Lumber Company of Cornwall and the latter advises me that they will do everything in their power to see that materials are laid down on the job in sufficient quantity to keep the thing rolling as soon as construction starts. This, of course, depends on whether or not you want the job done this way. Mr. Hodgins himself advised me he would not take any contract insofar as construction is concerned but would certainly make every effort to supply us the necessary materials. He would have to know, of course, at least three or four weeks ahead and that would mean within the next few days if we want construction to start by the middle of September.\n\nAnother alternative is the Farley Construction Company of Ottawa. This firm has under construction a large school in the city of Cornwall, and will, while in the vicinity, probably have other jobs to do. In conversation with the representative of this firm the other day, I am advised that they are prepared to take over the job of supplying materials and complete construction. This firm can be contacted in\nOttawa. In this regard, I might say that such an arrangement would appear to be most satisfactory as we have now reached the point here where it is getting almost impossible for me to divide my time much more than I am doing.\n\nThe last suggestion I have to offer is a Company recently formed by Mr. L. C. Dalgleish of Third St., Cornwall, Ontario. In conversation with this man I believe he would be prepared to undertake the job on a cost-plus basis or perhaps otherwise. Whether or not you could tie him down to guarantee delivery of materials, I do not know.\n\nIn analyzing the above situation I do not think you will have much difficulty in arriving at a solution. May I say, however, that it is most important that construction of this building start without delay.\n\nT. L.

Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall equip the workmen and hours and classify all work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule fixed therefore by the Minister, or shall fail to report over-time and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment made for wages owing by the Contractor to the Govern- ment be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour thereon.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such records shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would be due him for payment under the terms of the contract at the proper rates of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any portion of the wages due to any workmen remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such other information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) If the terms of default herein mentioned payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished the said Contractor shall pay such claims out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams and the persons entitled to payment for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting other than Subletting, such necessity as may exist, the main contractor is responsible for the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractors, the conditions will not be deemed to have been transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canadian soil, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available and that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

Approximately 60 apple pickers left for Vermont at the same time. This left us with only my road crew. In order that construction might proceed insofar as the school is concerned, I turned over my road crew to the construction Company. In turn I have had to contend with an inferior type of labour but by re-arranging my road programme, I can still get good results.\n\nIn view of the above, I would suggest that the matter of digging a well be taken up directly with Mr. Farley as he can do the job and has the help to do it now. Due to the nature of the soil, it will be necessary to crib right to the bottom of the well. My suggestion then is that cement piping of at least two feet diameter be put in and back-filled. Insofar as the crib work is concerned, this Company, with the help made available to them and the materials at their disposal, can handle this quite well. After discussing the matter with the local foreman, I do not think any objection will be raised.\n\nWould you please advise me if you are able to make an arrangement with this Company?\n\nF. D.

Co. advises they have gone approximately 28 feet and have not struck water. He informs me they have made tests which would show little indication of water at 40 feet. Already they are 15 ft. below the river and adjacent to same. Wells in vicinity show ample water at 22 ft. As it is not possible to definitely say water will be reached at any specific depth would you suggest first recommendation that water be piped in from river. At this point stream is at least 30 to 40 ft. deep. Nearest point of contamination is many miles to the west. Cornwall sewage does not affect south channel of St. Lawrence. Stream flows at approximately 6-7 miles per hour at this point.\n\nAbove forwarded for your information.\n\nT.L.

It is possible that this well may fill up at a later date but in order to ensure that we have an assured source of water for the school our Indian Agent, Mr. Bonnah has recommended that we test the river water.\n\nThe school is situated about one hundred and fifty feet from the St. Lawrence. At this point, the stream is at least thirty to forty feet deep and the nearest point of contamination is many miles to the west. The Cornwall sewage does not affect the south channel of the St. Lawrence. The stream flows at approximately seven miles per hour at this point.\n\nIt would be appreciated, if one of your officials could go to Cornwall and interview Mr. Bonnah in this regard. His phone number is Fort Covington 2286 (via Malone, New York). If your official taking the test would contact Mr. Bonnah ahead of time he could arrange for whatever help is necessary.\n\nBernard F.

Bonnah, Indian Agent.\nSUBJECT: Care of Stoves and Furnaces.\n\nThe Department is quite often put to the unnecessary expense of replacing stove and furnace grates, fire pots and heat radiators in hot air furnaces.\n\nIt is understandable that fire pots will burn out and occasionally grates will have to be replaced. Generally speaking, grates would not need replacing if teachers would see to it that ash pans are kept clear. There is little excuse for a radiator in a hot air furnace burning out. The only reason for this is that the teachers or janitors are putting too much in the furnace in the hope that the fire will hold over the week-end or the like. More coal should not be put into any coal burning stove or furnace in excess of what the firepot will hold. Any furnaces or stoves having water pans or water tanks should be checked daily to see that water is at the proper level. In hot air furnaces, it is imperative that water pans be kept filled.\nSt. Regis, Quebec\nOctober 31, 1947\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nIn account of Philip Francis\n\nIn transporting Helen Francis from\nSt. Regis Village to Chenail School.\n\n19 days at 40\u00a2 = $7.60\n\nReceived Payment:\nPhilip Francis\n\nHelen Francis (teacher)\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to Helen Francis,\nAddress c/o P.O.

Ryan, Esq.,\nFarley Construction Company,\nRoom 20, Cornwallis Hotel,\nCornwall, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ryan:\n\nUnder separate cover I am mailing you two bottles for use in testing the water at the Chenail Indian Day School well.\n\nTo prepare the well for sampling it is necessary to take one quarter (\u00bc) lb. chloride of lime and stir it well into a pailful of water. Stir well and allow the sediment to settle. Then pour the clear water into the well and allow 24 hours to pass. Then pump the well out and allow it to fill again. Two days later, take the two samples in the bottles which we are sending.\n\nThe reason for the above procedure is that any well which has been freshly dug is bound to be contaminated during digging and it is necessary to clear the well out before an accurate sample can be taken.\n\nFill in the blue slips which are in each bottle and then mail the bottles to the following address:\n\nBranch Laboratories,\nDepartment of Health of Ontario,\n458 Slater Street, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nPlace 10\u00a2 postage on them to cover mailing charges.

The estimated price is $210.50, f.o.b., Montreal, sales tax extra.\n\nMr. Dufault advised that if the Department contemplate using more of these units, an order should be given so that their work schedule could be arranged.\n\nSince they are the only firm likely to be in a position to manufacture Gravity Warm Air Furnaces in these large sizes, it would seem advisable to place a tentative order for an approximate number of furnaces in accordance with the number of schools projected.\n\nT.

Bonnah, Indian Agent, P.O. Box 987, Cornwall, Ont.,\n\nWater Supply - Chenail Indian Day School.\n\nA meeting was held in my office yesterday to discuss the problem of providing an adequate water supply for the above school now being constructed in your agency. We have now received a Bacteriological report on the two samples of water taken from the well which has recently been dug at the school. In both these reports the water has been classified as \"D\".\n\nPresent at the meeting were Mr. Farley, Mr. Buck, Mr. Rankin, Mr. Hargreaves, Mr. Doucet and myself. It was decided that in view of the small supply of water from the present well that two alternatives presented themselves:\n\n(1) To drill a well to a depth of 100 to 125 feet.\n\n(2) To pump water from the St. Lawrence river through a chlorinator into a tank in the school building.\n\nAfter a long discussion it was unanimously decided to follow course two and be assured of a steady source of water. In view of recent experiences with wells in your agency and because of the heavy expenditure and uncertainty involved in sinking another well, I think you will agree with this solution.\n\nSteps are being taken by our Engineer to prepare the necessary specifications for this project. Mr. Farley will take the necessary soundings and will be prepared to carry out this work as a sub-contract to his main contract. It was decided that we should find out definitely from you as to the possibility of getting power to the school. You will\nrecall that you had previously mentioned this in past correspondence. It would greatly facilitate the pumping of water from the river to the school if we could arrange for an electric pump rather than a gasoline pump. Therefore, we would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible regarding recent developments with regard to the provision of power at this school.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6085, file 306-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th, your file 33-1-5 (W.T.) re water supply at the new Chenail School.\n\nIt is surprising to learn that the Bacteriological report shows the water to be in Class \"D\". I think it would be wise to follow the course discussed in your office and have the water brought to the school from the river using a chlorinator.\n\nRegarding the electricity, I wish I could tell you definitely when the power can be brought on the Reserve. The Congress of the United States has already been petitioned to permit the Central New York Power Company to export power to St. Regis Reserve. I was discussing this matter on the telephone with Mr. Woods, the Manager of the Central New York Power Company, the other day but apparently the only thing we can do is wait until the authorization comes through. Mr. Woods did not seem to feel that his Company would not get the permit to export. When the permit is issued, the matter of bringing power onto the Reserve will then be handled through the Shawinigan Power Company. I was speaking to Mr. Mather, the Manager of this Company in Montreal, and according to his information they will be glad to proceed with the work as soon as the Export Permit is issued.\n\nI think we should proceed on the assumption that we will get the power but if the water is required before we have a hook-up with the power, then it is suggested that a gas engine be used in the meantime.\n\nAs previously discussed with Mr. Phelan, I would suggest that you telephone Mr. Mather at Lancaster 6281, Montreal.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nDecember 31, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nPhoned Mr. Mather, Shawinigan Power Company, Montreal this morning and he informs me that the possibility of obtaining electricity on the St. Regis Reserve is not very encouraging at the present time.\n\nThe situation is that the Shawinigan Power Company is dealing with the United States Electric Company at Hogansburg in an endeavour to obtain electricity from them. If they are successful in this regard they will run a line through the St. Regis Reserve and we can obtain the current required for the Chensil School.\n\nAccording to Mr. Mathers the American Company is experiencing some difficulty in obtaining permission from the United States to export electricity. However, Mr. Mathers states that the Shawinigan Power Company is extremely anxious to bring a line in and will again take up the matter with the American Company with a view to ascertaining if anything can be done to rush the matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJanuary 2, 1948.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Indian Agent,\nP.O. Box 987, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nWe received your letter of the 23rd ultimo in connection with the water supply at the new Chenail School.\n\nWe phoned to Mr. Mather, Shawinigan Power Company, Montreal, and while he appears to be very anxious to construct the electric line, he advised us, as he had already stated to you, the delay is due to the difficulty that the American company is encountering in endeavouring to obtain permission to export electricity to Canada.\n\nHowever, Mr. Mather promised us that he would keep in close touch with the American company and he is still hopeful that the situation will work out satisfactorily.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Mr. Mather:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's phone conversation with you on December 31st, we hope that you will be successful in obtaining the necessary power from the company in the United States in order to enable you to construct your electric line through the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nIn connection with the new school that we are erecting on the reserve, we are anxious to obtain electric power if possible, due to the fact that we will be obliged to pump the water required from the river as we are unable to find another source for water.\n\nWe appreciate your desire to co-operate with us if at all possible.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nBernard F.

I made no such recommendation. I did recommend that every effort be made to obtain a suitable supply from a shore source and stated that if it were necessary to draw water from the river careful chlorination would be required as I believed the river there was heavily polluted. This belief was verified later by sampling.\n\nWith regard to mineral and chemical analysis of the water this can be arranged for you by this Division if you will supply approximately one gallon of the water in question. However, your Engineering and Construction Division need not be unduly perturbed about the physical and chemical quality of the water as there are several municipalities above and below that location which are using the river water with chlorination only.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nACTING CHIEF, PUBLIC HEALTH ENGINEERING DIVISION.\n\nJRM/RD\n\nIndian Affairs.

While it appeared to the writer that the installation of a hot air heating system would leave little room in the furnace room, I hesitated to make any comment until I could have something definite to work on. When speaking to Mr. Marleau this morning about this matter, he advised me that when the hot air and cold air pipes were attached to the furnace there would definitely be no passageway open between what is shown on the basement plan as the sewing room and manual training room. I also learn from Mr. Marleau that there is no possible way of moving this furnace around to arrange a passageway between the two rooms.\n\nI am advising you of the above in the event that the Engineering Service might have some plan whereby the passageway they have shown on the plan between these two rooms can be utilized.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that in putting up a building of this nature the hot water heating system was not provided for. It appears to the writer that the cost of construction of this building warrants something better than a hot air heating system.\n\nT. L.

Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n\"RE CHENAIL INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\"\nST. REGIS RESERVE\n\nImmediately after the award to us of Contract to build the above school, the important matter of obtaining a Safe Domestic Water supply was investigated and it was concluded that sufficient good water would be found if a Well was excavated or dug, close to the building. It was thought that water would be secured at an approx. depth of 15 feet.\n\nWe were instructed to proceed with this undertaking and work was started at same on October 6th and was carried on until December 13th, when work was abandoned, after Well had been excavated to a depth of 32 feet. The water supply secured at this depth was not sufficient for requirements and after Tests of water had been made by the Department, the water at this level was found to be absolutely Unsafe for domestic purposes.\n\nThe cost of work on Well to December 13th amounts to the sum of $1151.00.\n\nIt is now found necessary to obtain and use water from the St. Lawrence River channel but this water is not safe for Domestic purposes and must be Chlorinated.\n\nTo supply and Install Jet type centrifugal water pump powered by means of a belt driven to a Briggs & Stratton Gasoline engine and equipped with a pressure switch which will shut the engine down when proper pressure has been built up in the Tank, also Chlor-O-Feeder equipped with two 5 gallon solution tanks and belt driven from the engine so as whenever the engine is operating sterilized solution will be applied to pump suction. Further it will be necessary to increase size of Electric service entering building from 30 amperes to 60 amperes to permit of the supply and installation of a 30 gallon Hot water tank with 3000 watt heater and also provide wiring for pump when power is supplied to the building.\n\nThe estimated cost of this work amounts to $1200.00\nTo secure water from St. Lawrence, it will be necessary to provide and lay a 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" galvanized pipe line from Pump room to St. Lawrence river, allowing said pipe to extend far enough into the River to permit obtaining an adequate water supply at all times. The River end of the pipe will have to be approximately Six feet below water level to prevent damage from Ice formation and pipe line leading to building to be 6'6\" below grade to prevent same from freezing. The work involves all excavation, sheeting of trench and unwatering required to complete this work.\n\nThe estimated cost of this work amounts to $1700.00\n\nTrusting the above will meet with your requirements and awaiting your valued instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Before your recommendation could be submitted to the Minister, we should have more information in regard to the work that has already been done by the contractors which was subsequently abandoned after spending $1,151. Have you a report from the engineers recommending that the work should be started? It is noted that the work was abandoned after the well was dug to a depth of thirty-two feet.

Neary.\n\nRe: Heating System in Two-Classroom Indian Day School, St. Regis, P.Q.\n\nFollowing his recent visit to the above, Mr. Buck noted two items in connection with the gravity warm air furnace which are hereby brought to your attention.\n\nItem 1 - The ash-pit appears to be too shallow to be suitable for burning coal.\n\nItem 2 - No shaker was noticed, and as far as can be seen it appeared that the grates were stationary.\n\nIt is felt that a brief review of the circumstances which governed the choice of this furnace should be recalled.\n\nThe gravity warm air heating system was chosen for this School as we were advised that the possibility of obtaining electric power was remote. The choice of the furnace was restricted to one manufacturer as several competitive firms had discontinued making units large enough for a school this size.\n\nThe McClary Magnet warm air furnace which was installed, is a type designed primarily for burning wood. However, linings and special grates can be furnished for burning soft or hard coal according to the manufacturer's catalogue data; and to make certain of this we contacted the manufacturer.\n\nOn December 23rd and December 29th, 1947, General Steel Wares advised us by letter that they were in a position to supply this furnace in the two sizes asked for, and that they would provide suitable grates and linings for burning coal.\n\nIt is suggested that the Contractor be instructed to check the grates and linings with a view to making certain that they are suitable or unsuitable as the case may be for burning coal. The Contractor should also request the manufacturer to provide proper shaking tools for the purpose of disposing of ash as it collects on the grates.\n\nR.A.

We were not able to buy the site selected as the Indian was not willing to sell. However, the alternative site upon which the school has been built, is actually closer to the St. Lawrence River than the original location. On the basis of depths to which wells had been dug on adjacent properties, it appeared that well water should be reached at a depth of approximately 15 feet. The Indian home next to the school had a well of this depth with an ample supply of water (see attached photograph 1).\n\nThe school is located less than 150 feet from the St. Lawrence (at this point about 35 feet deep and flowing at approximately 7 miles per hour). When the contractor reported lack of water at this depth in the well, we wrote on October 25, 1947, to the Public Health Engineering Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare. We asked that they test the river water at this point to ascertain if it were fit for public consumption. Their engineer visited the site on November 6 and took samples of the river water. The report on this water showed it as unfit for public consumption.\n\nTherefore we consulted the engineers of the Lands and Development Services Branch and it was decided to deepen the well...\nto 32 feet in the hope that water would be found at that level. At this point there was a slow water flow. Two bottles of the water from the well were tested and found unfit for public consumption (\"D\").\n\nOn December 19 a meeting was held in the office of the Superintendent of Education to discuss the water supply for this school. Present at this meeting were Messrs. Buck, Rankin, Hargreaves of Lands and Development Services Branch; Mr. Farley, the contractor; and Messrs. Neary, Phelan and Doucet of this Branch. It was decided, in view of the small supply of water from the dug well, that two alternatives presented themselves:\n\n(1) To drill a well to a depth of 100 to 125 feet.\n\n(2) To pump water from the St. Lawrence River through a chlorinator into a tank in the school building.\n\nAfter a long discussion it was unanimously decided to follow course 2 and thus be assured of a non-failing source of water. In view of the heavy expenditure and uncertainty involved in the sinking of another well, it is felt that this was a proper solution.\n\nTherefore the engineers took action to prepare the necessary specifications for this project. When the specifications were prepared, Mr. Farley was asked to tender on them as a subcontract to his main contract. His tender was as follows:\n\n(a) Installation of water pump, electric water heater, solution tanks, etc. ........................................ $1,200.00\n\n(this amount can be reduced by the installation of an oil kitchen range with coils for heating water).\n\n(b) Excavation, sheeting of trench, laying of 1\u00bd inch galvanized pipeline to river, anchoring same against current and winter ice, etc. ........................................ $1,700.00\n\nIt must be realized that items covered by (a) above are features which would be required, regardless of the source of water supply, and therefore must be considered as part of the building rather than to be associated with (b) which involves\nonly water delivery from the source. Confirming the costs quoted please find attached both Mr. Farley's tender and a memorandum from Mr. Mills advising that the prices are fair and reasonable.\n\nMessrs. Buck and Neary inspected this school last week and final payment on the main contract has been authorized. With the exception of one or two details for which the contractor admits responsibility, they found the work entirely satisfactory. The water situation was carefully reviewed and it is recommended that authority be given for the letting of the sub-contract and the payment of the original well account as previously submitted. It is emphasized that this is a completely modern school for some sixty or seventy children with good living accommodation for two teachers. Flush toilets and wash basins are installed as authorized by Order-in-Council and it is essential that a guaranteed source of water be assured. In view of past experiences by this Branch in attempting to make use of an uncertain water supply, we hope to follow in future the policy of getting water from an assured source. Initially the cost may be higher but in the long run we save money by eliminating continuous minor expenses due to well failures. It is therefore requested that the Minister approve the payment of the account for the old well and the letting of the two sub-contracts to the Farley Construction Company.\n\nDirector.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nTo B.

At this point there was a slow water flow. Two bottles of the water from the well were tested and found unfit for public consumption (\"D\").\n\nOn December 19 a meeting was held in the office of the Superintendent of Education to discuss the water supply for this school. Present at this meeting were Messrs. Buck, Rankin, Hargreaves of Lands and Development Services Branch; Mr. Farley, the contractor; and Messrs. Neary, Phelan and Doucet of this Branch. It was decided, in view of the small supply of water from the dug well, that two alternatives presented themselves,\n\n(1) To drill a well to a depth of 100 to 125 feet.\n\n(2) To pump water from the St. Lawrence River through a chlorinator into a tank in the school building.\n\nAfter a long discussion it was unanimously decided to follow course 2 and thus be assured of a non-failing source of water. In view of the heavy expenditure and uncertainty involved in the sinking of another well, it is felt that this was a proper solution.\n\nTherefore the engineers took action to prepare the necessary specifications for this project. When the specifications were prepared, Mr. Farley was asked to tender on them as a subcontract to his main contract. His tender was as follows:\n\n(a) Installation of water pump, electric water heater, solution tanks, etc. ......................... $1,200.00\n\n(this amount can be reduced by the installation of an oil kitchen range with coils for heating water).\n\n(b) Excavation, sheeting of trench, laying of 1\u00bd inch galvanized pipeline to river, anchoring same against current and winter ice, etc. ......................... $1,700.00\n\nIt must be realized that items covered by (a) above are features which would be required, regardless of the source of water supply, and therefore must be considered as part of the building rather than to be associated with (b) which involves\nonly water delivery from the source. Confirming the costs quoted please find attached both Mr. Farley's tender and a memorandum from Mr. Mills advising that the prices are fair and reasonable.\n\nMessrs. Buck and Neary inspected this school last week and final payment on the main contract has been authorized. With the exception of one or two details for which the contractor admits responsibility, they found the work entirely satisfactory. The water situation was carefully reviewed and it is recommended that authority be given for the letting of the sub-contract and the payment of the original well account as previously submitted. It is emphasized that this is a completely modern school for some sixty or seventy children with good living accommodation for two teachers. Flush toilets and wash basins are installed as authorized by Order-in-Council and it is essential that a guaranteed source of water be assured. In view of past experiences by this Branch in attempting to make use of an uncertain water supply, we hope to follow in future the policy of getting water from an assured source. Initially the cost may be higher but in the long run we save money by eliminating continuous minor expenses due to well failures. It is therefore requested that the Minister approve the payment of the account for the old well and the letting of the two sub-contracts to the Farley Construction Company.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Chensil Indian Day School,\nSt. Regis Indian Agency\nWater Supply.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum to you of March 5th last, which carried your marginal notation of March 8th, 1948, the tenders of $1,200.00 and $1,700.00 submitted by the A.E. Farley Construction Company, have been analysed and found fair and reasonable.\n\nWhile the work of laying the suction pipe and intake may not cost the tender price of $1,700.00, it is nevertheless felt advisable to let this amount stand as difficulties in construction might be encountered at the river end of the work which would entail the spending of the full amount.\n\nThe letter of the A.E.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: CHENAIL INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nST. REGIS RESERVE\n\nImmediately after the award to us of Contract to build the above School, the important matter of obtaining a Safe Domestic Water Supply was investigated and it was concluded that sufficient good water would be found if a Well was excavated or dug close to the building. It was thought that water would be secured at an approximate depth of 15 feet.\n\nWe were instructed to proceed with this undertaking and work was started on same on October 6th and was carried on until December 13th, when work was abandoned, after Well had been excavated to a depth of 32 feet. The water supply secured at this depth was not sufficient for requirements and after Tests of water had been made by the Department, the water at this level was found to be absolutely Unsafe for domestic purposes.\n\nThe cost of work on Well to December 13th amounts to the sum of $1,151.00.\n\nIt is now found necessary to obtain and use water from the St.Lawrence River channel but this water is not safe for Domestic purposes and must be Chlorinated.\n\nTo supply and Install Jet type centrifugal water pump powered by means of a belt driven to a Briggs & Stratton Gasolene engine or equivalent motor power and equipped with a pressure switch which will shut the engine down when proper pressure has been built up in the Tank, also Chlor-O-Feeder equipped with two 5 gallon solution tanks and belt driven from the engine so as whenever the engine is operating sterilized solution will be applied to pump suction. Further it will be necessary to increase size of Electric service entering building.\nST. REGIS SCHOOL WATER SUPPLY\n\nFebruary 25th, 1948\n\nfrom 30 amperes to 60 amperes to permit of the supply and installation of a 30 gallon Hot Water Tank with 3000 watt heater and also provide wiring for pump when power is supplied to the building.\n\nThe estimated cost of this work amounts to $1,200.00.\n\nTo secure water from St. Lawrence, it will be necessary to provide and lay a 1\u00bd\" galvanized pipe line from Pump room to St. Lawrence river, allowing said pipe to extend far enough into the River to permit of obtaining an adequate water supply at all times. The River end of the pipe will have to be approximately Six feet below water level to prevent damage from ice formation and pipe line leading to building to be 6'6\" below grade to prevent same from freezing. The work involves all Excavation, sheeting of trench and unwatering required to complete this work.\n\nThe estimated cost of this work amounts to $1,700.00.\n\nTrusting the above will meet with your requirements and awaiting your valued instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nSome time ago, the matter of supplying fuel oil for the kitchen range at the new Chenail School was discussed with Mr. Neary. At that time, I understood we were to receive a suitable oil burning unit with a water front. It was also my understanding that a suitable tank would be supplied for fuel oil. This tank should, I believe, contain at least 200 gallons. To date, neither the stove nor the tank has arrived.\n\nYou are aware that arrangements have already been made to obtain fuel oil and already the dealer has made several suggestions that we get our supply in without delay. This, however, we can not do until we get the tank. In purchasing this tank, care should be taken to obtain one of proper dimensions so that the tank can be brought through the doors and put in the space in the cellar which was decided upon.\n\nWould you please advise the action being taken on the above?\n\nT.

L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. B. F. Neary.\n\nAs previously advised, it was our intention to transfer the gas operated pump from the Sisters' Residence to the new Chenail School. However, it does not appear that we will have the power connected in St. Regis Village until perhaps late in September. This means we can not move the gas pump from the Sisters' Residence.\n\nWould you give me authority to purchase a gas operated shallow well pump for the new Chenail School which we will have installed there? It is not my intention to remove the electric pump now installed. Mr. Gendron, at my request, visited the Shawinigan Power office in Montreal and I learned from him that we would not be able to get the power in the Chenail this Fall. After considering the distance the Power Company will have to come to maintain our lines here, it might be advisable to purchase a gas engine now, install it, and leave it there after the power is hooked up as an auxiliary unit. This would protect us in the event of the lines being down for a long period such as we encountered with the telephone here during the sleet storm a few winters ago. If you can purchase a gas operated shallow well pump in Ottawa, it might be advisable to do so and have it sent here right away.\n\nYour early reply, please.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nOttawa, August 20, 1948.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Supt. Indian Agency, P.O. Box 987, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of August 17th in reference to a temporary pump for the Chenail School.\n\nOn reviewing the correspondence on the matter, it is difficult to understand just what you require. In the Fall and Winter Eaton's Catalogue on page 527, catalogue No. 0555-504 is listed a portable centrifugal Pump complete. Now it is possible that this pump may suit your purpose, if the water is no further down than 15 feet from the pump although there is another problem in that it is not automatic and will not shut off or start by itself.\n\nI would suggest that you look up this pump and if you feel that this is what is required, you are authorized to purchase it and forward the bill to this office for payment. However, if this pump is not suitable please let me know whether you can purchase or rent one locally.\n\nBernard F.

Neary.\n\nConcerning our telephone discussion about the water system at the new Chenail School, please be advised that I am returning the pump to Eaton's which was purchased at a cost of $89.50. As advised, this pump, not having an air vent, is not suitable for a pressure system.\n\nTo serve our needs at the school, I purchased, locally, a new 1\u00bd h.p. gas engine which was on a milking machine at the local Massey-Harris. There was an old pump at the Agency which was discarded some 10 years ago and which we have been able to put into shape for pumping. This unit is not, by any means, modern but it has an air vent and, together with the new engine, is supplying water to our new school. There will be, undoubtedly, a few more adjustments and possibly a little expenditure in this connection but it is expected the cost will not be very high. The cost of the new engine is around $65.00 which, together with the pump installation, will hardly exceed the cost of the pump purchased from Eaton's.\n\nT. L.

Neary\n\nRe: Furnace - New Chenail School.\n\nIt was my understanding when Mr. Buck and yourself were here that we would have a shaker grate installed in the furnace of the above school. The grate has been installed and the side castings. It is a permanent grate. I am somewhat dubious about the satisfaction we will get from this furnace. I am not against a permanent grate but I am quite sure that with a casting of not more than ten inches high set on the grate on both sides and the end that we will not get very much satisfaction. In the first place, there is no way to bank a fire. Consequently, with a fire box of that size, side castings won't last two months. While it is my opinion that the side walls and back of this furnace should be bricked with fire brick, there does not seem to be any way we can get this done unless we undertake to do it ourselves. It appears that insofar as the Company is concerned, they just sent one permanent grate and four side castings not over ten inches high along with one casting of similar height for the back. While I have had some changes made from the original installation made by the subcontractor, Marleau, I am certainly not satisfied as yet.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Buck or the Company concerned might be able to supply further information.\n\nT.

At that time, your office was pressing for information in order to requisition fuel for the schools but my reply of June 16th last was held up pending information as noted above.\n\nAs shown in my letter of the 15th instant, the grates arrived and were installed in the furnace. Being somewhat dubious, I wrote you explaining the situation. In the meantime, I discussed the matter thoroughly with Mr. Ryan of the Farley Construction Company as it appeared to the writer that the grates as installed would definitely not give us satisfaction burning hard coal. In an endeavour to help us, Mr. Ryan arranged for two officials of the General Steel Wares to come here and look this furnace over. Mr. Hebert and another official of the General Steel Wares in Montreal came here yesterday and, after looking the furnace over, stated definitely that we would never get any satisfaction by burning hard coal in the furnace.\nThese officials produced all correspondence from the Engineering Branch and it appears that no mention ever was made to the Company for anything else but a wood or soft coal burning unit. It is common knowledge that in this location wood is very difficult to obtain and soft coal is no substitute in a hot air heating system in a school. The officials of General Steel Wares, when questioned as to the practicability of burning soft coal in our school, even if some could be obtained, said they certainly would not recommend it under such conditions. This, of course, is quite understandable.\n\nI understand that the type of furnace that should be installed there is a G.S.W. 20-36 Heavy Duty Warm Air Furnace, specially built for hard coal, coke or wood, equipped with shaker grates and deep ash pit. It is my understanding that such a unit could be installed in place of the present one. The officials could not tell me whether such a unit was available but, undoubtedly, information can be had on this point from the Toronto head Office of this firm.\n\nAccording to information from the Engineering Branch to G.S.W., a wood burning unit will be used in many schools now under construction or to be constructed in the near future. It would seem advisable, therefore, to obtain, if possible, the 20-36 unit and install it here and have the present unit sent to some school where wood is obtainable. As to installation of the shaker unit, this should not present such a great problem as both models are similar and very little alteration would have to be made to the heating jacket.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\n\nIn the meantime I will try and see present furnace although grate and combustion chamber are not for type of fuel using.\nOctober 7, 1948.\n\nMr. T.L. Bonnah, Supt. of Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 987, Cornwall, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo regarding the furnace at the Chenail school, this letter has just been placed on our file. We cannot understand where it has been in the meantime.\n\nIf I am not mistaken, this is the matter about which you phoned me on September 27th. If so, my understanding is that you are dealing with the matter and consequently no reply is required to your letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/HHM.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\n**TO** Villas Furniture Co., Ltd., Cowansville, P.\n\n**SHIP TO** Mr. T.

He has no home but his wife has land near the Chenail School and if Mr. Debo was given the school building, I would expect him to move it onto the land owned by his wife.

Neary.\n\nFor some years past, it has been the custom to supply drinking cups to each child at the various schools with the result that each year a large number of drinking cups are ordered by the teachers. I would like, if possible, to try and discontinue such an arrangement in favour of each child purchasing a collapsible plastic drinking cup with cover. With the advent of family allowances and various other welfare improvements, it should not be too difficult for a parent to set aside 25\u00a2 a year for a drinking cup for a child.

Neary\n\nFurther to our telephone conversation of even date re roof Chensil School please note that due to heavy wind Thursday night and Friday last some damage was done. While it is difficult to ascertain at this writing the amount of damage done by winds some of the asphalt shingles on the northwest roof of the building have become completely loosened from the nails. Arrangements have been made to have these replaced without delay. Mr. Ryan of Farley Constr. Co., has agreed to take his men to the school Monday for repairs.\n\nWhat I am concerned about is that we are going to have continuous trouble every time we get a high wind unless we either put an asbestos roof on the west side of the school and residence or are able to cement down the present shingles. I understand that unless we get very warm weather cement will not prove out very successful. The greatest trouble is going to be in finding out just what shingles are lifting from the nails as it would appear that without renailing we would not get the full use or benefit even if the shingles were cemented. While the visible amount of damage is, at present, slight it is hard to say how many shingles are lifting from the nails and to learn this practically every shingle will have to be lifted from the flap or weather end. Such a procedure does not help a roof of this nature. While talking to an experienced roofing man this morning I learn that such a roof, while giving long service in a town or city or well sheltered community, is not practical in open country especially so when the roof surface is large.\n\nT.E.

I was down to the school today but, due to high winds, was unable to get up on the roof. I note, however, there was considerable flapping of the shingles but the condition was not as general as the day Mr. Neary and Mr. Buck were here. This may be due to the cold weather.\n\nI endeavoured, a few days ago, to obtain a bundle of black shingles of the same type but was unable to do so. I did purchase one bundle of black asphalt shingles of a smaller size.\n\nIt was my understanding that the shingles on that roof called for four nails to the shingle and that they were put on accordingly. I do not know whether re-nailing will solve our problem but if it will, it would seem advisable that this be done without delay as the visible damage, as previously intimated, is slight. Mr. Ryan of Harley Construction, it appears, was unable to obtain the same kind of shingles as are on that roof and, to protect our building in the event of further damage, I purchased a bundle of the same colour but of smaller size.\n\nIt is suggested that this matter be brought to the attention of the contractor without delay as I understand they will be through here in a few days' time.\n\nP.

Farley Construction Company,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Farley:\n\nAs it may be a few days before Mr. Ryan returns to St. Regis, I must advise you that I am in receipt of a letter from our Superintendent of Education concerning the roof on the new Chenail Indian Day School. Undoubtedly Mr. Ryan brought to your attention that high winds during November 18th and 19th last damaged the school roof on the side we were looking at the time Mr. Buck visited the school.\n\nIn the above connection, the Lands and Development Services Branch advise as follows:\n\n\"With reference to the memorandum dated November 26th to you from the Acting Director of Indian Affairs and your marginal note thereon, it is indicated that the asphalt shingles on the above school were improperly laid and/or not satisfactory in quality.\n\n\"Our Architect, in the course of an inspection this summer, observed during a high wind that the shingles were not properly applied and warned the Contractor that if wind action had damaged the shingles beyond the point where proper nailing could rectify conditions, many of the shingles would have to be replaced. Since full instructions for applying these shingles are in every bundle, there is no justification for existing conditions.\"\n\"It is up to the Contractor to complete\nthe job properly, to provide a water tight\nroof in accordance with standard practice,\neven if it involves replacing the whole\nroof covering.\"\n\nAs the season is getting quite late,\nI would appreciate your giving this matter early\nattention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your letter of November 18th last, file 306-5 (R.5), please be advised that the old Chenail School is located on Lot 109 as shown on Quebec Plan 3026. While the survey of this section of the Chenail is comparatively recent, I might say that, at one time, Lots 108 and 109 were together. Lot 108 is still in the Skitters family.\n\nAs far as I am able to learn, it would seem that the above property has been owned by Joe Skitters for many years. Some of the older Councillors tell me that Joe lived on this property for at least the last 25 years or more. When I questioned Joe about the small parcel upon which the school was built, he told me that the Department paid $25.00. I do not seem to be able to locate any correspondence in the office here and Joe is unable to give me information as to when the transaction transpired. Possibly your records in Ottawa may throw some light on the subject.\n\nAs far as not being able to find information concerning any land located to Mr. Skitters, I might remind you that it is only very recently that it was possible to have the Council agree to the Location Ticket system at this Agency.\n\nPerhaps with the above information we might be now in a position to proceed with the disposition of this very old building and also the small lot.\n\n[Signature]\nJ. L. Brennan,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\nJanuary 17, 1949.\n\nT.L. Bonnah, Esq., Supt. Indian Agency, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nYou are referred to your letter of the 5th instant, your file 6-242 which was in reply to ours of November 18th regarding the Old Chenail School Lot.\n\nWe have reviewed our files further regarding this matter and find that on October 1st, 1929, Joe Lazore sold a small parcel of land, presumably in Lot 108 which as you say was surveyed after that date, to His Majesty the King for school purposes for the sum of $25.00. Now you claim that Joe Skitters has lived on this land for 25 years or more, intimating that he has received $25.00 for this land.\n\nWill you kindly advise whether Joe Lazore and Joe Skitters are one and the same party and if not how does Joe Skitters claim to be the owner of this land.\n\nD.J.

Farley Construction Company, December 20th, please be advised that the damaged shingles on the section of the Chenail School roof facing the north west were repaired.\n\nHowever, during the high wind storm yesterday and last night, this portion of the roof received considerable damage with the result that many shingles are loosened and some blown off. It would appear that no matter what procedure we adopt with that type of asphalt shingles, we are not going to get satisfaction and whether or not we can recall the contractor to repair the recent damage is not clear to the writer. The recent high winds caused considerable damage in various sections of the Province and it is a debatable point as to whether we can hold the contractor liable to repairs in this case. Only the side of the roof and residence where the shingles were lifting at the time of Mr. Buck's visit appear to receive any damage during wind storms. If we can not hold the contractor liable, there would appear to be only one thing we can do and that is nail the shingles down on the flap and, in the Spring, put on a similar roofing on this part of the building to what was put on the Agency Residence.\n\nI shall be pleased to await your directions before taking further action.\n\nT.

I authorized him to make the purchase, and during our conversation the matter of the roof of the Chensil School came up, and I thought you would like to have the comments appearing in the first part of this letter.\n\nPhilip Thelan,\nChief, Education Division\nCREDIT MEMORANDUM\n\nReceived\n\nDeposited\n\nEntered in Official Cash Book - Folio\n\nTreasury Office Receipt No.\n\nReceived from the Hobit Simpson Co.

There seems no doubt that Lots 108 and 109 have been in the Skitters family for many years.\n\nI have been able to unearth information to the effect that the exact site where the school is located was not purchased by the Department but Joe Skitters' grandfather apparently permitted the Department to build the school on that spot. With regard to the small parcel for which $25.00 was paid, it appears that the Department was anxious to get enough land where the children could have a small playground near the school and also that fuel could be brought in and placed in the small lean-to at the back of the school. Undoubtedly, that is the agreement that was made October 1st, 1929. The small parcel in question extends from the school for the depth of the lot to where the present boundary line is shown between Lots 108 and 109. How the name Joe Lazore enters into the picture, I do not know, but it was quite likely a mistake on the part of whoever wrote the agreement.\nUnder the circumstances, and in fairness to Mr. Skitters, I don't think we have any other alternative but to give him an opportunity of getting this small parcel back and also that portion which was given by his grandfather as the original school site and which, at one time, formed part of Lots 108 and 109.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Indian Agency, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nConcerning the Old Chenail School Site on Lot 108 your attention is drawn to your letter of February 1st your file 6-242 in which you point out that from all the information you could gather you cannot determine who was Joe Lazore who signed an agreement with His Majesty on October 1st, 1929, selling a parcel of land for school purposes in the amount of $25.00.\n\nWe are attaching for your information one copy of the agreement which we have on file. Will you kindly peruse these and make a further check as to the whereabouts of Joe Lazore.\n\nIt now appears from your letter that the parcel of land which Joe Skitters requests that it be returned to him is not the parcel that was purchased by the Department but the land given for school purposes by his grandfather. In view of this we are questioning what about this parcel which was purchased for $25.00 from Joe Lazore?

What Mr. Skeeters wants, and which I think he is justified in asking for, is the return of that parcel of land upon which the Chenail School rests and which was given as a school site free by his grandfather. Also, the opportunity to purchase back, in the amount of $25.00, that parcel of land sold to the Department on October 1st, 1929, lying between the site previously given by his grandfather and Lot 109.\n\nT. L. Hannah,\nSuperintendent,\nSt. Regis Agency.\n\nEnclosure (2).\nMarch 24, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO:\n\nMr. Phelan, (E.1)\n\nOn Lots 108 and 109 there is the Old Chenail School Site on which is located an old school building. Superintendent Bonnah has been corresponding with this office with a view to return the land to the Indian from whom it has been acquired some years ago for school purposes.\n\nThis school site involves two different parcels of land acquired at different times. The \u00bd acre of land on Lot 109 Chenail Range was acquired some years ago and from the information that Superintendent Bonnah gives, this was donated by the grandfather of Joe Skitters. On this one-half acre of land the school was built and from a letter dated October 28th, 1948, Mr. Bonnah suggested that since this school building is of no further use that it be given to Tom Debo who would remove it from the present site and turn it into a residence for himself and family.\n\nThe land, he suggested be returned to the present owner. Will you kindly advise us whether this building is of any further use to you and if not are you prepared to recommend that it be turned over to a member of the band so that it may be used as a residence. With regard to the one-half acre of land if you have no further use of it you might also advise us to that effect so that action may be taken in compliance with Mr. Bonnah's suggestion.\n\n.....\nWith regard to the one-half acre on Lot 108, this was purchased on October 1st, 1929 for $25.00 from Mr. Joe Lazore who now goes under the name of Joe Skitters. This Indian is willing to refund the $25.00 paid for the land. Will you kindly advise whether you have any further use of this one-half acre and whether action may be taken on the suggestion of Mr. Bonnah to return the land to the present owner.\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\n\nJR/HTC\n29th March, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT, RESERVES & TRUSTS\n\nWe have your memorandum of 24th March, 1949, with reference to Lots 108 and 109 which was the site of the former Chenail Day School.\n\nThis Division has no further use for these lots, and we are, therefore, willing to have you take whatever action you consider advisable with regard to the recommendation contained in Superintendent Bonnah's letter of 15th March, 1949.\n\nBernard F.

Indian Agency, Cornwall, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 15th, file 6-242 with regard to the old school site on lots 108 and 109, Chenail Range, we have now been assured by the school division that they have no further use for these lots nor the school building.\n\nThe land is considered band property and if the Band Council will recommend, by passing a resolution, that the land be allotted to Joe Skeeters the department will have no objection. With regard to the suggestion that Joe Skeeters repurchase it for $25.00 this again is left to the discretion of the Band Council.\n\nWith reference to the building the department concurs in your suggestion noted in your letter of October 28th, 1948, that it be given without charge to Tom Debo. It is understood that the cost of removing it will be borne by Tom Debo.\n\nD.J.

I am informed by the Indians that there are over 20 children who do not attend any school as the Chenail school is the nearest one to them and that is too far to attend, being over three miles away. I think the Indians would do better under compulsory educational laws. They are very careless about their children. The Chenail school house only holds 40 children and would not accommodate all the children in the district.\n\nSgd. A. Luther Gilman\n\nInspector of Schools\nOttawa, June 19, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Gilman in his report on the Chenail Indian Day School states that a new school should be erected near Sugarbush Island near the residence of Louis David.\n\nThe Department would like you to go fully into the question of the need of a new school. I am sending herewith a blue print of that portion of the reserve and I would ask you to show on it the location of the homes of Indians with children to attend the school and mark on each lot the number of children. I would also ask you to show the dividing line between this proposed section and present Chenail school section. You will notice on this plan that a lot has been reserved for school purposes, but this would not appear to be a central location.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrancis E. Tailon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your of Aug. 12, 1912 #408626, I have looked into the matter and have decided that a school is essential for that portion of the reserve.

Kindly advise the Department of your whereabouts, so that you can be communicated with at a later date, as it is noted that you are leaving Port Carling in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Andrew Cook,\nPort Carling, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nAfter leaving the Tyendinaga Reserve I went to St. Regis and visited all the schools on the reserves. Extensive repairs have been made to each of the schools and they are now in excellent condition.\n\nThe new school at Chetlain on the lower Chenail is nearing completion and Mr. Angus Lalonde, the contractor, has made an excellent job of it. The site chosen is high and dry and the school will accommodate all the children in that neighborhood. The building stands on a good solid foundation which has been properly laid and the lumber used is well seasoned and of good quality. The plans and specifications made no provision for closets, but Mr. Lalonde informed me that he would put up two separate closets for $30.00 a piece. This appears to be a reasonable price and I would recommend that his offer be accepted.\n\nThe school will be ready for occupation early next month and we have already had an application from Mrs. Cook, an Indian woman, who holds a Model School diploma.\ndiploma and is very highly spoken of and her appointment would be satisfactory to the Indians. She would be quite willing to live close to the school and, as it would be a difficult matter to get a white teacher as well able to instruct the Indians, I think it would be well to secure her services, if she will accept a salary of $400.00 a year.\n\nThe only additional requirement I found needed for the Cornwall Island School were two gates, which could be put in for about $10.00. These were not called for in Mr. Lalonde's arrangement for repairs. The Department has been asked to fence off the school lot, but I think that this might stand till the spring, as there will be very little need of a fence this fall.\n\nThe question of fencing the St. Regis Island School could also remain in abeyance.\n\nA pump will be required for the new well at the Village School. They have secured an excellent supply of water there and the well has been cased and should be boarded over when the new pump is placed in position. Mr. Taillon should be authorized to purchase a pump.\n\nNone of these schools have been furnished with flags and, as they all lie in the neighborhood of the United States.\nStates border where the Stars and Stripes are constantly in view, I think it would be well to give them each a nine foot flag and instruct the Agent to have suitable poles provided and fly the flags on all state occasions.\n\nThe teacher of the St. Regis Island School sent in her resignation to take effect on the 30th of this month and a new teacher will have to be engaged. It is an isolated place to live in and the accommodation is not very satisfactory, but we have an application from Miss Burke, who has had some year's experience in teaching and is probably the only one we could engage at such short notice. I would recommend that she be employed at the usual salary.\n\nThe new teacher has taken charge of the Village School and from what I have since learnt she is likely to give satisfaction. At all events there will be no recurrence of the trouble we had with the late teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This letter was dated the 15th of September and since then no acceptance has been received.\n\nI should be glad if you would ask Mrs. Cook to inform the Department whether she is prepared to accept the position or not. It is presumed that the school will be ready for occupation shortly and we would like to make arrangements for securing the services of another teacher, should she not be available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

We had received an application from an Indian woman who has Normal School qualifications and who the Department was willing to accept. Mr. Taillon, the Agent, states that she had the promise of other employment and has not since renewed her application. It is, therefore, necessary to take steps to get a teacher in time to open the school when it is ready for occupation.\n\nIf you know of anyone who would be suitable for the position the Department would esteem it a favour if you would be good enough to inform her that there is a vacancy and ask her to forward an application to the Department accompanied by testimonials, when it will receive consideration. The Department will pay a salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum for a qualified teacher.

The Department would like you to make inquiries and see if there are any respectable Indian families who would take the teachers into board and, if so, at what rate.\n\nMrs. McDonald, teacher of the Chetlain School, called at the Department yesterday and stated that she has found it impossible to get a comfortable boarding place. If this is the case the Department would like to know if there is a vacant house in the vicinity of her school that could be secured for a teacher's residence. Would it be possible for the teacher of the Chetlain School to live in St. Regis Village and cross over to the school every day?\n\nThere should be no difficulty in getting a boarding place on Cornwall Island, but the Department would like to know if one could be secured convenient to the school.\n\nThe St. Regis Island teachers have been in the habit of boarding with the Thompsons and it is presumed that they would be willing to receive the new teacher. If not\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nnot, is there any other family that would care to give board?\n\nMrs. McDonald suggested the idea of having a teacher's residence put up midway between the Chetlain and Onenail schools with accommodation for the teachers of both these schools. I should like to have your opinion in regard to this suggestion and I should be glad if you would reply to this letter at your earliest convenience, so that arrangements can be made in time for the re-opening of the schools.\n\nThe Department will be able to secure qualified teachers for all these schools and Mrs. McDonald will be kept on at the Chetlain School in the meantime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with instructions contained in your of July 29th ultimo, #4056261, I have the honor to inform you that I visited the Indians and find that on St Regis Second, Mrs Thompson, will take a teacher, and will cost $6.00 per month.\n\nFor the Ch\u00e9nais school I have secured a place with Richard Sunday, at $10.00 per month; this house is only a few hundred yards west of the school.\n\nAn Emmanuel School, I called upon some Indians but the parents were away, however they agreed to let me know tomorrow if they would send a teacher; The Rev J. J. Cape, Methodist missionary, offered to take the teacher, at $10.00 per month, provided both parties were satisfied and that the teacher looked after her own room.\n\nAs to the Beloeil school, I called upon several persons and they agreed to let me know their decision on Sunday next.\n\nAt the present time there does not appear to be any room.\n\nAug 6th 1915\nSir,\n\nIn regard to crossing from St Regis Village to the Settlement school every day, I fear that this block is not very feasible, as during the school year there are times when it is impossible to cross the river. The school would have to be closed during those days. Of course, should we be unable to secure a boat or ferry service, it would be preferable to have the teacher board in the village and make the best of weather conditions.\n\nThe suggestion of having a house erected does not appeal very strongly to me, inasmuch as I feel that other teachers may not care to live alone, and if such a boarding house could be secured it would be much better; of course, if two teachers were agreeable they could live in this house, thereby relieving the school. Raise Thornton, the school's owner, seemed most certainly opposed of a house being erected.\nSir,\n\nI will inform you at the Ottawa school by Monday, if possible.\n\nJ. D. M. Lea, Jr.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nF. E. O. Allen,\nAgent\nOttawa, August 13, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in reference to accommodation for the teachers on the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that Mr. Thompson's terms of $16.00 a month are too high and I have to ask you to make further inquiries. The Department is informed that there is an Indian named Mitchell, who had a very comfortable house near the school and who perhaps would be willing to take a boarder; if so, you might get terms from him.\n\nMiss Mary O'Hare, who has been appointed teacher of the Cornwall Island School, is willing to accept Mr. Oke's offer to board her for $12.00 a month, she to take care of her room. She is a Roman Catholic and a qualified teacher.\n\nThe offer of $10.00 made by Mr. Richard Sunday for board for the teacher of the Chenail School is very reasonable and will be satisfactory.\n\nThe Department will not put up a dwelling for the teacher of the Chetlain School and she will have to secure board for herself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of July 29th, ultimo, No. 47256, I have to inform you that Mr. Louis Benedict, Postmaster at Cornwall Island, has stated that he could take a steamer to board but was unable to select what ship he would require for board; this caused no doubt to be arranged by the steamer and Mr. Benedict. I may say that some years ago, the steamer were accustomed to board at Mr. Benedict's.\n\nIt seems difficult to secure a boarding place for the children except, etc., etc.\n\nI have been here today and have been unable to find a place; however, I think possibly Chief L. W. David, might possibly take her but I cannot vouch for this, as at the present he is away.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. M. Leon, Sr.\nActing Agent\n\nF. S.

Donnec, teacher of Coteauin School, desires to have her salary increased to $500 from the beginning of July.\n\nShe is a good teacher and a consistent worker.\n\nShe has intimated to me that she deems it proper to make this increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.S. McLeod, Sec.\nAttorney Gen.\n\nF. & Guillon,\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 7, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant requesting that an increase be made in the salary of Mrs. P. A. McDonald, teacher of the Chetlain School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the Department has decided to increase Mrs. McDonald's salary to $500.00 per annum to date from the first of July, last. Her salary for the September quarter, last, is being paid at the increased rate. You will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\n\nAsst.

I went to the Chetlain School as it is the nearest one to commence my duties, to see how many children are in school.\n\nI went to the school house at half past nine.\nlet school out. It was just past two. Most children coming home of the children were because the teacher in their way home hadn't arrived. Some did not get to the school house again. I spoke to the people around about this teacher. They do not like to have their children suffer so much from the cold, as, up on an easily judge some are not very warmly clad.\n\nI spoke to the agent about this matter, and the agent said that I met most of the half past two.

Armstrong about the teacher, as she lives about 25 yards from the school house.\n\nI thought I would write this matter direct to you as the agent is not active about his work.\n\nI received a letter from the Department regarding some matter which was needed prompt attention.\n\nYou can see for yourself. My letter is No. 13097-1 Oct. 23rd, 1915. He has not attended to the matter yet. He promised he would come and attend to this matter, but has not come yet.\n\nI thought I would also ask you if I could be the caretaker of the school, I might in some way help the children.\nthat we know that she would do better for the children as she is an Indian and I know she would like to teach, or at least is ready to teach, and the people would rather have her teach than any other. I refer, as you might know, that former teacher around here, the former teacher of Cornwall Island, Mrs. Armstrong, they are not satisfied she lives near the school house and I believe she would another teacher.\n\nMrs. Macdonald is the caretaker of the school and she has never a fire on the stove when the children get in the house. The teacher is very mean; she treats the children badly and the people around. The neighbors or the people around want her to stop teaching school. Mrs. Armstrong, they are not satisfied she lives near the school house and I believe she would another teacher.\nto the work to please\nthe parents.\nWell this is\nall I can say\nnow, awaiting\nan early\nreply\nI am\nyours.\nChief Louis David\nSt. Regis\nJune\nOttawa, January 4, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nMrs. McDonald, teacher of the Chetlain School, who called at the Department yesterday, states that there are two or three families whose children should attend her school and are not doing so owing to the carelessness of the parents in providing them with suitable clothing and the distance they are from the school. She gives the names as the Martin and Lazarus children.\n\nMrs. McDonald states that the parents are in a position to provide their children with proper clothing and, if so, they should be compelled to send them to school. If they fail to do so the regulations will be enforced and the children will be sent to Spanish River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nP. E.

I taught at one time in the Bay Cove Indian school in Kent Co., N.B., & had to resign very suddenly owing to the unexpected illness & death of a relative dependent.\nI would like to secure a school for the term in some part of Upper Canada or in the Western provinces, as I am an orphan and would like to make it a permanent work. I have lived near an Indian reserve and well fitted to be a teacher of the Indians. I have an Elementary School diploma from the Province of Quebec but had been educated in the High School at Campbellton N.B. I have taught four years in one school in the province, am pretty thoroughly trained in domestic work, any kind of fancy work, sewing, crocheting or needlework, and find myself understand taught in the schools at present can teach French also fairly well. May add when I took charge of the Indian school at Cross Point I found the children had been nearly all trained in the Micmac language by the former teacher, which was their own language. I did my best to form classes and establish order among them, which met with commendation from the Priest who visited the school every month. He took a deep interest in all matters relating to education, and enclosed a copy of reference from him, also a self addressed stamped envelope. If you will kindly lend your aid to help me to secure a position I do not care about the isolation of it, but would like it in one of those places already mentioned, or if you could help me to secure a position as clerk in any of the offices of the Dept., it is needless to say how deeply grateful I shall be, and will do my very best to prove myself worthy of same.\n\nAgain asking pardon for my intrusion, praying to hear from you at an early date.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nP.

Archibald, in connection with a matter pertaining to your Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. D.G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Benson\n\nPlease let her learn\nknow as to record of this\nteacher. It might be possible\nto place her in one of our\nOntario schools.\n\nA.G.M.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the application of Miss Rosie A. Archibald, addressed to the Hon. Dr. Roche, I beg to say that Miss Archibald taught the Big Cove School from the beginning of the March quarter 1909 until the end of the March quarter 1910, when she resigned for the reason stated in her letter to Dr. Roche.\n\nRev. Father Ryan, Superintendent of Indian Schools, in a report dated the 30th of November, 1909, stated that \"I do not find that the children are getting on as they ought, but am inclined to credit this state of affairs to the fact that under the late teacher, Miss Isaacs, the children spoke in the Indian language mostly and in consequence it is hard for the present teacher to overcome this drawback to their studies\". The attendance was unsatisfactory, owing to the lack of interest of the parents, and in consequence of their indifference it was a difficult matter for a teacher to make any headway.\n\nMiss\nMiss Archibald would now be about 38 years of age and, if she has been teaching since she left the Big Cove School, she will have gained experience and might meet with better success in another locality. She is a Roman Catholic and at present there are no vacancies in any of the Roman Catholic schools in Ontario and in the West the nominations are made by the church authorities.\n\nThe school at Temiskaming should re-open on the first of April, next. The teacher of this school was transferred to the St. Regis Reserve where there was a vacancy at the Chetlain school. Chief McBride of Temiskaming is anxious that she should again take charge of the school there and she has been twice written to and asked to let the Department know whether she would resume her duties there. She told me she would prefer to stay at St. Regis. There will be a vacancy at one of these schools on the first of April, next, and Miss Archibald might fill the vacancy. We were paying $600.00 at Temiskaming and Miss Delorme was told that if she stayed at the Chetlain school her salary would be $500.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that Miss Robillard, teacher of St Regis Island Day School, has asked to be transferred to the Village School.\n\nI have asked Miss Stella Sloan about resigning and she is not prepared to resign as she is not certain as yet just what she will do.\n\nIn securing new teachers for the schools, I do believe you should secure only first class experienced teachers and those who are able to teach signing and able to teach rhetoricals etc for the Indians seem to appreciate the work and the parents take a greater interest in the work.\n\nDuring the years that we had the following teachers, Nellie Keon, Lillian McGee and Katherine McCaffery the schools advanced very rapidly and the children were attached to them so much so that we were not bothered by non-attendance to any extent.\n\nMy wish is that you would place the Sisters in charge of the Village School at least and in time place them in charge of the other schools.

Gibbons.\n\nThe teacher was not\nregular. She did not open\nevery teaching days. She\ntook more holidays than\nnecessary. She had the\nhabit of going visiting and\nstaying off the days without\nan excuse.\n\nShe sometimes only taught\ntwo days in a week\nand sometimes three\ndays. She did not care\nfor the school.\nSome of the children have come to come and they'd come in a cold snowy days and stay around the school for half a day without the teacher. Their parents got disgusted sending their children to school for nothing so they couldn't send them every day as the teacher did not care to teach. I would stay in the school till 9 o'clock but I am not supposed to stay after 9 o'clock and could not keep the children in school and would have to turn them out in the cold and lock the doors as they would be no teacher. We are all sorry to have\nSuch a teacher.\n\nI had spoken to Mr. Sutton about it and told me that they would not come back. The parents and neighbors are very dissatisfied with the teacher as there is some that would like to educate their children. We would like you to send us a teacher that is a teacher.\n\nHope you give this your early attention,\n\nYours,\nJohn Jacobs,\nCaretaker of Chilcotin School.\nIndian Affairs.

They are not doing their duty. I am the caretaker of the Chellam school and have always filled my duty. Have made the fires every morning, polished the school children by 7 o'clock every morning and have to turn them out done.\n\nIt's disgusting to have a teacher like that when she don't want to teach.\n\nI have a list of the days that the teacher was absent and has it marked down on the Register as present.\n\nShe closed the school yesterday Dec. 18th and has it marked on the register that the children are present Dec. 21st and 22nd.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some of the everyday pupils are the ones that like her.\n\nThese two teachers go to St. Regis and stay there and love that excuse they can't get over.\n\nThey have a room rented here and the man there is making fire for them every day and they don't come and make use of the fire and the Chenaill School caretaker is doing the same work.\n\nNow the rent for that room is paid by the Department for nothing and supplies the coal and wood for nothing for this man is making the fire for them all the time and they don't live in it.\n\nNow the number of days that the teacher lost is 19 days I love a list of it here she'd tell me that she was sick.\nEvery time they come a day I go over to their boarding house to see about the teacher. They are very tame. They go off visiting every time. Now even our Indian Agent comes over and takes the two teachers out of their school and takes them over with him in St. Regis. He does not wait till after school hours.\n\nThe neighbors here wonder why he could do that.\n\nThese children are running around while they should be in school.\n\nNow the teachers say they go over to the Indian Office and play cards with the officers all night and stay over the next day. The Agent don't care about them work as long as he's got company.\n\nThe neighbors here have urged me to write to the Department about the teachers as they are all certainly dissatisfied with the teacher.

All they do while at school is playing. They are getting older every day and learning nothing.\n\nThe parents do want a new teacher that knows something about teaching.\n\nWe want to know if we could have an Indian teacher, one that would take interest in the school work and children.\n\nI would also ask you to send me my fees for calculating the children's school.\n\nThe Agent opened the letters I get from the Indian Department.

She wishes to know the length of time she is going to have, so as to let her people know at home when to meet her at station, also to make arrangements on returning to St. Regis.\n\nI Am,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nW.C.

McDonald, teacher of the Chetlain Indian Day School, as to the period the schools should be closed for the Easter holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the teachers on the St. Regis Reserve may close their schools on the afternoon of Wednesday, the 13th instant, and should reopen same at the usual hour on Tuesday, the 26th instant. Please inform the teachers accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. INSPECTOR GUDDHY,\ndated May 15th, 1927.\n\nOriginal on File 33-5-1.\n\n\"Permit me to congratulate you on the acquisition of Miss McNulty, Miss McDonald and Miss Dunnigan to your staff of teachers at St. Regis. In the examinations just held they proved their worth and they are worth retaining in your department.\"\nOttawa, May 30, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to Miss Margaret Donovan, of Renfrew. I note you suggest Cornwall Island for her. Miss McDonald, at present at Chetlain, has made a strong plea to be transferred to Cornwall Island for next year. I understand her home is not far from Cornwall. Do you think Miss Donovan would accept Chetlain if she knew all the circumstances. I am seriously thinking of engaging a Caughnawaga Indian girl, who has had experience with the Sisters there, for St. Regis Island. She would live on the island. This would mean that Miss Dunnigan would have to be moved. How would she do in the junior room of the village? If this transfer were made and Miss McDonald transferred to Cornwall Island, the only vacancy for Miss Donovan would be Chetlain. Would she be willing to board with one of the families there? The new village residence can be used for both village teachers and the Chensil worker. Please let me have a further expression of your opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss M. MacNulty,\nSt. Regis, P. Q.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nMiss CARMEL DUNNIGAN, of Killaloe, Ont., who has taught for the past few months at the St. Regis Island Indian Day School, applies for the position of junior teacher at the St. Regis Village Indian Day School. She will write or call up the Department some time about July 4th. She does not wish the position at Chetlain under any circumstances.\n\nRussell T.

He also states that the out houses are in poor condition and dirty.\n\nYou will be good enough to arrange as soon as weather conditions permit to have the storm door to the porch repaired.

You may also arrange for the purchase of two new storm doors of the dimensions required. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nI have also to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the above date, regarding the repairs required to the foundation. You may arrange to have the repairs required carried out. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to see that a satisfactory job is made, and that the foundation is placed in good condition. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded.\n\nThe above repairs should receive your early attention in order that they will be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I looked over the work done and which I consider a satisfactory job. The cause for this shed trouble was that there was only one cross support under the flooring, where now there are three, and I can safely say, will be strong enough to support the weight of the soil and wood etc., in the shed.\n\nThe cleaning of the woodwork of the interior of this school has been done, and the oiling of the floors will be done the first part of the week commencing August 27th.\n\nThe exterior of this school requires a coat of paint badly. I mentioned this to the Department in one of my letters in the fall of 1927, but nothing further was done. Charlie Semo offers to give this school (Chatlain) one coat of paint, including toilets, and the repairing of two of the school steps, price $20.00. Department furnishing the paint.

It is noted that you can arrange with a member of the St. Regis Band to perform the labour for the sum of $35. You should purchase the quantity of paint, oils, etc., required, and you should see that a good grade of materials is used.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the woodwork and floors washed, and any other work required to place the classroom in good condition carried out.\n\nPlease keep all expense as low as possible, and when this work is completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the material supplied and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

When we have this report, consideration will then be given to authorize having the classroom redecorated during the summer holidays, next.\n\nRelative to the condition of the pump in the school yard, you may arrange to have the same repaired and placed in good condition. Please keep any expense for the purpose as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nSt. Regis, Island Indian Day School.\n\nThe foundation under this school is entirely done. In many places there is no foundation at all. To place this building in shape, a new foundation is required, of stone or cement. I would consider cement the best, and almost as cheap. The building should be raised about fifteen inches from the ground.\n\nI have consulted Mr. Thompson, caretaker of this school, about two weeks ago, with respect to this work. Thompson promised to let me know, but has not to date. I expect due to the river breaking up, and clearing of ice. As to the cost of this work, I would say, that between $70.00 and $80.00 would complete the job. Perhaps Thompson's figure may be lower than that.\n\nThis is an old building, but by putting a good foundation under it, the building would serve for some years yet.\n\nAs to the paint to be used in redecorating interior of Chetlain school, I wish to say, that I have had considerable trouble in previous painting jobs, by Indians, with respect to mixing paint. To have a good satisfactory job done, at this school, I would recommend ready mixed paint supplied. Although it may be possible, to secure some Indian painter who knew the art of mixing paint correctly.\n\nSome of this school repairing could be done this Spring, previous to the summer school holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J. MacKillop\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letters of March 13th and 19th regarding work to be done at Chetlain and St. Regis Island Indian Day Schools, I am to say that I visited the two above schools, also Chenail school. The following is a summary and approximate cost, including redecorating and repairing, that should be done to the three reserve schools, this coming summer.\n\nChenail Indian Day School.\n\nFoundation stone work, loose. In places stone work has fallen away. To be replaced and repointed, using plaster.\nOne large crack in brick chimney on school, to be repaired.\nDoor on one closet to be repaired.\n\nApproximate cost ------ $25.00\n\nChetlain Indian Day School.\n\nInterior to be redecorated.\nWood work, walls and ceiling thoroughly washed.\nCeiling painted white, two coats.\nPlaster walls, painted buff. Two coats if required.\nWash room and two entrances done the same.\nFloors scrubbed and oiled.\nAlmost all new stove pipes required.\nThis is the only school on the reserve, that has not been redecorated in the interior, since I came to office. The school is badly in need of brightening up.\n\nApproximate cost, including paint ---- $150.00\nOttawa, April 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, relative to the interior redecorating at the Chatlain Indian Day School, and stating the work required to be carried out and the approximate cost of same, including material and labour.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of having the interior redecorated. The woodwork, walls and ceiling should be thoroughly washed; the ceiling painted white, two coats, and the plaster walls painted buff, two coats, if required, and the washroom and two entrances painted. The floors should also be scrubbed and, when dry, given a coat of oil. It is considered that you should purchase the paint and other material required, and you should arrange with a competent Indian or other person to perform the labour. It might be advisable to obtain the paint mixed, ready for use, in the colours required. The above work should be carried out at a time when it would not interfere with the regular classroom work. Any new stove pipes required may be supplied.\n\nIt is expected that you will see all expense, both for material and labour, is kept as low as possible, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job. After the work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint and other material, and also for the labour in having the work done. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have a satisfactory job completed, at the lowest possible expense.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst.

This pump has been put in working order several times during past three years. Someone must be responsible for pump going out of order so often.\nOttawa, February 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your report for the month of January, last, on the Chetlain Indian Day School, drawing attention to the condition of the pump. It is noted that the school pump has been put in working condition several times but that, through misuse, it is frequently put out of order. Please state whether it would not be possible to obtain, from a nearby well, the small quantity of water that would be required for drinking purposes at this school. If this could be done, it is considered that the repairing of the school pump could be deferred. You might advise as to the repairs necessary and the approximate cost and also state whether the supply of water required could not be obtained from some well near the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P. Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter to you of April 10th, 1930 with reference to redecorating and repairing of schools on St. Regis reserve.\n\nWith reference to redecorating interior of Chetlain Indian Day School, you authorized this work to be done in spring 1930 but later, (Refer to your letter of April 29/30) that owing to funds being limited, you cancelled this work.\n\nChetlain school is badly in need of interior redecorating. At present the class-room has a very backward and neglected appearance.\n\nIn event of you approving of this work being done this year, I would recommend that a competent painter be engaged, other than an Indian, as I mentioned before to you, that it is almost impossible to find an Indian who does good interior painting. For outside work, painting, there are a few Indians who do fair work.\n\nSt. Regis Village school requires a coat of paint, outside. It's almost four years since this school was painted. St. Regis Island School should be painted, exterior, also the shed at this school, which was newly built in 1929, should be painted.\n\nThese outside jobs could be done by Indian of the reserve. Work is very scarce for Indians of St. Regis reserve, and by giving some painting jobs, would help out some families who are in rather close circumstances.\n\nWith reference to Chetlain school, if you approve of the interior being redecorated, I would get a price on cost of work, and forward to you for consideration.\n\nPlease advise me, if there are funds available to have the work mentioned carried out this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I regret, therefore, that we will have no funds to carry out the redecorating and painting of the above named schools this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A.

The ceiling should be given a thorough cleaning; the walls should be cleaned and given a coat of muresco. Some of the other schools on the reserve need the same.\n\nNurse Cousins and myself suggest that if the muresco was supplied, which is very cheap, a five pound package for 55 cents, to have some of the Indians who are on relief go ahead and get this work done. Seven or eight Indians would clean the ceiling and walls of one school, and put on the muresco in a day or so.\n\nIf you would allow me to purchase say, 20 lbs. muresco, which would cost $2.60 and also two wide brushes, $1.00 each, we would try to get this work done before Christmas. It would take more muresco than above for all the schools, but the total cost of muresco would not exceed $6.00.\n\nI would like to be advised on this question of employing Indians on relief in cleaning the interior of the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.F. Gibbon\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, recommending that the interior of the Chetlain Indian Day School be redecorated. It is noted that the ceiling requires a thorough cleaning and the walls should be cleaned and given a coat of muresco.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase of approximately 5 lbs. of muresco and two wide brushes. You should arrange with Indians on relief to clean the walls and ceiling and apply the muresco, provided you are satisfied that they could perform satisfactory work. In view of the relief which they receive, it is understood that there will be no charge for the labour. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the muresco and the brushes. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe Department will be unable to incur the expenditure required in redecorating and cleaning the other schools on the reserve, unless the entire work could be performed by Indians on the relief list, without expense other than for the material. If you consider the Indians could do the work satisfactorily, you may forward a list of the materials required and an estimate of the cost. Consideration will then be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. A.

If the cost involved will be reasonable, you may arrange to have the doors repaired and the door knobs replaced.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the toilets require cleaning, especially the boys' toilet. You should arrange to have the toilets properly cleaned before the school reopens in September, and you should see that they are kept clean during the academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nD. P. McNaughton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI wish to recommend the redecorating of the interior of the Chetlain Indian Day school. The paint has peeled off of a considerable portion of the ceiling and it will require two coatings of paint to make a finished job. The wainscoting will require one coat of paint, applied after a thorough washing, while the plastered walls, which have been muredescoed, will need to be very thoroughly washed if paint is to be applied, but as they are in fair condition I would think they could be put in good shape if muresco was again applied.\n\nTwo gallons of paint should be sufficient for the ceiling and two for the wainscoting with 3 boxes of muresco required for the plastered walls. Charlie Seymour will furnish the labour for at not more than $25.00, the brushes and sandpaper, to be supplied.\n\nWater has seeped through the roof, around the chimney, causing the plaster to be broken away, this will require repairing also the roof, around the chimney to prevent rain from entering. There is some small repairing to be done to the south porch, a plank in the steps to be replaced. This is included in the labour cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, you may arrange for the redecorating of the interior of the Chetlain Indian Day School.

McNaughton advised this office that Mrs. Armstrong had not received payment for the services rendered and requested this office to investigate the matter. Upon referring to your office by telephone we learned that the cheque had been negotiated, the endorsement being \"Frank Armstrong\" and not Mrs. Frank Armstrong, who is the payee. The cheque was withdrawn from the custody of the Audit Office and forwarded to the Indian Agent to allow Mrs. Armstrong to examine the endorsement. We are in receipt of advice to the effect that neither Mrs. Armstrong nor her husband, Frank Armstrong, have endorsed the cheque. In fact they dispute the endorsement. It would appear that the cheque was negotiated through a local merchant, Mr. Frank T. Kernan. He, however, is not in a position at this time to definitely state who negotiated the cheque.\n\nThe cheque in question is enclosed herewith and I would ask you to take the usual action in this regard as we would like to have the matter adjusted to enable us to make the payment which is due to Mrs. Frank Armstrong.

It would have to be rebricked, requires a new grate carriage, which are burnt out, new grates and a new top, sliding cover which has become broken. It will be more satisfactory to make a replacement.\n\nA new stove, with floor board, Quebec heater style, would cost in the neighborhood of approximately $35.00. It may be less but I cannot quote definite prices until the dealer gets the invoice. I am told that all goods are now priced upwards.\n\nI have had to install 10 new stove pipes and one elbow in this school as the old we found, on cleaning, to be burnt out to a dangerous extent.\n\nI wish to recommend that I be allowed to incur the expenditure of a stove replacement, plus transportation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 5th instant you may purchase a new heater for the Chetlain Indian day school.

This work of course will be done by Indian labour. The trench will have to be dug below the level of the cellar floor and at a drop of approximately one foot for every ten feet in length to afford suitable drainage.

(RG 10, Volume 6086, file 307-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa,\nJanuary 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your voucher No. 424 covering the cost of goods supplied for the manual and home economics classes at the Chetlain Indian Day School. I note that you quote letter of June 24, 1940, as your authority. In reviewing this letter it is found that all the articles whose purchase was authorized in that letter have previously been secured with the exception of 6 pen knives and the fret saw blades. These items are not included in the account submitted under your voucher No. 424 as this includes sewing material only.\n\nIt would, therefore, appear that no authority was given for the purchase of the articles covered by voucher 424 and I should appreciate it if you would let me know why you made the purchase without authority.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. D.P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Voucher No. 424\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter under date of Jan. 17th., relative to goods purchased for use at the Chetlain Day School.\n\nGoods required by the teacher at the Chetlain School were not all purchased at the same time. Voucher No. 304 took care of some of the purchases made and the balance under Voucher No. 424. Authority for the latter voucher should have read 33-2-II June 24th.\n\nThe only purchases over on above authority were for 8 yds. of twine $2.50; 6 spools of thread 30\u00a2; 3 pkgs. of needles 30\u00a2; and 5 yds. of duck $1.75. These articles were paid for under voucher No. 304. The reason for purchasing same being that the teacher advised goods were necessary to carry out her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nDear Sir:\n\nRepairs, Chatlain School\n\nWhile visiting the above school recently it was noted that minor repairs were needed on the coal bin and steps leading to the classroom on the South side of the building.\n\nThe coal bin and wood storage, which comprises three walls, is attached to the end of the school building proper. It is supported off the ground by loose stones piled on top of each other with the result that through frost heaving and the weight of fuel stored this building has become separated from the school. It will be necessary to put this building back into its proper position, level it and secure it well and put proper shoring underneath each corner in the form of stone and cement with intermediate piers between the corner ones.\n\nThe landing entrance to the classroom as well as some of the steps need replacement as the flooring is broken through and lumber will be required for this purpose. It is estimated that, along with some scrap lumber which is on hand, the following materials will be required to effect the necessary repairs at this school. In addition approximately $25.00 will be required for Indian labour. Materials will cost around $16.00.\n\n(Materials)\n7 # spikes 7\" 3 bags of cement\n6 # \" 6\" 2 tins chimney cement\n1 Gal. grey paint 3 Pkgs. alabastine # 15\n1 load of sand 30 pcs. T&G 1\"x4\"x6\" D2S (pine)\n\nAs coal is expected in shortly it will be necessary to start repairs to the coal storage immediately. It would be appreciated if authority would be granted to purchase the above materials locally so that this building can be put in shape without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 11, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to repairs required at the Chetlain Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department approves an expenditure of $41.00. It is noted that this includes the cost of both material and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D. P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSt. Regis Quebec,\nJuly 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe - repairs at Chetlain Indian Day school.\n\nWith reference to the enclosed vouchers #143 and 144, dated July 28, 1942, in the sums of $16.00 and $11.60 in favour of Jake George and Joe Sharrow for work done in connection with repairs at the marginally noted school.\n\nA new floor and steps were constructed at the south entrance of the school. Coal bin was raised and put in line; four additional buttments were built as additional support. Chimney was caulked where it emerges from the roof, also the chimney in the school room was replastered near the ceiling and repainted with alabastine. The roof, at the junction of the teacher's addition and the school-room was caulked to prevent seepage. Also the fire-box of the stove in the residence was relined. All woodwork of repairs was painted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, October 27, 1942.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRE: ST. REGIS Indian Agencies\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nI visited the Shetland and Chenail Schools and found the following repairs had been made.\n\nSHETLAND SCHOOL:\n- New concrete abutments under coal shed.\n- New steps and repairs to porch on south side entrance, bottom step being made of cement.\n- Caulking chimney and repairing wall in classroom; same repairs to chimney and to wall in teachers residence.\n\nCHENAIL SCHOOL:\n- New coal shed-back of school lot.\n- Two new outdoor toilets.\n- School painted one coat outside and inside.\n- New well platform\u2014a good cement job.\n- School foundation\u2014cement faced on four sides.\n\nJude Thibault,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe - repairs\nChatlain Indian Day School.\n\nAuthority is requested for expenditure in connection with repairs to fence around above M/N school grounds, and for repairs to floor of one of the toilet buildings. Indian labour will be used.\n\nThe fence requires installing of about 20 posts and the straightening and fastening of loose wires of the paga fence which will place the fence in condition to do for a further few years.\n\nToilet requires a few feet of scantling to strengthen the floor and one board \"XL\" X'8', repairs to seat.\n\nApproximate cost, Lumber - $3.00\nLabour - $9.00, $12.00.\n\nI wish to recommend your approval of this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 30, 1943.\n\nMr. D.P. McNaughton, Indian Agent, St. Regis, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, you may expend an amount of $12.00 for material and labour in repairing the fence at the Chetlain Indian Day School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR J. THIBAULT,\ndated June 7, 1945, on:\n\nCHENAIL SCHOOL\n\nThis school does not justify any repairs, being too old; attendance of twenty-four is too much for space available, and such conditions are far from being healthy. A new building is required and should be erected in a more central location - about on Lot No. 91 - the new building should provide for a two class school, with teachers' living quarters. This would do away with the CHETLAIN School, situated at the very end of the Reserve.\n\nCHETLAIN SCHOOL\n\nThis building is in good state of repair. If ever the relocation of the Chenail School is decided upon, as suggested, this building could easily be disposed of for an Indian residence.\nCornwall, Ont., October 19th, 1946.\n\nMines & Resources,\nDepartment of\n\nST.

August 30, 1921\n\nSir,\n\nMiss M. Kelly, teacher of the Chenaill Indian Day School, called at the Department today and requested a continuance of a grant allowed last year for living quarters for Miss Morris and herself. She was informed that the Department would continue to pay a rental at the rate of $10.00 a month for the living quarters for these two teachers and the necessary arrangements can be made with Mr. Sherrow by the teachers and yourself.\n\nThe Department will also pay for the fuel required for the use of the teachers in heating the rooms used by them but cannot provide fuel to heat any other part of the house in which they obtain accommodation. It should also be distinctly understood that no further arrangements will be made to provide any other equipment for living quarters for the teachers, as it is expected that the owners of the house will provide all the furniture and the other equipment required. You should arrange to supply a reasonable amount of fuel for heating purposes.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded from time to time covering the amount of the rent due at the above rate, namely, $10.00 a month.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.
