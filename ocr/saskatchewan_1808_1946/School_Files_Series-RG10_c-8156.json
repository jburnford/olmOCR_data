If 6 ft or so were added to the building, this addition could be partitioned off in the middle by folding doors to be thrown back when access to the altar would be needed.\n\nThe idea could be walled off one corner for the missionary's bunk, the other for a confessional. Besides a well could be put on the School House. This, however, we could purchase if need be. Indeed we are prepared to undergo costs in the other matters also if costs are made an argument against it.\n\nI am writing the Secretary.

Contractor said specifications did not provide for straps or hooks in cloakroom therefore they were not put in. Book-case should be provided for books and school material. Some provision for residence for teacher is required at this school. The nearest house where board might be obtained is about 4 miles distant and the intervening road is very bad. It would suffice to provide two rooms at the back of the present building with communication from the school-house.\nWith reference to the contents of your letter of the 24th inst., No. 31527/85, I have to say that Mr. McLean, contractor, offers to supply and place in position furnishings for the school house at Malagawatch as per annexed following, namely:\n\n- Six double desks @ $5.00 each = $30.00\n- Two chairs @ $3.00 each = $6.00\n- Four rear seats @ $1.00 each = $4.00\n- Two plain chairs @ $1.00 each = $2.00\n- One table for teacher fitted with drawer and book shelf @ $9.00\n- One cupboard with shelves to store supplies @ $5.00\n\nTotal = $60.00\n\nHe also offers to erect a small building for closets 8x8' ft. and 6x6' ft. porch, with exterior partition, two rooms, screened approaches, two small windows, one ventilation in centre of roof, two battery doors with false hinges, and hearths, and true dry earth floor - the roof to be shingled with clear cedar shingles and the walls with spruce shingles - for the sum of thirty five dollars ($35.00).\n\nAnd\n\nOne wood shed 14x10' ft. and 7' ft. peak at back, with two battery doors complete 6x6' x 8' ft., one small window, the walls boarded horizontally and battened, the roof boarded with rough boards and shingled with clear cedar shingles, finished around the eaves and other places where required; a floor of two inch spruce or hemlock slats - the building to be set on posts of hemlock or juniper sunk four (4) ft. deep - for the sum of seventy five dollars ($75.00).\n\nOr\n\nOne wood house 14x10' ft. and 7' ft. peak with pilot roof.\nrough boarded, the roof shingled with clear cedar shingles,\nthe walls with spruce shingles, plain finish around\nsashes and other parts where required, a floor of two\ninch spruce or hemlock deals, corner boards 4x5-10 in.,\none small window, two butter doors complete. After this\nthe building to be set on posts of hemlock or juniper\nabout four (4) ft. - for the sum of ninety dollars ($90.00).\n\nMr. McLean has said nothing about painting\nthe building, but I think that both closet and house\nshed, or wood house, should receive one coat sufficient\nat least, as having regard to the difference in the cost\nof the two buildings I should prefer the house to the shed.\n\nIn view of the difficulties and expense\nof transporting materials from the nearest railway station\nat Malagawatch, a distance of fifteen miles with very\nrough roads, I consider Mr. McLean's offers are quite\nreasonable and would recommend them a acceptance\nby the Department.\n\nMr. McLean is not prepared at present\nto give an estimate of the cost of sinking a well at\nMalagawatch Reserve, but will be in a position to do so a\nlittle later.

Boyd, Esq.,\n\"Indian Superintendent\"\nRiver Bourgeois, C.B.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Boyd,- Owing to the want of water, and other necessary accommodations for the Indian school and kitchen, within a reasonable distance, I am compelled to-day to move my family home at considerable expense. As for the well, I wish it could be completed in the near future, for it is a nuisance to have to haul water for about a mile distant, and even then to find the fresh water overflowed with the salt sea water. The kitchen stove, the school house stove and one of the stove pipes, are unfit for use in their present conditions. I have previously ordered these without any apparent avail, so I am compelled to move my family home until better accommodations are provided for, and it is not likely, I can come back myself to open the school before at least a couple of weeks. Mr. Murdoch McKay has again spoken to me about the banking of the school this fall, which he wishes you to give him. As Mr. McKay is a friend of mine, and very obliging, I wish you would advise him to do the banking at an early date, and to do it better than it has been; for last winter we almost froze in that building. The banking should commence with rough boarding from the ground to the flooring, and then with sufficient eelgrass, it could be thoroughly banked so as to make it comfortable in winter. But when not rough boarded, as above suggested, the cats make their way underneath the school through the eel-grass, let alone for the cold air. On my return to Malagawatch, I shall write you again after hearing from you.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Arsene Burns,\n\"Indian Teacher\"\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT.\n\nRIVER BOURGEOIS, N.S., 23rd October, 1911.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst., and to say that I regret very much the inconveniences you have experienced on account of serious defects, as you say, in the utilities mentioned.\n\nRespecting the kitchen stove, you will, no doubt, remember, when it was proposed to exchange it for another, you told me that it was then working well; that you had not understood it in the beginning, but having discovered what the trouble was you were quite satisfied with it; and that the necessity for making an exchange had been altogether obviated. Therefore, I have not given the matter any thought since, but I think no one can hold me to blame in that regard.\n\nAs to the school house stove and the stove pipe, it seems strange that there should be out of order, because they were new when the school was established two years ago and ought to be in good condition still, if properly cared for.\n\nAbout the well, I cannot understand why Mr. McDonald has not carried out my instructions and endeavoured to make it a success. He has not been paid for the work he already did at the well, and he knows that I do not intend to present the Department an account for his services in that respect, until it be practically demonstrated that no water can possibly be got where we have already excavated for it.\n\nI note what you say about banking the school house, and that work will be properly attended to in due time.\n\nHowever, I must submit your grievances to the Department and ascertain its wishes relative thereto, before I can undertake\n\nto\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian School,\nMalagawatch, N.S.\ndeal with them; because the Malagawatch school may possibly be closed in the near future, for a time, at least; and, therefore, it would be unwise for me make any new expenditure in connection with it until I receive particular instructions from the Department.\n\nFinally, I hope to be able to visit Malagawatch Reserve about the 10th. of November, when the different interests referred to above will have my personal attention, as the Department may desire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir,-\n\nI enclose herewith the copy of a letter quite recently received from Mr. Burns, Teacher, Malagawatch school, and of my reply to it.\n\nHis statement about hauling water \"a mile distant\" I believe to be bosh; and I have serious doubts about the validity of the reasons he gives for absenting himself from duty.\n\nIf the stove and the stove pipe in the school room are out of order, they must be that way since Spring, because they were not used all summer. Then why did not Mr. Burns bring their condition to my attention during vacation, or before the time came for opening school on the 29th. of August, so that repairs might be made while school was regularly closed? It must have been through neglect, and he is to blame.\n\nWith regard to the kitchen stove, the Department may do as it pleases; but I would be inclined to politely advise Mr. Burns to procure a stove to suit himself at his own expense, because the one he condemns was suitable and new two years ago, and should be in good condition still, if properly cared for.\n\nHowever, I shall endeavour to inquire fully into all the circumstances connected with the actual condition of school affairs at Malagawatch as soon as I can get round to it, and report the result of my investigation to the Department in due course, which will also be in line with your instructions in official letter of the 12th. inst., No.315275/1.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

Water was obtained by boring at the bottom of a well dug and curbed with stones two years ago, which proved a failure. (See official letter to me dated September 27th, 1912 and subsequent correspondence).\n\nThe cost of all operations up to the present for procuring water is about $70. To provide a suitable pump and necessary fixtures will entail a further outlay of $25. But Mr. Burns, the teacher, wants the water brought into his house, and to do that would require an extra expenditure of $15, making the total cost $110. Will the Department agree to accommodate Mr. Burns as he desires?\n\nIn any case, I would recommend charging him with the responsibility of keeping the pump and its metal connections, once these are correctly installed, in proper working order. Otherwise, the Department may be called upon very often to effect repairs rendered necessary through accidents resulting from the meddlesome curiosity of children and others.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

You may have a pump installed, but it is not considered necessary to have the water taken into the building used as a residence by the teacher.

I enclose an invoice for the coal, beside the coal purchase tally bill for oil and candles for same school. An oil can should last years, so should an oiled lamp and lamp chimneys. By referring to former bill you will, I think, find that such articles were purchased at the school, some of them even last year. If you want to make the teacher as careless and improvident as the Indians, if indeed she is not already worse than most of them, the whole bill call for payment. It would be well for you to notify Mrs. Burns that she will be held responsible for such articles and that her orders for the school are not to be filled or mislaid or delayed without your immediate consent.\n\nThe Secretary &c &c\n\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 26, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nRev. D. MacPherson, Indian Agent, has forwarded to the Department an account for $7.87 for articles supplied to the Malagawatch School.\n\nIt would appear that good care is not taken of some of the articles at this school. For example, it is only a year ago since an axe and axe handle were furnished for this school and in December, 1911, a complete set of linings for the cook stove was furnished. The Department wishes to know whether those purchased in January were for the cook stove or for the heater in the school-room. If it is the cook stove it would hardly appear to be necessary, as the stove is not long enough in use to require two new sets of lining. The Department will expect better care taken of these things in future. Also authority must be had from the Department for the making of all these purchases and all requests should be forwarded through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Molean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. MacPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, C.B.\nApril 7th, 1913\n\nSir,\n\nI may say that the \"cook stove\" in the kitchen needs to be heated, and our heater to keep the kitchen warm in winter. The fireplace (that is the kitchen hearth) is twice as cold as the bedroom room itself, and consequently should be provided with a better stove for heating the kitchen. The living room closed in January was certainly for the cook stove, as in the living room preceding year, there was a fireplace inside in the same place. (The two old places being rather narrow.) As per conveyance of the house, I may say that my wife believes them most occupy, and while both stoves appear very well outside, I cannot provide an answer for the inside in this case. Kitchen in winter, extra fuel must be used to keep it warm.\n\nIn future, however, I will make the necessary arrangements by the Department.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb 15 | 20 5-gals Kerosene @ 2\u00a2 for Malagamatch School | $1.20 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed, and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MACNEIL ON THE MALAGAWATCH SCHOOL.\n\nThe teacher complains that the house is very cold and it cannot well be otherwise. There is no underpinning, the house stands over a foot above the ground on a number of \"piles\" and thus the wind has full play under it, besides that it necessarily twists with every storm. For the sake of comfort as well as to preserve the building, a concrete foundation should be placed under it. There is no entrance to the living rooms except through the school room; I would recommend that a door be opened into the kitchen, first enlarging the porch to the required size. There is just the necessary space. There are four knobs required for the doors and the out-buildings require some repairs.\n\nSeeing that the building is said to be so very cold, I think it would be advisable to provide a base-burner for hard coal so that a continuous fire could be maintained during the severest part of the winter. The location of the building is very exposed.\n\nSCHOOL FURNITURE REQUIRED:-\n1 wash basin; 1 axe; 2 boxes castile soap; 6 towels;\n6 drinking cups.\n\nDate of Inspection.- May 16th, 1915.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo John A.

The exception has reference to the school house at Malagawatch, which should receive two coats of paint on the outside as soon as it is closed for the summer vacation. I shall submit an estimate in due time of what this work would probably cost.\n\nA. J. Boyd,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMay 19, 1924.\nOttawa, May 20th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on educational matters at the various schools in the Province of Nova Scotia for the last fiscal year, I beg to say with reference to the painting of the school house at Malagawatch that the department will await your estimate of the probable cost of having this work done. If it is decided to authorize the painting, the work can be performed during the coming summer holidays. You should state how you would propose having the labour in performing the painting carried out. The department would prefer that arrangements be made to have it done by day labour, and that a competent person be engaged to do the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nReferring to your letter of May 20th, in connection with the painting of the Indian school house at Malagawatch, I beg to say that my estimate of the probable cost of the work is two hundred dollars ($200.00).\n\nThe outside walls of the building require two coats of paint, and some work should be done in the school room also. Inside doors and finishings particularly require painting.\n\nThe amount specified should cover the total cost, and I recommend having the work done by day labour during the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 10th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the painting of the Malagawatch Indian Day School building, and stating the approximate cost of having the work done.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the painting of the exterior of the building, also the inside doors and finishings, with 2 coats of paint of a good quality. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to purchase the paint required and for the labour employed. You should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers, and purchase the paint from the firm quoting the lowest price. You may engage the services of a competent man to act as foreman, as well as any Indian labour that may be required to assist him. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept for the labour employed. This work should be carried out during the present summer holidays. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the paint and also for any brushes required. These vouchers should be supported by an abstract of tender form, showing the names of the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. The time sheets for the labour should be certified by you. It is noted that you estimate that the cost of the material and labour will not exceed approximately $200.00.\n\nPlease arrange to purchase the paint and have the work started at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Daniel MacLean, of Orangedale, N.

The teacher thought she was privileged to purchase supplies when necessary, and in view of the excellent use she made of them, as intimated in my school report for the past year, I am not disposed to find fault in this case. However, I have instructed her to make requisition in future through me, or the Agent, for whatever supplies may be needed in her school.\n\nThe expenditure for items of hardware was authorized by me.\n\nI recommend payment of the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

In future, however, this teacher as well as several of the other teachers in Indian schools on Cape Breton Island should be definitely instructed that they have no authority to incur such expenditures. All school material is supplied through the Government Stationery Office here upon receipt of requisitions prepared by the teacher and forwarded through the office of the local Indian Agent. Teachers should anticipate their wants in due time and prepare requisitions for the school material required, which they should forward to the Department as above stated. Any other supplies needed, or repairs required, should also be brought to the attention of the Agent, who should report same to the Department and receive authority before incurring any expenditure. It will be difficult in future to pay any accounts for school material ordered by teachers. I shall be pleased if you will inform all the teachers regarding the procedure to be adopted by them in requisitioning for supplies. Only in cases of emergency should purchases be made without the authority of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J.

The one used there last term was the kitchen stove of the same school. The teacher intended to live in the kitchen this winter, as she had to walk two miles or over to the nearest available and proper boarding house. Consequently she will need the kitchen stove where it belongs.\n\nAs the weather is getting colder now, the children will need heat from this day. Be good enough, therefore, to authorize the purchasing of this stove.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. M. Maclean\nAgent\nOttawa, September 18, 1924.\n\nRev.

You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the stove and for any stove pipes, elbows, etc., that may be required to properly set up the stove.

If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. After the purchase has been made, please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost, together with receipts for freight or other charges.\n\nIf you consider the Inspector's suggestion relative to the painting of the outside of the chimney should be carried out, you may arrange to have the work done at as low a cost as possible.\n\nI should be pleased to hear from you later as to the action taken in supplying the stove and with reference to the painting of the chimney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When this arrives, please arrange to have it installed in the classroom.\n\nRegarding the stove for the schoolroom, I beg to say that we are requesting Mr. Superintendent Boyd to arrange for the purchase and delivery of a stove of the type considered suitable to meet the requirements, and he will, no doubt, attend to this matter in due course.\n\nYou may also purchase and have delivered the following equipment, viz: - 1 broom; 2 kitchen chairs; 2 combs; 12 graniteware cups; 1 large sauce pan; 1 cheap looking glass; 1 galvanised pail; 12 bars soap; 4 yards towelling and 2 wash basins.\n\nYou may also purchase a small quantity of cocoa, sugar, Klim, biscuits and cheese to be used in giving the pupils a midday lunch. It is not intended that the pupils be supplied with a full meal at midday, but the hot drink, biscuits and cheese are to augment the lunch brought by the pupils from their homes.\n\nNo unnecessary expense should be incurred in the purchase of the articles which you are authorized to obtain, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded by you covering the expenditure incurred. Please have all purchases made and the articles delivered in order that the teacher can start the serving of the lunch when the school reopens after the Christmas holidays. This midday lunch is to be furnished the pupils until the end of April, next.\n\nThe Department will forward to the teacher 18 toothbrushes, and she should see that the children use same each day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

The latter, I suggest a map of Nova Scotia, a map of Canada, and a map of Cape Breton. Since this term, the toilet has fallen into hopeless disrepair. Schools should have a toilet for each of the sexes. It is true that we may expect Indians to go to the woods, but since we have \"civilized\" them, then we should provide toilets.\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nPort Hood\nI know that I am not asked or expected to comment upon matters apart from the school; but may I be permitted to say that the road to the school from the main road is impassable in both spring and fall; probably impassable in summer as well. The distance is a quarter-mile. Visitors are desirable, but the road to the school is such that neither doctor nor priest, inspector, nor anyone else can travel it with a car.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT\n\nMalagawatch Indian School\nDate of visit May 19, 1939\n\nPost Office address of school Big Harbour Island, Newfoundland, N.S.\n\nGrades I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX\n\nEnrolled 12\nPresent 10\n\nTeacher Colin Kennedy\nLicence (or certificate) Grade XI\nValid to November 10\nTaught last term in same school\nTotal teaching experience 10 years\nService in Indian school 6 years\nConventions attended\n\n| LOW | HIGH |\n|-----|------|\n| Appearance | |\n| Health | |\n| Personality | |\n| Initiative | |\n| Discipline | |\n| Relations | |\n| Management | |\n| Teaching skill | |\n| Preparations | |\n| Language | |\n| Community service | |\n| Pupils' progress | |\n\nGeneral comment:\n(1) The road to the school is soon to be repaired and gravelled, in accordance with a recommendation made by you last fall.

A rough sketch is enclosed showing where the extension should be carried out.\n\nIn the mean time Mr. McLean may be instructed to go on with the wood-shed and closets. Single closets should be put up at a suitable distance apart so that they can be properly separated and screened. The shed selected will be the one for which a price of $75.00 was quoted, but the Department does not consider it will be necessary to floor it and a reduction should be made in consequence, and these outbuildings should be given one coat of paint. The school should be banked.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nup all round before the cold weather sets in. Will you kindly get Mr. McLean's price for the extension as soon as possible?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., No. 35319, and to say, with regard to the matter referred to in the second paragraph, that Mr. McRee offers to put up, for the sum of three hundred and eighty-five dollars ($385), an extension for the residence of a teacher in the rear of the present building, of the size indicated by the rough sketch furnished by the Department; the materials to be of the same character and quantities as those used in the construction of the school house, except in the case of the interior finish.\n\nMr. McRee states that the season is getting too late for good work to be done with plaster finish in a place like Malapamulato, and that it would be better to use sheathing instead, which would be quite as expensive as the plaster.\n\nThis offer supposes that the extension would require to be constructed and finished so as to conform in every respect to the design of the present building. Viewing the matter in that light, and considering the time of year when delays due to unfavorable weather will be unavoidable, I believe that his tender is reasonable, and therefore recommend its acceptance.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 26th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you state that Mr. McLean, the contractor for the Malagawatch school building, will put up an extension for a teacher's residence in the rear of the new building, of the size indicated on the sketch furnished by the Department, for the sum of $355.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will accept this offer, and you may authorize Mr. McLean to go on with the work.

McDonald, Malagawatch, N.S., the only one I have been able to obtain for sinking a well to supply water for the Indian School there.\n\nHe offers to bore for water, and to supply the necessary metal pipe for conveying it to the surface, besides a sink and a pump, for $1.25 per foot, which I consider reasonable. Any piping required to connect the school house with the well, if it should be thought necessary to make the connection, would be extra; and in the event of failure to get water by boring, he would expect to be paid 50 cents per foot at any rate.\n\nI could get no one to make a definite offer to excavate for a well, and to wall its sides with either stones or cement. I believe such a well would prove more satisfactory in the end; and I would advise employing some reliable person by the day to provide one of that description.\n\nThe Department instructed me last Fall to invite tenders for this service, which I did, with the result that up to the present I have received only one definite offer\u2014 that mentioned above from Mr. McDonald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

McClean, Esq.,\nSecretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have not yet been supplied with the necessary materials to complete the attic of the kitchen attached to the school, as per your letter of Feb. 8th, '99. And the proposed water supply has not yet been provided for. I would be much pleased if these matters could be taken up immediately; for it will be very much needed before the frosts. As it is now I can manage to get good water by going far enough, but in the fall and winter, the spring from which I can now get water, gets overflowed by the salt water, and it is then no big nice to have to use melted snow or rain water for drinking purposes. I therefore hope and trust that these important matters will be promptly attended to. The kitchen stone I have for cooking purposes is unfit for baking bread. I could not yet get a good loaf bread or cakes of any kind with that stone. I would therefore be much pleased if it could be exchanged for a better stone. This small heating stove is a wasting of good flour.\n\nBelieve me, Your sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n\"Indian Teacher\"\nOttawa, September 27, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the questions of a water supply and finishing the addition to the school building at Malagawatch will be taken up with Mr. Boyd.\n\nThe Department is not prepared at present to exchange the stove, for which a good price was paid. You might, however, state why, in your opinion, this stove is not satisfactory. I may add for your information that it is not customary for the Department to supply household equipment for married teachers and when the furnishings were put in the addition it was on the presumption that a single teacher who would board himself or herself would occupy the quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nArsene Burns, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Harbor Island P.O., N.S.\nOttawa, September 27, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nLast spring Mr. Burns, teacher of the Malagawatch school, asked the Department to complete the attic of the addition used as a teacher's residence. He stated that it would require one thousand feet of shathing, ten pounds of two inch nails and one double window. The Department has been awaiting a report from you, but evidently this has not come to hand. No doubt, however, you looked into the matter when you visited the school. It would appear necessary for Mr. Burns' accommodation to complete this attic and you should obtain as soon as possible an estimate of the cost of material and labour, so that the work, if decided upon, may be done before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Oct. 8th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No. 3162 75/8, I beg to say that I had not understood from the Department that it expected a report from me relative to the request of Mr. Burns, teacher at the Valagawatch school, to complete for his accommodation the attic of the addition used by him as a teacher's residence.\n\nIn speaking to me last spring, Mr. Burns stated that he had been in communication with the Department about the matter, and, as a result, was promised that it would be attended to in due time.\n\nHowever, as you surmise, while I had the opportunity, I looked the situation over carefully and made myself acquainted with the necessities of the case. I am, therefore, in a position to state that the increased accommodation desired by Mr. Burns can be provided at a total outlay not exceeding eighty-five dollars. I can get a thoroughly capable mechanic to complete the attic of the addition now occupied by the teacher for the sum mentioned, and I recommend that the work be done as soon as possible, because Mr. Burns has really need of more accommodation for his family.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ.

The accounts should show the materials purchased with prices and also the wages paid.\n\nYou will be good enough to give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

Oct. 6th.,\n\nSir,-\n\nMr. Burns, Teacher of the Malagawatch School, complains that\nthe cook stove he uses (it was furnished by the Department) does\nnot suit his purpose at all. He says that, besides being quite\nunsatisfactory for cooking purposes generally, it is impossible to\nmake good bread with it.\n\nNo doubt the trouble is this:- The stove was intended to\naccommodate one person, or two, at most. Consequently, a small one\nwas procured, which is not suitable for Mr. Burns' family of seven\nmembers. I dare say that Mr. MacAulay, from whom it was purchased,\nwould be willing to exchange it for a larger and suitable stove by\npaying the difference in value between them. If so, I think this\nshould be done, as an unsatisfactory cooking apparatus is very apt\nto sour the disposition of the cook and make things unpleasant for\nall concerned.\n\nIt is useless to tell Mr. Burns to provide himself with a\nstove that will meet his requirements, because he lacks the means\nand cannot do it. I am only too well aware that the man is poor,\nvery poor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D.

The cost of these articles would be about $40.00.\n\nI cannot very well see what use she may have for six cups & saucers, and for as many plates, knives, forks and spoons, as I understand that the only occupants of the residence would be herself and her sister. She has been boarding at a place one and a half from her school; but the road she must travel being very bleak and not used in winter, she can board there no longer. It is necessary for her to live near the school during the winter months in order to keep it in operation.\n\nHer average attendance of pupils during December quarter was 15.15, which indicates that every available pupil on the reserve must have attended school regularly, and that the Indians appreciate her services.\n\nI recommend that an expenditure of $40.00 be authorized to procure the articles enumerated in the inclosed memo., subject to such modification as I may be able to make.

Macdonald\nIndian Agent\nVictoria County\nNova Scotia\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nExtract - original on 235086\n\nOttawa Nov. 1902\n\nSir: (Middle River)\n\nThe teacher Mr. A. Mc Dougall holds a grade C, 2nd Class Provincial certificate. This seems to entitle him to, and he draws, a grant from the Provincial Government of $90 or a little less per annum. He has had much experience in rural schools and seems to be very competent.\n\nThe register in use is a Provincial one, not one of the Departments. This should not be the case as it is important to have the Indian course of study, which is printed on the Department's register, constantly before teachers and to insist upon them following it. They are generally prone to follow the same lines in teaching Indian children as they do in teaching those...\nthose of English speaking parents and the result is far from being the same because the teaching of the first is in a tongue not native to the children. In consequence they do not understand the work they do. The course of study directs teachers attention strongly to this fact and gives them directions regarding it.\n\n(Agd) J.A. Macrae\n\nS.S. A.R.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 27th November, 1902\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn my memorandum of the 17th instant, file 117552, with reference to the salary paid the teacher of the Eskasoni school, I called attention to the fact that the teacher at Middle River was also only paid at the rate of $200.00 per annum. You have been pleased to authorize an increase of $50.00 for the teacher at Eskasoni and I think that Mr. McDougall, the teacher at Middle River, is entitled to like consideration, as he is reported to have had much experience in rural schools and is said to be very competent. I may add that he is now the only teacher in the Lower Provinces receiving less than $250.00 a year. Funds are available for this increase.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Dec 2nd 1902\n\nMr. Beaum\n\nAn application has been received from Mr. M. D. Gayall for an increase.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 3rd December, 1902\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry I beg to say that Mr. McDougall, teacher of the Middle River school, has not applied for an increase of salary. He is, however, the only teacher in the Lower Provinces who is receiving less than $250.00 and as the Estimates are now under consideration I thought it only fair that he should be placed on the same footing as the others who receive that amount. Mr. McDougall has been in charge of this school for five years and the reports of Mr. Public School Inspector McKinney who visits this school semi-annually show that he is well qualified for the position and is reasonably successful. In his general remarks on this school the Inspector says that the residence of the teacher with his family on the reserve has a valuable educational influence in many directions quite apart from what is communicated in the schoolroom. It was to enable the teacher to maintain this position that I suggested that his salary be increased to $250.00.\n\nI may add that the Department has lately put up a new schoolhouse on the reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Beaven\nWhycocomagh,\n\nAug. 29th 1903\n\nMr. M. Douglas Scott,\nTeacher, Nyanga, Victoria Co.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Dept. of Education has intimated to me that it is doubtful whether, for the future the Government of Nova Scotia will continue to pay to teachers of Indian schools the same or the school grant they have hitherto been receiving.\n\nIn that event, I hope that the Department at Ottawa will make such an addition to your salary as will at least be equivalent to what you are now receiving.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. M. Kinross\nV. Inspector\nDivision No. 8\nA. Macdonald\nVictoria County, Nova Scotia\n\n116774\n\nRadock, Nova Scotia\nSept. 5th 1903\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find a letter from School Inspector McKinnon to the Teacher Mr. Dougall on the Indian Reserve. In view of the recent government of Nova Scotia proposed action in this matter, Mr. Dougall informs me that if it is carried out he cannot continue teaching on the Indian Reserve for the amount at present provided for by your Department viz $200. As the price of living he has come up as well as the wages of all classes of men he states that he cannot teach there for less than $350. After the past number of years he has been served $200 from your Department and $80 per year from the School Trust provided by the government of Nova Scotia. I may say that it will be impossible for me to obtain a teacher for $200. In fact it is not an easy matter to get a good teacher of respectable character to go to teach there under any consideration.\n\nThe Department are to be congratulated in having a man\nof Mr. McDougall's good moral character as a teacher on the Reserve in this County and his leaving would be a distinct loss.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTours and Servant\n\nA. Macdonald\nIndian Agent\nVictoria City\n\nTo the\nSecy Dept of\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, 14th September, 1903.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 5th instant inclosing a communication addressed by Mr. Public School Inspector McKinnon to Mr. McDougall, teacher of the Middle River Indian School advising him of the discontinuance of the grant made by the Government of Nova Scotia to teachers of Indian schools which amounted in this instance to about $90.00 a year and requesting on behalf of Mr. McDougall that provision be made for a salary of $350.00 a year for his salary as teacher of this school in future.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that it is now too late to do anything towards meeting the teacher's views as the estimates for the current year are all closed.

I regret this very much as he was a good, faithful teacher but he told me that as the Local Government or rather the Council of Public Instruction of Nova Scotia proposed cutting the free school from all teachers on Indian Reserves, the balance of $240 allowed per year by the Dept. of Indian Affairs should not compensate him for his time & trouble on the Reserve and that he decided to throw up the School and go to America to reside.\n\nThere was a very urgent vacancy keen of Grade B.

This, to my mind, is a mean, paltry piece of business. What can you do to assist in having a teacher secured for the Indian Settlement at Middle River.

Ross M.P., enclosing a communication from Mr Agent Macdonald of Baddeck, in regard to the proposal of the Council of Public Instruction of Nova Scotia to withdraw its contributions towards the salaries of teachers of Indian schools, I beg to say that I do not see that this Department can do anything to have the grant continued, as the Provincial Government is under no obligation to contribute towards the support of Indian schools. I may say, in fact, that this Department had no official knowledge of such grants being made and in providing for the salaries of teachers of schools in that Province, no account was taken of their salaries being so supplemented.\n\nThe salary provided for the teacher of this school is only $200.00, which is an exceedingly small amount to offer. In a memorandum of 3rd December last I suggested that a larger provision be made for this school, and although this is all that is voted, I think that if the General School appropriation could stand it, an increase of $100.00 might fairly be given as the Department will find it a most difficult matter to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for any less than $300.00 per annum.\nMO. 95.

Without said grant the salary received from the Indian Department viz. $800.00 is too small considering the expenses of living at present, and I would feel greatly obliged if you would make an effort & have my salary increased to $400.00 & $450 such increase to begin from the time that the Provincial Grant ceased viz. June last. Mr. MacInnis will likely be acting & obtain a like increase for the teacher in the newly constructed Indian School and by writing forces I should think that it would be a comparatively easy task for you to obtain this.\n\nThis school is in Pilling District No. 10, where I am a registered voter.

The complaint if true is a serious charge and I would like to be in a position to investigate this matter of the complaint further.\n\nI may say that I found that the school on the Indian Reserve was never in a worse off condition.

Besides, I have been personally acquainted with the Indians being amongst them since childhood.

McKenzie, of St. Patrick's Channel, Victoria Co., C.B., for the position of teacher of the Middle River Indian school. Mrs. McKenzie encloses a copy of a recommendation from the late Inspector, Mr. John McKinnon.\n\nThe only apparent objection to Mrs. McKenzie's taking charge of this school is on the score of religion, she being a Protestant. She says that if she were to teach there, that would not interfere. The Department would like you to communicate with the missionary and find out whether he would be willing that a Protestant take charge of this school.\n\nPlease attend to this matter at once, as the Department is desirous that the school should be reopened as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

MacKenzie of St. Patrick's Church in this county for the position of teacher of the Middle River Indian School, I may report that I have communicated with the Reverend Mr. MacKenzie of St. John's who is the missionary clergyman for the Indians on the Middle River Reserve as to whether he would be willing that a Protestant take charge of this school.\n\nHis reply to me is that he is decidedly opposed to a Protestant teacher being engaged for that school. He pointed out to me that teachers of the Roman Catholic religion have invariably been employed there in the past and he would not consent to have any teacher of any other religious persuasion employed there.\n\nI am in hopes of getting a teacher of that religion to take charge of the Indian School after the Christmas holidays.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA.J.

She holds no license complying with our provincial qualifications authorizing her to teach although she holds a high school certificate or qualification of Grade C or Second Class.\n\nI believe she would make a good faithful teacher and as her qualification outside of the question of license is good, and more than ample for what she will be called upon I would recommend that she be engaged for the remainder of the present school year. She is a woman of discretion, a Roman Catholic and would be acceptable to the Roman Catholic missionary attending to the spiritual needs of the Indians of the Middle River Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.H.

It is hoped that you will renew your efforts after the summer holidays to improve the attendance and, as an encouragement to the children, a further grant of $5.00 will be made in December, next, to be expended in accordance with your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. Annie McNeill,\nTeacher,\nNyanza, N.S.\nOttawa, September 22, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to official letter of July 18th last, and previous correspondence I beg to say that the last report of the School Inspector on the Middle River School, which has just come to hand, shows that the attendance is still very poor. The Inspector suggests that you should visit the Indian families in their homes and encourage them to send their children to school. This is certainly a good suggestion and many of our Indian teachers by this means have been able to greatly improve the attendance at their schools.\n\nThe Department would like you to make a very special effort during the next few months and, as you have already been informed, a grant of $5.00 will be made for prizes at the close of the December quarter, to be given as rewards for regularity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. Annie McNeill,\nTeacher,\nNyanza, N.S.\nNyanga, V.C.\nDec 29th 1910\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your letter of September 2nd 1910, prizes have been given for regularly in attendance at Middle River Indian School.\n\nTo the following:\n\nMagdalen Matton 11 Years - 1st Prize\n- A Coat Sweater, a Neck Wrap, a Pair of Gloves or Stockings\n\nJo Mary Francis 7 Years - 2nd Prize\n- A Coat Sweater, a Neck Wrap or a Pair of Gloves\n\nJoseph Paine 7 Years - 3rd Prize\n- A Shirt or a Coat\n\nThey were sent by the Agent, Mr. McDonald at Baddeck, and are most satisfactory.\n\nThe report of Inspector as you say, reported attendance poor. I am pleased to say that this quarter has been better. The average was 8.4.\nThe school was closed for 15 days owing to whooping cough. There was only one death, therefore I may say that I am quite accustomed to visiting the children's homes & they visit me. I do all I can to encourage them to attend... As is customary in this place, I would advise giving the children a meal at mid-day. Their homes are far from school for a stormy day, the children being even say a biscuit or two for each. I am merely suggesting this, it would benefit all the children. I think if such would be done the judge could be dispensed with, at least to give it a trial. Might not be amiss.\n\nI hope that the Dept will be able to give the teacher here a house to live in. There is only one building available for such, & it is not at all fit for the winter & is too far from the school so I am sure Mr. Boyd can verify\u2014a road is impossible to get within a mile or half of the Reserve.\n\nTrusting you may give my statement consideration.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. Annie McNeil,\nTeacher, Middle River Indian Agency.\nOttawa, January 5, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in reference to several matters affecting the Middle River Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the distribution of prizes as reported is satisfactory. It is also pleasing to note that there has been some improvement in the attendance during the past quarter.\n\nYour suggestion to supply a simple mid-day meal is also approved and I have to ask you to be good enough to state definitely what supplies you think would be most suitable and whether you are in a position to prepare this meal. I may add that in some places the Department furnishes bread, a little bacon, molasses, tea and sugar to supplement the lunches brought from home by the children. It might be possible for you to arrange to prepare a simple meal of this kind in the school-room with the assistance of the older girls. As soon as the Department hears from you further instructions will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMrs. Annie McNeil,\nTeacher,\nMiddle River Indian School,\nNyanza, N.O.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your correspondence of January 5th re Middle River Indian School & the preparation of a mid-day meal for the children of the same, to supplement that brought from home by the children. They say that I can prepare the same with the assistance of the older girls in the school room, with the exception of bread which I might bring baked from home, or could be supplied by the ladies who assist me. The beans can also be baked in house or brought to the school to take the place of bacon some days. There would need to be some fish for Fridays. Which might be better of the canned variety or something not requiring much cooking. The tea can be made in the school room or bacon can be cooked there. As to quantity, I will not be able to say. You can judge from what you send to Miss Solvato, for one month, again, we will want cooking utensils, teapot, tea kettle, frying pan, plates, cups, cans, knives, forks, spoons, towels, for cooking, dishes, &c., bowls, soap, wash basin, water buckets, &c.\n\n[Seal]\n\nJanuary 30th 1911\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is thought that the children should bring the bread from their homes, but if this cannot be done you may purchase a small quantity each week. I may say that the cost of this simple meal as given in other schools ranges from 1\u00bd to 2 cents per pupil per day. It is not considered advisable to supply any canned goods such as suggested by you. You should buy a sufficient quantity of these supplies to last a month.\n\nYou may also purchase a teapot, tea kettle, frying pan and a few agate plates, cups and saucers and a few cheap knives, forks and spoons, also some towelling, soap, wash basin and water bucket.\n\nYou will be good enough to confer with the Agent in regard to these purchases and show him this letter, which is your authority.

I think such a move should be encouraged.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nI think that some regulation should be in force which would compel the children to attend school more regularly. I would suggest that the teacher be instructed to give more time to the \"Conversational\" method of teaching English. \"Berlitz Method of Teaching English\" would be a good text for guidance.\n\nSgd.

The teacher should send in at the end of each month through your office a report on this night school showing the attendance and progress made, so that the Department may be in a position to know whether the Indians are taking advantage of the privilege granted them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Better progress, he says, would be made by the pupils and it would be more satisfactory in every way to himself. However, he is willing to abide by what you say in the matter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, December 19, 1923.\n\nRev.

McIntosh,\nIndian Agent,\nBaddeck, N.S.\nReport of Inspector James MacKinnon Middle River School.\n\nSchool was inspected on November 25th, 1913.\n\nLack of interest and absence of parental control over children cause unsatisfactory attendance\u2014the children do pretty much as they please. The absence of control over the children by the parents handicaps the teacher very much in the exercise of his authority. Complete separation from the parents during the school term appears to be the only remedy. In the meantime an appropriation to be expended by the teacher in purchasing little prizes for attendance, progress etc., would help. I recommend the use of the 'Berlitz Method of teaching English'.\nReport of Night School at Middle Reserve for January 1914.\n\n| Standard | Average attendance for January |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| Men      | Girls                          |\n| Band     | 1 2 3 4 5 6                    |\n| Enrolled | 26 19 7 Micmac                 |\n|          | 8 8 4 6                        |\n\n442363\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief E.

This increase to be dependent upon his carrying out the Inspector's recommendation - the establishment of a school garden.\n\nI note from the reports that the attendance at this school has been very poor, and the late Agent, Rev. Mr. McIntosh, in his report for December recommended a simple mid-day meal. It might be well to carry out Mr. McIntosh's suggestion to see if any improvement will be effected.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nMarch 3rd, 1914.\n\nDear Senator Girvin:\n\nReferring to our conversation of recent date, I have looked into the matter of salary paid Mr. Morin, Teacher of the Middle River School, and have given instructions that he be granted an increase of $50.00 from the first of the current quarter upon condition that he carries out the recommendation made by the Inspector, that a school garden be established; this I have no doubt he will do.\n\nWhile the late Agent's report on Mr. Morin's work was very satisfactory I am sorry that the report of the Public School Inspector of the district was not so favourable. It may be, however, that Mr. Morin's work still improves and that at some time in the future he will prove worthy of a further increase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nHon. E. L. Girvin,\nThe Senate, Ottawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 4, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that it has been decided to increase the salary of Mr. McRea, teacher of the Middle River Indian School, to $450.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter. This increase is to be dependent upon his carrying out the recommendation of the inspector for the establishment of a school garden.\n\nThe late Agent Rev. Mr. McIntosh, recommended that a simple mid-day meal should be provided for the children attending this school and the Department is prepared to give this a trial. You may expend the sum of $10.00 in the purchase of the necessary supplies for this purpose and it is hoped that this will have the effect of increasing the attendance at this school, which has been very poor of late.\n\nOn the 3rd ultimo Mr. McIntosh was asked to state whether there is land suitable for gardening in connection with this school and, if so, what would be the probable cost of putting it in proper shape to commence this work in the spring. Kindly let the Department have this information as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn F. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBaddeck, N.S.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

Having announced during my visit in February that prizes would be given for good attendance, Seems to have the desired effect, I would therefore suggest that the ten dollars you authorized me to spend for mid-day meal be given in prizes.\n\nJohn. E.Campbeell\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nIn your March report on the Middle River School, you recommend that prizes be given for regular attendance instead of the mid-day meal.\n\nIn reply, I would say that the Department does not give prizes for monthly attendance. On the other hand, it has been found that the giving of a mid-day meal has encouraged regular attendance.\n\nYou will, therefore, kindly carry out the instructions given you in official letter dated March 4th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You may expend the sum of $10.00 in the purchase of the necessary supplies for this purpose and it is hoped that the attendance at this school will be increased.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBaddeck, N.S.\nSir,\n\nFrom Letter of March 16th 1917\n\nReceived, and in reply beg to say, that there is a white boy going home twice to the Indian School.\n\nHe is an orphan boy who lives two and keeps Mike from the Public School, and during the stormy weather would not be able to attend the White School. And I asked the Indian teacher if it would be any favor to send the Indian children for this boy to go to the Indian School when unable to get to the active school, and the teacher said it would not interfere with the teaching of the Indian children, that it might be more help to the Indians as the boy was bright and anxious to learn and might cause them to try and keep up to him.\n\nSo I told the teacher to let the boy come to the school during the stormy weather, and the teacher informs me that during his short stay at the school helped to make the Indian children more eager to learn in order to keep up to him.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn E.

At his time of life it is not so easy for him to change his manner of living from teaching to something else which might bring him more money and I need not take much time in impressing upon a practical man like yourself, that under present conditions it is absolutely impossible for a man to support himself and a family on $400. a year and I feel confident that the Canadian people will back you up and approve of your action in giving those teachers a living salary.\n\nI trust therefore that you will comply with Mr. McRae's request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMCK/H\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nFebruary 28, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie -\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd inst., in reference to the teacher of the Middle River Reserve. It would appear that you have not been correctly informed regarding Mr. Macrae's salary. He is paid $500.00 per annum and has received that during the four years past. I think you will agree with me that this is a fair salary for a teacher with Mr. Macrae's qualifications. He has not been particularly successful in the school. I think too that this salary compares favourably with salaries paid in rural schools of the Province for teachers of this standing. Of course we have to be largely guided by the Provincial Standards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nD. D. McKenzie, Esq., K.C.,\nMacrae, McKenzie & Macmillan,\nBarristers, Solicitors, etc.,\nNorth Sydney, N.S.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Middle River Indian School, December 3rd, Original on 116774-6.\n\nGeneral conditions in this school are not satisfactory. The attendance is poor and the discipline weak. The parents are not \"interested\" and the truant officer does not do his duty. There can be no progress without fairly good attendance and proper discipline. If good attendance can be secured and some discipline brought about one might look for a little progress.\n\nLack of interest on part of parents and failure of truant officer to do his duty are chief causes for poor attendance. Recommend rigid enforcement of \"Compulsory Attendance\" regulations and missionary work among parents with a view to interesting them in the cause of education. Some parents say that their children cannot attend school owing to lack of clothing. Prizes consisting of clothing, to be given on the completion of satisfactory attendance and progress at the end of each quarter, might stimulate attendance.\n\nJas. MacKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, January 3, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Public School Inspector MacKinnon, in a report on his recent inspection of the Middle River Indian Day School, states that the general conditions in this school are not satisfactory; the attendance is poor and the discipline weak and the truant officer does not do his duty. He states that, if a good attendance could be secured and some discipline brought about, one might look for a little progress.\n\nYou should draw the attention of the teacher to the Inspector's remarks regarding the discipline and inform him that it is expected that he will see that proper discipline is maintained in the class-room. He should use his influence with the parents to see that they send their children more regularly to school. You will be good enough to inform the present truant officer that if his duties are not performed more faithfully his services will have to be dispensed with and if he does not show more interest in his duties you should endeavour to secure the services of a competent person to look after the duties of truant officer. I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding these matters and it is hoped that there will be a decided improvement on the occasion of the Inspector's next visit as regards discipline at the school and an increased attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn E. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRaddeek, N.S.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan 3/21\n\n#63-1-1 in reference to report of Inspector McKinnon in re Indian School, Middle River.\n\nThe attendance was small on the day he visited the school, and that was owing to many of the children attending school were sick or unable to go to school for want of shoes or clothing.\n\nAs to the discipline part, I consider it very good, and I consider that the teacher Mr. Mc Rae is keeping very good order, and as for the truant officer I find he is doing the best in his power to get the children to attend school. I went with him myself to every Indian house in order to help him to get the parents to keep their children in school regular; and I discovered that nine of the children were unable to attend school for want of shoes and clothing. They promised me to attend regular at school if fitted out for it.\n\nI informed them that I was going to write the Department to see what I could do for them.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nI am building a cottage here where my presence is quite necessary with the workmen as I am getting it built by day's wages. I got along very well since I began 1st July. Now I am going to ask you a favour. If I should find by the 1st September next ensuing that I would like to stay for 2 or 3 weeks more with the job will you be so good as to ask the Dept. of Indian Affairs if I would be allowed to get a substitute for that length of time to teach in any place in the Middle River Indian Reserve School Victoria County, N.B.? The person I have in view wrote for Grade \"B\" at the last Provincial examinations for teacher license and I feel quite confident...\nis capable of teaching in M.R. Reserve School.\n\nI would open school there and get my substitute started and acquainted with the pupils and the time table etc., etc.\n\nAn early reply would greatly oblige me so I could make arrangements beforehand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn C. Mac Rae\nOttawa, August 12th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, requesting authority to engage the services of a substitute to carry on the work as teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School from the 1st of September next, for a period of two or three weeks, to enable you to complete the building of a cottage.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that provided the substitute engaged by you is satisfactory to the local Indian Agent, Mr. John E. Campbell, the Department will have no objections to your arranging for such substitute to teach until you are able to resume duties. We are informing Mr. Agent Campbell, Baddeck, N.S., of your request for the appointment of a substitute for a few weeks. I may say that he will be requested to inform you as to whether he approves or not. If a substitute is appointed the Department will expect you to arrange for the payment of salary which you allow him, and you should prepare and sign the quarterly returns of attendance, days taught, etc., for the September quarter, when a cheque in payment of the amount due will be made in your favour and sent you.\n\nI have to request that in future all correspondence regarding matters in connection with your work at this school be forwarded through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

MacRae, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, for permission to engage a substitute teacher from the 1st of September, next, to carry on the work for a period of two or three weeks to enable him to complete the cottage which he is erecting. Mr. MacRae is being informed that he should have forwarded his request through your office, also that, if you approve of a substitute being engaged, you will grant him the necessary authority for two or three weeks' absence and the engagement of a substitute to replace him during that time.\n\nIf a substitute is engaged, Mr. MacRae should, however, prepare and sign the quarterly return in the usual manner, when a cheque for salary and bonus will be drawn in his favour and sent him, and he can arrange for the payment of the services of the substitute for the period he is engaged.\n\nPlease inform the Department as to whether you approve of the request of Mr. MacRae, and also if you have arranged with him for the appointment of a substitute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In reply I beg to say that enquiry is being made in the matter.\n\nRegarding payment for your services as truant officer, I beg to say that cheques have been sent at the end of each quarter, the last cheque being sent on the 27th of March, last, to the amount of $6.25, this being payment of your services in full to the end of March, last. Another payment will be due at the end of the present quarter, viz: June 30th. If you have not received the cheque for the March quarter, you should apply to your local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Matthew Simms,\nHyamsa, C.B.,\nN.S.\nOttawa, June 8th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nA complaint has been received regarding the services being performed by John A. MacRae, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School. It is stated that the pupils are making no progress and that a change in teacher should be made. It is also charged that the teacher takes intoxicants to the school, which he drinks in the presence of the children.\n\nThe Department requests that you forward a report immediately regarding the services Mr. MacRae is performing, the success which he has met with in his work, and also whether the charge that he uses intoxicants in the school is true or not.\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of December 4th, 1924, regarding the services of Mattie Simon, the truant officer, and have to request that you will state if you have taken any action to dispense with his services and obtain another man in his place, as recommended in your report on this school for the month of November, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn E. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBaddeck, N.S.\nOttawa, June 15, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. McIsaac:\n\nPursuant to our conversation relative to increasing the salary of Mr. John A. MacRae, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, Nyanza, C.B., N.S., I wish to inform you that this teacher's services are not particularly satisfactory. The public school inspector states that discipline in the school is weak and that there is no progress. I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to an increase in his case at the present time. Mr. MacRae's stipend of $650 compares quite favourably with the salaries paid not only in Indian schools but in other rural schools of the province.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nC. F. McIsaac, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 15, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Chisholm:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, requesting an increase in salary for Mr. John A. MacRee, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, Nyanza, N. S. I am informed that this teacher's services are not particularly satisfactory. The public school inspector states that discipline in the classroom is weak and that there is no progress. Officers of the Department have lately called for a special report on this teacher and for an investigation into the charge that he drinks intoxicants when on duty. The question of increasing his salary should remain in abeyance for the time being.\n\nIt is true that two of the most successful teachers of Indian schools in Nova Scotia receive a salary of $750. However, Mr. MacRee's stipend of $650 compares quite favourably with the average salary paid not only in Indian schools but in other rural schools of the province.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. A. W. Chisholm, M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI cannot say but they might do better with change \nof teacher. In regard the use of intoxicants by the \nteacher, I don't think this is correct. I never heard \na complaint of him using intoxicants in or out of \nschool. He always kept watch on young Indians, and \nif he had any suspicion of them bringing beer or \nintoxicants to the Reserve, he always telephoned to \nme\u2014and I know that some of the Indians and white \npeople have that against him, and it may be the main \ncause of this complaint, to get square with him.\n\nI visit the school regular every month, \nand visit the Reserve quite often besides, and your \nletter was the first knowledge I had that Mr. McRee \nwas blamed for the use of intoxicants in or out \nof school.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa Canada\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 8th 1925 #63-1-1, beg to say that in re truant officer Mattie Simon, last November when I wrote the Department in regard making a change, I found that the one I planned on appointing would not likely give as good satisfaction as Mattie Simon. I then told Mattie Simon that I would give him another trial, and he promised to do the very best he could - did fairly well during December and March quarter, but during this quarter did not seem to take the same interest as before, so I notified him that his services would cease on June 30th, end of quarter.\n\nJohn Joe Paul, who is janitor of school, agrees to take the job, and any children absent on opening of school every morning, that he will make a daily visit to the parents and guardians, and find out cause of them not attending school, and report to me.\n\nIn re John A. McRea, teacher, I am of the opinion that the children are making fair progress, but\nOttawa, June 17th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 12th instant relative to the teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, the Department is pleased to learn that there is no ground for the complaint that was made regarding the use of intoxicants by him. It is noted that in your opinion the children are making fair progress. His re-engagement for the next school year is approved.\n\nYou have been advised in a separate communication regarding the appointment of John Joe Paul as truant officer to replace Mattie Simon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have no desire to place the cause on anyone in particular. However it is my unbiased conviction that the present incumbent is a member of the old conservative school and is not progressive and peppy enough to put progressive ideas in the minds of those committed to his charge. I would state that he is probably there too long. He is faithful and honest and does his best. I have been thinking of something that you may consider.\n\nA female teacher is my choice. I would like to see someone there who would teach the Indian children how to sew and mend; how to take care of their homes; how to make use of waste products; how to cook and what to make use of in doing so. They are fairly intelligent and pick up things very quickly, as to their learning the routine they will learn that if they want to. However on the other hand a male teacher is necessary also to show them mechanics how to till the soil and conduct their farms. They are progressive if they have the right kind of leadership. They also could be made self-supporting with proper direction.\n\nMy idea would be to employ a married couple who would take the proposition in hand. The woman to teach in the school, and the man to carry on an experimental farm. She would teach the pupils the arts of homekeeping besides the ordinary school work and he would teach the Indians in general on the reserve the progressive methods of farming. Besides the salary paid to the teacher in school the man would have to receive a nominal salary.\n\nNumber of Pupils in 1st Standard: 6\ndo 2nd do 6\ndo 3rd do 2\ndo 4th do 3\ndo 5th do 1\ndo 6th do 0\n\nAgency Dated May 7th, 1929\n\nN.B.\u2014A separate form to be used for each school. \"State whether 'day', 'boarding' or 'industrial'.\"\n\nForm No. 19\nOttawa, July 25, 1929.\n\nRev.

I should be pleased if you would interview Mr. J. A. MacRae, the teacher. Inform him that the Department believes it is necessary, in the interests of efficiency, to make a change in the very near future. You might question him regarding his plans and ascertain if he is in a position to resign from our service. He has been faithful and I believe has done as well as he could; but his age now militates against his success in the classroom. If he is desirous of returning to the school next September, you should inform him that the Department would like to secure the services of another teacher to commence duties on January first, next. After you have seen Mr. MacRae, please report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. R. S. Campbell,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, C. B.\nIona, N.S.\nAug. 10th., 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 25th., No. 63-1-1, I beg leave to state that I was in communication with Mr. John A. MacRaw, teacher of Middle River Indian School. I carried out the instructions as outlined in your letter. He is desirous of taking advantage of the time limit. He requests to be permitted to teach until the end of December at which time he will resign from the school to give place to another.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 14, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, informing the Department that Mr. John A. MacRae will resume duties as teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School when it reopens after the present summer holidays and will continue teaching until the end of December next. The Department will approve of his resuming duties on September 3rd, next, and teaching until the Christmas holidays following. At that time, you should obtain his resignation and forward same to the Department, together with the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you recommend be appointed to succeed him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. S. Campbell,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, C.B.\nIona, N.S.\nAug. 12th., 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have written you regarding the resignation of Mr. J.A. MacRae, Teacher of the Indians at Middle River Reserve, to take effect December 31st, pending the approval of the Department. While doing business in Baddeck, Saturday, I met Mrs. John McNeil who taught school at the Middle River Indian school some years ago and later at Malagawatch. I happened to ask her if she could recommend a competent teacher for the Middle River school. She proposed the following: Her son who is 22 years of age has completed a successful Highschool course and holds a Grade D teacher's license. Mrs. McNeil proposed that her son teach in the school and she would undertake to give the children a course in Domestic Training. They would both reside in the teacher's residence on the Reserve. However in the event of her doing so she would expect a nominal salary. This is an excellent proposition and I highly recommend it as a beginning towards the progressive movement for Indian betterment. Mrs. McNeil is highly competent and her son under her direction and together with her will spell progress. In the event that the Department gives its approval to this proposition it will be necessary to repair the teacher's residence to make it a fit place to live in.\n\nMay I expect a reply from the Department on this matter?\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 17th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the teaching services at the Middle River Indian Day School and recommending that Mrs. John McNeil and her son be appointed, the son to carry on the teaching duties and Mrs. McNeil to instruct the children in a course in domestic training. The Department is favourably disposed to consider this arrangement from the first of January next. In the meantime, however, Mr. John A. MacRae, the present teacher, who, you state in your letter of the 10th instant, was desirous of taking advantage of the time limit and be permitted to teach until the end of December next, is to carry on the teaching work until that time as you have been advised in our letter of the 14th instant. If Mrs. John McNeil and her son are free to accept the position at this school at the beginning of the new year, the Department would approve of their appointment and would allow, besides the salary to the son as teacher, a nominal grant to Mrs. McNeil for carrying on the domestic training activity. I shall be pleased if you will again draw this matter to the Department's attention early in December next, giving the name of Mrs. McNeil's son, who would be satisfactory to carry on the teaching work in the classroom.\n\nPlease forward a report showing the repairs required to the teacher's residence and any furnishings that may be needed. You should, also, state the approximate cost of the repairs and any furnishings that you recommend be supplied. This estimate should be forwarded in due time in order that any repairs required can be completed by the end of the present year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. R. S. Campbell,\nIndian Agent,\nLong, N.S.\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed enclosing bills in duplicate and certified to as cashed for coal and supplies for stove, pipe, land also for relief supplied to Indians. While visiting the school a few days ago, Mr. John Mac Rae, the teacher, told me that he had sent in his resignation and that it was accepted by the Dept. to become effective at the end of January 1930. I have been looking over the prospects of getting a successor and find that it seems the easier to get a teacher to start in next Sept. In case that we fail I think it is better to retain Mr. Mac Rae's services till June 1930 and then get an energetic young man who will take interest in the general welfare of the Indians, probably one who could help them to take more interest in the land. He would continue, but he tells me that he will have to pay $5 or $6 a month more for board and would expect that much more salary. I have his mind a young married man, if so you...\nSir,\n\nman and his sister or mother also should take interest in the young women and teach them some domestic science or household science. In that event she should have to do same repairing to the house, get a stove for it, and fit up the doors and windows. I should advertise for a teacher early in the Spring and secure the services of one who would be competent in each respect.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.J. Rankin\nAgent\nOttawa, November 6, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the resignation of Mr. John A. Macrae, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, and the appointment of a teacher to succeed him.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official correspondence with your predecessor in office, Rev. R. S. Campbell. On the 12th of August, last, he wrote regarding the resignation of Mr. Macrae, and nominated the services of Mrs. John McNeil and her son - the son to carry on teaching duties and Mrs. McNeil to instruct the children in a course in domestic training. The Department was favourably disposed to consider this arrangement from the 1st of January, 1930, and, in the meantime, Rev. Mr. Campbell was informed that Mr. Macrae could continue teaching until the end of December. He did not report further as to whether Mrs. McNeil and her son accepted the positions offered, and I shall be pleased if you will interview them and ascertain whether they will be prepared to take up duties at the beginning of January, next, or not, and you should inform the Department as to their decision in the matter.\n\nIt is noted that you have in mind a young married man, or a young man and his sister, for this school - the man to perform the teaching duties and the woman to teach domestic science. If the McNees do not accept, you should give due attention to the matter of obtaining qualified incumbents for this school - the man to perform the teaching duties and the woman to give instruction in domestic science.\n\nYou should forward a report regarding any repairs required to the teacher's residence and any furnishings that may be needed, together with the approximate cost of same.\n\nThe accounts which you enclosed are being paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. J. Reddin,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, C.B.\nIona, C.B., Dec. 10th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have also written to Mrs. MacNeil and her son to find out whether they would take care of the school but have received, so far, no reply which seems to indicate that they are not available. I think we better hire Mr. John A. MacRae, the present teacher for the period between January 1930 and June and then secure a new teacher for the term beginning in September 1930.\n\nD. J. Rankin.\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 18, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has recently been in correspondence with Rev. D. J. Rankin, Indian Agent, Iona, C.B., in connection with obtaining the services of a qualified teacher, also an assistant to teach domestic science to the pupils of the Middle River Indian Day School. The present teacher, Mr. John A. MacRae, tendered his resignation to take effect at the end of the present month. Rev. Mr. Rankin states that he has been unable to obtain teachers to begin duties when the school reopens early in January next, and recommends that the services of Mr. MacRae be continued for the balance of the present school year ending June 30th, next. In view of the fact that if the services of two teachers are obtained as mentioned above, it would be necessary to make repairs to the teachers' residence, and, as this work would no doubt take some time, it is considered that it would be advisable to retain the services of Mr. MacRae, and Mr. Agent Rankin has been requested to see him and, if possible, arrange with him to remain as teacher until June 30th, next.\n\nI have to request, however, that you will bear the requirements at this school in mind and endeavour early next Summer to nominate the services of a fully qualified teacher to carry on the classroom work and also an assistant who would teach the older girls domestic science and assist in the preparation of the midday lunch. If the services of a married teacher are secured, his wife would no doubt be able to give the girls instruction in sewing, knitting, cooking, etc., and assist in the preparation of the midday meal. You should also, in due time, furnish a full report as to the repairs that would be required to place the residence in a good state of repair, with an approximate cost of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. J. MacNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 165,\nAntigonish, N.S.\nOttawa, December 18, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nRelative to that portion of your letter of the 10th instant regarding the services of a teacher for the Middle River Indian Day School to begin duties at the beginning of the new year, I have to say it is noted that Mrs. John McNeill and her son are not available. If Mr. John A. MacRae will continue for the balance of the present school year ending June 30th, next, the department will approve of his doing so. You should see him at once and ascertain definitely whether he will continue teaching until the above mentioned date, and you should advise the Department accordingly.\n\nWe are taking up with Mr. Inspector McNeil, Antigonish, the question of obtaining the services of a qualified teacher and also an assistant who would teach domestic science for the school year beginning September 1st, next. We are also requesting him to report on what repairs would be required in order to place the teachers' residence in suitable condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. J. Rankin,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, C.B.\nI have heard from Mrs. J. MacNeil and her son Mr. J. MacNeil that they will be ready to start back after the Christmas holidays. I am writing Mr. MacNeil not to come back after Christmas. I think he should have a difficulty in securing a boarding house and therefore it seems wise and fortunate in getting the MacNeils to take charge.\n\nI am suggesting to them that perhaps it is better for themselves to get the necessary furniture and stove etc. I shall visit the Reservation with them and find out what will be necessary before we move.\n\nMrs. MacNeil is qualified to teach as she has made all the high school grades and has Grade IX having passed.\nSir,\n\nthat at the Provincial examinations he is 22 years old and speaks the Micmac language. It is necessary that she know at once whether the Dept. hires him or otherwise there is danger of the children going without school which caused me a great misfortune.\n\nI believe what will be necessary to do to the teacher's house after night with the Mae Neil's regarding salary. I presume it argued the same to Miss Neil as MacNeil is getting and if Miss Mae Neil were to help in teaching sewing and housekeeping and other useful things to the young girls we can see how much her services might be worth. In the meantime...\nSir,\n\nI am telling them to be ready to come as soon as I get word from the Dept.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD. J. Austin\nAgent\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, December 26, 1929.\n\nRev. D. J. Rankin,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, G.B.\n\nDepartment approves appointment Red J. MacNeill\nas teacher Middle River School to begin duties January\nsixth next.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nChg. Dept. I.A.\nOttawa, December 26, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, nominating the services of Rev. J. MacNeill as teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School to begin duties when the school reopens after the present Christmas holidays, also his mother, Mrs. A. J. MacNeill, to teach domestic science and assist in the teaching of sewing, housekeeping and other useful subjects to the older girls. The salary allowed Mr. MacNeill will be at the rate of $55 per teaching month. The salary to be allowed Mrs. MacNeill will depend on your report as to the work she is performing, but it is considered that a nominal salary will be satisfactory. You should arrange with them to begin duties on or about January 6th, next, the date the schools reopen after the present holidays. It is noted that you have suggested to them to provide their own furniture, stove, etc. After you visit the Reserve, you should report as to what repairs and furnishings are required for the teachers' residences.\n\nIf any materials are required for the teaching of sewing, knitting and in the serving of a midday lunch to the pupils, you may arrange for the purchase of a small quantity of the articles you consider necessary, and you should have Mrs. MacNeill prepare a requisition for the articles and supplies she requires sufficient to last for a three months' period. You should forward this requisition for the consideration of the Department.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector McNeill, Antigonish, of the change that you have made for the securing of the teaching services at the Middle River School as mentioned in official letter to you of the 18th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. J. Rankin,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, C.B.\nOttawa, December 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nReferring to official letter of the 18th instant, I have to say that in a further communication from Rev. D. J. Rankin, Indian Agent, Iona, C.B., he states that he has secured the services of Mr. J. MacNeil as teacher and his mother, Mrs. A. J. MacNeil, to teach domestic science, cooking, etc., and to assist in the preparation of a hot lunch for the pupils at midday. He states that they will be ready to begin duties when the school reopens after the present Christmas holidays, on or about the 6th of January, next. The Department is approving of their appointment and requesting the Agent to arrange with them to take up duties on the date mentioned. The salary we will allow Mr. MacNeil as teacher is at the rate of $65 per teaching month. The Department will consider later the salary that will be allowed Mrs. MacNeil for her services after the Agent reports as to the duties she is performing.\n\nThe Agent has also been requested to notify the Department as to the repairs and furnishings required to the teachers' residence and the supplies for the teaching of domestic science and for the serving of the hot lunch.\n\nIf the services of Mr. and Mrs. MacNeil are satisfactory during the balance of the present school year it will not be necessary for you to arrange during the summer to obtain teachers, as instructed in letter above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ferrier Esq.,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast July I wrote you in re pensions for Indian Day School teachers, and in reply you wrote me that, as \"these employees do not contribute to the Dominion Govt. Superannuation Fund, and are not considered permanent civil servants, there is therefore no provision for pensions in the case of teachers at Indian schools.\" You said however, \"that the Department allows a small gratuity for teachers who have given lengthy service; two months' salary is allowed upon retirement.\"\n\nWhen I saw there was no pension to be given I resigned in September to take effect 1st January 1930.\n\nI wish to remind the Department that I have taught at the Indian Day School at Nyanza, Victoria Co., N. S.\nfor sixteen years and three months,\nand I submit, if the Department\nowes a small gratuity for\nlengthy that I am entitled to same,\nI have given faithful service at my\npersonal discomfort and if I may\nnot have pleased all the Indians\nindividually at all times, it was\nbecause I would corroborate\ntheir false statements to the Agents\nwhen applying for aid from the\nDept. When I felt satisfied they\ndid not deserved it, as for instance,\nwhen I knew that they squandered\ntheir earnings at drinking and card-\nplaying and other debauchery and\nturn around and ask the Agent for\naid from the Government.\nWould you kindly appeal to the Dept.\nin my behalf and ask that my\ngratuity be sent me as soon as\nConvenient.\nWith the Compliments of the joyous\nfestive season.

Should it be found necessary in the future to secure the service of another teacher, either for this or another Indian Day School, I shall endeavour to obtain the service of a most suitable one so that eventually the standard of our Indian Day Schools in this inspectorate may be raised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nEastern Nova Scotia.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 18, 1930\n\nRev.

For the house being so long unoccupied is as yet very damp & cold.\n\nThe stove does not cook very well\u2014being a second-hand one and not suitable very much for wood alone. I had to buy a lot of coal, in order to get more heat & cooking done. You will see for yourself when you come\u2014\n\nTo get the house warm & comfortable, we are keeping the fires\nbut (or) the weather will soon be warmer.\n\nRegarding the work you wish done, here, I would be glad to know first before sending in a list of requirements, what are the necessary branches or hours &c. forth., the Dept will require and all particulars relating thereto. I can advise as requested.\n\nRod is getting on ok. Of course teaching an Indian school is difficult & tedious, and we doing all we can to make it easier for them.\n\nHoping you are very well.\n\nRod will send in quarterly letters at end of quarter for your signature.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nMarch 15th, 1930\n\nThe Acting Secretary of Indian Affairs Office,\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you this Mae Neil's letter which will enable you to see that she is going to do good work at Ryauza with her pair. She is a young man who knows the Indian language and who is really doing good work in the School. Now I want you to instruct her in regard to the work she has to do as leave it with me for I have had a long experience in teaching School and have taken interest in the education of children of all races and understand the needs of these Indian children also. My Mae Neil can teach the girls cooking and sewing and domestic science and the depth of education of Mae Neil's would be glad to help for they have been taught women going around teaching our young girls and giving talks to them. My Mae Neil joined he glad to know how much time the Dept of Indian Affairs paid her fees.\nSir,\n\nTo devote to the work of teaching and then we can ask for necessary equipment. I know she could have to buy material for making dresses and yarn if she is to teach knitting and other things all of which would be most useful in keeping the young Indian women occupied. I agree that the Dept finds that they have spent much money on fixing the teacher's residence and getting things in order but I think it is money well spent and it seems to me that we have more persons at Nyanza who can do much for the Indians if we try & encourage them. Mr. J. MacNeil, the Inspector, is also glad to cooperate in any way he can and I want instructions from you at once in order to do everything possible for the Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 24, 1930.\n\nRev.

She should also carry out any instructions which you may give her in reference to this work. Mr. Inspector McNeil and yourself could decide the time she should devote to the domestic science work. A requisition should be prepared and forwarded through the office of Mr. Inspector McNeil for the materials required in the teaching of sewing, knitting, etc., and for the supplies required in the serving of the midday lunch.

McNeil, teacher at the Indian Day School Middle River Reserve, is not giving satisfaction and on account of certain misdemeanors on his part, I am constrained to recommend the appointment of a successor to Mr. McNeil.\n\nIt is not necessary to relate the details in connection with this case suffice to say that the teacher of the Indians should be a person who would command the respect of the Indians. I have questioned Mr. McNeil about certain charges and he has admitted them and for this reason is going to resign at the end of the present school year.\n\nRegards a successor, there is a Mrs. Joseph MacDonald of Baddeck who is an experienced teacher and who would be a suitable person as teacher to the Indians at Middle River Day School. Her husband, Joseph MacDonald, is a young farmer and a graduate of the agricultural school in Truro. He would undoubtedly be a great help to the Indians in matters of farming if it were possible to pay him a nominal salary.\n\nI should be pleased to have your opinion in this matter and your idea of the amount that might be paid to Mr. MacDonald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the services of Mr. R. J. McNeil, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School. It is noted that Mr. McNeil intends to resign at the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next. The Department considers, in view of your report, that his resignation should be accepted. You should obtain his resignation in writing and forward same to the Department, or, failing this, you should give him one month's notice that his services will not be required after the above date.\n\nThe Department is not at all satisfied that a married woman would be the best incumbent. Her husband would have so little, if anything, to do that it would be a bad example for the Indians among whom he was living. Perhaps you had better look for other applicants who are qualified. I believe that a married man or a single teacher would be more suitable for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J.

We can collect this amount from Father Beaton, but would very much prefer to have Mr. MacNeill pay it himself, as the money was loaned to him. Father Beaton got no portion of it.

McNeil, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Box 16, Antigonish.\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nAntigonish, Nova Scotia,\nSeptember 1, 1931.\n\nTo Whomsoever This Has Interest:\n\nThis is to certify that Mr. Michael Prosper has been a teacher in the public schools of Nova Scotia for a period of about three years, the last one of which he was directly under my supervision. Mr. Prosper proved himself an efficient teacher, and his methods in the classroom seemed to be very sound. He is possessed with enthusiasm and initiative, and has fine qualities of leadership among boys and girls.\n\nI can heartily recommend him to any school board looking for a competent teacher, for I am certain that he will measure up to what I have stated regarding him.\n\n(Sgd.) H. M. Macdonald,\n\nInspector of Schools for Division No. 6.\nSir:\n\nRe Teacher Middle River Day School.\n\nIn further reference to your telegram of the 1st, instant re vacancy in Middle River Indian Day School and your approval of the appointment of Michael Prosper as temporary teacher there, I beg to report that this position became vacant on account of the illness of Mrs. Jos. McDonald who notified me that she could not act and that she had decided not to accept the position.\n\nMichael Prosper is an Indian and he has been teaching in the rural schools of Antigonish County for the past three years. From time to time, I have made inquiries about his work from the different inspectors and the report received was always satisfactory.\n\nIt has always been Michael's ambition to teach in an Indian School and on several occasions he has approached me with a view to getting a school. When I spoke to him about the Middle River School, I impressed upon him what the Department expected of him and made it plain that he was being put there only so long as his service is satisfactory. He has promised me to do his best, and I have no doubt but that his work in the class room will be all right. My only concern is that his conduct will be what it should be when he is living with other Indians. However, I think he should be given a chance. In view of the attached recommendation received from Inspector H.M. MacDonald of Antigonish, I would that his salary be the same as was paid to the former teacher, namely $65.00 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, recommending that the services of Michael Prosper be continued at the Middle River Indian Day School. This young Indian will be given a further trial for an indefinite period and salary at the rate of $60 per teaching month will be allowed in his case. At the end of the calendar and academic years, you might let the Department have a special report regarding his success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAntigonish, N. S.\nOctober 10, 1931.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nPlease refer to your memorandum of the 12th ultimo with reference to the teacher employed at the Middle River Indian Day School at Nyanza, N.S.\n\nThe Minister is favourable to the appointment of Mr. Arsene Burns, of Cheticamp, who is already known to the Department and whose services were satisfactory. The Minister is advising Mr. MacDougall to have Mr. Burns apply direct to the Inspector of Indian Agencies at Antigonish.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOct 14th 1931\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nOctober 20, 1951.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 10th instant, with reference to the application of Mr. A. Burns, of Cheticamp, N. S., for the position of teacher at the Middle River Indian Bay School. The Departmental Inspector in Nova Scotia reported that the temporary teacher was doing quite well and recommended that his services be retained indefinitely. The Department did not reply immediately, in view of your memorandum of the 10th ultimo and Mr. Williams' reply of the 12th instant. However, on the 7th instant, no further word having been received from your office, the temporary teacher was informed that his services would be continued as long as he met with success. Therefore, it would be very difficult to consider Mr. Burns' application at the present time.\n\nI may say that the temporary teacher, whose appointment was confirmed by letter of the 7th instant, was Michael Prosper, an Indian young man, whom the Department has assisted to secure education. He did really better than expected and I was glad to approve of his retention. It is the practice to give employment to our own wards whenever possible.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNovember 3, 1931.\n\nMR. FERRIER\n\nI discussed the matter of the appointment of a Teacher at the Middle River Indian Day School with the Minister yesterday. He regrets to disturb Michael Prosper in this position, but it is desirable to appoint Mr. A. Burns, of Cheticamp, N.S., and he hopes it will be possible to arrange to appoint Michael Prosper to the first vacancy.\n\nD. S. G. I.A.\nOttawa, November 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 7th ultimo, concerning the services of Michael Prosper, at the Middle River Indian Day School. It has been decided to make a change, and you will please notify the present teacher that his services will not be required after the 30th instant.\n\nYou will please inform Mr. A. Burns, of Cheticamp, N. S., that he is appointed to the position of teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School - duties to commence on December first. Salary at the rate of $65 per teaching month will be allowed in his case.\n\nIf you believe Michael Prosper has done sufficiently well to warrant his engagement at another Indian school, you will please so recommend to the Department in a special communication. In that event, he will be given the first suitable vacancy. You may so inform him if you decide to recommend his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J.

The Indians state that they will\nnot send their children to school to Mr.A.Burns.\n\nWhen I received your letter of the 4th, I forthwith\nnotified Mr.Burns of his appointment. I also notified\nMichael Prosper that his services were not required after\nthe 30th,instant. Subsequently,I notified the gent Rev.\nD.J.Rankin of the change. I have pointed out to Prosper\nthat his appointment was for an indefinite term only. There-\nfore,while his disappointment may be keen and we\ncan appreciate how he feels over it,nevertheless I do not\nthink that there has been any injustice done.\n\nAs a rural teacher Michael Prosper was considered\nvery good by the school Inspector of Antigonish County and\nI would have no hesitation in recommending him for the next\nvacancy from a standpoint of qualification. But,if he\nshould be appointed to another school what assurance am I to\nhave that he will not be dismissed when some other white\nperson wants to get his job and is successful in securing it.\nThe result would be another disagreeable situation as in the\npresent case of Mr.A.Burns appointment.\n\nIn the present situation I do not think it would be\nwise to consider the request of the Indians. Having made the\nappointment I think it should be upheld. However,I should be\nvery glad to hear from you in the matter as soon as possible\nplease.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nI FIND IT NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF INDIAN CHILDREN AT NYANZA TO RETAIN SERVICES OF MICHAEL PROSPER AS TEACHER REPLY APPROVAL\n\nREV D J RANKIN INDIAN AGENT.\nDAY LETTER\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPH\n\nHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO, ONT.\n\nW.

S.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of December 5th advising me that the officers of the Deptt be obliged when serving their own cases to accept an allowance of 75\u00a2 a mile. I think that it is a good and fair allowance because after all the money at the disposal of the Deptt should be used as much as possible for the welfare of the Indians and in these times of depression officers of the Deptt of Indian Affairs should make every effort to bring to the attention of the Deptt a matter that I think should be carefully looked into. Michael Harper was engaged as a teacher in the Day School at the Middle River Reserve, Victoria County, and raising the best satisfaction. He was very much liked by both children and adults. The Inspector of Indian Agencies and adults. Mr. Neil Antigonish received a letter from Mr. MacKenzie of the Deptt that he was appointed to begin his duties on the 1st of Dec. He has clearly stated that the Agent should make in these matters.\nI immediately wired the Dept. to retain the services of Mr. Peeples but received a reply that they could not do it. Our inquiry showed out that this affirmative Cabinet through the recommendation of one of the members of Parliament in the Federal House, my first impulse was to regard this as a matter that required immediate action by those who supervised the regular procedure in the matter and to show the injustice that was done the teacher Mr. Peeples who was gaining satisfaction in every sense by the work. I cannot be strongly inclined to believe that same one has made a very serious mistake in insisting on Mr. Butten being appointed and that if we care to follow the matter up it will cause the immediate dismissal of that official. I have much prefer to have an explanation that will show that the same thing may not again occur to retard the education progress of the Indians.\n\nWith best wishes for the Coming Winter,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nPETITION.\n\nWe the residents of the Middle River Indian Reserve, in the County of Victoria and Province of Nova Scotia, herewith humbly petition your Honorable Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, to inform you that we are greatly dissatisfied with our present school Teacher, Mr. Arthur Burns, and we humbly ask to have him removed, and to have a better Teacher by the name of Michael Press, as our children made much better progress under his teaching, and your humble petitioners will ever pray:\n\nNAMES,\n\nIsidore Pierre\nMichael Isidore\nThomas Isidore\nCharles Paul\nStephen Boop\nPierre Isidore\nJohn Isidore\nKevin Isidore\n\nMatter Simon\nLouis Francis\nJohn Matte\nJohn Francis\nCharles Martin\nJohn Julian\nAndrew Matte\nJoseph Cerinos\nHercel Stephenson\nJames Beck\nFrancis Christopher\nJohn Gregory\nJohn Marshall\nStephen J.

EX TEACHER BURNS REFUSES TO VACATE REQUEST OF DR JOHNSTON. B E CHRISTMAS SECTY.\nIona N.S. Sept. 5 1932.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nReturning from a few days holidays on August 30, your letter regarding the dismissal of Mr. Burns, the teacher of the Middle River Day School, and the appointment of Mr. Prosper was before me. Mr. Burns was still on the Reserve and had no notification of his dismissal till then; also Mr. Prosper had gone there to take his place.\n\nThe time was short before the opening of the school and tried to do business with you by wire but find that there is something wrong some place. As the agent here I am strongly opposed to the appointment of Mr. Prosper as the teacher of the school, because of his behavior on the Reserve as teacher last fall. This may be news to you but not to me and to put things through some official form I investigated the case Saturday and found that things were really worse that I knew before.\n\nThis man, Mr. Prosper has been drinking on the Reserve so much that he did not attend to his school duties, and according to the Captain used to go across the bay for a week-end spree with some of the other Indians. He also used the residence to hold boose parties, so much so, that the greater and the better class of Indians of the Reserve do not want him back. Dr. Gillis of Baddeck who attends the Indians states the same thing and tells me that Mr. Prosper's first official act on arriving was to visit the Government Vendor not once but twice before going to the Reserve. Mr. John E. Campbell, a former Agent and in touch with the Indians since the last half century, also confirms this and says that it would be folly to put Mr. Prosper in as teacher. Even Mr. Mac Rae who furnishes the supplies strongly condemns the idea of having Mr. Prosper back.\n\nI know that it is the wish of the Dept. to try satisfy the Indians in so far as they are able. The element backing\nup Mr. Prosper are very few and his associates in his debauchery. Regarding the petition headed by the so-called chief Ben Christmas of Sydney, it was prompted by the same source, a good-for-nothing Indian at this Reserve, John Julian. To show the attitude of Mr. Prosper towards authority, he did not even go to see the Captain on his arrival.\n\nI have informed Dr. Johnson M.P. of this matter and he will put his recommendation to those statements. The school is closed at present and Mr. Burns is still on the Reserve and I would recommend that he be reinstated as teacher. As far as I know the man he does his work well and quite capable of teaching the Indians.\n\nAwaiting your early reply and assuring you that I will have no part in the appointment of Mr. Prosper nor will I hold myself responsible for any of his actions in case he is appointed. I remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHonourable Thomas G.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the teaching services at the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, after due consideration of your report regarding the conduct of Michael Prosper, the Department cannot approve of his appointment. In this connection, I have to confirm the following telegram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Your letter fifth received. Arsene Burns re-appointed teacher Middle River School.

The school was closed for the week as I thought it would not be desirable to have a substitute for such a short time.\n\nWhat I would like to know is, what the Dept. is prepared to do for their employees and families in such cases. The operation was done by Dr. McKeough, of Sydney Mines, and that along with hospital and other bills is going to amount to quite a sum.\n\nMr. Burns is a man who would be hard to replace as teacher, and at present is not in very good financial circumstances. His work in the school is by no means the only good he does, but exerts a good moral influence on the whole Reserve, which influence was badly demoralized by his two predecessors, whom I had the misfortune of knowing.\n\nThis is not intended to eulogize Mr. Burns but to give you some idea of how I esteem him as an employee so you may give his case a favorable consideration.\n\nAs stated above please let me know at once what is to be done in such cases. I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 21, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, informing the Department of the illness of a member of the family of Arsene Burns, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, and requesting to be advised if the expenses in connection therewith can be met by the Department.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, while the illness and consequent expenses incurred are regretted, this Department cannot be responsible for the payment of any part of expenses occasioned by illness in the family of an employee.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MacDonald,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, N.S.\nIona, C.B., Nov. 23rd, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am making a full report of what I found to be the condition of the Indians on the Middle River Reserve at Nyanza, Victoria County, N.S. This is my third visit to the Reserve since I have been appointed agent, the first visit being for the purpose of finding out about the condition of the school. I find that the teacher, Mr. A. Burns is a competent teacher with a good knowledge of the Indian mentality and sympathetic towards the Indians, anxious for their spiritual and temporal welfare. He does not know their language as both Raddie Mac Neil and Michael Prosper did and for that reason I recommended both of them for the position. They both did some good because they knew the Micmac language but there were complaints as there will always be against them as teachers.\n\nD. J.

F. HACKETT,\nSecretary.\nTo Dept of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIndian agent Mr. J. Rank was here today and I have been informed about the teachers affairs here at the Indian day school that he does not want the Indian children from 18 years old and up to come to school. He said there are too old to attend the school. I want those 5 to 8 years old to come over and some are rather too young. School hours are 4 hours and some days less in April lost the days from 26th to 27th to be school days. I was in school the other day and I find them sleeping in the school house during school hours. Half the children are out playing & etc. and Indian people those have to send their children to school are not satisfied of this teacher Mr. Burns they taught these children are ruined. Mr. Burns can't teach our children when he couldn't teach his children are spoiling the reserve by increasing the population they do remain your very truly.\n\nJames Beck, Trust Officer\nMyra Indian Day School\nThe Secretary,\nJune 14th 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have, as instructed in letter of 8th inst., visited the Middle River Indian Day School and find that the teacher is doing good work. The attendance was very good, but the only time for the last year that the children attended well was when they had Michael Prasser as teacher. He was doing good work there, but he was also working because the politicians wanted to get their own friend in there. The fellow who was not satisfactory and I think it would be a good idea to hire him and try Charlie Francis Pierron. He is under the school and his performance may be whether he will perform a good job or not.\n\nBut there have been complaints about the teacher not doing his work properly, interfering among the people with the children's duties. It is true that the teacher and pupils being sick with the influenza there was no school from April 25th to 28th, but there was sufficient reason for that.\n\nWe do not think he was asleep, and we had an application for the school from a young teacher and preferably a woman, if we could we would accept Miss Ramsden as soon as she is available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD. J. Martin\nMy dear Reverend Father,\n\nNotwithstanding the continued lameness for want of a good fence around the premises of the teacher's residence on the Middle River Indian Reserve, I think you will agree with me that we have been more or less of an encumbrance, stimulating to the poor Indians, so I have difficulty in meeting financial obligations in general.\n\nI feel that you would like for us to continue our promising\nSir D.J. Rutherford, P.P., Indian Agent,\n\nand farming to encourage and assist poor Indians as much as possible. Our hopes are doing well, and I am anxious to get these Indians interested in our farming. They need instruction and continued encouragement. There is no harm in asking for the favorable consideration of a good wire fence around the house lot. There are only 2 acres of land, so far the land adjoining the house lot is too near for pasture, etc., a brushwood fence would be good enough. At all events, I shall thank you in anticipation of continued good judgment.\n\nI remain, Your most obedient servant,\nA. Burns, Canada.\nMiddle River Indian Reserve\nMyarya, N.S.\nApril 13th, 1906\n\nRev. D.J. Macdonald, P.P.,\nIndian Agent,\nDover, N.S.\n\nMy dear Reverend Father,\n\nAs you are aware, I cannot possibly make ends meet with my school salary at $68 a month for 10 months per year, with the cost of living at Myarya. I am in arrears now to the amount of about $450. Of course, we have to be good to the poor Indians to stay with them. I am trying to assist them all I can to become self independent.\nRev. D.J. Rankin, P.P.,\n\nI am satisfied to remain with them for a living wage, so a matter of fact conditions are improving so much so that I am now anxious to remain with them and encourage them as usual. But is it possible to ask for an increase in salary to enable me to carry out my wishes? I think the best stands nothing to lose even the my salary be increased $56 or $100 a month for 12 months of the year.\n\nAt all events, I shall thank you to be good enough to use good judgement as usual. Believe me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArchie Burns,\nTeacher.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir: The Beadie at Middle River\nIndian Reservation, Mr. Abram Burns\nwrites me two letters one asking for\na raise in salary which is not\nlikely to be granted although I do\nbelieve that he is gaining more\ntime and labor than he is paid for.\nRegarding the other matter he wants\nme about the getting up a fence\nI think that should be granted.\nWe could be able to raise some\nvegetables on the flat of land and\nI could induce the Indians\nto start flats of their own,\nI should like to have at once\nif the Dept will get him the wire\nfor fencing and we can get it\nat the best price.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.J. Walker\nOttawa, April 10, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that you should inform Mr. Arsene Burns, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, that present regulations do not permit an increase in salary being allowed to a teacher in any Indian day school.\n\nWith reference to the fence around the school lot, please let me have an estimate of the cost. On receipt of this information, the Department will be in a position to decide if funds can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. D. J. Rankin,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, C. B.,\nN. S.\nHOTEL BRUNSWICK\n\nMonoton, N.B., Oct. 3, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nOutside this I have only one thing to bring to your attention. I am sure Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Phelan cannot know what kind of teacher they have at Baddeck or Nyanza\u2014the same reserve. He is filthy about his person, has tobacco juice running out of his mouth, and his school is no cleaner than he is. The children were dirty too. I visited the school about 10 O'Clock in the morning. There were only 6 or 8 pupils but he said more would turn up in the course of the morning, as several did while I was there. The contrast between this bird and the teacher at Pictou Landing was most striking. I understood from a clergyman who should know, that his son is the parent of one of our illegitimate children at Nyanza. If I had had any show of authority at all I would have closed the school and sent the children home. I think I am not often very extreme in my judgments, of late years at least, but this Burns is beyond the pale. The rest of the teachers I met were fair to good, one or two very good.\n\nE. L. Stone.\nMy dear Rev. Father,\n\nFor the last couple of years the Indians here have, and are still clamoring for a night school for adult children and young men and young women. I had been teaching night school at the Macdonald Indian Reserve for several winters about 16 years ago with marvelous success. Hence it is that I feel like acceding to their request for a trial. I am sure that the majority of the Indians here will profit materially by it. Will you be good enough to call the attention of the Dept. to this? It may quite possibly do a vast amount of good in various ways. I have no doubt that it will. At least, I feel like giving the adult Indians a fair chance of improving on the actual condition of their mental activities. In a word, I get them interested in oral methods of teaching.

I have been trying to help him to help along the pupils in getting some knowledge in reading and writing and arithmetic, and sometimes when I visited he seemed to be succeeding, but I feared he pleased if at the end of this term, in June, the Dept. wanted instructions to receive a teacher for the coming year that is, for the year beginning...\nSeptember 1936.\n\nIt is better that he know that after this year his services are not required. And when it is definitely decided we can hand applications from which we can select what we may reasonably expect to be one who will give satisfaction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nOttawa, December 12, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nThe contents of your letter have been carefully noted and you should write again about the end of March and definite instructions will then be given you.

It is better that he know that after this year his services are not required, and, when it is definitely decided, we can have applications from which we can select what we may reasonably expect to be one who will give satisfaction.\"\n\nAt the end of April, last, the case of Mr. Burns was placed before the Honourable the Superintendent General, and he approved of Mr. Burns being given notice that his services would not be required after the end of the school year, viz.: June 30th, last. Reverend Father Rankin was instructed to notify Mr. Burns accordingly, and he nominated the services of Miss Mary MacLean, who, he stated, would give satisfaction and would have more influence among the Indians than any of those teachers who had preceded her during the last ten years. The Superintendent General approved of the appointment of Miss MacLean, who will take up duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on September first, next.\n\nThe Department will be unable to consider continuing Mr. Burns' services for a further period.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n| DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|------------|----------|------------------|------------|----------|\n|            |          |                  |            |          |\n|            |          |                  |            |          |\n|            |          |                  |            |          |\n|            |          |                  |            |          |\n|            |          |                  |            |          |\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs**\n\n**Middle River Day School**\n\n**General**\n\n**From**\n\n10/12/1895\n\n**To**\n\n17/7/36\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6048)\n\nFile 255-1, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - General Administration. 1895 - 1897, 1902 - 1936.\n\nFile 255-1, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - General Administration. 1936 - 1947.\n\nFile 255-3, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Teachers' Salaries. 1913 - 1936, 1943 - 1947.\n\nFile 255-5, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Establishment - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1902 - 1903.\n\nFile 255-5, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1916 - 1937.\n\nFile 255-5, part 3\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1937 - 1949.\n\nFile 255-8, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Teachers' Residence - Establishment Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1911 - 1919, 1929 - 1935.\n\nFile 255-8, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Teachers' Residence - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1935 - 1945.\n\nFile 256-1, part 1\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - Establishment - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1891 - 1929.\n\nFile 256-1, part 2\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - General Administration. 1930, 1936 - 1947.\n\nFile 256-3, part 1\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - Teachers' Salaries. 1922 - 1947.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nSydney, N.

Since then, I have had letters from residents of the District, upholding Mr. Burns very strongly, as a school teacher, and pointing out that in as much as he bought a farm in Nyanza since coming there, as a teacher, and has not completed payments, it would be imposing a great hardship upon him if he was dismissed this year.\n\nThe suggestion is made that he should be continued another year, and if his work continues to be unsatisfactory, he should be then asked to resign, which he is willing to do.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it would seem to me perhaps a fairer way of dealing with this man. He is getting along in years, and if sent off under the stigma of a dismissal, it might be very difficult for him to secure employment elsewhere.\n\nI would respectfully ask, therefore, that your Department reconsider the decision arrived at, and give this man another chance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC/TP.\nJuly 21, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Cameron:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to continuing the services of Mr. Arsene Burns, who taught the Middle River Indian Day School, Nyanza, Cape Breton.\n\nAt the time you wrote this letter, you had not received my communication of the 17th instant.

From there they did the noon hour where the teacher was doing needle work with several of the children. They had taken lunch and immediately after began their sewing. There is a delay in getting the tools for the boys to start their wood work, but they were no pains of their sisters doing so much knitting, sewing, and crocheting that they had to get needles. The work that the girls are doing is very good, and doing some sewing of aprons and pockets and stockings and sweaters. The older girls are not doing same under wear. There were 15 children present, namely, they being present on account of sickness or other had not been there. I ordered shoes for them, the only boots are very neat. I shall be writing for more yarn and needles soon, and I think the children are benefiting very much by this range. They do look so clean and interested in their work and they are all glad of their teacher who seems to have rather a influence than to have her Indian children reach the standard retained by the whites.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nIndian Agent\nIona, C.B., March 31st, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit a report of the activities among the Indians of this reservation.\n\nThe school is well attended and the teacher is doing splendid work teaching the girls sewing, knitting and other needle work. It seems to me that this training has an excellent effect on the girls, and the boys are doing some woodwork under John Marshall, who is an excellent tub maker and he does other woodwork, such as tables, chairs and flower stands. He is not a native of the reservation and is not well liked and as soon as this term is over we shall have to get someone else to continue the work.\n\nRev. D.J.

However, the Department carefully reviewed your application for an increased salary to this teacher and while we recognize that she is doing good work at the same time the funds at our disposal are limited. Consequently, it was only possible to provide an increase at the rate of $50.00 a year.\n\nThis makes her total salary $700.00 a year from September 1 and as you were informed in official letter of the 22nd ultimo it compares favourably with the salaries allowed at other Indian Day Schools in Nova Scotia.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Rankin,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, N. S.\nReverend Sir:\n\nSeveral of the adult or grown up Indian men have been talking to me about night school sessions during the winter months. They seem to be very interested in it. These sessions could be carried on during the months of January, February, March and April. I think this would be a very good thing for them, as it would be an instructive and useful way for them to pass their long winter nights. I wish you would bring this to the attention of the Department for their approval. Also find out how much of a grant they would be willing to pay for my services.\nI would suggest that some of the subjects taught would be pertaining to agriculture, for as we see it they are very backward in farming methods. I could also give them ideas on constructive woodworking, as I have had experience in that line.\n\nI hope that this will receive careful consideration by you, as Indian agent, and by the Department.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRod W. Coady,\nIndian teacher.\n\nRev. D. J. Rankin,\nIndian Agent,\nDona, N. S.\nThe Secty Affairs\nIndian Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources\n\nAttorney,\n\nDear Sir, I am enclosing letter from the teacher at the Indian Reservation of Middle River in which he seems to have reported same by the needs of the adult men who have no school. He has been brought upon a farm in the Maryann Valley and is a pretty hard headed young man. I believe he would be glad to get your approval of this project. I think that he could be of great use to start out with and enable us to see whether they needed benefit by the Indians.\n\nThere are three branches in Canada & Canada - Otaud and many of the Indians have very practical in this kind of work. They are able to help in the work. They are able to make their own handy blankets and one or two can make a fairly good rug that will stand up to get into rain coat but I am sure they are interested in building.

Coady\nOttawa, February 13, 1941.\n\nDear Sir or Madam:\n\nAs you are aware the government is at this time making a strong and wide-spread appeal for the citizens of the country to invest their savings in War Savings Certificates in the greatest measure possible. Efforts are being made to bring this appeal before the people through every branch of industry. I have been requested personally by our Minister to place before you the desirability of a high percentage response from members of the Civil Service, and I think it opportune to acquaint you with the Minister's views as expressed in the following:\n\n\"There can be few, if any, Civil Servants, who are actually unable to invest some part of their salary for their own and the general welfare. In very many, perhaps the majority of cases, the amount that can be set aside monthly is necessarily small but no contribution will be overlooked in the present campaign.\"\n\nIt is becoming universally accepted throughout the country that it is essential for us all to do our part in the prosecution of the war and to utilize to the utmost any resources we may have available to further this end.\n\nIt must be left to the discretion of the individual to determine the amount he is able to contribute, but it is strongly desired that participation should be representative and general and that the greatest number possible should buy certificates. Therefore, if for any reason you cannot invest as much as you would like, you should not be deterred from making a small investment.\n\nWe are especially interested in the contributions you may make from the point of view of the success of the Department's participation as shown by the number of investors. Therefore, if you have contributed in some other way we should be pleased to know of this.\n\nIf, so far, you have felt unable to purchase War Savings Certificates, an appeal is being made to you to review your financial position once again to determine whether you can now contribute. If, on the other hand, you have already pledged yourself in this way, you are being asked whether you can find it possible to increase your effort to assist in reaching the goal set by the government of a total investment of ten million dollars a month in War Savings Certificates.\n\nI should appreciate an early reply as it is desired to complete our returns as soon as possible. DEDUCTIONS CAN ONLY BE MADE UPON RECEIPT OF COMPLETED PLEDGE FORM.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nNyanga, N.S.\nApril 7, 1941\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nThis is a statement of time spent teaching night school on the Middle River Indian Reservation.

Owing to an epidemic of influenza and measles on this reserve during January and until the middle of February I could not get enough to start school, so beginning the 17th of February I taught every school-day night until the last of March, for a period of two hours a night, a total of 62 hours. The department called for three nights a week, but under the circumstances I thought it would be alright to teach every night. The subjects taught were a review of elementary arithmetic for and English for the first two weeks.\nThe remainder of the time was devoted to agriculture and woodworking. The agricultural subjects dealt mainly with the development of farmlands on the reserve, which was brought to your and the department's attention. As far as woodworking is concerned, they have an innate aptitude for it, and therefore they know most of the work which is necessary for farmers or fishermen.\n\nThe number enrolled were 21. The average nightly attendance was 15. They all took the course right from the beginning.\n\nYours truly,\nRoderick Wm Coody,\nTeacher.\nReport of work done at the Middle River Indian Day School in regards to Night School for adult Indians.\n\nOpening date Feb. 17\nClosing March 31\nNo. of hours taught - 62\n\nRoderick Wm.

On Saturday, May 31st., 1941 at about 6:00 A.M. I was walking across the Middle River bridge on No.13 highway between the Indian reservation and Ryman. At about the middle of the bridge I met Maddy Cody driving his car with Alfred McDonald and Willie MacNaughton in the front seat with him. He crowded me over to the side of the bridge endangering my life. At about 8:00 A.M. I saw Cody in the car near the teachers residence on the Reserve. The car was crossways on the road and Cody was trying to start the engine. His head was on the steering-wheel. I kept going on into the house to use the telephone. In about 10 minutes Cody came in. He had both hands in his pockets and was staggering. I was standing at the phone when he came right up to me and ordered me to \"Get the hell out of the house\". He appeared drunk and I could smell the liquor on his breath. He was staggering and cursing in the house. I left then for Ryman to phone. The next time I saw him he was getting out of a carrie's wagon to go into the house. Johnny McDonald was with him. I was with John and Francis George.\n\nSigned. John Marshall\nI am 40 years of age. I live on the Middle River Indian reservation. I remember on Saturday, May 31st, 1961 at about approximately 4:00 P.M., I was walking from Wynona to the reserve when I met Soddy Cody, Indian School Teacher. He was walking along the road with McManus's boy. He was staggering and I think he was drunk. He was about 1 mile from his car which was in the ditch. At about 5:30 P.M., on Saturday I saw him driving his car south on the Indian Reserve. Alfred McDonald and Willie MacNaughton were in the front seat with him. At about 6:00 P.M., I saw him driving his car past Noel Charlie's house on the reserve. He was alone in the car this time and going in the direction of Middle River. At about 6:00 P.M., I saw Duncan Macarrie bringing Cody home in his wagon from the direction of Middle River. Charlie McManus was with them.\n\nSigned,\n\nJohn Ocogoo.\nI am 16 years old and I live at West Middle River. I was driving to Ryanza and about \u00bc of a mile from Ryanza I met Teddy Cody and Andy McLellan. They were walking in the direction of the reserve. I picked them up with the truck and the three of us went to Ryanza where I got gas for the truck. I then drove them back to the reserve. I dropped them off at the teacher's residence. When I was in Ryanza I saw Cody's car in the ditch and he told me he wanted to go up and get Alfred McDonald to pull it out with the truck. I would say that he had been drinking but was not too drunk to drive a car. I didn't see Cody after that.\n\nWitnessed A.A. Tyson\n\nSigned Donald Robert\n\nP.M. Kinney\nI am 72 years old. I live at West Middle River.\n\nI was in my house at about dark on Saturday, May 31st, 1941, when Roddy Cody knocked at the door. I let him in. He said his car was in the ditch and he wanted to get a team to pull him out. He was apparently under the influence of liquor. He stuttered when he talked and he staggered a little. I could smell liquor on his breath. John McDonald and Duncan MacMuirie who were in the house took a horse and went down the road. They were unable to pull the car out and MacMuirie and I returned later, after driving him home. In my opinion he was not in a fit condition to drive a car.\n\nWitness: D. W. Finney\n\nSigned: R. J.

It would appear from your letter, however, that, as you are going to use this money during the months of July and August you could obtain the same results by depositing $20.00 per month in the bank; or, if you wish to buy a bond, make arrangements to buy the bond through your local bank by your deposit of $20.00 per month.\n\nL. S. McIlwraith\nChief Treasury Officer.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWe wish to report that we should like to dispense with the services of Mr. A.O'Rielley, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nAs it was very difficult, at the time of his appointment, to procure a teacher we gave him a trial on his scholarship but from observations he does not measure up to requirements. In fact, to use a slang expression, he is a \"washout\" and we would be in profit to keep the school closed if we cannot get a suitable replacement. This is from personal observations on different occasions.\n\nWe report this now as we do not know what procedure may be necessary on account of wartime regulations and to allow ample time to arrange his release and have a replacement made.\n\nJ.A. Maclean, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 24, 1944.\n\nMr. J.A. MacLean, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, N.S.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to Mr. A. O'Rielley, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School. It is usual for the Department to give at least one month's notice when dismissing a teacher and, as we have almost reached the first of May, it would mean that he would not leave the school until the end of May. The academic year ends in another month after that date.\n\nI suggest that you tell Mr. O'Rielley that his services are unsatisfactory and, unless there is a decided improvement, you will have to dismiss him at the end of the current academic year. If he does not show sufficient improvement to warrant employing him for the academic year 1944-45, you should give him the one month's notice previous to the first of June. Please let me know what action you take in this regard.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith further reference to our letter No.9, dated April 19, and your reply No.63-1-1 of April 24, regarding Mr. A.O'Rielley, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, N.S. we wish to state that we have given him notice that his services will not be required by the Department after the end of the current academic year.\n\nAs per your instructions, we warned him by letter that if school conditions did not show an improvement, we would have to dismiss him but during a recent visit to Middle River reserve we found that conditions were unchanged. The parents do not wish to send their children to school as they state that they are not taught and we feel sure that their statements are correct.\n\nJ.A.

A vacant building on the Western end of the reserve was fitted as a temporary school and although it is rather small, the children in that area now have the first chance they have had in three years to attend. Seating accommodations in all the schools of the Agency are not very satisfactory but when the new desks and seats requisitioned for are received, the difficulty will be overcome.

Miss Jennie Forbes should be, and I have secured her consent, come to Eskasoni as a lay teacher while a Sister of the teaching Order is securing her license.\n\n2. Mrs. Mary MacNeil of Shubenacadie, whose home is not far from Middle River, is anxious to teach there if a boarding-house can be found. The teachers' residence on that reserve was unoccupied for a number of years because the teacher was a local girl and could commute daily. While empty it was given to an Indian family, to the consent of Mr. Morris, Inspector, to allow decent accommodation for a blind Indian man whose wife was tubercular, and who were currently living in a disreputable shack. There is no house available for this family, should Mrs. MacNeil displace them. I will investigate more fully upon my next visit to Nyanze.\n\n3. Miss Hazel Bissett of Chapel Island could go to the Truro school in Mr. Rice's Agency, which I think is vacant. Although Truro is approximately 150 miles from her home, I think she would find it easier to visit her aged relatives than if she were teaching at Middle River. There is a daily bus service between Truro and Miss Bissett's home, and it would allow her at least one monthly visit home. I have written to her accordingly, and have advised Mr. Rice to accept her, as she has done very good work in Chapel Island.\n\nI trust you will agree with me and advise all concerned accordingly.\n\nF.

The salary allowed Mr. MacNeil will be at the rate of $65 per teaching month. The salary to be allowed Mrs. MacNeil will depend on your report as to the work she is performing, but it is considered that a nominal salary will be satisfactory. You should arrange with them to begin duties on or about January 6th, next, the date the schools reopen after the present holidays. It is noted that you have suggested to them to provide their own furniture, stove, etc. After you visit the Reserve, you should report as to what repairs and furnishings are required for the teachers' residence.\n\nIf any materials are required for the teaching of sewing, knitting and in the serving of a midday lunch to the pupils, you may arrange for the purchase of a small quantity of the articles you consider necessary, and you should have Mrs. MacNeil prepare a requisition for the articles and supplies she requires sufficient to last for a three months' period. You should forward this requisition for the consideration of the Department.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Inspector McNeill, Antigonish, of the change that you have made for the securing of the teaching services at the Middle River School as mentioned in official letter to you of the 18th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department considers, in view of your report, that his resignation should be accepted. You should obtain his resignation in writing and forward same to the Department, or, failing this, you should give him one month's notice that his services will not be required after the above date.\n\nThe Department is not at all satisfied that a married woman would be the best incumbent. Her husband would have so little, if anything, to do that it would be a bad example for the Indians among whom he was living. Perhaps you had better look for other applicants who are qualified.

J. McNeil, Esq., Teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, requested that his June quarter salary be forwarded to Mr. M. H. MacBee, Ryanza, N. S., as Mr. MacBee had apparently advanced Mr. McNeil the amount of his salary.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter, dated June 6th, from Mr. McNeil, authorising payment of $55.00 of his salary to \"The Walker Financial Company, Port Hawkesbury, Cape Breton, N.S.\".\n\nWhen the June quarter return of the Middle River Indian Day School is received, the Department will, unless you advise to the contrary, issue cheques as follows:-\n\nOne for $55.00 in favour of The Walker Financial Company\n\nand\n\nOne for $140.00 in favour of M. H. MacBee.\n\nAs you are aware, the total due Mr. McNeil for the June quarter will be $195.00, and these two cheques will cover that amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. J. McNeil, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 16,\nAntigonish, N. S.\nJune 12th 1931.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRod J. McNeil of Nyanza, school teacher, incurred a debt of over $80.00 for board while teaching this past term and, though I have at the instance of Mrs. McLeod the creditor, obtained a judgment against him, so far have not been successful in obtaining payment.\n\nAs the school term is near completion I wish you would be kind enough to inform me as to when McNeil will receive his cheque and what the amount is that he is to receive.\n\nAn early reply will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJWM/LM.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 10th instant with reference to amounts owed by Mr. R. J. McNeil, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nSince writing you, the Department is in receipt of a letter from J. W. Maddin, K.C., Sydney, N. S., in which he states that, acting on behalf of a client, Mrs. McLeod, he has secured judgment against Mr. McNeil for a debt of over $80.00 for board.\n\nAs the matter now stands, Mr. McNeil has written two letters - one requesting payment of his salary to M. H. MacRee; and another letter authorising payment of $55.00 to the Walker Financial Company, and, in addition, the Department has now received Mr. Maddin's letter.\n\nIt would appear from the above that Mr. McNeil's financial arrangements are in a somewhat tangled condition and the Department would appreciate your advising what you consider is the best action to take in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

McNeil, teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nMr. McNeil is paid a salary of $65.00 a teaching month and, at the end of the current month, the sum of $195.00 will be due for his services for the June quarter.\n\nIt appears from correspondence that the Department has previously received that Mr. McNeil has, also, contracted other accounts and, in fact, orders have been received authorizing payment to certain parties of the full amount that will be due him at the end of this month.\n\nIn view of your letter, I am communicating with C. J. McNeil, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Antigonish, N. S.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W. Maddin, Esq., K.C.,\nBarrister,\nSydney, N.

MacNeil, teacher at the Indian Day School, Middle River Reserve, I would suggest that the Department send Mr. MacNeil the full amount of his cheque as usual and let his creditors take whatever action they think necessary in order to recover from him. I do not see why the Department should assume the responsibility of paying one account when there are more accounts than his salary will cover.\n\nMr. Maddin and the other creditors have the ordinary means of law at their disposal in order to collect without taking a short cut through the Department.\n\nI may state that I have written to Mr. MacNeil and advised him strongly to pay his board bill to Mr. Maddin and all other bills in so far as he is able pointing out to him, that under the Collection Act he may be jailed for debt.\n\nIf the Department thinks otherwise I shall be pleased to carry out any instructions or make any payments should his cheque be sent to me for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMAILING TODAY AUTHORIZATION FOR PAYMENT OF CHEQUE IN FULL DUE TO ROD J MCNEIL TEACHER NYANZA TO ME STOP IS THIS AGREEABLE TO YOU WIRE ME COLLECT\n\nJ W MADDIN.\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 9th July, 1931.\n\nJ.W.

The building has not, however, yet been painted outside, that the Agent informed me, not being required by the contract. The dado inside should be oiled and a bell should be provided. A coal house and separate closets are also needed. For these the Agent has, I understand, permission.\n\n(Sgd) J. A. Macrae\n\nJ. A. R.\nOTTAWA, 21st November, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that the schoolhouse lately constructed on the Middle River reserve has not been painted, and I have therefore to request that you will at once call upon the contractor to have this matter attended to as the contract of Mr Norman J.

I was informed by the schoolmaster that he had recently purchased several gallons of paint for the purpose of painting the building. He also mentioned that the paint was of good quality and would last for many years.\n\nAfter examining the building, I concluded that the total cost of painting would be approximately $100.00. However, due to the condition of the building, I believe that the actual cost would be closer to $150.00.\n\nI am confident that the work will be done by a skilled painter.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ.

She thought a water container, together with drinking cups, should be placed in the school house, and strongly recommended mid-day meals for the children during winter. No doubt it would stimulate more interest in them attending school and from morning until closing time in the afternoon they would be in the school house and all the travelling they would have to do is to go to school in the morning and to home after school.\nOttawa, January 24th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 18th instant regarding the suggestions of Miss Catherine McDonald, Travelling Nurse for the Province of Nova Scotia, when she visited the Middle River Indian Day School, I beg to say that if the teacher will undertake the work of preparing and serving the lunch, the Department will approve of the supplying of a small quantity of supplies for the purpose. This midday lunch would consist of tea or cocoa, with sugar and Klim, and biscuits or hardtack. It is not intended to serve a regular meal but only to supplement the lunch taken by the pupils from their homes. If there are facilities for making the cocoa or tea, you may purchase a quantity of cocoa or tea, sugar, Klim, soda biscuits or hardtack. A sufficient quantity of the above should be purchased to supply a lunch to the children during the present winter months or until the end of April next, only. You may also purchase a number of graniteware mugs, not exceeding 16, for the purpose of serving the cocoa or tea. If a saucepan is required in which to prepare the cocoa, you may also purchase and supply the same. It should be understood that it is not intended that any large expenditure is to be incurred, and the Department will rely on you to see that the cost is kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nYou may also purchase a covered water container for the use of the school. It is considered that the mugs purchased for the midday lunch could be used by the pupils for drinking purposes.\n\nPlease take this matter up with the teacher at once, and if he will prepare and serve the lunch, you should arrange for the purchase of the supplies mentioned. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of any expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is hoped that if this lunch is supplied it will stimulate the interest and lead to a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Although I had no direct request from any so far yet I need not wait very long. Apparently all have been getting assistance of this kind in the past. There are some who should get it, and there are who are able to provide it for themselves. These latter are sorely in need at present. Will you kindly advise me on the matter?\n\nThere is another matter I intended to take up with the Dept. Other branches of the Governments, both Federal and Provincial think it not ill-advised to spend considerable sums of money in providing prizes to encourage different activities which spell progress. On that account, I am therefore requesting the Dept. to consider the matter as regards the Indians. I would be pleased to have a check for the small sum of FIVE DOLLARS to distribute simple prizes for attendance, cleanly habits, progress in school, etc. during the Xmas season.\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\n(Rev.) S. Campbell\nAgent\nOttawa, December 4, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReplying to the last paragraph of your letter of the 27th ultimo, I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $5 in the purchase of prizes or other gifts to be distributed to the pupils of the Middle River Indian Day School at Christmas.\n\nPlease obtain an account, in duplicate, covering the expenditure of the above amount. This you should attach to a proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department, when payment will be made to the firm from whom the supplies are purchased.\n\nRelative to the first paragraph of your letter regarding the providing of shoes and clothing for several of the Indian children who attend school, I beg to say that you will be advised in a separate communication regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

John S. Googoo, an Indian carpenter of that reserve, will do this job for $30.00 and supply the material. I consider this price to be quite reasonable and would recommend that the work be done immediately.\n\nFurthermore, I find that this school requires a few more seats and desks there are about five required and there is room for that many. At present, with a full attendance it is necessary to put three pupils in some of the seats.\n\nI might also state that the blackboards are in very poor condition and would recommend that two new blackboards 3 ft. by 9 ft. be installed.\n\nIf these new seats and blackboards are authorized, will you please advise me where they are to be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 12, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, reporting on the repairs required to the roof of the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the side of the roof that is leaking reshingled. It is noted that the cost of the labour and material will be $30. Please see that this work is completed at an early date. An account, in duplicate, covering the cost should be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase and delivery of 5 extra desks of the type and size required and have them delivered at the school and set up in the classroom. It is thought that you can obtain these desks locally or from the Rhodes-Curry Company, Amherst. The price charged should be F.O.B. nearest shipping point to the school. Please obtain an account, in duplicate, covering the cost, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nRelative to the new blackboard required, I have to say that an order is being placed here with the Government Stationery Office to supply 2 blackboards, 3' x 9', with the necessary chalk trough and moulding. This material will be forwarded to R. J. McNeil, Esq., Teacher, Baddeck, N.S. Please arrange with him to accept delivery when this material arrives.

The Department will approve of your incurring the extra expenditure of approximately $45 in reshingling the other side of the roof and in carrying out the repairs required to the chimney. All work should be completed before the extreme cold weather sets in. After this work has been finished to the satisfaction of the Agent or yourself, accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost of the material and for the labour.\n\nIt is presumed that you have arranged to obtain the five extra desks authorized in letter of the 12th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Voucher No. 283\nAntigonish, Nova Scotia.\n\nJuly 16th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise that Mr. Burns, teacher at Middle River reserve, Nova Scotia, was notified that his services would not be required after June 30th, 1932. Mr. Burns has written me and asks permission to remain in the teacher's residence until some time about the middle of August. He states that so far, he has been unable to secure work and just does not know where he will locate. I would recommend therefore, that he be allowed in the residence until the 20th of August. This will give a new teacher time enough to get settled until school opens in September.\n\nYou will recall that when Mr. Burns was appointed to the position last November, that the Indians were very much opposed to his coming to Nyanza. When he arrived there with his furniture, they did not allow him on the reserve. He was obliged to return to Cheticamp with his household goods and then upon my instructions, he returned to Middle River and settled in the teacher's residence. This however, necessitated his making two trips instead of one and this cost him an extra \u00a315.00 through no fault of his own but through the fault of the Indians. Mr. Burns states that he did not and would not complain about this only that he is being dismissed now to give the job to an Indian and he feels that he should be recompensed for the extra carting of his furniture from Cheticamp to Middle River.\n\nI may say that he has made considerable improvement around the teacher's residence and has given satisfaction and appears to be getting along well with the Indians. To me it seems only just that this voucher, in his favour, should be paid.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAntigonish, Nova Scotia.\nJuly 19th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI should like to bring to your attention that the Middle River Indian day school is very much in need of cleaning. The walls of the room require to be done over with moresco or calcimine. These walls were white at one time but now they are dark and sealing, causing much dirt to fall to the floor. The approximate cost of this job would be about \u00a335.00 and I would recommend that this work be done during the vacation, part of which could be done by some of the Indians there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 25, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing a voucher in favour of Mr. Arsene Burns covering expenses incurred by him in trucking household furniture to Middle River in November, last. The report which you forwarded regarding the necessity for Mr. Burns to make the extra trip with his furniture has been noted. I regret, however, that the regulations of the Department do not permit payment of any part of the cost of removal expenses of a teacher. We will, therefore, be unable to give favourable consideration to the payment of this account. The voucher which you submitted is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J.

It is noted that the approximate cost of material and labour is $35. You should arrange for the purchase of the material and engage Indian labour in carrying out the work, which should be completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays. After the work has been completed, you should forward vouchers, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and for the labour employed. All costs should be kept within your estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. J.

This expense was contracted through orders from the Dept. and I would recommend that it be paid. I got those receipts from the parties in case there would be any danger of duplicating the account.\n\nRegarding Mr. Prosper's future it is a pity that he has conducted himself so poorly, as he is a very capable young man and I attribute his waywardness to the company with which he associated. If he would prove himself better latter on I would be strongly inclined to give him another chance. At present the worst feature besides drinking is his attitude towards dismissal and his successor Mr. Burns. He tried to get round the Indians by getting them to sign some petition so that he may be reinstated some future time. Don't pay any attention to this as he is quite capable of quibbling, and in any case I hold the original petition at the time of the investigation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 27, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing accounts in connection with expenses incurred by Michael Prosper.\n\nOwing to the regulations of the Auditor General, it will not be possible to pay the accounts which you submitted.

No. 150-3 or No. 11-3 dated April 30th, I wish to express my great satisfaction at the decision of the Dept. to pay teachers monthly, and to pay full amount where teachers who are paid less than $600. Mr. Brown, the teacher at Nyanza is paid less than that amount, and besides he has for the last two years been draining the field around the house and barn. I think ordinarily teachers receive their fuel too and allowance should be made for fencing the property. He himself, with the help of his boys have been doing a good deal of work around that property. I should like to have someone from the Dept. if he is around here any time to look into this matter with me so that he may regard us as trying to encourage him in his good work. You know that it pays sometimes to show appreciation of good work done, some of these teachers work very hard.\nMEMO.\n\nhard and rather there is something done, let it be ever so small to show approval it may go a long way to bring about more efficient service.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

Maclean, teacher of the Indian School. The attendance is 100% and there is new life in the school. The children love the teacher and she is kind and fair in her work. I want to encourage her by recommending that the Department of the Federation, which would make her very much expenses, be sent to her. I think she will bring about good results as far as the pupils are concerned and give some comfort to the teacher, which will enable her to do her work as she should like to do it.\n\nWe are forming a sewing club among the girls so she is forming a sewing club among the girls. We are forming a sewing club among the girls.\n\nShe could get one of the carpenters of the house to spend some time with the boys, teaching them how to do some woodwork, hammering nails and sawing, and could be paid for this purpose. She could make more than $50.00.\n\nI should like to help her about $50.00 but she will not take it.\n\nThe barn which she uses was hurriedly built and is quite unsafe and the underpinning is weak and will fail and the building may fall. I think there is great danger of it crumbling away. I think some would be required for that or perhaps $50.00 in order to make a good job of it. I shall have to do something about it there soon at any rate to prevent its falling. The slates or bridges which\nI will go in and lead into the garage\nand not drive a few yards and the\nroad to the garage from the main\nroad is all dug up since the last\nweather came. I have asked others to take\nthat fixed up and get the drainage\nto help her out above. I mean her\nbrother who can't help her occasionally\nbut he has been staying with her always\nsince she has been staying with her always\nfor ten or fifteen dollars would\nhelp to do two weeks so that she could\nbe possible for her to get her car\nto the garage.\n\nI think it would be well to make\nroad work at the recreation fair\nwhich I am R #2000 in 1937 and\ncould attend to the road to the garage.\nIs there any planed if the Dept finds\nit convenient to send me\napproval of these expenditures\nat once as soon winter will be\nsettling in and it will be these\nmore difficult to get all done in\na satisfactory manner.\n\nYours sincerely,\nDr. J. Robson\nOttawa, November 19, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of sewing material for use at the Middle River Indian Day School at a cost not exceeding $10.00.\n\nProvided there will be no charge for the carpenter's services, you may also purchase material to teach the boys woodwork, at a cost of $5.00.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of wood for the teacher's residence at a cost not exceeding $50.00.\n\nThe Department does not supply garages for teachers of Indian day schools and we are, therefore, not prepared to authorize the expenditure that you mention in the latter part of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

It seemed almost a waste of money.\n\nHowever, I am told that about 250 lbs of white lead paint would be required for each house, and this all told, after gallows, turpentine and some black or other color for furnishings and doors, when I was painting the parish buildings, they had bought the white lead, best quality, #10.50 the ounce. I need about 180 lbs.\n\nAbout 35-gals of linseed oil would also be required. Costing about $10.00 a gal. $2.50 for paint + 5% tax for sales and $180.50.\n\nI think silk was required for their residence and underpinning for barn about 30 lbs. for material, so nothing and plant in addition required for staging if the work were done by Indians.\n\nI can get them to do the work but as I said above, the work will not be well done and there will be waste of paint.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nApril 8th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Dudley,\n\nThe attached letter from Rev.

If he is given the contract it should be stipulated that he employ Indian labour.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure (1).\nOttawa, June 8, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th ultimo regarding repairs required to the barn at the Middle River Indian Day School, it is presumed that this building is used as a garage by the teacher. Under these circumstances, any repairs that are necessary to this building will have to be made by her, as the Department does not supply a garage at any Indian school.\n\nIn your letter of March 27th, you stated that the cost of the paint required for the buildings at Middle River would be $80.50 and the cost of the material for repairs to the teacher's residence $30.00, or a total of $110.50. Please consult Charles McLeod, Nyansza, N. S., and ascertain from him what he would charge for doing the necessary work. When you have this information, you should advise the Department and we will then decide if funds can be secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. D. J.

MacLean.\n\nThere were 28 children on the roll at this school, and an average attendance of 22.\n\nThe school building is in fair shape but requires painting. There is a teacher's residence in connection with the school which also requires painting. The teacher informed me that the residence leaks badly, and I found that, to remedy this, it will be necessary to have it reshingled. I would refer the Department to the Rev. Father Rankin's letter regarding the painting of the school and teacher's residence.\n\nThe teacher gives the girls some training in sewing, knitting, etc., and from my observations while at this school I believe that Miss MacLean is doing fair work.\n\nThe yard around the teacher's residence needs draining and the coal shed should be repaired. The Chief of the Reserve was there at the time of my visit and I asked him to give Father Rankin an estimate of the cost of doing this work. Father Rankin will submit this estimate to the Department, if he has not already done so.\n\nI authorized Father Rankin to purchase a basin, wash-stand, soap and some towels, which the teacher asked for.\n\nM.

It is noted that the cost of his services for the next six weeks will be $25.00. At the end of that time you should have the teacher forward through your office a detailed report regarding the work accomplished, in order that we can decide whether or not his employment should be continued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It looks very hopeful having met the parents for a long time and the situation has also improved when the children came back with me that they seemed to agree. We attempted to get nothing but the best for their residence and I am sure that the quality of the activity has been improved by the lack of the Department's officials. The officials have neglected the needs of Canada and our people to settle down so young people.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1938.\n\nDear Father Rankin:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nI regret that, in preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year, no amount was specifically included for any extensive repairs at this school. Under the present set-up of our appropriation, it is difficult to find funds if they have not been specially included.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that you let me have a quotation on painting the interior of the school, and also a quotation on painting the interior of the teacher's residence. A separate estimate should be supplied for each. If it is your intention to have the work done by Indian labour, you should let me know what material will be required. If, however, you suggest that the work be done by a white man, you should state his name and his address, also the amount for which he will do the work.\n\nWhen the above information is received, I will give it very careful consideration and hope that it will be possible to provide funds for part of the expenditure this year, if not all.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I am appointed to look after the Indians here and not only attend them spiritually but also act as agent for the Dept., I have no scruples of conscience in doing both of these duties. I am attending & in doing both of these duties. I am attending to the Indians & virtually receive no remuneration but rather have on my account a charge to help out when it may be needed. I appeal to the government who do not believe officially that agents are up against especially first he cannot they see into the minds of their clients for attempting to the sentimental affairs.

The agency did not receive any full payment with the difference in the amount of the...\nDepartment to her seem to me to be in my regard, I have often heard it a complaint against individual members for shifting acting in regard to the welfare of the Indians.\n\nIf you do not wish to pay the enclosed I shall feel obliged to give it myself and so as we desirous and useless an expenditure as I have observed made during the last 15 years that partly looks after the Spiritual welfare of the Indians that have been furnished the Indians by the government and the natives, and further comfort of the natives they go to the Indians, and now Indians child who gave this Indians, therefore something to do to help themselves, therefore I have no difficulty in aiding them and as far as authorities on can claim I had authority to furnish boots and clothes for the children to do school.

J. McKeel.\nHouse of Commons\n\n377219 OTTAWA.\n\nJuly 28th, 1911\n\nRe: matters:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have received from the Board of Trade a letter dated July 28th, 1911, regarding the Indians at Brantford. It states that they have been informed by the Board of Trade that the Indians at Brantford have been promised land in the vicinity of the former settlement at Brantford. The Board of Trade has also informed them that the land will be surveyed and that they will be given an opportunity to purchase it.\n\nD. O.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Boursgeois, N.B.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th inst., No. 116774/5, and to say that I will be able soon to furnish the Department with the desired information. The delay is chiefly due to the seeming dilatoriness of a correspondent to whom I applied for prices on dimension scantling and rough lumber delivered at certain points.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your favor of 11th I beg to say that I am very grateful to you for all you have done towards the building of a teacher house here on the Reserve. I have all reason to hope the house will go up very soon. It was always a necessity but will be more so now as this Deputy does not occupy it to be sold to a party who may wish me to vacate building at any time.\n\nI am returning you the Royal letter.\n\nWith many thanks,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nSee also Letter No. 20 January 11 on 16774.\nDear Mr. Reddy,\n\nI have the honour to enclose you a letter received from Miss Teacher, who is an Indian Reserve school teacher in the County of Victoria.

D. McKenzie, Esq., K.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the erection of a teacher's residence on the Middle River reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the circumstances the Department has inserted an item of $1,000.00 in the supplementary estimates for the next fiscal year and, should this sum be voted by Parliament, steps will be taken to erect the building during the coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOttawa, 12th April, 1911.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, I beg to say that the sum of $150.00 has been provided in the Main Estimates of this Department to defray the expense of necessary work on the roads on the Eskasoni Reserve, and a similar amount has been provided for road work at Nyanza. $650.00 has also been provided for in the Estimates to carry on the work of protecting Indian lands at Nyanza from the encroachment of the river. It is probable that this amount will not suffice to complete what has to be done, and therefore the Department is taking steps to have a further sum placed in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nI beg also to inform you that provision is being made in the Supplementary Estimates to defray the necessary cost in connection with the erection of a residence for the Indian school teacher.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) J.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nD.D. McKenzie, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nI hope you are taking steps toward a tenure for the Indian Teacher at Tyangue Reserve No. The house is being needed as she should be so under delag. Yours truly,\n\nD. D. McKenzie\nOttawa, October 23, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant in reference to the erection of teacher's residence at the Middle River School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this work was not undertaken because, as you are aware, the whole of the grant which was asked for in the Supplementary Estimates for the current year was not voted. I may say, however, that the matter will not be lost sight of, but as the season is now so far advanced it is not considered advisable to undertake building operations this fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nD. D. McKenzie, Esq., K.C.,\nNorth Sydney, N.S.\n1 - Act\n2 - Return to Schools for plans.\n\nMr. Chinn requested to prepare plans & specifications. 29/10/11\n\nA.M.\nI estimate its cost completely finished at $800. Leaving the \"upstairs\" unfinished, the cost would be $100 less. I am speaking now particularly of the cost of erecting such a house at Middle River. A contractor would likely ask a much higher figure than the sum mentioned, which, however should suffice.\n\nMy estimate is based on materials to be used as follows:-\nSpruce or Hemlock for scantling and rough boards; best Cedar Shingles for roof; No. 1 Spruce Siding for outside walls; Hardwood for top floor over rough floor of surfaced Hemlock or Spruce; Surfaced Spruce, free from knots and shakes, for floor overhead; Spruce Laths with No. 1 lime, sand, and Plaster Paris, for ceiling and interior walls; No. 1 Spruce Sheathing for wainscoating; No. 2 Pine window casings and sashes, with doors and door casings of same materials; Mouldings and finishing lumber of standard quality, as also Nails, Zinc, Dry Paper, Tar Paper, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th ult., No. 116774/5, and previous communications on the same subject, I beg to submit for the Department's consideration the enclosed very imperfect sketches, of a building which I think would be suitable as a teacher's residence at Middle River.\n\nAs may be seen, it is designed to accommodate a small family, and is as limited in size as the comfortable housing of 4 or 5 people will permit, ordinary convenience and sanitation considered. In connection with such a building, I will frankly state that I should like to have one room in it set apart for my personal benefit.\n\nWith regard to Middle River Reserve, I can remain there when visiting it only until I get hungry, when I am obliged to leave and travel a couple of miles to get a meal. I should like to prolong my visit sometimes for a few days, especially in Spring; but the absence of a suitable lodging place makes this impracticable. These remarks apply also to a few other reserves.\n\nI may say further that medical men would like to have some place where they might get a comfortable meal, and to stay over night if necessary, when visiting reserves on professional business. At present, there is no such place on any reserve in Cape Breton.\n\nThe enclosed rough sketches are for a residence 25x21 ft. of one story and an \"up-stairs\", or practically of one and a half story in height. The shed shaped L shown in the sketch will add comparatively little to the cost, but without it, accommodation on the main floor would be very scramp.\n\nJ. D.

No one in this part of the country thinks of using anything new but concrete, especially for the foundations of dwelling houses.\n\nFinally, I desire to direct your attention to the position of the chimney, as marked on the plan, with regard to the situation of the kitchen. I presume that the pipe of the cook-stove is intended to connect with the chimney, in which case, the latter would seem to be badly placed. Would not the junction of the dining-room and hall partitions be a better position for the chimney?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

The brick work is to be carried three feet above the roof and there should be a galvanized iron pipe of sufficient height to insure a proper draft. The chimney flue should be eight inches square inside and the chimney should rest on a two inch plank frame about seven feet high well fixed in position and located as you and the contractor think best. This frame should be constructed so that it may be used as a cupboard and should be fitted with a door and shelves. Please obtain an estimate of the cost of this work from the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlex. D.

McLean\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the teacher residence on the Middle River Reserve, now under construction.\u2014I beg to advise you that there is no provision made for an outside entrance to the cellar,\u2014the plans and specifications evidently not mentioning a cellar door.\n\nIn your letter dated June 28th, 1912, and having file no. 116774/5, you requested me to obtain from the contractor of the teacher residence an estimate of the cost of providing an extra chimney on the auto kitchen.\u2014I wrote him and obtained his estimate ($75.00)\u2014but at the same time the contractor expressed a doubt as to whether he could undertake to build the extra chimney.\u2014giving as his reason the lateness in the part of proceeding with construction.\u2014I have already written you in regard to this, but to date have had no reply.\n\nPlease advise me if the Department has the appointment of an inspector for the teacher residence at Middle River Reserve under consideration,\u2014or have I to attend to that matter?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlex.

The price asked is considered to be higher than it should, but under the circumstances the Department will allow the contractor $75.00 for this work, if finished in a proper manner and in accordance with the instructions given you in a previous communication.\n\nRegarding the inspection it is desired that you should report on the buildings at intervals and Mr. A. J. Boyd, Indian Superintendent, was so informed on May 17th, last, and asked to give you full instructions and blank forms for progress certificates. As it does not appear that he has done this I am sending you a few progress certificates and payment will be made to the contractor up to 60% of the value of the material on hand and the work performed from time to time. You will, therefore,\n\nAlex. D. McLean, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBaddeck, C.B.\nplease see that good materials are used and that all the work is performed strictly in accordance with the plans and specifications. As stated above you may submit these certificates in duplicate as the contractor requires advances to which he is entitled from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, July 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nOn May 17th, last, the Department wrote you asking you to communicate with the Agent with regard to the inspection of the work on the Middle River teacher's residence. The Agent now writes asking if the Department has appointed an inspector or whether it is his duty to attend to the matter. It would appear, therefore, that you have not communicated with him and given him the instructions with regard to the progress certificates, etc. The Department is now writing him direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.D.

It will be very inconvenient for the occupants, and arrangements should be made to build a chimney.\n\nIn a letter directed to me June 28th inst., and bearing file No. 116774/5, you asked me to obtain an estimate from the contractor for the construction of an extra chimney. I forwarded the contractors estimate ($75.00) to the Department on July 6th, and not receiving any reply, I wrote again on the 20th inst., but have received no reply to date.\n\nThe contractor has notified me that he will build the chimney for $75.00, and I would be obliged to receive your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nAlex.

D. McLean's appointment as Mr. McDonald's successor. As soon afterwards as I conveniently could, I went to see Mr. McLean, and instructed him also, as requested in your letter of May 17th.\n\nUnless the Department notifies me promptly of changes taking place from time to time in the personnel of its officials, I am apt to be placed in an awkward position.\n\nJ.

If\nsomething is not done before\nthen...\nIt would be well also to supply a skeleton store, block, etc., which would belong to the building. There is need of an old lumberjack\u2014particularly a wall clock\u2014and a small barn, the latter will soon be scarcely cold, and the nearest barn to that house is about three quarters of a mile distant. She has a cow & horses, etc., and finds this very inconvenient. Please do what you can in this matter & very much obliged.\n\nCaptain Simon Steel\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nIndian Agent.\nBaddeck.\nN.S.\nreceived the enclosed letter from Capt. Simon Paul of the Middle Reserve, Victoria County, a couple of days ago. Before I was appointed as agent I had occasion to visit the reserve in my capacity as clergyman and called at the house of the teacher which the Department had built last summer, and I saw that the house was a good one, but there were no openings above the chimney for stove pipes except for the kitchen stove. The Dept. evidently intended that the house should be heated by a furnace as there is an aperture in the cellar part of the chimney for a furnace pipe. There is no outbuilding of any kind, and the teacher evidently needs a small barn for a cow and horse, and a water closet. A kitchen stove is also needed as it would be very inconvenient should the present teacher leave that her successor would have to provide all these things.\n\nI recommend, therefore, that the Department furnish the following items for the teacher's residence at Middle River Reserve:\n\n1. A hot air furnace of sufficient capacity to make the house comfortable.\n2. A kitchen cook stove.\n3. A small barn for a cow.\n4. A water closet, which may be built in connection with the barn or detached from it.\n\nIf you should approve of this expenditure, please instruct me how to proceed in the matter. Shure.\nSir,\n\nI call for tenders for the construction of these buildings,\nfor the heating apparatus and for the furnishing and\nplacing of the kitchen stove; or would have discretionary\npower to purchase the stove and have it placed there\nonce as it is needed urgently.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nOttawa November 29, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant in reference to the heating of the teachers dwelling on the Middle River Reserve and other matters.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it was not the intention of the Department to heat this building with a furnace and the contractor should have built the chimney for stoves. It will be necessary for you therefore to arrange for the required openings in the proper places.\n\nThe Department does not supply stoves for the teachers but is prepared to erect a small stable and the closets. Kindly give a description of the stable that you will think to be satisfactory and an estimate of the cost, at the same time stating whether there is any person in the vicinity who could do the work by day labour. Less time will be saved by having this done by day labour rather than by contract.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nD.J. McIntosh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nBaddeck, N.S.\nSir,\n\nReceived your letter dated Nov. 29, 1912, No. above indicated in reference to the teachers dwelling at Middle River Reserve, Victoria Co. You say that the Department will not furnish said dwelling with furnace or kitchen stove and you ask me to arrange for the required openings for stoves in the chimney.\n\nYou also say that the Department is prepared to erect a small barn and the closets and you ask me to give you a description of the stable required and its estimated cost and you assume that the work be done by day labor.\n\nI shall endeavor to comply with your request next week. As I live about 8 miles from the Reserve I must hire a horse each time and lose a whole day besides. The Department expects me to visit the school there at least once a month. Do you expect me to do all this travelling and negotiating without any other compensation than my yearly salary?\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nMiddle River Reserve\nOttawa, December 12, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in reference to work in connection with the school-house on the Middle River Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to have you look after the matters referred to in official letter of the 29th ultimo and will allow you reasonable travelling expenses for each visit when you find it necessary to make one to the school under instructions. It might be possible for you to make your monthly inspection on the same date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. J.

There small windows about 2 feet square as indicated on plan and three doors below and one above leading to hay loft.\nSir,\n\nIn your communication to me on Nov. 24th you asked me to give you a description of a stable and closet which I considered satisfactory for the use of the teacher on the Middle River Reserve and also to state if any person in the vicinity could do the work. I visited the Reserve on Monday the 16th inst. and found a man who can do the work and advised him to employ as his help any of the Indians who may be capable and asked him to give me an estimate of what such a building should cost. I enclose a sketch of what I consider necessary and also enclose a copy of his estimate. You will notice that I have put the closet in the barn and also the fuel room. As the weather is so cold we will have to put the building on blocks for the present and have a better foundation placed under it in the spring, which will not cost much.\n\nThe building is proposed to be 14 feet x 20 feet\u2014without loft\u2014to make a good hay loft. The roof only is to be shingled\u2014the body to be battened which I think will make it sufficiently warm. The height of the loft above the lower rooms is to be about 7 feet leaving about 5 feet above for the hay space.\n\nThe estimated cost of the building as per enclosed memo is $169.67. Of course it is only an estimate and may cost more or less.\n\nPlease advise if you approve the above and if you advise me to proceed with the work.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, December 26, 1912.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant submitting a sketch, together with a bill of materials, for outbuildings in connection with the Middle River School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to have this work done by day labour under a competent foreman, Indian help to be used where practicable. This work may be proceeded with at once, but the Department would like you to see that a good job is done. The bills for materials should show in detail the articles purchased with prices and the account for labour should show the number of hours for each man, with the rates of wages paid, which should be reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The stove that is there now is pretty well used up.\n\nI might say the state that the cellar in the teacher's residence is in bad condition.

It seems that the spring water will be sufficient for the needs of the school.\n\nThis would be a good time to do the work, considering the construction of the cellar. The house is much needed and a drain made to carry the water from the house. A small storehouse is also needed or a porch to the house size 10x12. The house also requires painting inside and outside.\n\nAll of the above is most necessary to have done.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 17, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo in reference to concrete cellar in the teacher's residence, Middle River school, and in reply to inform you that you should send in an estimate of cost of doing any work which you consider necessary and recommend being done. This is necessary as consideration cannot be given until this has been ascertained.\n\nIn this instance the Department cannot give any instructions in reference to the cellar floor as it is not known here if the drainage stated to be necessary will interfere with this.\n\nIn your report to the Department each item is to be dealt with separately showing the necessity for it with itemized cost.\n\nThis statement should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In connection with this work I should like to state that the house itself which has been vacant for seventeen years has been suffering in many ways, both from the elements and from vandalism of the Indians. The outhouse, or barn, which was the rendezvous of escapading Mic-Macs, was burned a few years ago. Having no barn at their disposal the house was broken into. Several of the windows were broken and the plastered walls were damaged considerably as well as being defaced.\n\nIt was necessary to reshingle the roof which was in a very bad state of repair. It was also necessary to rebuild an outhouse or barn, which comprises a toilet, a place for fuel, as well as enough room for one cow or horse. I may add that all work done was absolutely necessary and the cost was kept as low as possible.\n\nWith exception of repairing and whitening the plaster, all work was done by the Indians under the supervision of a foreman. With reference to the amount and kind of furniture being supplied, just the mere essentials of an inexpensive kind are being furnished.\n\nAttached herewith are vouchers for the material and labour in connection with these repairs and I trust you will find same in order for payment please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing vouchers in payment for the material and labour in the repairs that were made to the teacher's residence and barn at the Middle River Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the expense in carrying out these repairs was larger than anticipated, but, in view of your report as to the amount of work that was necessary to be carried out, the action taken is approved. Cheques in payment for the labour are being sent. Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are almost completely assigned and it is regretted that it will not be possible to pay the accounts of John MacIver covering the cost of the lumber and other material supplied until after the 1st of April, next, when our appropriation for the coming fiscal year is available. As soon as these funds are available, cheques in payment will be sent.\n\nIt is noted that certain furnishings have also been supplied. If possible, these accounts should be withheld until the 1st of April, next, after which date payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Nathan,\n\nRe. Propose Referring to the Teacher's House, etc.\n\nThis is to inform you that the Teacher's House on the Middle River Indian Reserve needs repairs, painting, etc., in the very worst shape by a way I got a carpenter to examine the house for me and we came to the conclusion that it would cost about $100.00 to make a complete job of it. Of course, it is badly needed, the porch is leaky, the plastering is all broken up, the clap boarding outside is in bad condition and the corner is attended to, the house is well kept. Hence I hope and trust that you may see your way clear to have the job done at an early date. Believe me,\n\nYour most sincere and obedient servant,\n\nJames Burns\nIndian Teacher\n\nDear Sirty:\u2014I find that this matter should be attended to at once.\n\nRev. D. J. Raykin\nOttawa, July 27, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Middle River Indian Day School. Owing to lack of funds, the Department cannot authorize the expenditure recommended by the teacher.\n\nHowever, you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $25.00 in making urgent repairs to the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

S.\nMy dear Father Rucklin, I am in receipt of your esteemed communication of the 13th inst.\n\nIn reply, I think that a fair estimation to cover the cost of a neat, neat and whole fence should be in the vicinity of $430. Of course, a wire fence might cost over $60. At all events, I shall see to it that it be done with the least possible expense around the lot of\nRev. J. Smith, P.P.,\nIndian Agent\n\nland on which are the house\nand barn for the use of\nthe teacher. I am particularly\nanxious to have this lot\nof land under some form\nof cultivation this year.\n\nBelieve me, your\nmost obedient and\never faithful servant,\n\nAndrew Burns,\nTeacher.\nApril 29th, 1935\n\nThe Dept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing your herein letter of Mr. Butler, Indian Teacher at Middle River Indian Reservation regarding cost of fence around residence yard.

Martin\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 3, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing communication received from the teacher of the Middle River Day School, I beg to say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure that would be required to erect the fence requested by Mr. Burns.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. D. J.

It really looks disgracefully neglected. The school requires shingling and other repairs. Would you please have these matters attended to.\n\nD. J. Rankin.\nOttawa, June 6, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding your visit of inspection to the Middle River Indian Day School, I have to request that you will inform the Department of the approximate cost of the repairs required to the interior walls of the teacher's residence. Further, please give an estimate of the cost of material and labour in carrying out the shingling and other repairs required to the school building. You should state how you would recommend having the work performed. Would it be satisfactory to have it done by Indian labour? Our funds are extremely limited, and only those repairs which you believe are urgent can be considered. When the Department receives full information concerning the cost involved and the best means of having the work done, you will be advised.\n\nI may add that there are no funds available to paint the exterior of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. D. J. Rankin,\nIndian Agent,\nIona, C. B.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Dept., Ottawa.\n\nJune 10th\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to letter no. 63-1-8\nof June 6th I stated that the\nrepair & work necessary for the\nresidence would cost about $40.00.\nI estimate the cost of shingles\nfor material and labor for cedar\nshingles about $20.00 and labor\nabout $5.00 or about $25.00. The\ncabin gets some shingles now\nhere for perhaps $5.00 but I\nwould recommend the better\nquality for they last much\nlonger.\n\nI am very sorry that the Dept.\ndoes not see its way clear\nto paint the exterior of the\nresidence for it looks very\nbad and I am sure it is\nnot well to let it go much\nlonger without.\n\nRS: I can get the Indians to do\nwork done by Indian labor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ. Ralston\nAgent\nOttawa, June 15, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the repairs required to the teacher's residence and the shingling required to the school building at the Middle River Indian Day School. In this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have this work carried out during the coming summer holidays, employing Indian labour, as far as possible.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of the shingles and other materials required, from firms on the approved list. A good grade of Cedar shingles should be obtained for the school building. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nProper returns, in triplicate, should be supplied covering the labour employed. These returns should show the names of the labourers, the days or hours employed and the rate paid. They should be signed by the individual labourers, certified by yourself and forwarded for payment.\n\nThe Department will leave in your hands the matter of repairs to the residence and school and will expect you to have the work carried out in a satisfactory manner and at the lowest possible cost. The cost for the material and labour should not exceed your estimate, viz.: $40.00 for repairing the residence and $90 for the material and labour in shingling the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

S. (Electoral District of Cape Breton North-Victoria), I have to say that these matters were drawn to the attention of the Department by Reverend D. J. Rankin, the local Indian Agent. He stated that the repairs he considered necessary to the teacher's residence would cost about $40.00 and that the school building would require shingling and certain other repairs. He estimated the cost for materials and labour to be about $90.00, and stated that he could have the work done by Indian labour.\n\nThe Agent was authorized to purchase the shingles and any other materials from firms on the approved list and to have the work carried out during the coming summer holidays. He was advised that the cost was not to exceed his estimate - $40 for repairing the residence and $90 in shingling the school building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Burns, former teacher, has vacated residence on 15th August. I have visited it some time after and found that rain had come through the roof near the kitchen place. Miss Maclean is going to occupy the house while teaching taking her brother with her and it will be necessary to make some repairs to the roof. Mr. Burns has often spoken to me about that.\n\nThe residence looks very very bad. The paint peeling off and it hail soon he in very bad condition. I recommend that repair be done to it and that it be painted with two coats of paint. I think about two coats of white lead and about 10 gals of oil and about 2 gals of turpentine mixed as the job. I have just finished painting one of my rooms and have used the same mixture. Churches and schools should be that well painted to the size that this house was done and done the best. The labour was done and done well at $600. People feeding the resident will be remark that the residence makes much needed and suppose looking very satisfactory. And the people who pass by the Canadians who make remarks are interested because it\nin their manner that was used in building it. I have, therefore, been pleased if you would approve of this expenditure.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. D. J.

MacLean, Indian Agent.\nNyanga, Vict. Co.,\nNova Scotia.\nJan. 25, 1943.\n\nMr. J. A. MacLean, Indian Agent,\nEskasoni & Chapel,\nCape Breton,\nNova Scotia.\n\nDear Mr. MacLean:\n\nMy brother who lived with me at the \"Teacher's Residence\" here, up to the present, had to return home to remain due to the illness of his father. When he came over with me he took furniture from home, as there was very little in the house here. Now, that he has returned home, Mr. MacLean, he has taken his furniture, bed-clothes, etc., with him. I got another party to live with me in the Residence for the remainder\nII.\n\nOf the school-term. But she has no furniture to bring with her, and there is, really, very little in the house now. It will be necessary, Mr. MacLean, that we get some furniture for the house and have a little work done to make the house comfortable to live in, for the remainder of the school-term.\n\nWhat I would appreciate the Department supplying for the house, Mr. MacLean, is the following:\n\n1 bed, spring, and mattress.\n6 window blinds.\nCurtain material for curtains for 6 windows.\n1 kitchen table.\n16 window glasses for the \"storm-windows\".\n2 lamps.\n4 cords of wood.\n12 double rolls wall-paper (for papering a bed-room and\nliving-room)\n\nThe Department also paid an Indian $5.00 for putting up the storm-windows, cleaning the sills and putting up a stove and a few other little jobs around the house for me last winter; and I would appreciate it if they would permit me to have the same done this winter.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\nMae Chisholm\nOttawa,\nFebruary 6, 1943.\n\nMr. J.A. MacLean, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel,\nN.S.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing a letter from the teacher of the Middle River Indian Day School, the Department does not wish to spend any large amount of money at this school, as we hope to be in a position to close it at the end of June next. However, if the teacher really intends to reside in the building for the balance of the academic year, we wish her to be comfortable and, with this in mind, you may arrange for the purchase of the following articles, if you consider them necessary:\n\n1 Bed, spring and mattress\n6 Window blinds\n1 Kitchen table\n16 Window glasses for storm windows\n2 Lamps\n4 Cords of wood\n12 Double rolls wall paper\nCurtain material for 6 windows\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAs previously reported, the Indian Day School at Middle River reserve, N.S. was re-opened with Mr. A.O'Reilly in charge as teacher. When I visit the school in a few days and receive completed documents from the teacher, I will report further regarding his appointment.\n\nHe is a married man with a wife and two or three children living with him. Having limited means and not having household furniture, I hereby recommend that the teacher's residence to be used by he and his family, be supplied with the following articles:\n\n1 bed.\n2 bed-springs.\n2 mattresses.\n2 lamps.\nDishes to the value of about $10.00.\n\nThe house is already furnished with a stove, some chairs, a table and 1 bed without a spring.\n\nJ.A. MacLean, Indian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 22, 1943.\n\nMr. J. A. MacLean, Indian Agent, Eskasoni Chapel, N. S.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant and to state that you are authorized to purchase, from approved local sources, -\n\n1 bed,\n2 bed springs,\n2 mattresses, and\ndishes at an approximate cost of $10.00,\n\nfor the Indian Day School at the Middle River Reserve.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach account amounting to $71.33, covering supplies required for furnishing the teacher's residence at the Middle River School. The teacher is a married man and in order to obtain his services we had to furnish the living quarters. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTEACHER'S RESIDENCE - The teacher's residence is a good building. It has not been occupied for several years. It is, therefore, deteriorating rapidly.\n\nMrs. Victoria Frenzie, her son Christopher, and four children whom she is maintaining, were authorized to move into the building with the understanding that her present house would be made available to the family of Jim Peck - wife and six children. Note, Mrs. Peck is Mrs. Frenzie's daughter. The house now occupied by Jim Peck and family is to be made available to Charlie Morrison, his wife Martha, and their boy Donald, seven years old. Mrs. Morrison is an advanced TB case, and the family were living in a most disgraceful hut. It was imperative that some other living quarters be provided them. Therefore, it was necessary to make the above arrangements. The agent was instructed to have the Morrison shack destroyed by burning it, when the family moved out, as it was a menace to the health of the community. Dr. C. L. MacMillan agreed that the building should be destroyed.\n\nOn my first visit to this reserve, about half-past eight at night, it was raining very heavily and the water was coming through the Morrison shack in many places. Charlie was trying to keep the fires going. Martha was in the only bed, coughing and experiencing, with Donald sleeping with her. I came to the conclusion that the only solution was to have Donald admitted to the residential school at Shubenacadie. We intended to take him with us as we were travelling there in the agent's car. However, two days after, when we returned to pick him up the mother and father raised such a disturbance that it was decided to give them a month's extension with the following understanding, which was signed by both parents:\n\nDonald is to attend school regularly every day. He is to sleep in a room separate from his mother. A bed belonging to the school residence, and not being used, was provided for this purpose. No doubt the boy will eventually have to be sent to the residential school. I did not wish to force the issue during the time of my visit as the parents were very upset and in a very nervous condition which might have resulted in both, or either of them, doing something desperate.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\u2014 INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH \u2014\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 255-8 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT MIDDLE RIVER DAY SCHOOL\nTEACHERS\u2019 RESIDENCE\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM JUNE 1935\nTO OCTOBER 1926 Nov 1945\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 6-2-12-12 VOLUME 2\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6C48)\n\nFile 255-1, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - General Administration. 1895 - 1897, 1902 - 1936.\n\nFile 255-1, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - General Administration. 1936 - 1947.\n\nFile 255-3, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Teachers' Salaries. 1913 - 1936, 1943 - 1947.\n\nFile 255-5, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Establishment - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1902 - 1903.\n\nFile 255-5, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1916 - 1937.\n\nFile 255-5, part 3\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1937 - 1949.\n\nFile 255-8, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Teachers' Residence - Establishment Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1911 - 1919, 1929 - 1935.\n\nFile 255-8, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Teachers' Residence - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1935 - 1945.\n\nFile 256-1, part 1\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - Establishment - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1891 - 1929.\n\nFile 256-1, part 2\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - General Administration. 1930, 1936 - 1947.\n\nFile 256-3, part 1\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - Teachers' Salaries. 1922 - 1947.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6048)\n\nFile 255-1, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - General Administration. 1895 - 1897, 1902 - 1936.\n\nFile 255-1, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - General Administration. 1936 - 1947.\n\nFile 255-3, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Teachers' Salaries. 1913 - 1936, 1943 - 1947.\n\nFile 255-5, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Establishment - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1902 - 1903.\n\nFile 255-5, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1916 - 1937.\n\nFile 255-5, part 3\nVictoria Co. - Middle River School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1937 - 1949.\n\nFile 255-8, part 1\nVictoria Co. - Teachers' Residence - Establishment Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1911 - 1919, 1929 - 1935.\n\nFile 255-8, part 2\nVictoria Co. - Teachers' Residence - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1935 - 1945.\n\nFile 256-1, part 1\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - Establishment - Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1891 - 1929.\n\nFile 256-1, part 2\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - General Administration. 1930, 1936 - 1947.\n\nFile 256-3, part 1\nColchester Co. - Millbrook School - Teachers' Salaries. 1922 - 1947.\nExtract from a letter dated 17th Street Halifax\n\nReginald Hoo\n\nSir (Mr. Andrew Paul \u2014 Chief of the Cape Breton Indians) desires me to advise you that a school is greatly needed at the Reserve at Truro, there being no less than thirty children there and that an available house, partly built can be purchased for about $150.\n\nThere is no farm near the place it now stands but the salary may be fixed at $200 per year.\n\nWith the others to be sent Mr. Jones\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

McClellan\nNova Scotia\nMillbrook Reserve Colchester Co\nJuly 30th\n\nTo Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nLetter\n\nSir:\u2014In accordance with your communication of July 7th I forward plan and specifications accompanied by tender for construction of school house to seat 30 pupils, that being the smallest size schoolhouse that can be built under Provincial requirements.\n\nThere are on the Reserve at present 38 children of school age.\n\nI instructed the Architect and Tenderers not to exceed if possible the sum of $1250.\n\nThe building will be on the Public road leading to the town of Truro, and in sight of the Intercolonial Railway, while the plan had necessarily to be made as plain as possible, I think if completed it will be a credit to the Indian Department.\n\nYours,\n\nJos. H. Smith,\nIndian Agent\nTruro\nN.S.\nwith the principles of proper lighting of the rooms, etc., as elsewhere directed, and should not be more than two stories in height, exclusive of the basement which should be airy and well lighted for a play room, and of the attic which might be utilized as a general assembly room.\n\n[4.] Lighting, Ventilation and Warming. (a) The windows should be principally on the left of the pupils. There may be two behind them, but none in front of them or on the right. The front and right can be utilized for an unbroken blackboard, which should reach to within two and a half feet of the floor, and have a width of five feet, the upper portion being useful for the more permanent illustrations.\n\n(b) The lower window sill should be at least four feet from the floor, and the top of the window as near the ceiling as possible. The left wall above the four foot line should be about one-half glass.\n\n(c) The upper part of each window should be a transom, hinged below, or the upper sash should be hung on pulleys, as well as the lower, for ventilation purposes.\n\n(d) The size of a school room is determined by the greatest number of pupils it is intended to hold, 200 cubic feet of air being required for each. When the room is full of pupils this air should be entirely changed at least two or three times every hour. In some of the more expensively ventilated school buildings in the province, the air is warmed and changed every ten minutes.\n\n(e) In rural sections where economy has to be carefully considered, a large stove surrounded by a sheet metal jacket closely fitted to the floor and around the door, separated from the rest of the stove by an air space, and rising up over three feet and nearly to the top of the stove, makes an excellent ventilating and warming furnace. Underneath the stove and shut off from the school room by the jacket should be a large opening for the admission of pure, fresh air through a large tin pipe or air-tight wooden funnel running underneath the floor and through the foundation, then turning up and terminating at least six or eight feet above the ground on the side of the house, the entrance to the funnel being lateral and covered with a grating to prevent the throwing of anything into it. The stove should be two or three times larger than one necessary to warm the room without such an\n[2.] School Grounds. (a) In rural sections the grounds should contain, when convenient, one acre, never less than half an acre; in thickly peopled localities, or villages, a half an acre or more but never less than one-third; and in towns never less than one-quarter, if possible.\n\n(b) The form should be, perhaps, more than twice as long as broad, in order to furnish proper separate play grounds for the boys and girls. (c) It should be properly levelled, drained when necessary, neatly fenced around, ornamented with desirable shade trees, which should neither interfere with the play grounds nor the light of the school room.\n\n(d) Clean water, free from the suspicion of taint from surface drainage or other impurities, should be within easy reach of the school house.\n\n[3.] School Houses. (a) For a rural section not likely to have more than 30 pupils for twenty years to come, the school house should have the following inside measurements:\n\nWidth 23 feet, length 31 feet, (hall 6 feet, teacher's platform 5 feet, clear space 4 feet, seats and desks 13 feet, clear space 3 feet), and 11 to 12 feet high.\n\n(b) For a section with 42 pupils: Width 24 feet, length 36 feet, (hall 6 feet, platform 5 feet, space 4 feet, seats and desks 18 feet, space 3 feet), and height 12 to 13 feet.\n\n(c) For a section with 54 pupils: Width 25 feet, length 41 feet, (hall 6 feet, platform 5 feet, space 4 feet, seats and desks 23 feet, space 3 feet), and height 13 to 14 feet.\n\n(d) For a section with a greater number of pupils, there should be, as required by the statute, a separate class room, large enough to be converted into a primary department of a graded school should the attendance increase.\n\n(e) When a building is situated with its length north and south, the entrance doors can be at the south end, the teacher's platform next the entrance hall, the stove at the north end, so that on cold, windy days the heated air may drift through the whole room; the light coming principally from the east will obviate the glare of a midday sun, and the maps can be hung on the north wall to secure their proper orientation in the minds of the pupils (a very important matter), the west wall being used temporarily for maps when the convenience of teaching requires it.\n\n(f) School houses with several departments should be so planned as to admit of extension without interfering\nOTTAWA, 6th August, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing plan and specifications, and tenders for the construction of a school-house on the Tillbrook Reserve.\n\nIt is regretted that you appear to have misunderstood the Department's letter of the 20th July last, in which you were instructed to call for tenders for the erection of a suitable building at a cost not to exceed \u00a3500. The tenders received from you are of no use, as the lowest is for about $100 more than the amount voted by Parliament for the purpose.\n\nI return herewith the plan and specification forwarded by you, and have to request that you will be good enough to obtain a tender for a figure not exceeding $500.

Secretary\n\nThos. B. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro,\nN.S.\nThe humble petition of the undersigned showeth,\n\nThat the education of the Indians on the reservation which is situated about three miles from the town of Truro is not conducted and heretofore has not been conducted according to the school laws of the province, in such cases made and provided.\n\nThese Indians are of the Mic Mac tribe all Catholics, and good citizens who are anxious to bring up their children in the faith of their fathers but under their present unfortunate circumstances they find it very difficult to do so.\n\nYour petitioners would further show that when the Government established a school on the reservation a young man, a Catholic, holding a high grade of license, and a normal school diploma, sent in his application for the position but Mr. Smith did not forward it to the Indian Commissioner, he simply forwarded the application of his own daughter, which was the only one which reached the Commissioner, and by this dishonest conduct he secured the position of teacher for his daughter. I doubt not that Miss Smith may be a competent teacher in the general acceptation of the term, but she has openly set the School Act, of this province at defiance, by persistently teaching her own ideas of religion in the school, singing hymns and giving other religious lessons and instructions according to the ritual of the Presbyterian Church, and this she does in the face that every pupil under her care is Catholic, and against the wishes of the parents, who have continuously protested against such high-handed imposition, and the result is that many of the pupils did not attend school last year, and are being cheated out of their education in consequence of the bigotry of the teacher and the Indian Agent.\n\nTo the Honourable Clifford Sifton, Esq., M.P.,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nTruro, May 10th, 1901\n\n(sgd) M.K., Knepp, P.P.\nOTTAWA, 18th May, 1901.\n\nRev.

D. McLEAN\n\nThos. B. Smith, Esq. -\nIndian Agent,\nTruro,\nN.S.\nTo the Honourable Clifford Sefton Esquire\nM.P. Minister of the Interior.\n\nOttawa. Sir,\n\nThe Honorable\n\nPetition of the undersigned.\n\nShoweth,\n\nThat the Education of the Indians on the Reservation, which is situated about three miles from this place, has not been conducted according to the School Laws of Nova Scotia, nor in keeping with the welfare of the pupils. There are some twenty families on the Reservation. The Agent Mr. Thomas Smith is a Presbyterian and does not seem to have anything in common with the Indians or their children, and instead of discharging his duty as guardian of their spiritual and temporal welfare, as the Government intends he should, he has permitted a protestant woman to go openly to their houses on Sundays during last summer for the purpose of proselytizing and robbing them of their faith. He seldom deals out even handed justice and often favors those who are the least deserving while he pays but little attention to the more deserving ones because they cannot favor his ideas. These Indians are Micmacs Catholics who are anxious to bring up their children in the faith of their fathers, but with a bigoted agent, and a protestant teacher they over which neither the parents nor their clergy have any influence, they find it very difficult to do so.\n\nYour petitioners would further respectfully show that a Catholic young man holding a high Grade Licence Normal School Diploma sent in an application for the position of teacher last year, but Mr. Smith did not forward it to the Indian Commissioner\u2014he withheld it\u2014and only sent his own daughter, which was the only one that reached the Commissioner, and by such\nActing he managed to secure the position for her.\n\nI doubt not that Miss Smith may be a competent teacher in the general acceptation of the term, though not acceptable to the Indians, as she kept up a system of religious training by singing hymns and giving other lessons and instruction keeping with the ritual of the Presbyterian Church, and thus she has done in a school where every pupil is Catholic, and against the well understood wishes of the parents who have continuously protested against such imposition, and the result is that many of pupils did not attend school during the past year, and are being cheated out of an education as a consequence of the bigotry of the teacher.\n\nYour petitioner would further respectfully show, that in many cases the priests have been appointed agents, and such appointments generally give satisfaction.\n\nIt is the priest who gives his time and money to promote the spiritual and temporal welfare of the Indians, and while the Agent and the Doctor are paid for their work, the priest gets nothing for his services, though his frequent visits are often attended with hardship in stormy weather and always with cost, paying for living teams and other incidental expenses.\n\nI have endeavored to lay this case before without prejudice to the agent, or the teacher, and have stated the facts of the case without any coloring.\n\nIn conclusion I would most respectfully suggest that, in the interests of justice, you should dismiss the present agent Miss Smith, because he has proved himself incompetent to occupy the position any longer \u2014 and while I do not covet the position myself for any pecuniary interest, I may feel in the matter, but in the interests of the Indians and their families, if you should think proper to give me the appointment of Indian agent for the Times Reservation, I will undertake to discharge to the best of my ability the duties\nThat may devolve upon me.\n\nMeanwhile I have the honor to remain\n\nSir most respectfully\n\nYours\n\nM. K. Kinnele\n\nP.S.\n\nRe: matters of School and Teacher\nin Indian Reservation Time W.S.\n\nSir,\n\nThe above statement is a copy of a petition which I had mailed to your address, Ottawa, in April last, which will explain itself. Since then I have patiently and anxiously waited your advice on this subject. But not having any reply and fearing the document may not have reached you, and as the time is nearing for appointing teachers in this province for next school year, I decided to send you this copy of the matters above mentioned, and also to enquire what action, if any has been taken, with reference to the matter set forth for your consideration in my memorial of April, as to the appointment of a new agent, and a competent Catholic teacher, for the ensuing term. \u2014 You will readily perceive that this is a very grave matter, and I sincerely hope you will give it due consideration, and not allow the new school year to pass without appointing a Catholic teacher to the position in the Reserve.\n\nI herewith enclose copies of two applications of teachers, which have already been sent to Mr. Smithy, and as he has withheld a teacher application on a former occasion, he may do so again, and for this reason, and in justice to those Catholic teachers who are now applying, I am sending the enclosed copies, so you may appoint one of them instead of Miss Smithy, whom I presume will also be a candidate for the position.\n\nI remain sincerely yours \u2014 M.

Mr. Smith did not forward it to the Indian Commissioner,\nhe simply withheld it, and sent in his own daughter's application,\nwhich was the only one that reached the Commissioner, and by such\naction, he secured the position for her.\n\nI doubt not that Miss Smith may be a competent\nteacher in the general acceptation of the term though not acceptable\nto the Indians, as she has kept up religious training, singing hymns,\nand giving other lessons, and instructions, according to, and in keeping with the ritual of the presbyterian church, and thus she has done in a school where every pupil under her care are Catholics, and against the will and wishes of their parents, who have continuously protected against such imposition, and the result is that many of the pupils did not attend School during the past year, and are being cheated out of their education, in consequence of the teacher's conduct.\n\nIn many places the priests have been appointed Indian agents, and such appointments generally give satisfaction. It is the priest who gives his time and money to promote the spiritual and temporal welfare of the Indians, and while the agent and the doctor are paid for their work, the priest gets nothing for his services, which in my opinion, always costs high for many expenses.\n\nI have endeavored to lay this case before you without prejudice to the Agent or the teacher, and I have given you the facts, the truth without any coloring.\n\nIn conclusion I would most respectfully suggest that in the interest of justice, you will discharge the Agent Mr. Smith who has proved himself incompetent to occupy this position.\n\nAnd while I do not covet the position myself from any personal point of view, but in the interests of the Indians and their families, if you think proper to give me the appointment of Indian Agent for Tims Reservation I will undertake to discharge to the best of my abilities the duties that may devolve upon me.\n\nMeanwhile I have the honor to remain\n\nSir most respectfully\n\nYours\n\nW.

As I have not received any notice from him, nor from yourself, I send my former letter back unaddressed to the Department, and this is why I am troubling you at present. I am mailing the Minister a copy of that memorial of April, but fearing that he has not yet returned to the Capital, I have taken the liberty of addressing myself to you in the meantime, believing that you will be favorably disposed to help me in this business.\n\nI had a letter from our mutual friend J. A. M. Cole of Normal School offices last July informing me that he had brought my case to your notice. And stated that you had advised him to say that I had better lay my case before the Minister of the Interior. Will you be good enough to inform me whether or not the minister has received my communication of April, and why he did not favor me with his answer?\n\nI am a supporter of the Laurier Government, and feel that I have been badly treated by the minister of the Interior in a matter of such grave importance.\n\nLooking forward to hear from you.\n\nI remain faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

S. to which is attached a copy of a communication previously addressed by him to you and of papers placed therewith.\n\nThe explanation of his addressing me is that he first wrote to his friend Dr MacGabe. The Doctor spoke to me and I told him that the proper course for Father Kinsella was to address himself to you and that if there was any cause of complaint as to the non-fulfillment of the provision of the Indian Act requiring that the teacher of an Indian school should be of the religious opinion of the majority of the Band, you would be quite ready to remove it. Dr MacGabe wrote Father Kinsella accordingly and he, it appears, addressed you in the matter; but doubtless the communication was never brought to your attention.\n\nHon.

He will probably be able to throw some light upon it.\nOttawa, 14th September, 1901.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter, without date, which has been transmitted to the Department by Mr. McKenna, having reference to a petition which was sent by yourself to Mr. Sifton in the month of April last, and to which you state you have never received any reply.\n\nI may say in answer that Mr. Sifton has no recollection whatever of ever having received any communication from you with regard to this matter, and if it came here it was probably during his absence and was overlooked or mislaid, as it evidently did not reach him.\n\nRegarding your charges respecting the conduct of his office by Mr. Thomas Smith, the Indian Agent, I beg to say that the Department will at once arrange for an investigation into the facts by Mr. McLean, the Secretary of the Department, who is to visit the Eastern Provinces within a few days. Mr. McLean will be asked to call upon you before taking any action with regard to the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Revd. M. K. Kinneally,\nTruro, N.S.\nSydney, C. B. September 24th, 1901.\n\nJames A. Smart, Esq.,\nDept. Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Smart,\n\nI have investigated the complaints made by the Rev. M. K. Kinsella of Truro, against our agent Mr. T. B. Smith who has charge of the Indians of Colchester Co.\n\nThe complaints briefly stated are as follows:\n\n1. That he permitted a woman to go openly to the houses on Sundays at intervals during the past summer for the purpose of proselytizing and robbing them of their faith.\n\n2. That he seldom deals out even handed justice and often favors those who are the least deserving, while he pays but little attention to the more deserving because they cannot conscientiously favor his ideas.\n\n3. That at the close of the school year in July 1900, a Catholic young man holding a high grade license, and a Normal School diploma, sent in an application for the position of teacher to the Indians, but that Mr. Smith with held it and sent his own daughter's application which was the only one that reached the Department.\n\n4. Father Kinsella asks that as the agent has proved himself incompetent to occupy the position he be discharged and the same given to Father Kinsella.\nIn answer to the first complaint the agent explains that a Mrs. Gunn a Baptist lady of Belmont, about two stations from Truro, came to the Reserve last September and desired to speak with the Indians in the school house regarding their spiritual welfare. The agent refused as the building was Government property, and he did not wish to have anything like that conducted in the school. On Mrs. Gunn's own motion she visited one or two of the Indian families. The agent advised them not to interfere with her, as some of them threatened to do her bodily harm. Mr. Smith told them that if they did not wish to listen to her they should go away. The consequence was that the following Sunday she could find no Indians and accordingly she left the Reserve.\n\nAs to complaint No. 2. I may say that I found the agent popular with the Indians. He is a substantial farmer and dairyman. The mere pittance of Fifty Dollars which he receives as salary from the Department is nothing to him. He apparently gives a great deal more than his salary back in the way of help to the Indians as they are constantly coming to him for relief. Mr. Smith was appointed by order of His Excellency in Council on the 21st of May, 1897 and he receives the full indorsement of the friends of the Government in Truro.\n\nAs to complain No. 3. Mr. Smith explains that the application of Mr. Hanway referred to by Father Kinsella, which is attached herewith, was received by him after the application of his daughter for the position had been sent to the Department.\nand accepted. He advised the applicant therefore that the position had already been filled.\n\nAs regards No. 4. I explained to Father Kinsella that I thought the Department would meet his views as to a Catholic teacher, provided, that his nominee received the indorsement of the President of the Liberal Association in Truro; as properly the patronage of such appointments belongs to the Government. I told him however, that as Mr. Smith, the agent, was a recent appointment and had the indorsement of friends of the Government in Truro I did not think it was likely that he would be disturbed in his position. Father Kinsella however, urged that as the Indians were all Roman Catholics it was only fair that the agent should be of the same faith; that he had to visit the Reserve and look after the spiritual welfare of the Indians at his own charges, while the Doctor and the agent were salaried officials of the Government and their expenses paid.\n\nAs regards the Father's complaint against the teacher Miss Smith, teaching religion in the school, singing hymns etc., in keeping with the ritual of the Presbyterian Church, I may say that I visited mostly all the Indians on the Reserve and questioned them as to whether or not Miss Smith taught religion in the school. They all said \"No\", and appeared to be satisfied with the way she brought their children along. The number of children on the roll during the present year was 31 with an average attendance of fifteen. Miss Smith holds a \"B\" certificate from the Truro Academy and a \"C\" license from the Provincial\nGovernment which equals a second-class certificate. She taught the school for two years and nine months, her salary having been at the rate of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00) per year.\n\nAs to the hymns stated to have been sung in the school, Miss Smith explains that one of the Indian children brought a Moody & Sankey Hymn book and she sang out of that book hymns Nos. 17, 33, and 99. She claims that no religion of any particular faith was taught by her; that she simply complied with the course of studies prescribed by the Department and only read the Lord's Prayer with the pupils every morning.\n\nFather Kinsella visited the school about a year ago and asked her if she had a Bible in the School and if she taught religion. She told him that she only read the Lord's Prayer, and after his visit changed the form of it to suit the Roman Catholics, which was by changing the word \"which\" to \"who\" in the first part, and leaving out \"for thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the glory forever\" in the latter part.\n\nI thought it necessary to make this report to you at once so that a teacher could be appointed in Miss Smith's place as soon as possible. I have asked the President of the Liberal Association to submit the name of a Catholic teacher to you and I have no doubt that this will be done in due course.\n\nThere is one thing that Father Kinsella suggested to me, and that is, that he thought it would be advisable if the Band had a duly elected Chief, there being no recognized chief at present. If you approve will you kindly give instructions\nso that the agent may be advised to hold an election at an early date. I think myself it would be better if the Band had a recognized Chief.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell Remitt.\nOttawa, 3rd October, 1901\n\nMemorandum: Mr. McLean,\n\nI have read over your report with regard to the charges made by the Reverend T. C. Kinsella, of Truro, against Mr. Agent Smith, and from what you say there appears to be nothing in them at all as the agent seems to have been doing his duty quite satisfactorily.\n\nI do not know any reason for the change in the school teacher, unless it is that the children are Roman Catholics, but I did not understand that it was a religious school at all. However, if there is any point at all in this connection I presume it might be just as well to appoint a Roman Catholic teacher. I do not think, however, that it would be wise to appoint a Chief. It seems to me that that would be a retrograde action. What real advantage a recognized Chief is to a Band of Indians is more than I can understand in this age of civilization. It seems to me that the appointment of a Chief has the effect of making the Indians less self-reliant.\n\nDeputy Supt.

The books she is using now I got the loan of in case she should cease coming. I have been encouraging her to continue, if she does I feel she will be quite successful.

They are appointed by this Department and the salary they receive is also decided and paid by the Department.\n\nYou are at present receiving a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum, a combined salary and bonus of $650.00. It is considered that, with the qualifications you possess, this salary will compare favourably with that received by teachers having your qualifications in the rural schools in the province of Nova Scotia.\n\nI may say that there is no provision made for pension or retiring allowance to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Jessie Scott,\nTeacher,\nMillbrook Indian Day School,\nAlton,\nCol. Co., N.S.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo the Acting Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRegarding the request made by Miss Jessie M. Scott, teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, to the Honourable the Minister of Public Works to ascertain whether she would be entitled to a pension after twenty years continuous service as teacher in the above school, I beg to say that there is no provision for the granting of superannuations or pensions to teachers of Indian schools. A gratuity on retirement has, however, been granted in the cases of several teachers in the past. In two of these cases the teachers have taught for thirty years and they were allowed a gratuity equal to one-half of their yearly salary as at the date of their retirement. In several other cases where the teachers had not been in our service for so long the period being less than twenty years, a gratuity on retirement equal to one-quarter of the yearly salary was allowed.\n\nMiss Scott has been employed continuously at this school and has given satisfaction to the agent and public school inspector. The salary now paid her is at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nI would suggest that, if approved by you, that she be granted a gratuity equal to one-half her yearly salary, viz., the sum of $250.00. This could be paid from the appropriation for Indian Education, the same as was done in all the above named cases.\n\nThe letter left with you by the Minister's private Secretary, is attached herewith.\nMr. J. D. Miller\nActing Deputy Superintendent General:\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to tender my resignation as teacher of the Willbrook School to take effect Dec. 21, 1921.\n\nThis resignation will be accepted.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJennie M. Scott.\nOttawa, December 1, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the resignation of Miss Jessie M. Scott, Teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School. The Department will require the services of a teacher to take her place on the first of January, 1922.\n\nWill you be good enough to immediately take steps to secure a properly qualified successor to Miss Scott. The Department will allow a salary of $500.00 per annum, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law, to a teacher with good qualifications. You will please recommend, for our approval, a teacher as soon as this matter can be arranged and keep a careful oversight over the activities of the school during the period of transition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, Col. Co., N. S.\nOttawa, December 1, 1921.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 26th ultimo, referring to your resignation as Teacher of the Millbrook school.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department regretfully accepts your resignation and will take steps to secure a properly qualified successor.\n\nIt is meet that I refer in this letter to your successful long service, and I am voicing the sentiment of the Department of Indian Affairs when I offer thanks to you for your faithful work at the Millbrook Indian Day School. It is a matter of regret that provision has not been made for a pension or gratuity to teachers of Indian day schools. The necessity for such a superannuation scheme is very seldom brought to our attention, in view of the fact that less than one per cent of the teachers of our Indian day schools remain in our employ more than a few years.\n\nIn your case the Department is extremely sorry that no fitting financial remuneration for faithful and long service can be offered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, December 2, 1921.\n\nMemoandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nI wish to draw your attention to a matter arising out of the resignation of Miss Jessie K. Scott, Teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School in Nova Scotia. This teacher has given over twenty years' successful service at this point and is resigning because of ill health.\n\nA year ago Miss Scott wrote to the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission in connection with pension, and this communication was forwarded to this Department by Mr. Foran. She was informed by official letter of November 16, 1920, that there was no provision made for pension or retiring allowance to teachers in Indian schools.\n\nLast August Miss Scott petitioned the Minister of Public Works, to ascertain whether she would be entitled to a pension after twenty years' continual service as Teacher in an Indian day school. Mr. Sutherland, of the School Branch, prepared a memorandum to the Acting Deputy at this time and recommended a gratuity equal to one-half year's salary, or the sum of $250. This recommendation was turned down by the acting Deputy and Miss Scott was informed that she did not come under the Civil Service regulations and that no annuity or gratuity could be granted.\n\nI have taken the trouble, Sir, to look carefully into this matter of gratuity to retiring Indian day school teachers. I have learned that the Department has granted to four teachers, who have taught for periods of 17, 8, 13 and 8 years respectively, gratuities equal to one-quarter of their annual stipend, or more.\n\nI would recommend, in view of the faithful services given by Miss Scott, and in view of the fact that her health is not good, that the Department allow her a gratuity on her retirement at the end of this calendar year equal to one-half of her yearly salary ($250). This could be paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education, as was done in all the above-mentioned cases.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Xavier\nOttawa, December 2, 1921.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to refer again to yours of the 26th ultimo. Since my communication, of this file number, dated yesterday, the first instant, I have made careful inquiries, in an effort to ascertain if some recognition of your faithful and long service could be made. I am pleased to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has seen fit to authorize a gratuity payment equal to one-half your yearly salary, Viz: Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00).\n\nAs I intimated to you in previous correspondence, no provision is made for the pensioning of teachers of Indian day schools, but the Department has in one or two instances in the past given one gratuity payment to teachers who have spent the major portion of their lives in our work.\n\nUnder separate cover, you will receive a cheque for $250.00 as a departmental recognition for faithful work.\n\nYou should prepare, at the end of the present quarter, your usual quarterly return, showing attendance, days taught, etc., and forward it through your local Indian agent, and when received by the Department, a cheque for the amount of the salary and bonus due you up to the period of your retirement will be sent. I have also to request that you will be good enough to see that all school material is placed under the charge of your local Indian agent, until such time as a new teacher takes up duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Jessie M. Scott,\nTeacher,\nMillbrook Indian Day School,\nAlton, Col. Co., N.S.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, December 2, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of the Department of Indian Affairs has seen fit to authorize a payment of $250.00 to Miss Jessie M. Scott, Teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, as a gratuity upon retirement after twenty faithful years of successful service.\n\nNo provision has been made for the superannuation of teachers of our Indian day schools, but in one or two cases the Department has made a single payment upon retirement to those employees who have spent many years teaching in our Indian day schools. Miss Scott has been informed direct concerning this action.\n\nI trust that you will be successful in securing the services of a properly qualified successor in the immediate future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N. S.\n\nRussell T. Ferrie\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, December 2, 1921.\n\nDear Miss Scott:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that you have seen fit to tender your resignation as Teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School.\n\nIt is unfortunate that no provision has been made for the superannuation of teachers of our Indian day schools, but the Department of Indian Affairs is pleased to make an exception in your case and offer you a payment of $250.00 as a gratuity upon retirement. I am taking this opportunity of thanking you personally for the splendid service given to this Department and to our Indian children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott, who has been continuously in charge of the Millbrook School since October 1896, a period of twenty years, has resigned, account of ill-health.\n\nIn view of her long and faithful service she is being granted a retiring allowance equal to one-half of her yearly salary.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General has approved of this grant being paid Miss Scott.\n\nCertified correct,\n\n[Signature]\n\n2, 12, 21.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature] Agent\nI understand that Miss Jessie Scott, teacher of the Indian Day School at Millbrook, Colchester County, N.S., intends to vacate her position at the end of the present quarter, in which case, it would be more in the interest of Indian Education to appoint, as her successor, the person Mr. Campbell, Provincial Inspector of Schools has in view. I am writing Miss Scott to ascertain whether she has decided to resign her position or not.\nAlton, Col. C., N.S.,\nDec 7, 1921\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Chief, General,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to express to you my sincere thanks for your words of appreciation of my work at the Millbrook School, also for granting me the gratuity of $50.00. It was indeed a very pleasant surprise. Again thanking you.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJames M. Scott\nMr. Russell J. Turner,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your valued favor of the 2nd inst., and am indeed very grateful for your words of appreciation of my work in the Millbrook School, also for your kindness in obtaining from the Government the gratuity of $250. It came as a very pleasant surprise and I take this opportunity to extend to you my sincere thanks.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJessie M. Scott.\nHalifax Rd., Truro,\nDec. 8, 1921.\n\nR. H. Kennedy,\nHilden, N.S.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs a teacher is required for the Indian Reserve at Hilden, I would like to apply for the position.\n\nI hold a First Rank Normal Diploma and have two years experience in teaching.\n\nIf this application...\nShould be sent to Mr. Board of Control, instead of your please let me know Mr. Smith, M.J., will, I think, speak as to my character, etc.\n\nIf you could let me know at your earliest convenience I would be greatly obliged.\n\nYour's Truly,\n\nE. Smith.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing an application for the position of teacher in Midwood Bay School. Mrs. Smith lives near the Reserve and has a husband and family living with her. I think she will make an efficient teacher and recommend that she be given the position.\n\nI would like you to give me full instructions as to the conduct of this school viz hours to be kept each day, church holidays in addition to holidays observed by the common schools of the province, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, December 23rd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing an application from Mrs. E. Smith for the position as teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the Christmas Holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted Mrs. Smith possesses the necessary qualifications, but that she is a married woman with a husband and family living with her. The Department considers that the duties of her home would seriously interfere with her work as teacher, and that she might not be able to give the time and attention required. However, it may be that Mrs. Smith can arrange to devote the full time and attention which is required, and I should be pleased to hear from you as to whether you consider she would be able to carry on the work successfully, teaching the full number of hours required each school day and attending to any other duties connected with the work. As soon as the Department has your assurance that her home duties would not interfere with her work as teacher we will be pleased to accept her services, it being understood that her retention in the position would depend upon the services which she performs. An early reply giving the full information is desired.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of the Indian Day School Regulations which contains the information regarding the hours the school should be open each day, the holidays, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

S.,\nDecember 21st., 1921.\n\nSir,-\n\nI regret to be informed by letter just to hand from Miss Jessie Scott of Alton, N. S., with her school return which I enclose herewith, that she had tendered her resignation to the Department as teacher of the Indian Day School at Millbrook Reserve. It may be difficult to secure the services of a successor, who will fill the position with as much satisfaction to all parties interested as she did. She was certainly a faithful servant; and the progress of her pupils from time to time was evident on the occasion of every visit I made to her school.\n\nI am much pleased to receive her assurance that she was always treated with courtesy and consideration by every official of the Department with whom she had any business relations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, December 25th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, informing the Department that Miss Jessie Scott, teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, has tendered her resignation.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Scott, in a letter to the Department dated November 26th, last, tendered her resignation, which was accepted. In view of her long and faithful service, covering a period of 20 years, the Department granted her a gratuity upon retirement equal to one-half of her yearly salary, or a total amount of $250.00, for which a cheque has been sent her.\n\nRegarding the obtaining of a successor, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Kennedy, Hilden, N.S., has forwarded an application from Mrs. E. Smith, to be in duties when the schools re-open after the present Christmas holidays. Mrs. Smith is a married woman with a husband and family living with her. She holds a first rank Normal diploma, and has had two years' experience. The Agent has been informed that, if Mrs. Smith can arrange to devote the full time and attention that is required for the work, the Department will accept her services. We are awaiting an assurance to this effect before approving of the appointment of Mrs. Smith.\n\nYou will be informed of the action taken regarding this appointment at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nRiver Bourgeois, N.S.\nOffice of the Indian Superintendent,\n\nRiver Bourgeois, N. S.,\nDecember 24th., 1921.\n\nSir,-\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of your letter of the 17th. instant, I beg to recommend and to urge the appointment of Mrs. Elizabeth Smith of Truro, N. S., as teacher of the Indian Day School at Millbrook Reserve, Colchester County. She is an experienced and most successful teacher, and would be a worthy successor to Miss Jessie Scott, the late incumbent of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nRussell T Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nOn receipt of yours of the 23rd\n\nI called Mrs. Smith by phone and informed her of the hours she would be required to teach. She objected to the 3-hour session in the afternoon on the reason that the local schools get out earlier than that. I consulted Mr. Campbell, the Local School Inspector about that and he is of the opinion that from 1 to 3:30 with a 10 minute recess would be about in line with local schools where there are no advanced grades. I also notice that the winter term is to begin on Jan 3rd each year. This year the local schools closed Dec 25th and will reopen Jan 9th. I did not think to mention this to Mrs. Smith and anyway I do not think we will be ready to open before the 9th this year.\n\nRegarding the duties of Mrs. Smith's home, she is arranging for a woman to come in and look after the home while she is absent and I do not think there should be any trouble on that score unless there should be serious illness in the home. There is no other teacher in sight and as I am anxious to see this school open I would say to give this woman a trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, January 3, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 24th ultimo, in which you recommend and urge the appointment of Mrs. E. Smith, of Truro, N.S., to the position of Teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School. I have noted your remarks that she has been a most successful teacher and would prove a worthy successor to Miss Jessie Scott.\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Agent Kennedy has addressed to the Department a further communication, and in light of the information that he now gives us, we take pleasure in appointing Mrs. Smith to the Millbrook school. She is prepared to teach at this school and devote all the time that is considered necessary. I hope that this school will re-open about the 9th of January.\n\nMight I suggest that when you next visit the vicinity of the Millbrook Indian Day School you will make a thorough inspection into the management and conduct of this school. I have asked Mr. Agent Kennedy to give special attention to school matters at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent\nRiver Bourgeois, N. S.\nOttawa, January 3, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 28th ultimo, referring to the appointment of Mrs. E. Smith, of Truro, N.S., to the position of Teacher at the Millbrook Indian Day School.\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Boyd, Indian Superintendent for Nova Scotia, has urged upon the Department the advisability of appointing Mrs. Smith, whom he knows to be a successful teacher.\n\nI have noted your remarks concerning Mrs. Smith's willingness to devote the proper amount of time and attention to school matters, if she receives the appointment.\n\nI now have to inform you that the Department approves of the appointment of Mrs. Smith to the position of Teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School. As soon as possible, you will please requisition to the Department for the school supplies necessary for the carrying on of the classroom work. Kindly inform Mrs. Smith of her appointment and make an effort to have the school opened on the 9th of this month, or as soon after as is convenient. You may inform the band that the Department will continue to operate the school as long as they show an interest in the education of their children and as long as the attendance keeps up satisfactorily. Your personal and careful attention to school matters at this time, as the teachers are changing, will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N. S.\n\nP.S. The salary allowed is at the rate of $500 per annum.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your #47-1-1 of the 3rd inst.\n\nI beg to inform you that the Willbrook Day School was reopened on the 9th inst. with Mrs. E. Smith as teacher with an enrolment so far of 24.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for some supplies as requested by you. I did not have a form with me when I visited the School and for that reason the teacher's signature is lacking.\n\nIn my letter of the 28th ultimo I made reference to the hours of darkness after consultation with Mr. W.R. Campbell, the Local School Inspector. I would be obliged if you would give me your opinion on this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 17, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 13th instant, concerning the opening of the Millbrook Indian Day School under the care of Mrs. E. Smith, as Teacher.\n\nConcerning the hours of teaching, I wish to reply that the Department will permit Mrs. Smith to teach from 1 p.m. to 2.30 p.m., but would suggest, instead of a 10 minute recess, one of 20 minutes' duration. The Department is convinced that a 20 minute recess is not too long if the play or other activities of the children are supervised.\n\nYour requisition for school supplies will be dealt with in another communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. T. Ferrier,\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N.S.\nSir,\n\nMrs. E.

Smith, teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, has tendered her resignation to take effect at the end of the present term.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mrs. Smith's resignation is accepted. She should prepare her quarterly return at the end of the present quarter showing the attendance, days taught, etc., and hand the same to you for transmission to the Department, in order that any salary and bonus due can be paid.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of another teacher to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next, and I have to request that you will endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of any applicant received should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. I may say in this connection that we have a request from Mrs. G. Turple, Noel, Hants Co., N.S., for a position as teacher in one of our Indian schools in Nova Scotia. It might be well for you to communicate with her, and ascertain whether she would accept the position as teacher at the Millbrook school or not, from the 1st of September, next; the salary allowed being the same as was paid Mrs. Smith.\n\nIn any event, you will be good enough to endeavour to nominate a teacher for this school in time to have the appointment made before the school re-opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N.S.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

She has a \"D\" license and a \"C\" certificate, 3\u00bd years experience and a Roman Catholic in religion. I have written Inspector Lyte and he advises hiring her if the local School Inspector would recommend her. This he has done.\n\nRequesting to have your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.J. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, July 28th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, nominating Miss Alma Sheridan for the position of teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications which she possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as Miss Sheridan is recommended by both the Public School Inspector for the district and Mr. Inspector Boyd, the Department will approve of her appointment, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $500 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss Sheridan that her appointment has been approved, and ascertain from her definitely as to whether or not she will be prepared to take up duties on the above date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nfor Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N.S.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that the Millbrook Day School was opened on Monday the 18th inst. Miss Alma Sheridan as teacher. The delay in opening was due to Miss Sheridan getting disappointed in securing a boarding house. She is now with Mr. MacKenzie adjoining her present residence and it is the best possible location.\n\nI am enclosing requisition for school material and trust you will forward same promptly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Kennedy,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nThe Indians on Millbrook Reserve are complaining that their children are not learning under Miss Sheridan. The local Inspector Mr. Campbell thinks she is rather easy going and I agree with him. I am writing Mr. Board to see what he thinks about keeping her for another year. Her intention as far as I know is to continue teaching here.\n\nIf it is thought advisable to make a change I presume a notice from me that her services were no longer required would be sufficient. If not kindly advise how to proceed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR. H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, July 10th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the continuing of the services of Miss Alma Sheridan as teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School for the next school year. We note that you have written Mr. Inspector Boyd regarding this matter. If Mr. Boyd and yourself consider that Miss Sheridan's services are not satisfactory, you may inform her that she will not be required for next year, and, in that event, you should endeavour to secure the services of another teacher to take charge when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nIf any change in teacher is made, you should inform the Department promptly as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you. If it is decided to continue Miss Sheridan's services, you should inform the Department to that effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H.

There is a School Nurse on the Department of Education for the Town. There is also a County Nurse who holds Clinics for school children in the town and examines periodically all the County children. With all this service available the Indian children did not receive any benefits of Could not some arrangement be made to include this one school under either of these nurses.\n\nWe have permission in the Province for Junior Red Cross Branches to be started as school clubs, using school hours for their meetings.

Those numbered 7-13 and 14 come from homes where some provisions are regularly given and they get an occasional small grant for clothing. I do not expect that either 13 or 14 will go to school much more as they are old enough to go to work. 13 has already been working some. The attendance generally is not what it should be and you might advise me as to how far a Truant Officer can go in compelling attendance.\n\nMr. Smith plans to teach again next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 6, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, enclosing the June quarter return of the Millbrook Indian Day School. The teacher's remarks regarding attendance have been noted. I would point out that, where relief is granted to Indian parents, it is expected they will see that their children of school age and in good health attend school regularly. Relief is supplied in many cases on that understanding; and, where the parties thus assisted fail to send their children to school, the question of discontinuing the relief supplies should receive your consideration and a report regarding each case furnished the Department. We understand that Mr. W. T. Gloade is truant officer for this reserve. He should obtain from the teacher, at least once each week, a list of the absentee pupils. He should then visit their homes and, if possible, conduct the children to school. For your information regarding the enforcing of attendance, I would refer you to Section 10 of the Indian Act, with special reference to Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 10.\n\nWe note that Mrs. Elisabeth Smith will continue as teacher for the next school year. The Department will be pleased to approve of her re-appointment. She should arrange to resume duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on or about September first, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLean\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

In this connection I beg to say that we are referring your request to Mr. Indian Agent Kennedy, as it is necessary to have his recommendation before consideration can be given.\n\nIn future, I should be pleased if you would forward all communications regarding matters connected with the school under your charge through the office of your local Indian agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Smith,\nHalifax Road,\nTruro, N. S.\nOttawa, April 4, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, in which she applies for an increase in her salary. At the present time, she is in receipt of salary at the rate of $65 per teaching month. She has been engaged at this school since September first, 1925, and states she has a \"B\" License for the Province of Nova Scotia. The Public School Inspector who visited this school in November last, states that the pupils did not seem to take any very great interest in any subject, that the work seemed to be all in the manner of a task. Mrs. Smith has also requested that she be re-engaged for the next school year.\n\nI should be pleased to have a report from you at your earliest convenience, stating whether you would recommend any increase in Mrs. Smith's present salary and also whether you would approve of her re-engagement for the next academic year.\n\nYou will be written later, regarding certain repairs, which the teacher states are required to the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N. S.\nI would recommend that Miss Smith be re-engaged for the ensuing year as teacher at Millbrook School. Regarding an increase of salary, it would seem that she is now getting more than she would get in a similar school under provincial management, but with her grade of license she could get a graded school and so much or more than she is getting now. It is a well known fact that school teachers in Nova Scotia are very poorly paid and an effort is now being made to remedy this condition and the Dept would be setting a good example if they increased the salaries of their Indian School Teachers where length of service and efficiency warranted. I feel that the Dept is spending a lot of money on Indian education and not getting very satisfactory results therefrom. In the first place the attendance is not what it should be, this is not the fault of the present officer but rather...\nof the parents, they do not think it is necessary that their children do more than learn to read and write, and they make excuses that they cannot provide the smaller ones with foot wear or other clothing fit to attend school in and as they get older they are kept home to assist in work.\n\nIt does seem that when the Dept bears the whole expense of running a school that the Indians should cooperate so far as to see that every child of school age is kept going regularly.\n\nIt might be that if regular school attendance was to count in their favour when aid is sought from the Dept that it would have some effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Kennedy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the request made by Mrs. E. Smith, teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, for an increase in salary and for re-engagement for the next academic year.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased to approve of the re-engagement of Mrs. Smith for the academic year 1928-29, but regrets that it will be unable to make any increase in the salary at present allowed her. It is thought that the salary now paid compares favourably with that paid to teachers having similar qualifications in the neighbouring rural white schools. In granting increases we take into consideration the ability of the teachers to interest the pupils in their work in order that they will attend regularly. If the teacher, assisted by the truant officer and yourself, makes an effort to have all Indian children of school age, who are in good health, attend regularly, the Department may consider at a later date the granting of a small increase in her salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Kennedy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHilden, N.S.\nSir,\n\nYour school regulations as we have them call for closing for the Christmas Holiday on Dec 22 to reopen on Jan 3rd.

The length of the term in the Provincial Schools has lately been reduced, it now comprises 200 teaching days with a full two weeks winter vacation.\n\nI have instructed the teachers to close the Millbrook School on Friday the 20th inst. and would suggest that we have the full two weeks vacation in line with the Provincial schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nR.H.

Smith who has been the Teacher in the Indian Day School at Truro during the past few years has asked for one year's leave of absence on account of family duties at home.\n\nAgent Kennedy has had an application from Mrs. A. King, who taught at the Shubenacadie Day School until it was closed last winter, for the position of Teacher at the Truro School. He has enquired as to Mrs. King's record as a Teacher, as far as I know she was satisfactory while at Shubenacadie. It is possible that you can give us some information on this matter as you have a record of her work during the past several years. I shall be pleased to hear from you.\n\nIs it in order for Agent Kennedy and myself to grant Mrs. Smith her request also to engage her successor?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 29, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, informing the Department that Mrs. E. Smith, teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School, has applied for one year's leave of absence, on account of family duties. It is noted that Mr. Agent Kennedy has had an application from Mrs. A. King, who formerly taught at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School, to carry on teaching duties during Mrs. Smith's absence.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is not favourably disposed to this arrangement and would prefer the resignation of Mrs. Smith if it is necessary for her to give up teaching duties. In this event, it is thought that the services of a teacher having higher qualifications than Mrs. King possesses could be obtained. I would request, therefore, that the local Indian agent and yourself give this matter further consideration and endeavour to nominate the services of a fully qualified teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Marner, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWindsor, N. S.\nWindsor, N.S. August 9th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter No. 47-1-1 dated July 29th, 1930, in reference to application from Mrs. E. Smith, teacher at the Indian Day School at Truro, for one year's leave of absence.\n\nIn reply to this letter I would advise that I visited Agent Kennedy on 5th inst. and talked this matter over with him. Mr. Kennedy had made enquiries in regard to the qualifications of Mrs. King and he is satisfied that she is capable of teaching at the Truro School. In this regard I would report that Mr. W.C. Stapleton, Public School Inspector living at Dartmouth, reports quite favorably on Mrs. King.\n\nAs Mrs. Smith has always been very satisfactory neither Mr. Kennedy nor myself can see why she should not be granted her request, and that Mrs. King be employed as the teacher for the coming term.\n\nI beg to submit this for your consideration, should it not meet with your approval, I shall be pleased to endeavor to carry out whatever instructions you may issue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Maciver\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 14, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the appointment of Mrs. A. King as teacher of the Millbrook Indian Day School to replace Mrs. E. Smith, who has applied for one year's leave of absence.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will approve of the appointment of Mrs. King for the coming school year. She will be allowed salary at the same rate as was paid Mrs. Smith, viz., $65 per teaching month. Please inform Mrs. King accordingly, and arrange with her to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, on September 2nd, next.\n\nThe Department will give consideration to the re-engagement of Mrs. E. Smith for the school year 1931-32.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

Fox, the Indian Agent at Truro, in which he reports that the present teacher, Mrs. E. Smith, is a married woman, with quite comfortable circumstances. Her husband is in good health, working every day at a high salary, as foreman of one of the departments in Stanfield's Limited.\n\nI wish to direct attention to Section 36 (1) of the Civil Service Regulations, which provides as follows:-\n\n1. \"Hereafter, no married woman, whose husband is living, shall be eligible for appointment in the public service;\n\n2. \"Provided that, when the supply of experienced help for any particular kind of work is not sufficient to meet the demands of the public service, a married woman may be certified for temporary employment;\n\n3. \"Where it can be established by a married woman that her husband is unable, through illness - or other\nor other cause, to contribute to her support, such married woman may be certified for permanent or temporary appointment.\"\n\nAs Mrs. Smith's husband is well able to support her, I beg to recommend that she be notified that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year, viz.: the 30th instant.\n\nRegarding the application attached to your memorandum above referred to, from Mr. F. B. McKinnon, of Truro, for the position, to succeed Mrs. Smith, I would say that he has the necessary qualifications and his appointment would be satisfactory. The local Indian Agent states that Mr. McKinnon is highly recommended by the Faculty of the Normal College and some of the R. C. Clergy in Truro. The Agent states, further, that he discussed the matter of Mr. McKinnon's appointment with Dr. Thomas Robertson, Commissioner investigating Indian conditions in the Maritime Provinces.\n\nThe appointment of a new teacher does not come under the Civil Service Commission. The salary rating at this school is $66 per teaching month. The local Agent has requested, should Mr. McKinnon receive the appointment, that the rating be increased. The Department can increase the salaries of teachers, without reference to the Treasury Board or the Civil Service Commission, and I would recommend, in the event of the appointment of a new teacher, that the salary rate be $75 per teaching month - this being equal to the average salary paid to teachers in the province of Nova Scotia.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have Mr. Jackson's memorandum of the 16th instant, regarding a change in teaching services at the Millbrook Indian Day School, near Truro, N.S.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that a letter was received today from Mr. B.B.

At this time these white children have no school privileges and our Board are inquiring if it is possible to make some arrangements with your Department whereby the white children can attend this school.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBoard of School Commissioners.\n\nHorace McDougall,\nSecretary.\n\nMcD/M\nOttawa, July 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding the enquiry of your Board of School Commissioners, if it would be possible to enter into some arrangement with this Department, whereby white children, residing in the vicinity of the school, could be provided with educational facilities in the day school on the Millbrook reserve.\n\nIn reply might I say that a school is being conducted on the Millbrook reserve for the Indian children of that reserve only. The Department is not intending to extend the facilities to provide for an increased attendance. This is a small building and provides only sufficient accommodation for the Indian children on the reserve. From our information, it is doubtful if there would be accommodation for other than the Indian children. However, the matter is being referred to the local Indian Agent for a report. On receipt of same, you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHorace McDougall, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of School Commissioners,\nTruro, N. S.\nOttawa, July 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Secretary, Board of School Commissioners, Truro, N. S., in which he states that the Commissioners have been informed there is a possibility of the Department opening a school at the Reservation in Truro, where children other than Indians would be permitted to attend. The Secretary states there is, a short distance from the Indian reservation, within the limits of the town of Truro, quite a settlement of white people, who have no school privileges, and the Board enquire if it is possible to make some arrangements whereby the white children can attend the Indian school.\n\nThe Department understands that the school building on the Millbrook reserve provides classroom accommodation for only the children of the reserve. The Department is not contemplating any addition to the present school building, nor are we responsible for providing school facilities for white children.\n\nI would request that you furnish a full report regarding the request of the Secretary of the Board of School Commissioners. Please state the number of pupils which the school on the Millbrook reserve will accommodate and also the total number of school age - 7 to 16 years - on the reserve. Your early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. B. Fox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N. S.\nTruro, N. S.\nJuly 13, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to yours of July 7th, in reference to a communication you received from the Secretary, The Board of School Commissioners, Truro, I beg to say that at present on the Millbrook Reservation there are twenty-four children of school age. Our School now has accommodation for twenty-eight pupils and there is room in the present building for six more desks or twelve more pupils.\n\nIn conversation with the Chairman of the Truro School Board, I learn that there may be ten children from the section of Truro next our Reserve that would attend the Indian School. He suggested that a charge per pupil might be made by the Department of Indian Affairs to the Town. In our talk I suggested to him that should an arrangement be made where the Indian School would take care of a number of the white children that we have the privilege of sending some of the boys to manual training and some girls to Domestic Science classes in the town schools. He believed this could be satisfactorily arranged.\n\nWe mutually suggested that if an arrangement was made that the course of study would be the same as in all public schools in Nova Scotia and that therefore it would come under the inspection of the district School Inspector and result in the teacher receiving the Provincial grant which goes to all teachers in this Province.\n\nTruro is facing a problem of either coming to some agreement with the Department of Indian Affairs respecting the School or erecting a building of their own to accommodate a comparative few children that are near our Reserve. It was pointed out by the Chairman of the Board that if Truro had the privilege of sending these children to the Indian School the commissioners could then put it up to the parents that they would have to send their children to our school or else to the Willow Street School two and a half miles distant.\nPractically all the Indian families on our Reserve believe that a number of white children going to the school would have an influence that might get the Indian away from the idea that he must always be an Indian, never to rise above the status of a Government ward. Of course, there are some objectors both among the Indians and the whites, but they are of a small percentage.\n\nPersonally I feel that the Indian Children should be taught in accordance with the policy of the public schools of the Province so that should they advance sufficiently they would be able to continue their studies in the Provincial Normal or other higher educational institutions. Or if the suggested agreement succeeds to the County Academy.\n\nI do not believe there need be any financial outlay except for desks to make our school suitable to accommodate the surplus that is now a difficult problem for the Truro School Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.

Mr. Sutherland, who visited the school and reserve at the end of July, last, states that there would be accommodation for the above number of children, who reside just off the reserve, about 2\u00bd miles from the nearest white school in Truro. Mr. Sutherland discussed the matter of the admission of the white children with yourself and Mr. Doyle, of the Truro School Board. The Department would be prepared to grant the admission of the white children, on the following conditions:-\n\n1. Payment of tuition fees to the amount of $12.00 per capita per annum on the average attendance - these fees to be paid at the end of each school year - the teacher of the school to keep accurate record of attendance of each white child.\n\n2. If the Board of School Commissioners, Truro, will permit those Indian boys and girls on the Millbrook reserve who are qualified to take the course to attend the manual training and domestic science classes, respectively, in the Truro School nearest the reserve, without payment of tuition fees, the Department will agree that no tuition fees be charged for the white children attending the Millbrook Indian School.

Indian Welfare,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nDue to my failure to pass the required tests at the conclusion of my course I find myself compelled to ask for an extension of my leave of absence until the end of the school year in June. My sister, who is at present substituting for me, is quite willing to continue until then.\n\nPerhaps a little note by way of explanation would be in order. At the outbreak of the war I volunteered for service with the navy. They were quite independent at the time and told me I was on their waiting list. After waiting some time I tried the army who promptly rejected me for faulty vision. They told me then that had I been of any particular value to them as a tradesman or such I could be with special permission taken on. The trade I chose to learn in the shortest time possible was telegraphy hoping that somewhere in the Navy, Army, or \"ir Force I would find a spot. If I am accepted I will then ask for leave of absence for the duration. If rejected I will to the best of my knowledge be back in the fall.\n\nWould you endeavour to arrange with the treasury dept. to insert 157 arthur st. after her name on her check as Truro is growing up, and delays of even two or three days are to say the least annoying. Thanking you sincerely, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. McReynolds\nOttawa, January 17, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant, in which you ask for an extension of your leave until the end of June.\n\nIn view of the fact that your sister is willing to substitute until then, your request for additional leave is acceptable to the Department and approved.\n\nThe Treasury officials have been requested to send forward your sister's cheque to 157 Arthur Street, Truro, N.S.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. B. McKinnon,\n157 Arthur Street,\nTruro, N.S.\nOttawa, January 17, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Millbrook Indian Day School, No. 256.\n\nIn Mr. Phelan's memorandum of October 16, 1941, you were advised that Mr. F. B. McKinnon, teacher of the above named school, had been granted leave of absence without pay for the period October 1 to December 31, 1941, and that his sister, Miss Cecelia McKinnon, would be in charge of the school.\n\nMr. McKinnon has now requested an extension of his leave until the end of June, 1942, and this has been approved by the Department.\n\nMiss Cecelia McKinnon's name should remain on the paylist until the end of June, and her cheque should be sent to 157 Arthur Street, Truro, N.S.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 13th ultimo in which you intimated that if you were not accepted in any branch of the military service you would return to duty as teacher of the Millbrook School in the fall. Today I am in receipt of a form from the Canadian National Railways from which it appears that you are seeking employment with them. If this is correct, you should immediately forward your resignation as teacher of the Millbrook School. It is hardly fair to the Department to expect us to keep a place open for you while you are trying to obtain employment with some firm.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.B. McKinnon,\n157 Arthur Street,\nTruro, N.S.\n157 Arthur St., Truro, N.S.\nMarch 1st, 1942\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSup't Indian Welfare,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of 20th ult. and desire to state that my letter of Jan. 13th still stands as far as I am concerned. To wit \"if I am not accepted for military service I will return to duty at the Millbrook School in the fall.\" That is of course if nothing unforeseen happens, in the meantime.\n\nI was rejected for service by both the Navy and Army due to poor vision in one eye. I was told however that if I had a trade I might be accepted. One doesn't learn a trade overnight and I chose Telegraphy to learn that with a minimum cost I applied for permission to study in a C.N.R. Station. On completion of the course I asked for and obtained temporary work.\nas a telegrapher. The letter you received must have stated that I was only a spare man. This was to relieve an embarrassing financial position as I was without remuneration of any sort during the study period of about eight months.\n\nTo be frank with you I have no false hopes of making a living on the C.N.R. as a telegrapher since Centralized Traffic Control came into operation, for some other reason and I assure you that if I do not see fit to continue in the Service of the Indian Affairs Branch I will submit my resignation in sufficient time prior to the opening of School in the Fall. That is if I am not in the Services, of course.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval\n\nI remain Sincerely yours,\n\nJ. B.

I thank you for all the cooperation given me while there and can truthfully say that I enjoyed very much working with both the \"Department\" and the Indian people of Truro.\n\nDuring the year's leave of absence given me by the Dept I have studied telegraphy and have been working with the C.N.R. as operator. Having been redrafted as C.I which is still not active service I have been accepted as Clerk of the New Indian Agency at Shubenacadie. More than ever now I will be working with the Indian Affairs Branch and hope that our association will continue as pleasant as heretofore.\n\nThanking you for past favors and genuinely looking forward to further cooperation, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ.

May I also extend to you my congratulations on having secured your present appointment. We all feel here that a real step forward has been taken in the progress of the Indian population of Nova Scotia by the decision to group the Indians on two distinct and separate reserves. It is my hope that you will enjoy your duties as clerk and that you will find the work congenial and satisfactory in every sense.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

It was generally understood that the Sisters would be taking over at the new School on the Reserve here. With this in mind, I intended to have Mrs. MacNeil, who had taught last year on this Reserve, placed as teacher at Millbrook. However when it became known that the Sisters would not be able to take over the new School, I was advised by the Department to retain Mrs. MacNeil and in addition, to if possible, obtain the services of another teacher. I was able to engage Mrs. Elsie Basque to teach with Mrs. MacNeil on the Reserve here, but it meant there was no teacher at Millbrook. After advertising in the papers, the result was I received six or seven applications and from these I selected one who seemed best qualified, Miss Mary B.

S. Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, immediately following an investigation undertaken by him of conditions on Indian reserves in the provinces of Nova Scotia and P.E.I.\n\nWhat we are aiming at at the present time is the centralization of the Indian population of Nova Scotia on two reserves - Eskasoni and Shubenacadie. It is just possible that there are at a number of reserves in the province Indians who, for the time being at least, are gainfully employed, and it is our intention that these Indians should not be disturbed. On the other hand, it is difficult to justify capital expenditures on our reserves that may be abandoned in the years immediately ahead of us. It would, I feel sure, be of value to you and of interest to the members of your Association if you could find an opportunity to visit the reserves where our new policy is now in force. In addition to this, it is my intention to pass on your letter with a copy of my reply to Mr. J. E. Morris, Acting Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Quebec and the Maritime Provinces. Mr. Morris will, I feel sure, be glad to discuss the matter with you at the time of his next visit to Truro.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRalph M.

My reason at that time was the health in my immediate family. Happily that has disappeared and I am now ready to return to this great social field: the teaching and guiding of Indian children.\n\nDuring the past year the parents on the reserve, and I organized a Home and School Association. It was the first parent-teacher organization on any reserve in Canada.\nBecause of this work which I helped to start and am applying for the Millbrook school, feeling that a teacher unfamiliar with home and school might not carry on with our adult education programme.\n\nI am enclosing the Indian Agent's reply to my application.\n\nYours Truly,\nD.

I would suggest you write the Indian Affairs Branch regarding this. I was somewhat surprised when I received a letter from the Department in Ottawa stating that your resignation had been sent in and accepted, as all correspondence is supposed to go through this Office and as I personally had hired you as Teacher felt that you should have sent your resignation to me, but as it was taken out of my hands completely feel the only alternative is for you to write the Department.\n\nEnclosed you will find Day School Returns which you requested by phone from Mr. Brown.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. C. Rice,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1947.\n\nMr. D.F. MacDonald,\n89 Esplanade,\nTruro, N.S.\n\nDear Mr. MacDonald:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo we have already communicated with another teacher with a view to securing her services for the coming academic year. Under these circumstances we are not prepared at the present time to consider your application for reappointment.\n\nIf you so desire you can write again by the end of this month, by which time we will have heard from the other teacher and will be able to give you a definite answer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Mr. Henry,\n\nI should have answered your letter before now, but I was waiting to hear from Bert McKinnon and Miss Forbes, both about the Millbrook School at Truro. I went to Truro to see the school and Donald McDonald last year's teacher told me he wanted to come back there again next term. He is a smart young man and a very good teacher. So I told him I wouldn't take the school from him under the circumstances.\n\nBert McKinnon offered me Nyanga but, near here, but no residence there for the teacher and the boarding house is a good mile away from the school. I think Miss Forbes is\nis going there. Will be here for July and August. No doubt there will be many vacant schools (with residence) take on. Thanks\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary E.

Miss Jennie Forbes should be, and I have secured her consent, come to Eskasoni as a lay teacher while a Sister of the teaching Order is securing her license.\n\n2. Mrs. Mary MacNeil of Shubenacadie, whose home is not far from Middle River, is anxious to teach there if a boarding-house can be found. The teachers' residence on that reserve was unoccupied for a number of years because the teacher was a local girl and could commute daily. While empty it was given to an Indian family, to the consent of Mr. Morris, Inspector, to allow decent accommodation for a blind Indian man whose wife was tubercular, and who were currently living in a disreputable shack. There is no house available for this family, should Mrs. MacNeil displace them. I will investigate more fully upon my next visit to Nyanza.\n\n3. Miss Hazel Bissett of Chapel Island could go to the Truro school in Mr. Rice's Agency, which I think is vacant. Although Truro is approximately 150 miles from her home, I think she would find it easier to visit her aged relatives than if she were teaching at Middle River. There is a daily bus service between Truro and Miss Bissett's home, and it would allow her at least one monthly visit home. I have written to Mr. Rice accordingly, and have advised Mr. Rice to accept her, as she has done very good work in Chapel Island.\n\nI trust you will agree with me and advise all concerned accordingly.\n\nV.

Lauchlan\nActing Chief Treasury Officer.\nSaint Peters, U.S., Aug. 18th, 1947.\n\nMrs. Bernard J. Murray\nDept. of Welfare and Training\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter dated Aug. 13th stating there will be no vacancy on the staff at Eskasoni due to Mother Zenobial being in a position to nominate a full staff of Sisters, which is perfectly all right as I understand they have charge of school - what I did not understand was how a teacher could be appointed to or for one school as Miss Forbes was appointed for Nyangwa School and then within two weeks be appointed to fill in at Eskasoni as Mrs. Macdonald advised me in a letter written July 15th and which I still do not understand or consider \"Fair Play\" and far from professional or Departmental ruling - no sense of justice.\n\nIn the same letter she advised me I could have Nyangwa School which was now vacant due to Miss\nForbes accepting position at Eskasoni or if I was interested in Truro school which would be convenient to reach from my home to contact H.C. Rice, Indian Agent hence I replied to Mr. MacKinnon thanking him for advising me thus and asked for recommendation which I received enclosed in letter dated July 24th accordingly submitted application and recommendation to Mr. H.C. Rice for Truro School provided Mrs. MacNeil was not teaching which would make my application uncalled for. I never received a reply up to date which must be three weeks since I wrote. Mr. MacKinnon has certainly mis-informed you re Truro School which I would have accepted gladly as I could go and come by bus and overcome my difficulty regarding my aged mother.\n\nI am writing Mr. MacKinnon to ask him to explain the statement or information he wrote Department which is absolutely false. I always considered him fair upright and frank but your letter has completely changed my opinion.\n\nIn view of above I must ad-\nmit I am baffled and confounded.\n\nMr. MacKinnon, Indian Agent, wrote\u2014Sisters\u2014one licensed teacher required\u2014Miss Forbes asked to take position\u2014accepts. Nyanga Indians vacant offers same to me but I do not accept for personal reason which I explained.\n\nThen he writes\u2014I may have a chance of Truro School, which I made application for but received no reply.\n\nNow, letter from Department states Sisters have filled staff at Eskasoni\u2014a contradiction of this letter, also that Mr. MacKinnon advised you I had refused Nyanga and Truro School. I did not refuse Truro School as stated before\u2014I never received a reply from Mr. H. C. Price, Indian Agent.\n\nWhy all this deception? I am keeping all these letters but will supply any copy if requested.\n\nI request of you an explanation even though it means an investigation promptly as possible, as I could have had suitable schools had I not waited so long for a reply or replies from Department and Mr. H. C. Price, Indian Agent respectively.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHazel Bissett.\nOttawa, August 25, 1947.\n\nMiss Hazel Bissett,\nSaint Peter's, N.

The science books are very good and are proving quite popular with the students. Concerning the manual to grant it is more than I hoped for and I expect to have it completed this week. I have a model of a hand sleigh which I hope to have all the boys complete long before spring. Several of the better wood workers of the reservation have promised to help out as I am not much good in that line. Thanks you sincerely.\n\nI wonder Mr. Hoey about the cheque whether it comes usually at the end of December or the last teaching day. I certainly hope it will be here.\nby the 22nd or I'll have to spend Xmas here. I wonder is it possible for me to get it a day or two before the 22nd as the Xmas enter tantment will cost me a few dollars over & above the departmental grant for gifts & candies for 21 children.\n\nCould you advise me on that point?\n\nThank you again. I am\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.B. McKinnon\nOttawa, December 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 8,\nI expect that cheques for the teachers of all Indian\nday schools will be mailed sufficiently early to enable\nthe teachers to obtain their cheques by the date of\nschool closing.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nR.A.

Br.\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir -\n\nThis is the 6th day July and my cheque has not yet arrived. As you will understand this has caused a great annoyance. It necessitates my staying in Truro paying over \u00a31.25 per day board; it means that I lose employment awaiting me at home @ 2.50 per day.\n\nSo far this oversight or negligence has cost me at least 20s which to a person unemployed for 2 mos. and when employed will receive no remuneration until 30th Sept. is not quite fair. Even worse than that my credit at a local finance co. is endangered as my note was due the 2nd inst.\n\nPlease investigate at once and I think it is only fair to expect some remuneration to cover at least my board. Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher:\nMillbrook Ind Reserve\nColchester Agency, N.

With reference to this account I beg to advise that when I visited this School last month I found the outhouse in a rather unsanitary condition.

Please obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost. This you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nRegarding the serving of a midday lunch during the winter months, I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of supplies of the same type as furnished last year to an amount not exceeding the expenditure for this purpose last winter. The purchase of these supplies should be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration, in accordance with departmental instructions. You might refer the purchase of these supplies to Mr. Inspector Maxner. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost should be forwarded from time to time through the office of Mr. Maxner. The serving of the lunch should begin when the school reopens after the coming Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. H.

Only a hot drink, consisting of cocoa, milk and sugar, is now authorized. You may purchase, from time to time, the quantity of cocoa, milk and sugar required, obtaining accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIt is considered that the serving of this hot drink should not be continued after the end of April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

You should state, also, how you would recommend that the labour in connection with the repairs be undertaken. Could you arrange for the purchase of the materials and oversee the work, if the services of a competent foreman were engaged?

H. Faltenhine, Mgr.\nBrookfield NS.\nAugust 17th 1935\n\nSir:\nThe school building at this Reserve is in need of some repairs consisting of a new floor, and the walls replastered or sheathed. Also a few repairs on roof and floor porch. The costs will do for a few years with some minor repairs. I believe the walls would be better sheathed than replastered, and probably the cost of sheathing will be less.\n\nI beg to submit two tenders for this work: Halliday Galtman $160 and James H. Kenney $155. Steven Eldridge of this Reserve says he will do this work for $130, and will employ all Indian labor. Eldridge is a handy man, and quite capable of doing a satisfactory job. I think the tender of $130.00 is reasonable for this work, and if it is your wish to have this work done, I beg to recommend that it be given to Steven Eldridge at the above figure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gleade should employ Indian labour, as far as possible.\n\nI would request that you arrange to have the repairs completed at an early date. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and the cost should not exceed the quotation of Gleade for this work, viz.: $130. This is to cover the cost of materials and labour. It may be that the work will not be completed in time for the school to re-open on September third, next, but it is hoped that there will be no unnecessary delay.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should obtain accounts, in triplicate, stating in detail the work carried out. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It is hoped that, when the work is completed, the school building will be in a good state of repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacNeece,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. F.

The interior of the school is a disgrace to the Department. The plaster is off the walls and ceiling in many places. The floor is nearly worn through and the whole building shakes when one walks around. This is probably due to the rotting away of the sills. The porch has two holes where the windows should be and the floor is rotted through. There is no means of locking the porch or outer door. The porch roof leaks and the woodshed door is open allowing the Indians to remove wood at will. The stove is 35 years old and is held together by rods. The seats are in bad condition, being very rickety. I instructed the Indian Agent to buy a cheap padlock for the shed and report fully on the condition of this building to the Department.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIn acc't with C.T.

During the latter part of August and first few days of September the school building was renovated. This has greatly improved conditions inside and should tend to make the children attend more regularly. As the repair work was not finished Sept. 3rd, the school did not reopen until Sept. 11th.\nSir,\n\nWhen Mr. Gibson Armstrong was here, he asked if we supplied lunch for the school children last winter, and on being informed in the negative, he suggested that it would probably increase the attendance. I beg to recommend that lunch be provided by the Department commencing the first of December, for the children of Millbrook School; this lunch to consist of milk, cocoa, sugar, crackers and cheese. All the utensils needed are on hand.\n\nPlease advise me as to what action the Department desires me to take in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. F.

General Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI find at Truro quite a number of the Indians make fancy baskets and ax handles which they have to sell wholesale at ridiculous low prices. As the Trans Canada Highway runs through this reserve there must be a great many tourists pass over this road.\n\nIt appears to me that if there was a wigwam or some such structure erected there might be with two or three nice signs that they might be able to dispose of quite a lot of their work at fair prices.\n\nI think the Indians would do the work at very little expense to the Dept.\n\nWill you please give me your opinion on this matter and if agreeable what amount the Dept. would be willing to contribute.\n\nRe the ax handles, there must be a great number of those used by our Natl. Parks, etc., could not some arrangements be made to take those made by the Indians. They claim they are much superior to the factory made ones.\n\nThe school grounds at Truro are in bad shape would it not be a good idea to require any Indians who are able to work and require relief to work on these grounds. Discontinue direct relief. Require them to do road work, repairs to buildings etc in exchange for any future relief.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThos.

No funds have been specially provided to cover the cost of any further work. However, the local Indian Agent will be written and requested to furnish a report concerning any work required to the exterior of the building and the filling and levelling of the grounds. When this information is received, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided to carry out the work recommended by the Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nG.T. Purdy, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attention of the Department has been called to the need of repairs to the building and the filling and levelling of the grounds at the Millbrook Indian Day School. It has been suggested that some change be made in the lighting of the school building, as it does not seem to be satisfactory.\n\nNo doubt, you are aware that, last August, the Department incurred an expenditure of approximately $130 in repairs to the interior of the building. I would request that you furnish a report, at an early date, stating what further repairs are required to place this building in a good condition, giving an estimate of the cost for material and labour. Please report, also, regarding the condition of the grounds around the school, and, if you recommend that any work be undertaken in filling and levelling, you should furnish an estimate of the cost of the labour and any material that may be required.\n\nWhen this information is received, the Department will give consideration as to whether any funds to carry out the work can be provided from the Appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. B. Fox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N. S.\nSir:\n\nReporting on the repairs to building and filling, levelling of grounds, at the Millbrook Indian Day School, I wish to state:\n\n1st:\u2014Changing of windows to assure better lighting of school room and changing the seats, repairing broken ones, etc., can be done at an expenditure of not more than $50.00. Perhaps quite a bit less, all according to what we will meet in making the change.\n\nThere is a space in the floor that will require covering. For some reason or other the space under the teachers platform was not boarded over. This makes a cold draft for the teacher in winter. I know the department spent quite a substantial amount last year on this school, and it is regrettable that the changes we now recommend were not then made.\n\nSeveral of the seats are in need of repairs, all of which can be done by Indians, with only a few dollars expended for material. Since I last wrote in connection with filling and levelling the grounds, I took advantage of highway work now going on to secure about fifty loads of surplus earth and gravel, the road builders had to give away. This was put on the School field and levelled off by the young men near by, at no cost to us.\n\nAn expenditure now of about $100 on the grounds, all of which will go to Indians, excepting perhaps some material for fencing, will give us a splendid school field, and will keep the kiddies from the highway, which now hard surfaced, will be a source of danger where there are no sidewalks.\n\nThe grounds are very wet and need draining as well as filling and levelling.\n\nAn expenditure of approximately $150.00 will give us the School accommodations required for many years. Doctors have recommended the suggested change to safeguard the sight and health of the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nB. E.

This was put on the school grounds and levelled off by the Indians, with no cost to the Department.

Funds to cover the expense can be provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, reporting on the repairs required to the school building and filling and levelling of the grounds at the Millbrook Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure of approximately $150 in carrying out the following work at this school:\n\n1. Changing of windows in order to obtain better lighting of classroom.\n2. Changing seats and repairing any broken ones.\n3. Boarding over the space under teacher's platform.\n4. Levelling, filling, draining and fencing grounds.\n\nYou are to purchase any materials required, from firms on the approved list, and have all work, as far as possible, carried out by Indian labour. After the work has been completed, to your satisfaction, please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials, and accounts, in triplicate, covering the amount due for the labour employed. The accounts for the labour should show the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. I would suggest that the work in changing the windows, repairing desks, etc., be carried out during the summer holidays. The sum mentioned should not be exceeded in connection with all the work at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nB. B. Fox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N. S.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. B. B. FOX, INDIAN AGENT,\nTRURO, N.S., DATED JUNE 20, 1936.\n\nIn connection with the expenditure for labour at the School as approved in letter No. 47-1-5, dated June 9, 1936, I wonder if a cheque for $80 could be sent in advance to pay the men as in the plan of ditching. The rest of the estimated expenditure will be for material and the accounts would go directly to you. This would avoid considerable confusion and annoyance as the men will be paid as soon as the work is done by cheque and the signed forms as you have sent for labour submitted to the Department showing what money I have spent out and balance, if any, on hand.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: INDIAN AFFAIRS  \nBRANCH: SCHOOLS  \nDATE: June 26, 1936.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | B.

Besides the work that had been authorized before I arrived, I instructed the Agent to have one side of roof shingled, the porch at entrance moved and new steps build, also the repairing of shed and building of toilets. As this school is situated on the main highway, between Truro and Halifax, I authorized the painting of the school building - one coat, with two coats on front and roof stained. The total cost of all repairs would be approximately $250. All labour was performed by the Indians.\n\nI also authorized the Agent to purchase four double desks.\n\nThe grounds at this school have been levelled and drained and are now in fairly good shape.\n\nThe windows in the classroom are all placed on one side of the building. The school building is built on a cement foundation and a flagpole was erected. The sign with the name of the school has been placed on the front of the building.\n\nSince the repairs have been completed, the building presents a good appearance and is a credit to the Department.\n\nAgent Fox takes a great interest in the school and also in improving the Indian homes on the reserve. Considerable work was done on the reserve in carrying out repairs during the past summer, all work being done by the Indians, themselves - the Department supplying the material.\nTruro, N. S.\nSept. 6, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI came across an excellent cabinet yesterday suitable for a book case in the School which is needed to take care of the books and other material used in the Millbrook Day School. The price was quoted to me at $6.50 and I asked the dealer to hold it until I got approval to purchase.\n\nAs Mr. Sutherland, probably noted on his visit here there was no suitable place to keep books, etc in the School building and I believe to have built one in would cost us probably more than the amount that this very neat cabinet will cost.\n\nKindly advise as soon as possible as the dealer will probably want to sell if opportunity affords.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.

S.\nSept. 15, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. MacKinnon, our teacher, today made urgent petition for tooth brushes and dental cream for the pupils in Millbrook School. He tells me that this particular hygienic need has been sadly neglected among the children on the Reservation and as the consequence the teeth and mouth are in very bad state.\n\nIn conversing with the teacher I suggested that even if we gave the pupils brushes they would not take care of their teeth in the home as no doubt the parents are also negligent in this respect. He said that for a time he would keep the brushes in the school and each day give instructions to the kiddies on the care of their teeth. There are now twenty Indian children attending school and three more will be starting in a few days and there is only one child on the Reserve that has a tooth brush. We need therefore, two dozen brushes and a quantity of paste or powder from time to time.\n\nAlso, because of signs of tubercular trouble among several of the children Mr. MacKinnon also requested some kind of a closed receptacle or tank for water. I enquired at the hardware store here and find they have a properly constructed water tank with tap and the cost is $7.50.\n\nWaiting your approval, I am\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nB. B.

We repaired some of them last year but because of frequent repair the screws will not hold.\n\nFollowing recommendations of Truro School Supervisor Mosher and Inspector Ford who have visited our school I beg to petition for six school desk chairs, standard size at $6.50 each; six medium desk chairs at $6.50 each; and ten small desk chairs at $6.00 each.\n\nFor the beginners we require twelve kindergarten chairs at $.60 each and one table quoted at $7.00.\n\nThese figures were submitted to me by the Dominion Chair Company Limited at Bass River and are for chairs and table landed at Truro Station. This totals $152.70 to supply our school with the most modern equipment.\n\nWhile I hesitate in asking, yet another drain is needed across the school yard and this can be put in at a cost of not more than $35.00. I will supervise the work myself and have the Indians do the labor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnis\nSecretary,\nIndians Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nB. B. Fox,\nIndian Agent,\nTruro, N.

The local agent received approval of his plan to change the school seating arrangements and installing the most modern equipment.\n\nYesterday a large order was placed with the Dominion Chair Company for new seats for the higher grades and the modern seating equipment for the kindergarten and primary classes. Meanwhile, already a library has been installed, the first ever to be placed in the Indian schools here.\n\nLast year large sums were spent in improving the buildings and grounds of the school, and this year additional funds have been allotted for an outdoor basketball court and walks as well as more drainage for the school grounds. The school is under the supervision of the provincial school inspector and provides the Indian children there are a number of white children from the Halifax area who attend the school under a joint agreement with the town of Truro.\n\nA report upon consideration and approaches may be made to the federal government by local school authorities to have the school enlarged to accommodate more children and in large way solve an urgent problem that now confronts the lower grades in the town schools.\nDOMINION CHAIR COMPANY, Limited\n\nWHOLESALE MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS\n\nBass River, N.S., March 30, 1937.\n\nSold to Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Size   | Price |\n|-----------------------|----------|--------|-------|\n| School Desk-Chairs    | 6        | Standard size | 6.50  |\n|                       |          | Medium  | 6.50  |\n|                       |          | Small   | 6.00  |\n| Kindergarten Chairs   | 12       |         | 7.00  |\n| Table                 | 1        |         | 7.00  |\n\nTotal: 152.20\n\nDelivered at Truro, N.

McGill.\n\nWhile returning from Halifax last week I took the opportunity of dropping off at Truro between trains and visiting the band of Indians on the Millbrook Reserve.\n\nI visited the school and had a talk with the teacher (Mr. McKinnon). He was very much pleased with the desks and seats which had been provided for the school a few months ago but stated that he would like to have erected across the back of the school room a partition which would shut off a small space to be used for manual training. I told Mr. McKinnon that I would pass this information along to you.\n\nI then visited the Indian Agent, Mr. Fox, who showed me the supplies received from surplus belonging to the National Defence. These were in good condition and he was very much pleased with the same.\n\nMr. Fox stated that he thought considerable saving could be effected in the purchase of flour and drugs. He thought a half carload of flour might be purchased at once and stored by him for issue to the Indians, as required. With reference to medicines, he thought a saving might be effected by purchasing through the Department of National Health.\n\nI am passing these suggestions along to you for your consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nSir:\n\nIt has been the custom of the Department for a number of years to vote a small amount of money each year to obtain a treat for the children who attend the day School on the Reservation, at their annual closing before Christmas.\n\nTherefore, I am petitioning the Department to vote a similar amount to secure a Christmas treat for the twenty-two children now attending our School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.

Test and also the Provincial School Inspectors have recommended a jacket around the stove in the school. This would cause the heat to rise and spread over the room rather than strike the kiddies direct as at present.\n\nAlso the stone drain which was placed from the school to the ditch on the highway has settled considerably and this causes water to lie in the hollow places during wet weather.\n\nThe desks need varnishing to protect the wood and the plank steps to the front entrance of the school building are badly rotted.\n\nFollowing is an itemized statement of our requirements with prices that I have had quoted:\n\n- Jacket for stove 3 x 5 x 3 ft. medium sheet iron with feet to screw to floor quotation from Dexter & Company $12.00\n- 4 truck loads of gravel, 3 yards in each load, landed on school yard, quoted by Albert Beals at $15.00\n- 500 square feet of plank quoted by Consolidated Lumber Company $21.00\n- Varnish for the desks about one gallon estimated at $3.50\n- Labor on the entire work estimated at $20.00.\n\nThe planks mentioned are to be used to cover a ditch which would join to the school yard a small piece of land that was left when a curve on the highway was taken off a few years ago. The accompanying sketch may fully explain the grounds.\n\nThe total cost would be approximately $71.50.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.
