Mr. Connel said the government had appointed a special committee to examine the situation...\nTHE CHICKENS WE LIKE\n\nThe Fort Qu'Appelle Vidoette last week quoted from The Progressor of Dec. 18, 1853, to endorse its point that \"the power that be,\" and from our issue of the 16th of February last, to show that we have changed, and that we are not consistent. Our contemporary places extraordinary emphasis on our inconsistencies in the above dates, in column side by side, and palms them off as evidence of its assertion that we have been purchased to change its position. The distinguished members of the Vidoette are not to blame. It is welcome to all the comfort it can extract from the excerpts if has chosen to publish. Its editor must be looking through very distasteful spectacles when he sees any inaccuracy in the publications of others. But let us investigate them. The one taken from our issue of the 16th of February is part of an article in which we discussed the election returns of the Northwest Council, for their action on the Lieutenant-Governor's address, and in which we say that the every correctly represented the almost unanimous views of the people of the Territorial District. Such was the purpose of the extract which the Vidoette says is opposed to \"the powers that be.\" The other excerpt, in which it proposes to see a change of tone, is a criticism of Mr. Jackson, who has attacked the members of the Northwest Council and his subsequent delivery of a speech at a banquet which was commonly described as \"a most unbecoming hostility toward His Honour Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney. In the latter extract we condemn Mr. Jackson for attacking Mr. Dewdney under circumstances that precluded the possibility of a reply. Surely, the Vidoette would ask where is the inconsistency? Is it necessary to remind the editor of the Vidoette that Mr. Jackson does not constitute the whole membership of the Northwest Council, that he is but one man, and even then only a recently acknowledged leader? But while even the extracts which our contemporary quotes will not bear the extravagant interpretation placed upon them, we would ask where is the inconsistency? Is it necessary to remind the editor of the Vidoette that Mr. Jackson does not constitute the whole membership of the Northwest Council, that he is but one man, and even then only a recently acknowledged leader?\n\nFROM THE CAPITAL\n\nIn the election for the Northwest Council in 1853, Mr. Jackson's opponent was Major Bell, one of the Hon. Mr. Justice. The whole campaign stock-in-trade was composed of bitter attacks on His Honour, Lieutenant-Governor Dewdney, and when he went to the very next session of the Council there was no difficulty in the election of Dewdney and nothing but the usual bitterness toward him. At the last session of the Council during the first of yr., Mr. Jackson made a move which was calculated to throw the council toward the chair of the session his bitter hostility was aroused, it was by none powerful personage. Nevertheless, in the course of his remarks he mentioned that he had been unable to attend the session, and in the course of his remarks he mentioned that he had been unable to attend the session, and in the course of his remarks he mentioned that he had been unable to attend the session, and in the course of his remarks he mentioned that he had been unable to attend the session.\n\nHONI SOET QUIMAL Y PENSE\n\nThe Vidoette of last week published a letter from Belle Plain over the name de plume \"Occident,\" in which the Vidoette and its editors are accused of being extremely cowardly, but it affects us more harm than good, as much as pouring water on a duck's back. That geographical enigma contains the epithet the Vidoette makes in reference to Mr. Jackson. The Progressor of Jan. 29th, in its comments on the Vidoette, says that Mr. Jackson did not defend himself against the charges brought against him by the Hon. Mr. Justice, and says that he cannot prove the charges he makes. And not having done so he was extremely extremely cowardly in regard to the charges made against him.\n\nAn Ottawa dispatch says that Judge Travis will either be dismissed or removed. The report is hardly credible, if it comes on the reports of Mr. Jackson, who is now in Ottawa with the object of securing his discharge.

I therefore invite correspondence from any brother dairyman on this subject, and would urge that the question be thought desirable, of holding a convention of the dairymen of the province at Winnipeg during the summer season of next year, to take steps as may be necessary to form an association such as I have mentioned, and of other matters of mutual interest.\n\nWILLIAM WARDEN.\n\nCommissioner for Woodlands.\n\nOsborne, June 28th.\n\nThe greatest consolation to one growing up in the prairie surroundings which come with age, experience and wisdom. We are reminded of the recent appearance of the new Seal Annual of Mr. F. E. Ferry & Co., the celebrated stockbreeders of Danvers, Mass. The enjoyer of the enviable reputation of being the widest and best known firm in any business in United States. Many of the most prominent firms for profit and pleasure, have found several interesting publications and delightful in using. It is the annual containing seeds of the highest type and best quality, should secure the Annual. It can save on application.\n\nCONSUMER'S GUIDE.\n\nAn old proverb states that honesty having been placed in hands by an old Indian, insinuates the formula of a simple vessel containing water, and the secret art of constructing, Reinholds, Boots, Sashes, Artists and all kinds and Louis Al Gosselin, Messrs.

He said he was there for two dollars,\" said the newsboy. \"If I take them,\" said the man, \"I'll pay you another dollar.\" I'll put my end to your nuisance,\" exclaimed the newsboy. \"But show me your money,\" said the man, \"or I shall use my wilderness gun, desperately,\" said the newsboy. \"I shall use my shotgun in the back room,\" said the man. \"I shall use my shotgun in the back room,\" said the man. \"I shall use my shotgun in the back room,\" said the man.\n\nJ.
