Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe File 971-304-11 A.U. May 26th, 1948.\n\nAs requested in your above letter I recently visited Round Lake School and discussed with the Principal the matter of overcoming the fire hazards mentioned in the Inspector's report. Enclosed herewith is a requisition for the material required, the Principal is willing to have the work done by his staff.\n\nAs regards the furnace room this would require 1272 sq.ft. of Flexboard to make it fire proof. We have included this on our requisition.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's recommendations I beg to report as follows:\n\n1. Two doors with double acting hinges are included in our requisition.\n2. Pipes and collars for kitchen range will be purchased by the Principal.\n3. Kitchen stove will be moved out 18\" from wall and asbestos Flexboard has been requested in our requisition.\n4. All loose electric ends have already been taped.\n5. Material for a chimney in the men's sleeping quarters is included in our requisition.\n6. The defective fire extinguishers have been taken to Whitewood for repairs.\n\nW.J. Kerley,\nSuperintendent.\nPROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nOffice of the Fire Commissioner\n\nMay 21, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn May 7, 1948, I visited Round Lake Indian Residential School for the purpose of making a fire inspection of the building. Upon arrival I contacted Mr. J.H. Card, Engineer, who accompanied me through the school.\n\nIt was immediately noticed that the building was very old and in poor state of repair, especially in the basement section of the building. Because of the building's age and type of construction, if a fire should break out in any section of the premises, it would spread very rapidly and would be very difficult to control. The furnace room is in a very poor state of repair with exposed joists above the heating plant, improper fuel storage, no enclosures to shut off the furnace room from the rest of the building, and a gasoline engine driving an electric plant, together with storage batteries within a few feet of the furnace. It would be very difficult to improve this condition unless a complete renovation job was carried out and I do not believe the rest of the building warrants this expense.\n\nIn view of the above-mentioned hazards, it would be in the interest of good fire prevention practices to give immediate consideration to improving the conditions which exist in this building.\n\nListed hereunder are recommendations which could be applied, with very little cost and would improve conditions considerably:\n\n1. Doors would be placed on landings of main staircase on both 2nd and 3rd floors. These doors would prevent the spread of fire and smoke from floor to floor which, of course, would give students more time, in the event of a fire, to reach the fire escape. It appears as though there had been doors on these landings at some earlier date and had since been removed.\n\n2. Chimney inlet for smoke pipes of kitchen range requires repairs.\n\n3. Kitchen stove moved out from wall to a distance of 16\" and a wall protected from the heat of the stove by asbestos board and an air space.\n4. All loose electric wire ends to be properly taped.\n\n5. The heater in the men's sleeping quarters to be serviced by an approved chimney. At the present time the smoke pipes from the heater pass through the roof of the building.\n\n6. Several new extinguishers have been purchased in the past year and a large percentage of same were found to be plugged. These extinguishers should either be returned to the manufacturers or repaired and left in working condition.\n\nTrusting you will give these recommendations your personal and immediate attention and advise this office accordingly when recommendations have been complied with as we would appreciate your fullest cooperation in this regard. I am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSgd. R.A.W. Switzer,\nFire Inspector.\n\nMr. J. B. Ostrander,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nRAW/RB\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from the office of the Fire Commissioner, Province of Saskatchewan, advising how to remedy fire hazards at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. This matter was taken up with Mr. Kerley and he was instructed to discuss with the Principal how best to eliminate these hazards.\n\nI am enclosing copy of Mr. Kerley's letter and requisitions for materials required to make this building comply with provincial fire regulations. Mr. Kerley states that the Principal is willing to have the labour performed by the staff of the school. I would therefore recommend that he be given instructions to obtain this material from the Security Lumber Company at Broadview.\n\nJ.P.B.

Mills, Esq., Chief Engineer, Engineering & Construction Division, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School,\nWhitecourt, Sask.\n\nIn reply to your letter # I. A. 1556-11 of the 26th ultimo, the following are the facts requested:\n\n1. There is a Pump House 8' x 8' over a \"wet well\" at the lake shore, this well is 4' square and 11' deep with 5' of water at present. The suction line of 1\" pipe is connected to the water pump in the boiler room. The water is pumped into a cistern 9' in diameter, 9' deep in the boiler room by a F. M. air cooled 2\u00bd H.P. engine connected to a pump jack to an old pump said to be a F. M. (name could not be determined). This outfit cannot pump the wet well dry.\n\n2. The difference in the level of the water in the wet well to the highest point where the suction pipe enters the boiler room is about 40 feet. It appears that this pipe could have been put in lower so it comes in 6 feet over the top of the pump. If the pump is put in the Pump House at the lake shore, an oil stove would be the best method to heat it, as being so small there would be no room for fuel. The present pump there takes 3 to 4 hours to pump the cistern full.\n\n3. The size of the suction pipe is 1\u00bd\" and is 378 feet from one pump to the other.\n\n4. The electric supply is a 32 Volt D.C. unit, driven by a F. M. Z Type Self Oiling 6-7 H.P. gasoline engine. The same engine is used to drive the pump by another pulley.\n\n5. The existing pump is a F. M. Self Oiling Typhoon Pump, Pressure 100 lb., Speed 215 R.P.M., 2500 G.P.H.\n\n6. The F. M. 1000 G.P.H. Self Oiling Typhoon Pump #6659 has been sent back to Winnipeg.\n\nThe old pump is worn out beyond repair, it leaked so badly that it caused the shorting of the Generator which is situated close by. I might add that the whole set-up is very bad and in very poor shape. The measurements given were supplied by Mr. Leishman of the Round Lake School Staff. Any assistance that you can provide will be greatly appreciated.\n\nW. J. D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School, Whitewood, Sask.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of January 31st, you are advised that we are in receipt of information from Indian Superintendent Kerley with regard to the arrangement of the water supply system at the above.\n\nWe have analyzed the data presented in Mr. Kerley's letter of February 3rd, and it may be summarized as follows.\n\nThere is a \"wet well\" located at the Lake, a distance of approximately 378 feet from a concrete reservoir in the boiler room of the school building. An old pump powered by a 25 H.P. gasoline engine pumps water from the \"wet well\" into the reservoir in the boiler room. From the reservoir in the boiler room the water is pumped into a pressure tank by another pump which is driven by a pulley and belt from the diesel engine connected to the electric generator set. Mr. Kerley states that this pump is worn out and leaks so badly that further repairs are impossible.\n\nA new Fairbanks-Morse 1000 g.p.h. pump was recently purchased and installed to replace the old unit referred to. This new pump failed to give satisfactory service and has been returned to the Winnipeg Branch of the Fairbanks-Morse Company. A request from Indian Superintendent Kerley for authority to purchase a 6000 g.p.h. pump was then received by the Indian Affairs Branch, at which time they sought an opinion from this Division.\n\nFollowing the above summary, it is our opinion that the 1000 g.p.h. pump should serve the purpose if properly installed. It is therefore recommended that the Fairbanks-Morse Company be requested to supply a self-priming Typhoon pump suitable for belted service having a capacity to deliver 1000 g.p.h. against 100 lbs. per square inch pressure when connected by suitable pulley and belt to the existing Fairbanks-Morse Type Z self-priming 6-7 H.P., gasoline engine.\n\nIt is also recommended that the Fairbanks-Morse representatives in Winnipeg be requested to direct the installation of this pump and put it into satisfactory service.\n\nR.A.

Card, Principal of the above school, to which was attached an invoice covering the cost of a water pump recently installed. This matter was commented on in our memorandum of February 17, 1948.\n\nThe subject has been discussed between our Chief Architect and Col. Neary, who advised that it was an internal matter which your Branch would handle.\n\nTherefore, we are enclosing the attached correspondence and invoice for your action.\n\nD.M. Mackay, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncls.\nMarch 14th, 1949.\n\nMr. T. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to your memorandum under date of Feb. 17th which is enclosed.\n\nThe statement in first paragraph sets out the condition and manner of getting our necessary supply of water for all purposes except for drinking and cooking. This entails going across the lake in the winter to a spring. The greater part of the year we haul our water from a spring about 4 miles distant on No. 9 highway since it is not possible to reach the first mentioned spring by going overland.\n\nIt was in December while I was in Hospital with an attack of Pneumonia that the old pressure pump gave out. Our man at the school phoned me at the hospital saying that the only pump he found available was one of 1000 G.P.H. I advised accepting it. It was shipped in but was never set up according to my Farm Manager since Mr. Kerley, Indian Agent received authority to purchase a 2500 G.P.H. pump. This larger pump was received, installed and is giving good satisfaction.\n\nRecently in conversation with Mr. Kerley he requested that we should pay half cost of new pressure pump from our school moneys. When I came into this work I understood that all such expenditures were to be taken care of by the Department. Certainly, if we have to expend our moneys for Jacket Heaters, Pressure Pumps, and other such purchases it will not be possible to keep within our budget.\n\nWe would request that the purchase of this new pressure pump be taken by the Department of Mines and Resources - Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Card\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 6)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES & RESOURCES\nLANBS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nMemorandum\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School, Whitewood, Sask.\n\nOttawa, February 17 1949.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of January 31st, you are advised that we are in receipt of information from Indian Superintendent Kerley with regard to the arrangement of the water supply system at the above.\n\nWe have analyzed the data presented in Mr Kerley's letter of February 3rd, and it may be summarized as follows.\n\nThere is a \"wet well\" located at the Lake, a distance of approximately 378 feet from a concrete reservoir in the boiler room of the school building. An old pump powered by a 2\u00bd H.P. gasoline engine pumps water from the \"wet well\" to the reservoir in the boiler room. From the reservoir in the boiler room the water is pumped into a pressure tank by another pump which is driven by a pulley and belt from the diesel engine connected to the electric generator set. Mr Kerley states that this pump is worn out and leaks so badly that further repairs are impossible.\n\nA new Fairbanks-Morse 1000 g.p.h. pump was recently purchased and installed to replace the old unit referred to. This new pump failed to give satisfactory service and has been returned to the Winnipeg Branch of the Fairbanks-Morse Company. A request from Indian Superintendent Kerley for authority to purchase a 2500 g.p.h. pump was then received by the Indian Affairs Branch, at which time they sought an opinion from this Division.\n\nFollowing the above summary, it is our opinion that the 1000 g.p.h. pump should serve the purpose if properly installed. It is therefore recommended that the Fairbanks-Morse Company be requested to supply a self oiling Typhoon pump suitable for belted service having a capacity to deliver 1000 g.p.h. against 100 lbs. per square inch pressure when connected by suitable pulley and belt to the existing Fairbanks-Morse Type Z self oiling 6-7 H.P. gasoline.\n\nIt is also recommended that the Fairbanks-Morse representatives in Winnipeg be requested to direct the installation of this pump and put it into satisfactory service.\n\n(sgd) T.S.Mills\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.Gibson Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have had considerable correspondence with Indian Superintendent Kerley about the pump required at the Round Lake School, and forwarded to you a requisition dated February 23rd for the type of pump recommended by the Lands & Development Services Branch.\n\nFrom subsequent correspondence it appears that the Principal of the Round Lake School, which is a Government-owned institution, ordered a pump which was not satisfactory, and was later informed by Superintendent Kerley that a larger pump had been authorized. We cannot find any record of ever having given any such authority. The Principal of the Round Lake School secured a larger pump as it was urgently needed. The Reverend Principal, Mr. Card, explains the matter as follows:\n\n\"It was in December while I was in hospital with an attack of pneumonia that the old pressure pump gave out. Our men at the school phoned me at the hospital saying that the only pump he found available was one of 1000 GPH. I advised accepting it. It was...\"\nshipped in but was never set up according to my Farm Manager, since Mr. Kerley, Indian Agent, received authority to purchase a 2500 GPH pump. This larger pump was received, installed and is giving good satisfaction.\"\n\nUnder the circumstances there is no necessity for taking any further action on our requisition of February 23rd, and when the account for the pump is received, it will be submitted to you, and it is hoped that you will be able to issue a Purchase Order.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nAIR MAIL\n\n2nd April, 1949\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBroadview, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th ultimo regarding the pump at the Round Lake School, Reverend Mr. Card has written to the Lands & Development Services Branch in reply to a letter he received from them.\n\nPlease obtain and forward by airmail an account for the 2500 GPH pump which is now in use. The account should be dated previous to March 31st, as the transaction took place last December. We understand that the pump ordered on Purchase Order 36658 was returned unused.\n\nWe received your Voucher No. 194 dated 29th November, 1948, for $113.80, and this amount was forwarded to the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company for payment of the pump ordered on Purchase Order 36658. Consequently, when you are forwarding the Voucher for the larger pump which is now in use, you should deduct from the Invoice the amount of $113.80, which we have already paid to the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company.\n\nBernard F.

In addition to this there are 30 head of other cattle made up of young heifers and young steers. They are all Holstein breeding. It was their intention to butcher the steers for winter meat at the school and to keep the heifers for replacement of aged milk cows.\n\nIt is my opinion that there has always been too large a herd of cattle at the Round Lake School. If they intend to milk cows to have the milk for the use of the pupils, ten cows would be enough to keep with the present pupilage. Owing to the fact that the cost of erecting stable accommodation for the large number of cattle at the school, (and the fact that the main building is really not fit for occupancy at all,) I do not recommend erection of a cattle barn and I would recommend disposing of all of the cattle before the winter sets in and the purchase of powdered milk for food purposes.\n\nHowever, some stabling accommodation is necessary as it is necessary to keep two teams of horses at the school and occasionally in the winter the Indian Superintendent or the doctor drives to the school with horses and it is necessary to have a double stall for that purpose. In other words I would recommend the erection of a horse barn with three double stalls and a harness and feed room at one end. Enclosed is an estimate of the material necessary for such a building. The estimate was prepared by the Security Lumber Company of Broadview, Saskatchewan on a rough plan which I prepared, the barn being 16 feet wide and 36 feet long with no loft.\n\nContinued on Page 2.\nThe bill of material amounts to $1009.82, f.o.b. Broadview in addition to which there will freighting and gravel which will probably add a further $150.00. I would recommend that an order be placed at once for the material in accordance with the estimate and requisition enclosed. I endeavored to contact one William Pitcher of Stoughton, Saskatchewan who has done some carpentry work for the Department in the past, as I believe he would take on the work of erecting the building on an hourly basis on a satisfactory manner. However, he was absent and Mr. Kerley will contact him as soon as possible advising me of the possibility of employing him. Assuming that the labour performed in this manner will not exceed 50% of the amount of the bill of material, the barn will cost something under $2,000, and I would recommend that an amount of $2000 be made available for the purpose at the earliest possible date in order that it may be completed before cold weather sets in.\n\nIf the school is to continue a complete new lighting plant is needed and it should be 110 volts. The previous plant was 32 volts and there is so little electrical equipment being used from this plant, that a change to a 110 volt will not result in any expense or changing the electrical equipment. If the Department decides to re-open the school for the new term, a lighting plant should be ordered at once.\n\nI investigated the possibility of transferring some of the Government equipment from the File Hills Residential School to the Round Lake Residential School and I communicated to the Department in this connection yesterday asking authority to transfer the following items: 1 H.P. Fairbanks horse engine, 2 oven kitchen range (the one at the Round Lake School is worn our and in my opinion not worth repairing) one small washing machine and one drier.\n\nThe heating boiler at the Round Lake School was recently inspected by the Boiler Inspector and he reports it is satisfactory.\n\nIn any case I certainly do not think that the Round Lake Residential School should re-open unless a new Principal is appointed as I do not consider Reverend Mr. Card is fitted for the position.\n\nPlease instruct me further in this connection at the earliest possible date.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWhen I replied to your letter a few days ago, I told you that I would get the reaction of Mrs. Loveys and our Superintendent of Missions to the suggestion that no cattle barn be built at the Round Lake School and that the herd of cattle be disposed of. I advised you that I thought your suggestion was a pretty drastic one and that I certainly would not agree to it without consulting Dr. R.J. McDonald, the Superintendent of Missions, and Mrs. Loveys.\n\nTo-day I have a reply from Dr. McDonald, in which he expresses himself quite decidedly as feeling that \"the suggestion is altogether too drastic.\" He feels that we would not be justified in trying to feed the children at the School, using only powdered milk, - particularly since there is such a fine herd available. He says he is not in a position to say whether too many cows are being kept; perhaps a reduction in the stock would be justified. However, he feels that there certainly should be a sufficient herd kept to provide milk for the children of the School.\n\nDr. McDonald also points out that, as he understands it, in addition to the instruction given in the School, part of the value on the herd lies in the training in farming and dairying which it provides. To dispense with the herd would be to lose almost altogether the value from this source of instruction.\n\nAs soon as I have a reply from Mrs. Loveys, we shall pass the information on. I shall be greatly surprised if she expresses herself as favorable to the course suggested in your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMCM.MIT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 6)\nAugust 3, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.,\n\nRound Lake Residential School\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter received from Dr. Macdonald concerning the barn at the above school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\nBWN/HM\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to the situation at the Round Lake Residential School, and the condition of the health of Reverend J.A. Card, the Principal, I have to report that Mrs. Loveys visited the Round Lake School with me on the 2nd instant. When at the school we found that Reverend Mr. Card was in hospital at Saskatoon under observation as a result of his disturbed mental condition. Mrs. Loveys may receive a telephone message from his son Walter, who is temporarily in charge of the work at the Round Lake Residential School, to the effect that he has been informed by telephone from Saskatoon that Mr. Card's illness has been diagnosed as \"hardening of the arteries\", with the result that there seems a possibility that he might be in a position to return to his duties at no far distant date. In the meantime I understood from Mrs. Loveys that she is endeavouring to find someone to act temporarily as Principal at the school until Reverend Mr. Card is fit to return to his duties.\n\nMrs. Loveys is quite determined to continue to have a number of milch cows kept at the Round Lake School, notwithstanding the fact that I have tried to convince her that it would be much less difficult from the point of view of the Department to not build a cow barn at the present time and for the school to purchase the necessary milk for the children. She emphasized the fact that the school was getting a certain amount of profit out of the surplus milk which was being produced by the milch cows, and that this extra profit was necessary for the operation of the school. Of course, in my opinion, it is for the Department to decide whether or not to make this concession in order to improve the financial conditions at the school, at the expense of the taxpayer, by building a barn large enough to house at least 12 head of cows and a bull, in addition to the horse barn which I recommended some time ago as necessary.\n\nMrs. Loveys suggested that a barn be built for the cows without a loft. Of course this can be done at considerably less cost than would be the cost of a hip-roofed barn with a loft. The milch cows at the school are of Holstein breeding, and if the feed is not kept in the building, and has to be taken into the building twice a day in the cold weather, it would be difficult to keep the cows warm enough that their milk supply would not be considerably reduced. Holstein cows in full milk do not do well if they are not kept warm in the winter.\n\nI shall await the decision of the Department before taking any action to endeavour to find out what would be the cost of a suitable barn for 12 milch cows, and a bull but with a loft, and if we are to build a barn for the cows, the same barn should serve for the horses, and should be made large enough accordingly. I would estimate the cost to be in the neighbourhood of $10,000.00 at least. This might be reduced to $6,000.00 if the barn is built to house 12 cows, a bull, 6 horses, and room for some calves and feed, but without a loft.\n\nI shall appreciate being advised at a very early date as to the decision of the Department in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nOn my return to the office, I find correspondence regarding this school and the suggestion that the barn be not rebuilt and that the children be supplied with powdered milk. I have also the comment of Mr. Supervisor Ostrander that there is too large a herd of cattle at the Round Lake School.\n\nAs you know, I have a very great regard for Mr. Ostrander but I am wondering on what he bases his opinion that the herd is too large. It is very well to say that ten cows would be enough to take care of the present pupilage but that means that every cow is giving milk at the full capacity. Further than this, I think it would be a very great mistake to cut out all live stock on a farm situated in the Qu'Appelle Valley. As a matter of fact, horses might be dispensed with and tractors installed but I think there should be cattle on that farm.\n\nQuite apart from the opinion of Mrs. Loveys \u2014 which I am sure will coincide with my own \u2014 I am writing to say that a small barn to house six horses, with harness and feed rooms at one end, is entirely unacceptable. We are looking for, and expecting, the erection of a barn that will house at least a reasonable number of cattle. I would suggest fifteen or twenty head, letting any of the other stock run loose.\n\nI should be very glad to know if there is a possibility of your being in Ottawa during the next couple of weeks as I may be able to make a trip to discuss this and other matters with you personally.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:HC\nReverend Doctor George Dorey  \nSecretary United Church Mission Board  \n299 Queen Street West TORONTO Ontario\n\nRE ROUND LAKE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL BARN -stop- HAVE\n\nSUGGESTION BARN BE ERECTED HOUSE TWELVE COWS BULL SIX HORSES AND SPACE\n\nCALVES AND FEED BUT WITHOUT LOFT -stop- PLEASE CALL ME LONG DISTANCE\n\nAUGUST EIGHTEENTH -\n\nBernard F Neary  \nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCharge Indian Affairs  \nMines and Resources\n\nIndian Affairs.

We would appreciate your comments on\nthe matter of this report.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAJD: MMoN\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to telephone conversation with Colonel Neary on the 27th ultimo a plan of a suitable barn for the Round Lake Indian Residential School was prepared, and quotations given thereon by Harvey Lunan Construction Company, of Regina, after which the writer made an effort to secure quotations on the same building from contractors in Broadview, Messrs. Webb and Melanson, and Mr. W. Wellbelove. Both of these contracting firms declined to submit a tender on the building, as they both stated they had more work ahead of them than they would be able to perform before winter. After making several other enquiries as to contractors who might probably be interested, Mr. William L. Pilchak, of Stockholm, Saskatchewan, was contacted, and a quotation received from him.\n\nWritten quotations from the two contractors are enclosed herewith. It will be noted that the quotation of Harvey Lunan Construction Company is $8,500.00 without a loft, and $10,100.00 with a loft, while the quotations given by Mr. William L. Pilchak are $8,000.00 without the loft, and $10,000.00 with the loft. I am enclosing herewith a rough plan of the proposed building with a gable roof, on which the quotations are $8,000.00 and $8,500.00 respectively. Also enclosed is a photostatic copy of a loft and hip-roof on which, if added to the plan shown, the contractors have tendered $10,000.00 and $10,100.00 respectively.\n\nIt is very difficult without blue prints and specifications to get tenders quickly on a building of this kind, as very few hip-roof barns, or barns of any kind, are being erected by contractors in late years. However, the plan shown meets with the requirements of the barn necessary at the Round Lake School, and should be erected at the very earliest possible date. I would therefore recommend approval of the plan, and that the contract be awarded to Mr. William L. Pilchak, of Stockholm, Saskatchewan, who will perform the work in accordance with the plan, in either the gable roof type or hip-roof type, with loft.\n\nWhile I have been rather anxious to have this barn constructed with a loft, and have so requested, I have concluded that the plan shown without a loft will prove quite satisfactory for a few years, as the barn will be warm and, although it will cool at times, when hay or other feed is being taken in or out in the winter time, it will soon become warm again, and I do not think the milch cows will suffer a great deal in the colder weather. Therefore, having given careful consideration to the whole matter, and particularly the urgent need to have a barn completed as quickly as possible, I now recommend that the barn be built without a loft.\na loft by Mr. William L. Pilchak, of Stockholm, Saskatchewan, at the price of $8,000.00; he to supply all material and perform all labour, at the earliest possible date.\n\nMay this matter be considered urgent, please, and the necessary authority given me to proceed, at once. There will be some delay in securing all of the material, and I am sure the barn cannot be completed in less than two months from the date of commencement, as Mr. Pilchak will not be able to engage a very large crew of men because of the fact that we are in the midst of harvest.\n\nJ.P.B.

Card, why the test was taken, and at whose request. He informed me that he knew nothing about a test having been taken, or anyone requesting it.\n\nThe Department would naturally assume that the water referred to in the test was that being used for drinking and cooking at the school, which is not a fact. The bacteriological report reads: \"Sample of drinking water from a cold water tap on first floor of school\". There is no water being taken from the taps at the school for drinking purposes other than from tanks especially placed at the school for drinking purposes, and the water in these tanks is obtained from a very fine lively spring some distance from the school. It is hauled regularly to the school for drinking purposes in a clean receptacle. The water from the taps in the bathrooms and other places about the school is used for washing purposes only, and comes from a seepage well near Round Lake. It has been known for years that this water is not fit for drinking or culinary purposes, and it has never been used as such unless deliberately by some member of the staff of the school who should know better.\n\nI do not see that any action should be taken in connection with this memorandum other than I have already taken to ascertain that the staff and the children of the school fully understand that they must drink no water with the exception of\n\nthat water which.........\nthat water which is placed in the proper receptacle for drinking purposes and which is certainly not contaminated water.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThe buildings at the Round Lake Indian Residential School are badly in need of exterior painting and there is an item in the current year's Estimates of $3,250.00 for labour and material for this purpose.\n\nEnclosed is a requisition amounting to $1,842.50 for material and labour to paint the main buildings, and the classroom building at this school, being based on a quotation given by Messrs. Webb and Melanson, of Broadview, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am submitting the matter to the Department for consideration, and it will be noted that the amount is not sub-divided as between material and labour. I have no doubt that if the Department decides to proceed with painting these buildings the necessary paint could be purchased by the Purchasing Agent, and a painter engaged to perform the labour at somewhat less than the amount quoted. However, there is some doubt about the wisdom of spending money on painting these buildings unless it is proposed that the Round Lake School will continue in operation for a number of years. If the school year ending June 30th, 1950, will be the end of the operation of the Round Lake Residential School, then I do not recommend the expenditure. However, I would be glad to receive the instructions of the Department in this connection as to the wisdom of painting at all, and the question of the material being purchased by the Purchasing Agent, instead of accepting the offer of Messrs. Webb and Melanson for both material and labour.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has been having trouble financing and had submitted an interim progress report the week previously, but had not received a cheque. As the work will no doubt be completed by the time the $800.00 security cheque will have reached the Department, I did not collect it from him, and would ask that this formality be waived.\n\nJ.P.B.

Present regulations do not allow us to waive the acceptance of a security deposit cheque.\n\nAs soon as you are satisfied that the barn has been properly completed, you should forward another progress payment, and if you mark it \"Rush\", we will arrange to have the cheque issued immediately.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nTender Base = 8 tons\n\n54.00\n26.00\nAIR MAIL\n\nNovember 10th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

However, on November 4th I found the barn almost completed, but Mr. Pilchak was short on windows, which the lumber company at Stockholm had been promising to deliver to him for two or three weeks, and, of course, the building cannot be said to be completed until the windows are received and installed.\n\nAs stated, I have been away from the office for some time, and must remain here for two or three days to attend to urgent correspondence, therefore I shall not be able to visit the Round Lake School until toward the end of this week, and I am not prepared to make a statement that the work is completed and satisfactory until I have made another visit.\n\nAs soon as I am able to visit the school I shall communicate further with the Department. If, at that time, all the other work is completed, with the exception of the windows, I shall recommend that the progress report which has been returned to me be re-submitted, as I know that Mr. Pilchak is having some trouble financing, and I do not like to see him held up too long for a further interim payment merely because the lumber company cannot secure windows for him.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nNovember 15th,\n1949.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have received a letter from our Superintendent in Regina, Rev. R.W.K. Elliott, of which I am enclosing a copy. You will note that Mr. Elliott thinks that Mr. Card has not received much co-operation or assistance from Mr. Curley, but that is really not my reason for writing.\n\nI am much concerned about the lighting equipment. I think the situation which Mr. Elliott has outlined is definitely dangerous, and I should be glad if you would communicate with the Agent, or whoever is responsible, to see that the matter is attended to. I am quite sure that you can do this without any reference to what has been said regarding Mr. Curley's attitude\u2014which may or may not be a correct statement of the situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nEnc.\nRegina, Sask.\nNovember 9, 1949.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\n299 Queen Street West,\nTORONTO 2B, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nOn Monday I visited the Round Lake Mission and had an interesting talk to the children and a fair visit with the staff there. Mr. Card seems to be in just fair health. He does not seem to be able to stand very much extra effort. His talking with the Indian Agent seems to be a very sore spot. He has not received very much cooperation or assistance from Mr. Curley. The lighting equipment is in very poor repair. They have made several attempts to put it in shape and each time they will have light for a day or two then unannounced darkness. This is not very satisfactory for this type of residence. The carrying of coal-oil lamps and the hanging of metal lamps is a dangerous experiment amongst these youngsters.\n\nThere is also a need for some mode of transportation here. It would seem that it would be very helpful if a station wagon of some description might be made available for the transport of the staff and children when necessary from the Mission to town and back again. This station wagon might be put to very good work for the church during the summer months. Maybe we could approach the W.M.S. to do something in this regard. There seems to be a very good spirit prevailing amongst the staff and in the school as a whole.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(signed)\n\nR.W.K.

I might say that Mr. Pilchak has left nothing that could be desired in the way of materials or workmanship in this building.\n\nMr. Pilchak has received $5,400.00 less $300.00 or his 10% deposit, which was not sent forward on account of the urgency at the time of letting the Contract, and as I stated in my letter of October 31st, I thought the $300.00 security should be waived. This was not concurred in by reason of Departmental regulations as explained in Mr. Phelan's letter to me of November 2nd. With reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of November 4th and November 10th, I am assuming that Mr. Pilchak's deposit of $300 is held in a Suspense Account, therefore it will be returned to him on a separate authority from the $2600.00 requested on the enclosed Progress Report.\n\nMr. Pilchak's Contract price was $8,000.00 and to date he has received $4,600.00, therefore the balance due him is $3,400.00 made up of: $2,600.00 final payment plus his $800.00 deposit.\n\nJ.P.B.

His quick action undoubtedly saved the building by reducing the intensity of the blaze.\n\nLed To Safety\n\nFour boys and five sick head of cattle, including several calves, were led to safety before the doors were opened among the flames.\n\nFire extinguishers and barrels of water hauled to the scene on a truck helped bring the flames under control.\n\nThe fire burned through the double wall to the loft in two or three places.\n\nCattle stabled near the tractor were killed by flames, others by suffocation.\n\nAn Old Machine\n\nThe old tractor, which is an old machine, was kept in the barn at night for easier starting in the morning when grinding grain, crushing feed and sawing wood.\n\nRound Lake mission, operated by the Roman Catholic Church, is the Indian affairs branch for a new tract of land which would not have to be paid in taxes.\n\nNone of the mission staff was on hand when the boy driver brought the machine.\n\nFire A Year Ago\n\nThe new barn, built last fall, replaced one which burned down a year ago with a loss of more than $1,000.\n\nThe mission has about 30 Indian pupils, who joined the staff and several other white children.\n\nLocated in the Qu'Appelle valley between Stockholm and Wadena, the school is about 140 miles northeast of Regina.\nFuel truck overturns and burns\n\nDAFOE, Sask. (Special) \u2014 A truck carrying diesel fuel overturned and burned four miles east of here early last No. 6 Wednesday at 3 p.m. The driver was uninjured. The victim, Clarke, was killed by fire, Moose Jaw.\n\nEscaped through window\n\nIt was Tuesday night that the driver had escaped to avoid an incoming car, and had continued driving his vehicle from the burning vehicle by smashing a window.\n\nThe vehicle was a three-ton truck with a small tank at the rear. Truck loaded with diesel fuel. Mr. Clarke opened the truck, which was insured, and was operated by the MacCon company of Moose Jaw.\n\nM. Rudnitsky funeral held\n\nPRESCOTT, Sask. (Special) \u2014 Funeral services for Mira Rudnitsky, 45, who was crushed to death by a train on Saturday, were conducted Tuesday at the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Prescott. Burial was made in the Ukrainian Catholic cemetery.\n\nMrs. Rudnitsky was born in Buchanan district. He married Mrs. J. Shumate of Buchanan there in 1928. They lived in Buchanan until 1948, when they moved to Prescottville.\n\nSurviving are a wife, three daughters, Evelyn, Grace, and Mary; a son, Newton, all of Prescottville; two sisters, Mrs. R. Rudnitsky, Prescottville, and Mrs. J. Statnik, Buchanan; two brothers, Bill and Tom, both of Buchanan.\n\nTWO-THIRDS LOST\n\nIn filling 100 pounds of gas, there is a waste of approximately 67 pounds.\n\nMOORE'S TAXI LTD.\n\nWESTERN CANADA'S LARGEST TWO-WAY RADIO TAXI FLEET\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA,\n\nThe following is an army message sent to the Department yesterday regarding a fire at the Round Lake School, which resulted in the loss of fourteen cows and estimated damage of $500.00 to the barn:\n\n\"MR BLANCHE CROOKED LAKE AGENCY CLERK ADVISED ME BY PHONE OF FIRE IN BARN LAST PM. AT ROUND LAKE SCHOOL STOP REPORTS KEEPING TRACTOR IN BARN AND BACKFIRE STARTED BLAZE STOP INTERIOR OF BARN SCORCHED BUT DAMAGE TO BUILDING OF NO ACCOUNT LOSS EIGHT TO TEN COWS STOP KERLEY AT WHITE BEAR HE WILL INVESTIGATE AND REPORT FULLY IN A FEW DAYS.\"\n\nEnclosed is a cutting from the Leader Post of March 16th, 1950, with reference to this fire. I have not had Mr. Kerley's report which might furnish somewhat different information from that given in the Leader Post news report. However, I believe that the Department should officially take note and protest one paragraph of this newspaper report. The source of information must have been Reverend J.A. Card, the Principal of the school. The public, who have to pay for our mistakes, are given the impression that Indian Affairs Branch was responsible for supplying a new tractor to the school and that, failing to do so, has been the cause of the fire. Mr. Card asked if the Department would supply a new tractor for his school, and he was informed that the purchase of a new tractor was not the responsibility of Indian Affairs Branch, that such replacements are regular expenses of an Indian Residential School, for which the school is being paid a per capita grant.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 6)\nWith regard to driving an overheated tractor into the barn, I do not need to point out to the Department that this was highly improper and unsafe. If a school boy took it upon himself to drive the tractor into the barn to keep it warm through the night, I have no doubt that it had been a common practice. Also if a school boy was operating the tractor for crushing feed or sawing wood without supervision of an adult member of the school staff, that, also, was definitely wrong.\n\nThere is no doubt that a request will be coming from Reverend Mr. Card for the Department to pay the cost of repairing the barn. Unless Mr. Serley's report indicates that the newspaper report is very inaccurate, I do not think that the public should bear the expense of repairing the barn which was built, at the expense of the public, only four months ago.\n\nI wonder if the church authorities will still be quite satisfied with the present management at the school, now that they have lost about \u00a34,000 worth of their cattle through what looks like mismanagement and neglect.\n\nJ.P.B.

The tractor had been sawing wood and the farm manager, Mr. Myles Hoggarth, was taking a truck load of wood to the school. The tractor was driven by Ronald George, a pupil aged 14. He drove the tractor into the barn and shut off the fuel and walked to the other end of the barn; he heard it sputter and then saw a flash and immediately the straw near the tractor burst into flames. The boy ran to the school and got the farm manager who was in the kitchen, and with additional help they put out the fire with extinguishers and water. To prevent draft the doors were kept closed; this made it difficult for the firefighters to gain inside for any length of time. Mr. John Swanson who was cutting ice on Round Lake came with his tractor and pulled the burning tractor from the barn. When the fire was extinguished it was found the cattle had suffocated.\n\nThirteen cows, one bull, two heifers and four calves died. One front tire of the tractor was burned and both rear tires damaged, the magneto was also burned. The damage to the building consisted of practically all the electric wiring, the west end of the building, ceiling and stalls badly scorched, fifty-seven panes of glass 10\" X 12\" were cracked or broken.\n\nIt is probable that a backfire ignited the straw and the heat from this burst the sediment bulb intensifying the flames and eventually spreading to the fuel tank which further increased its intensity.\n\nI consider that this was gross neglect and lack of supervision on the part of the school Principal. The tractor should not have been kept in the barn as there are other buildings which could have been utilized for this purpose. Straw should not have been allowed to accumulate around the tractor. While Mr. Card told me the tractor had been used twice a week for chopping grain and cutting wood, it would seem that one full day per week would be sufficient.\n\nI do not feel that the electric wiring should be replaced or the building repaired at this time. Unless there is a change in management I would recommend that this school be closed. I would further recommend that the cultivated land be leased this spring and the day schools built as soon as possible.\n\nMr. Card denied giving an interview to any newspaper reporter. The only reports were to myself and the R.C.M.P. He emphatically denied stating that he had asked the Indian Affairs Branch for a new tractor. The newspaper report was sent in by Mr. Earl Statesbury of the adjacent Bird's Point resort who was formerly an Editor in Estevaney.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRegina, March 23rd, 1950.\n\nWith further reference to my letter to the Department of the 17th instant, File 668-108/6-1-661, regarding the fire in the barn at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, enclosed is report of Indian Superintendent W.J.D. Kerley, from which negligence on the part of the school staff is noted.\n\nIt will be noted Mr. Kerley does not recommend repairing the building at this time, or replacement of the wiring unless there is a change in the school management. Further, it will be noted Mr. Kerley recommends that the cultivated land be leased this spring, as the school will have no tractor for operations. I might point out here, also, that the manner in which the land has been farmed in the past has not resulted in much income to the school.\n\nI would particularly refer the Department to the last paragraph of Mr. Kerley's report wherein he states Mr. Card denied giving an interview to any newspaper reporter. I regret to say I do not believe this, as only Mr. Card would know that he had asked me to ask the Department to supply the school with a new tractor. He gave as his reason for thinking that the Department should supply a tractor, the fact that, having lost a quantity of fuel wood as the result of the fire which destroyed the former barn, he was forced to replenish the fuel supply with funds which otherwise might have been used to buy a new tractor. However, I told him I would not recommend it. Regarding Mr. Card's emphatic denial that he had asked the Department for a new tractor, this may be true, in a sense, but he did ask me to ask the Department for one.\n\nJ.P.B.

With reference to the above date, telephone call was received from the Rev. J.A. GARD, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, Round Lake, Sask., to the effect that there had been a fire in the barn and that it had apparently been started from a spark in the tractor, which was stored in the barn.\n\n2. In view of the fact, that a fire had been started by one of the boys on the 13-5-49 at which time the barn had been completely destroyed. The above information was transmitted to Sgt. Parsons, Yorkton Sub-Div., H.Q., and he advised that Cpl. Symonds would contact the writer on the following date.\n\n16-3-50:\n\n3. This date patrol was made via P.O. #8668 to Stockholm, Sask., where the writer was contacted by Cpl. Symonds, patrol then continued to the Round Lake Dist., and subsequent investigation made.\n\n4. The barn in question is 60 ft in length by 20 ft. wide, and housed the milch cows & work horses used by the mission.\n\n5. Investigation disclosed a large area of scorched wood on the ceiling and walls at the rear or west end of the structure. There was no sign of any burning on the floor and the burning portion on the walls was approx. three feet from the floor level, indicating that the flames had flashed upward. Fire damage to the structure had been of a superficial nature and the barn does not appear to be structurally weakened, as a result of this fire.\n\n6. Approx. 20 head of cattle were overcome by the smoke from the burning tractor. Total Damage incurred by the fire is approx. $5,000.00\n\n7. Apparently during the cold weather, the tractor has been stored in the rear of the barn to facilitate easier starting of same. The tractor in question is an old Model John Deere machine and was used by the school for instruction of the pupils in proper farming methods. And was used by several of the older boys.\n\n8. On the day of the fire the tractor was operated by one Ronald GEORGE (Age 14) at the end of the day he had driven the tractor into the front of the barn and parked it at the rear near the rear door.\n\nCont'd on Page 2-\nThe following is a copy of statement received from Donald George (T.I.).\n\nI am 14 years of age and attend Round Lake Indian Residential School. I have been here for five years. Last fall I started driving one of the tractors at the school. Yesterday March 15th, 1950 we were sawing wood with the tractor. At about 4:00 p.m. we quit and I drove the tractor into the barn. The tractor had been running steady for about one hour sawing wood and was hot. The water in the radiator was boiling. I drove the tractor in the east door and through the barn and stopped just inside the door on the west end. I shut the throttle off and also the gas. The tractor engine stopped almost immediately. It turned over a few times, but was completely stopped by the time I was off the seat and about two or three yards away. I started to leave the barn by the east door. Just as I got to the door I turned to pull the door shut and just as I had pulled the door a couple of feet I noticed flames from the tractor. They appeared to be coming from underneath the gas tank and were shooting up on the left side of the tank. At that time the flame was about as high as the gas tank itself. There were no flames from the right side of the tank or the tractor. I left the door as it was and ran to the residence and yelled that there was a fire on the tractor. Mr. Myles Hoggarth, the farm manager and Murray Wilson, the engineer and some others were having lunch in the kitchen. They all ran to the barn to help fight the fire and to get the stock out of the barn. I was not smoking yesterday when I put the tractor in the barn and did not have any matches in my pockets. As a matter of fact I haven't had a smoke since Xmas holidays. I believe the fire started from a spark from a spark plug or the wiring. There was quite a bit of gas leaking from the glass bowl underneath the gas tank. This gas used to drip and run down the pipe to the carburetor and then drip down on the side of the engine near the spark plug. This same tractor caught on fire last fall when I was one-waying in the field. The fire started that time underneath the carburetor on the left side. I jumped off the tractor and threw some dirt on the blaze which was only about five or six inches high and put it out. Albert MacArthur was fixing fence about a mile away and I went and got him to start the tractor for me. I told him about the tractor catching on fire, but didn't tell the farm manager as he was on Xmas holidays at the time. This tractor is a John Deere and is quite old. There has always been a leak near the glass bowl under the tank ever since I have been driving the tractor and the side of the engine was most always wet with gas under the carburetor. After I notified the men of the fire I went back to the barn with them and helped them fight fire. I carried water and caught a team of horses which we were going to use to pull the tractor out of the barn, however they got another tractor and pulled it out of with that.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Some were milch cows & some heifers and one bull.\n\nSGD: Ronald GEORGE.\n\n10. Myles HOGARTH the farm manager was interviewed in this connection and the following statement obtained.\n\nSTATION OF: Myles HOGARTH, Farm Manager, Round Lake Indian Residential School, Round Lake, Sask.\n\nB.G.MS.: I have been employed as farm manager at the Round Lake Indian Residential School since Nov. 1st, 1949.\n\nOn Wed. March 15th., 1950 I was employed with my duties around the farm yard. Five of the boys were sawing wood during the afternoon. About 4:00 p.m. the boys quit sawing wood. I saw Ronald GEORGE leave the sawing outfit with the tractor preparatory to putting it in the barn.\n\nI went to the kitchen in the meantime and was having lunch when Ronald GEORGE came in & stated the tractor was afire. I think I had only been indoors approx. five minutes when young GEORGE came in and informed me of the fire.\n\nI went immediately to the barn and began to fight fire. We pulled the tractor out through the back door and away from the barn with another tractor. Most of the fire appeared to be on the tractor. We put it out with chemical extinguishers.\n\nTwenty head of cattle including a bull were overcome by smoke.\n\nThe tractor in question is an old model, approx. 11 years old. It was a John Deere Model AR. This tractor needed considerable repairing before spring work could be commenced with it.\n\nRonald GEORGE has never mentioned to me that the tractor caught fire in the field with him one day.\n\nThe sediment bowl on the tractor did leak at one time, but was repaired around Christmas time. I had not noticed it leaking lately, but possibly it could have leaked and I did not notice it.\n\nSGD: Myles F. HOGARTH.\n\n11. In interviewing HOGARTH it appeared that this man did not understand the workings of a tractor and had very little mechanical experience and it is thought quite possible that the engine was leaking gas from the sediment bowl and that HOGARTH did not notice it.\n\n12. Rev. J.A. CARD was also interviewed, but could give no further information in regards to the fire.\n\nCont'd on Page -4-.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Also it was learned that on that model tractor, unless the petcocks on the sides of the cylinders are opened this could also cause a fire.\n\nIn view of the foregoing it is thought that the fire herein is of purely accidental nature and no further police action is considered necessary.\n\nExtra copies attached for the information of Dept's concerned.\n\nCONCLUDED HERE:\n\nCst.

(16-50) This date whilst investigating re: Round Lake Indian Residential School - accidental burning of barn, Round Lake Dist., Sask. (Please refer to Hesterhazy Detachment report dated 10-50), it was brought to the attention of the Writer & Cst.G.W.Tyler that the above school was considered a fire trap and unsafe to be used as a residential school for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The wiring is very old, faulty and bare in a number of places.\n\n(b) The heating system is antiquated and not considered safe, particularly when the steam firing is being done by an unskilled engineer (ref. para 14 of report referred to in para (1) herein).\n\n(c) Discipline appears to be lax and the 60 Indian children housed in this structure apparently have little or no training in fire prevention and the action to take in case of fire.\n\n(d) The building in question is very old and of frame construction and would afford very little chance for small children to escape in case of fire.\n\nInformant in this regard is very concerned regarding the children housed in this school. He advises that at the time the barn first burned, on 15-45, this building was condemned by the provincial Authorities; however, same has continued to be used without any action being taken concerning any of the fire hazards for which the building was condemned. Subject stated that on a recent visit to the school he had noted an open container part full of hi-test gasoline sitting on the floor of a store room and in the adjacent room Indian children were doing the laundry. He advised that it was a well known fact that the Indian boys smoked whenever the opportunity afforded itself. He added that the basement of the school was littered with trash and inflammable material, consisting of parts of cases of paint, newspapers etc., which had accumulated in the basement over a period of years. Informant also stated that the last 20 or 30 Indian children to arrive at the school had never participated in fire drill at the time of his visit.\n\n2. The informant wished the police to take some action herein as he felt that the school should be closed or re-built and fire-proofed. He was advised that same would be reported and brought to the attention of the authorities concerned.\n\n3. This matter is reported for record purposes and for whatever action is deemed necessary.

Parrie, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Resources & Development,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe above school was visited on March 23rd by Indian Agent Kerley, D. G. N. Morrison and myself. Mr. Kerley was most anxious that we visit this school and note its general condition.\n\nThe school is operated by the W.M.S. of the United Church of Canada with Rev. Card as principal. There are only 62 pupils in attendance.\n\nThe main portion of the school building was constructed about 50 years ago and additions have been made since that time, although none of these have been built within the last 30 years. The building is of frame construction throughout - and is in very poor condition. Externally, numerous windows are broken out, the roof sags, the wooden shingles on the roof are poor, the concrete work in the foundations and steps is cracked and doors to the outside entrances to the basement are off their hinges. Internally, while for the most part the school seemed clean, many things are outdated or in poor condition. In a bathroom, in the boys' dormitory, the floor has been partially removed to facilitate some plumbing repairs but has not been relaid. In the boys' playroom, the water and heat has been shut off as the room could not be kept warm due to broken windowpanes and drafty doors. There were numerous places throughout the building where the plaster was falling from the wall.\n\nIn all parts of the building, the great fire hazard is most noticeable. Evidence of a fire having started in the boiler room wall can be seen. Only extremely prompt action could prevent a catastrophe.\nin this room. A new boiler has been installed within the last year or two but the feed door is warped preventing its locking. This is done by a wooden pole which is propped against the door from the woodpile immediately in front of the boiler.\n\nThe fire escapes (fireman type) are accessible through windows. The school is lighted by a 32 volt Delco plant which is housed in a small shed, some 75 feet from the main building. In this building we found an uncovered pail of gasoline, beside a stove which showed signs of having been burning earlier in the day. A new set of batteries has recently been purchased for this lighting plant. At several places in the wiring throughout the building, somewhere connections had fused.\n\nThe outbuildings with the exception of the barn appear in a run-down condition. The granaries are leaning in all directions with doors partially off their hinges; the fences are in poor shape and the electric wires carrying power to the barn and pig pen are about six feet above the ground.\n\nThe barn, which was constructed last year, was partially destroyed by fire about six weeks ago. The fire originated from a tractor which was stored in the barn in cold weather. About 75% of the electric wiring in the barn will have to be replaced, but there is very little damage to the barn itself. This building is in good condition. Fire extinguishers from the school were used to extinguish the fire in the barn. They were taken to Whiteswood to be recharged. Although they had been ready for 2 or 3 days, no one from the school had taken them out.\n\nThe fire hazard at this school should be definitely checked by a fire inspector, as I am of the opinion the building is unsafe. From the age and the general run-down condition of the school, it would appear quite reasonable that the school be closed immediately.\n\nThe only redeeming feature of the school is its location. The buildings are on a shelf on the north side overlooking Round Lake, which is approximately 300 feet distant. The land slopes gradually down to the lake affording excellent drainage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. J. Kerr\nEngineering and Construction Service\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pertinent extracts are as follows:\n\n\"Subject stated that on a recent visit to the school he had noted an open container part full of hi-test gasoline sitting on the floor of a store room and in the adjacent room Indian children were doing the laundry. He advised that it was a well known fact that the Indian boys smoked whenever the opportunity afforded itself. He added that the basement of the school was littered with trash and inflammable material, consisting of part full cans of paint, rags, etc., which had accumulated in the basement over a period of years.

Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 9th wherein you set forth certain proposals relating to the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information would say that for some time past I have been rather concerned with the particular problem that the operation of this school has presented. As stated in your letter, I have been fully aware of the poor management in evidence.\n\nMy first comment would be that in view of the fact that the school term is almost completed and also the fact that the weather is much warmer, which would naturally necessitate less heating of the building, I believe it would be wise to work out some scheme whereby school could be kept open until the end of June. The way this could be done would be to appoint a night watchman full time for the next two months and then we would be sure that no fire or calamity would befall the inmates. Should this proposal be received kindly, I would at this time recommend Thomas Miskiman of Broadview, whom your Agent in that area could contact and put to work for this particular job.\n\nI am quite in accord with your views as expressed regarding the appointment of an educational survey committee to review the facts at hand in regard to this school. My own views of course are that as soon as conveniently possible that it is wise to do away with all residential schools and get down to a day school basis. In the experience that I have had and advice from those working closely with Indians, I am inclined to believe that day schools are one of the basic solutions to the Indian problem. I quite agree that many more isolated areas...\nrequire the residential type of school but for general purposes, I cannot too strongly urge the doing away with of residential schools.\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing therefore, I would suggest that no time be lost in getting your board established and a decision arrived at. Should the committee decide in favour of the day schools, these will have to be built some time during the summer so that the children do not have to suffer, all haste is necessary to get this project started.\n\nTrusting that these observations are of service and assuring you of my continued interest,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAustin E. Dewar,\nM. P. for Qu'Appelle.\nto the attached letter dated May 11th from Mr. Austin E. Dewar, M.P., concerning certain proposals relating to the Round Lake Indian Residential School.

W. Perrie, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Resources & Development,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe above school was visited on March 23rd by\nIndian Agent Kerley, D. G. N. Morrison and myself. Mr. Kerley\nwas most anxious that we visit this school and note its\ngeneral condition.\n\nThe school is operated by the W.M.S. of the United\nChurch of Canada with Rev. Card as principal. There are only\n62 pupils in attendance.\n\nThe main portion of the school building was\nconstructed about 50 years ago and additions have been made since\nthat time, although none of these have been built within the\nlast 30 years. The building is of frame construction throughout -\nand is in very poor condition. Externally, numerous windows are\nbroken out, the roof sags, the wooden shingles on the roof are\npoorly fitted, concrete work in the foundations and steps is cracked\nand doors to the outside entrances to the basement are off their\nhinges. Internally, while for the most part the school seemed\nclean, many things are out-dated or in poor condition. In a\nbathroom, off the boys' dormitory, the floor has been partially\nremoved to facilitate some plumbing repairs but has not been\nreplaced. In the boys' playroom, the water and heat has been\nshut off as the room could not be kept warm due to broken window-\npanes and drafty doors. There were numerous places throughout\nthe building where the plaster was falling from the wall.\n\nIn all parts of the building, the great fire\nhazard is most noticeable. Evidence of a fire having started in\nthe boiler room wall can be seen. Only extremely prompt action\ncould prevent a catastrophe in this room. A new boiler has\nbeen installed within the last year or two but the feed door is\nwarped preventing its locking. This is done by a wooden pole\nwhich is propped against the door from the woodpile immediately\nin front of the boiler. The fire escapes (fireman type) are accessible through windows. The school is lighted by a 32 volt Delco plant which is housed in a small shed, some 75 feet from the main building. In this building we found an uncovered pail of gasoline, beside a stove which showed signs of having been burning earlier in the day. A new set of batteries has recently been purchased for this lighting plant. At several places in the wiring throughout the building, we saw where connections had fused.\n\nThe outbuildings with the exception of the barn appear in a run-down condition. The granaries are leaning in all directions with doors partially off their hinges; the fences are in poor shape, and the electric wires carrying power to the barn and pig pen are about six feet above the ground.\n\nThe barn, which was constructed last year, was partially destroyed by fire about six weeks ago. The fire originated from a tractor which was stored in the barn in cold weather. About 75% of the electric wiring in the barn will have to be replaced, but there is very little damage to the barn itself. This building is in good condition. Fire extinguishers from the school were used to extinguish the fire in the barn. They were taken to Whitewood to be recharged. Although they had been ready for 2 or 3 days, no one from the school had taken them out.\n\nThe fire hazard at this school should be definitely checked by a fire inspector, as I am of the opinion the building is unsafe. From the age and the general run-down condition of the school, it would appear quite reasonable that the school be closed immediately.\n\nThe only redeeming feature of the school is its location. The buildings are on a shelf on the north side overlooking Round Lake, which is approximately 300 feet distant. The land slopes gradually down to the lake affording excellent drainage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. J. Kerr,\nEngineering and Construction Service.\nOttawa, May 30, 1950.\n\nAustin E.

We took action immediately and told Mr. Card that his services would terminate on June 30th.\n\nAs far as the condition of the School is concerned, you may recall that we have been requesting a new School for 15 years, knowing that the present one was in poor condition. While no steps were taken toward building, we always received encouragement and we were definitely told that the building of the Round Lake School was high on the list of new buildings.\n\nWhile we have accepted responsibility for the staff and we know the condition of Mr. Card's health, we understood that the supervision of the School was under the Department of Indian Affairs and if the school buildings are in such poor condition, we should have been made aware of this by those who have been supervising.\n\nWhile we believe in the Day School Program, we cannot overlook the fact that our schools are being closed too quickly and our constituency will not accept the closing of Round Lake without protest.\n\nFrom last September until February, the children were\nwithout schools at File Hills and again at Round Lake these children would be without any supervision of schooling if the school were closed in June.\n\nI am writing Dr. Dorey, who is now in Saskatoon, and trust that you may hear again from him in the course of a few days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. C.

W. Perrie, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nDepartment of Resources & Development,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School,\n\nThe above school was visited on March 23rd by Indian Agent Kerley, D. G. N. Morrison and myself. Mr. Kerley was most anxious that we visit this school and note its general condition.\n\nThe school is operated by the U.M.C. of the United Church of Canada with Rev. Card as principal. There are only 62 pupils in attendance.\n\nThe main portion of the school building was constructed about 50 years ago and additions have been made since that time, although none of these have been built within the last 30 years. The building is of frame construction throughout and is in very poor condition. Externally, numerous windows are broken out, the roof sags, the wooden shingles on the roof are poor, the concrete work in the foundations and steps is cracked and due to the weather expansion joints have opened and their hinges. Internally, while for the most part the school seems clean, many things are out-dated or in poor condition. In a bathroom, off the boys' dormitory, the floor has been partially removed to facilitate some plumbing repairs but has not been relaid. In the boys' playroom, the water and heat has been shut off as the room could not be kept warm due to broken window-panes and drafty doors. There were numerous places throughout the building where the plaster was falling from the wall.\n\nIn all parts of the building, the great fire hazard is most noticeable. Evidence of a fire having started in the boiler room wall can be seen. Only extremely prompt action could prevent a catastrophe in this room. A new boiler has been installed within the last year or two but the feed door is warped preventing its locking. This is done by a wooden pole which is propped against the door from the woodpile immediately\nin front of the boiler. The fire escapes (fireman type) are accessible through windows. The school is lighted by a 32 volt Belco plant which is housed in a small shed, some 75 feet from the main building. In this building we found an uncovered pail of gasoline, beside a stove which showed signs of having been burning earlier in the day. A new set of batteries has recently been purchased for this lighting plant. At several places in the wiring throughout the building, we saw where connections had fused.\n\nThe outbuildings with the exception of the barn appear in a run-down condition. The granaries are leaning in all directions with doors partially off their hinges; the fences are in poor shape, and the electric wires carrying power to the barn and pig pen are about six feet above the ground.\n\nThe barn, which was constructed last year, was partially destroyed by fire about six weeks ago. The fire originated from a tractor which was stored in the barn in cold weather. About 75% of the electric wiring in the barn will have to be replaced, but there is very little damage to the barn itself. This building is in good condition. Fire extinguishers from the school were used to extinguish the fire in the barn. They were taken to Whitewood to be recharged. Although they had been ready for 2 or 3 days, no one from the school had taken them out.\n\nThe fire hazard at this school should be definitely checked by a fire inspector, as I am of the opinion the building is unsafe. From the age and the general run-down condition of the school, it would appear quite reasonable that the school be closed immediately.\n\nThe only redeeming feature of the school is its location. The buildings are on a shelf on the north side overlooking Round Lake, which is approximately 300 feet distant. The land slopes gradually down to the lake affording excellent drainage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. J. Kerr,\nEngineering and Construction Service.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Kerr, following a recent inspection made at the above school.\n\nIt will be noted that this inspection was made at the request of Superintendent Kerley while Messrs. Kerr and Morrison were engaged on other Indian affairs work in the vicinity of the Round Lake School.\n\nW. W. Perrie,\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nEnc.\n\nMr. C. V. N.

I have sent it over to Mr. Loney as his school is operated by the Roman Catholic Society. I have asked Mr. Loney to give the whole matter his immediate consideration and as I shall be in the West until the end of June to take the necessary action.\n\nTwo things give me the greatest concern:\n\n1. That Pound Lake is the closest immediately and that it would seem that it is not to be opened as a Residential School. It had been hoped that it might continue its operation with a person in charge who might affect the transition in an orderly fashion as was the case at Duncan. They also pointed out that our experience would indicate that there is only the slightest possibility of school accommodation being available within a year. In the meantime the children will have nowhere to go and under such circumstances I cannot base any further experience that other religious bodies will enter their children into other schools.\n\n2. On Friday last I had a talk with Rev. J. Murray of Edmonton, Mr. Gooderham and Mr. Robertson. It seems clear that the time of our departure is September. The attendance at Edmonton...\nBoard of Home Missions\nThe United Church of Canada\n\n289 QUEEN ST. WEST\nTORONTO 2 B. ONTARIO\n\nwill not likely be more than 80 or 50% capacity. Under such circumstances we cannot operate without a serious loss. To discontinue certain localities such as... turning the school over to the medical service... bringing the stories who are without accommodation and for whom it is proposed to build an addition at Norley. This latter does not seem as hopeful or feasible as it might appear to be logical.\n\nMy great concern is that the constituency which our Board represents will rebel against closing any more schools operated by Protestant Churches while every school operated by the Roman Catholic Church is filled and in some cases with our children.\n\nAs far as our Board is concerned we believe in the Day School programme intelligently applied but we cannot overlook the fact that too many of our supporters it looks like selling our children down the river - We should not be asked to go too fast or too far in a hurry.\n\nMay I point out that the day home school which we need and which cannot be replaced by Day Schools has now been out of existence 6 years - We have suffered from the lack of this school. I hope dear that a start is being made at rebuilding this season.\n\nAs soon as possible I shall visit Toronto to discuss this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is our intention to appoint one of the officials of the Education Division to this committee and to request the Department of Education in Saskatchewan to appoint a third member.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe officials of the Education Division of the Indian Affairs Branch have proposed that a thorough educational survey be made of the Indian reservations which are served by the Round Lake and the Cowessess Indian Residential Schools. It has been suggested that this survey be made by a committee set up for the purpose in order to determine the educational facilities required for all the children of school age.\n\nIt is our intention to appoint one representative from the Education Division of the Indian Affairs Branch to this educational survey committee. While the Round Lake Residential School is being considered, a representative of the United Church of Canada will sit on the committee. While the Cowessess Residential School is being considered, a representative of the Roman Catholic Church will sit on the committee.\n\nIn order that we may obtain as complete a report as possible, it has been recommended that the third member of the committee be an inspector of schools or official of the Department of Education of the Province of Saskatchewan. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you would advise us as to whether you could appoint such an official to assist in the proposed survey. If this is possible, we would prefer an inspector or official such as Dr. Buck who has had previous wide experience in inspecting Indian schools.\n\nIt is felt that this survey could be carried out in August and will probably be completed by the committee in two\nweeks' time. We would of course be prepared to pay the travelling expenses of this official and to pay for his professional services.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, July 4, 1950.\n\nMrs. C. Maxwell Loveys,\nHome Mission Executive Secretary,\nThe Woman's Missionary Society of\nThe United Church of Canada,\n412-413 Wesley Buildings,\nToronto 2B, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. Loveys:\n\nI have delayed replying to your letter of June 2 concerning the Round Lake Residential School until I had an opportunity of further discussing this matter with Dr. Dorey.\n\nIt is our intention to establish an educational survey committee as previously outlined in my letter of April 27, addressed to Dr. Dorey.\n\nWe will expect to hear from you in the near future with a nomination of one of your officials who would serve on this committee while it is performing its duties on the Round Lake Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, July 5, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRound Lake Indian Residential School\nCowessess Indian Residential School\n\nAs you are aware from previous correspondence, the Round Lake Residential School has deteriorated considerably during the past few years and we have contemplated the necessity of closing this institution.\n\nThis matter was referred to Mr. Austin N. Dewar, M.P., with the recommendation that we establish an educational survey committee to review all the facts already obtained concerning the proposal to replace this residential school with day schools. His reply was in the affirmative and I have therefore prepared the attached letter, addressed to the Deputy Minister of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nYou are also aware of the reasons for including in this survey the nearby Cowessess Residential School, operated by the Roman Catholic Church. I believe that Mr. Dewar has informed the Minister as to the advisability of including both these schools in the proposed survey.\n\nTo summarize, therefore, we would establish two educational survey committees composed as follows:\n\n1. Round Lake Residential School:\n   (a) A nominee of the Indian Affairs Branch,\n   (b) A nominee of the Department of Education, Province of Saskatchewan,\n   (c) A nominee of the United Church of Canada.\n2. Cowessess Residential School:\n\n(a) A nominee of the Indian Affairs Branch,\n(b) A nominee of the Department of Education,\nProvince of Saskatchewan,\n(c) A nominee of Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIt is felt that in this way all sides will be heard and we can then place before the Minister a firm educational policy which can be followed on these two reserves. The 1944 census shows the following population:\n\n| Reserve       | United Church | Roman Catholic |\n|---------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Cowessess     | 25            | 381            |\n| Kehkewistahaw | 160           | 48             |\n| Ochapownee    | 131           | 26             |\n\nActing Director.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, July 5, 1950.\n\nA.

Kerley, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nMy dear Mr. Kerley:\n\nUnder separate cover there are going forward to you maps, specially printed on white paper of the following reserves:\n\nNo. 71 Ochepowase\nNo. 72 Kekewistahsw\nNo. 72A Kekewistahsw\nNo. 73 Cowessess\nNo. 74 Skimay\n\nThese are for use by the educational survey committee which is to inquire into educational needs on these reserves some time this autumn, in August, I hope.\n\nThere is very little detail on these maps and there appears to be a lot of preliminary work necessary on them in order to show the following:\n\n- Existing and proposed roads.\n- Existing and proposed power lines.\n- Existing and possible sources of water supply.\n- Existing Indian schools.\n- Provincial schools within walking distance.\n- Home-locations coloured to show whether the denominational affiliation is Catholic, non-Catholic or aboriginal.\n- The band number of the head of the house.\n- The quality of the land for economic purposes.\n\nYou are probably aware of the proposed composition of the committee which is:\n\n...\n(a) A Branch official\n(b) A provincial education official\n(c) A representative of the denomination concerned.\n\nThere will, therefore, likely be two committees, each deliberating on those school matters with which each of the two larger denominations is concerned. It may be possible, however, for the travelling and exploration to be done by all the members of the committee together so as to save the time of certain officials, but this consideration is at the option of the ecclesiastical members of the committee.\n\nThe duration of the sittings, travelling, hearings, etc., will depend upon the completeness of the information available from recently prepared maps, statistics and reports, and the number of persons who wish to be heard by the committee(s). We must try to avoid any long procession of Indian individuals who desire to make representations, and at the same time avoid being influenced by petitions, signed by many although engineered by only a few.\n\nIn surveys conducted elsewhere by the Department white residents of the area have offered or been invited to give their views especially when such persons have a professional or official political relation to local education such as inspectors or trustees.\n\nCertain accommodation and conveniences are necessary. The committee members will probably prefer the hotel at Whitewood. In default of a recording device, a shorthand writer will be desirable at several sessions. A place for the committee to meet in privacy will be necessary\u2014a place furnished sufficiently to permit a few visitors at a time. Transportation will, of course, be required. Favourable weather is something for which we shall hope, and we shall hope also not to disturb unduly the ordinary business of the agency which is probably great enough at this season.\n\nReverend Father Piche of Qu'Appelle school is already designated as a member of the committee and the ecclesiastical authorities of the area are all probably aware of the intended survey. It would seem in order, therefore, to acquaint the Chiefs and Councillors with what is intended, although the dates have still to be determined.\n\nC.A.F.

The explanation given was that the children were at home helping their parents. To my mind this excuse is not sufficient. It is most unusual to find 25% of the children enrolled at home, and I understand it is without the consent of the Department or the Resident agent. I would advise that the Principal be instructed to get the children in at once, and in future to get authority before letting them go home. Otherwise this practice will become a great nuisance and a hindrance to the\n\n[Stamp]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school is fortunate in having a fine class of students.\n\n3. The log building, in which is situated the living quarters of the girls, the staff, and the kitchen and dining room, is a very old building and very dilapidated, as has been already reported. Much of the furniture is broken and it is difficult to make the place look right. The boys' dormitory is in an equally bad condition, hardly fit for further use.\n\nI found the climate to be agreeable. You will remember I have before complained about the condition of the school. The principal is altogether too careless about matters of this kind.\n\n4. The surroundings of the school are in bad condition, especially the stables, and I would find fault even with an Indian if he allowed his premises to get into such shape. It was noted when I made my visit to the stables and I found they had not been cleaned and the animals were standing in a litter several inches deep. Attached to the stables is an old log building half fallen down, in which there were a number of pigs, a most unsightly place and a poor example to Indians. The yard too presented a poor example for Indians, and on the whole the place is far from what a training school should be.\n\n5. The land farm consists of 175 acres of land, of which 100 acres was in crop this year. Seventy acres produced 2,000 bushels; 30 acres, 2,000 bushels; 10 acres, 500 bushels. There are seventy head of cattle owned.\nby the Institution, twenty of these are kept at\nthe school and fifty elsewhere.\n\nOver a year ago some five carloads of lumber\nwas brought out to the school, none of it very\nfine flooring and siding. This has been piled very\ncarelessly and in most cases just thrown off the\nloads and in consequence of being exposed to the\nweather it is badly warped and in bad shape\ngenerally. It is hard to understand why the lumber\nwas not piled up properly in the first place and\nhow people do stand by and see hundreds of dollars\nworth of material going to waste. I instructed\nMr. Bailey to have it replated and covered. This,\nof course, is Church property, but nevertheless it should\nnot be allowed to go to waste.\n\nI understand that the teacher employed at\nthis school last year was not very competent. The\nwork in the class work was not anything like as\nadvanced as I found it on previous occasions. At\npresent any Indian boy, Fred Bailey, is teaching. He\nhad been in charge only a few days, and consequently\nI cannot say much about his work.\n\nEconomically the school is in good condition.\nWhen the grant for the quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1915,\nis received there will be a credit balance after\npaying all outstanding accounts.\n\nMr. Bailey does not reside at the school but is\nliving on his own farm which adjoins the school\nproperty.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I regret to say that I found general conditions about the school proper in very poor shape. The building, as you know, is in a most dilapidated condition and has been in this shape for several years. It has been going from bad to worse until it has got to such a state that it is really unfit for the purpose for which it was intended.\n\n2. A description of the boys' dormitory would not be out of place. The room is situated in a detached building over the class-room. The walls and ceiling are dirty and the floor worn out in places. The paint which was on the floor at one time has almost disappeared. The beds are old iron ones with the enamel worn off. In almost every case the springs are badly broken and many of them are for beds of a different make, so that the frames are projecting over the sides of the beds. Each is supplied with four or five patchwork quilts, between which the boys sleep.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn the centre of the room is a small old sheet iron stove (a most dangerous affair), which supplies the heat for the whole room. The whole dormitory presents a very unkept and dismal appearance; in fact, it is not fit for habitation, and as for the beds and mattresses\u2014they should be destroyed. I noticed there were not sufficient beds in the dormitory and on making enquiries learned that in most cases two boys sleep in each single bed.\n\n3. The outside closets were as usual in a most disgraceful condition, not fit for animals, let alone human beings. You will remember that a few years ago a similar condition of affairs existed and we built new closets. These are now in the same state. To call such a place an example is absurd\u2014for better to have no closets.\n\n4. The girls' dormitories are in the residential portion of the school and the beds and furniture are in about the same condition as that in which I found the boys'.\n\n5. The air in the class-room was not fresh and I noticed a change for the worse since my last visit.\n\n6. The children, especially the boys, had a decidedly unkept appearance. The faces looked unwashed and in a great many cases their hair was long and looked as if a comb and brush were never used. The Church is making a mistake in allowing these children to be taught by an Indian boy, who has degenerated.\ndegenerated, and whose ideas are not exactly what should be instilled into Indian children.\n\n7. The stables are not what they should be in order to give a proper example to Indian boys.\n\n8. The work in the class-room has fallen away and the sooner a change is made the better it will be.\n\n9. I believe that these children are well fed, and I have always found this branch of the school work well managed.\n\n10. The whole institution presents a most dismal picture, and the sooner the Presbyterian Church takes action and replaces Mr. McKay the better it will be for the Indians and the work generally. I consider he is utterly unfit to handle this school. It was a great pity that when a change of Principals was made a few years ago that the Church did not insist on Mr. McKay keeping out of the work. I would strongly advise the Government and Church not to build a school if Mr. McKay is to have anything to do with it. The old man means well enough but he is not cut out for the work.\n\n11. On the farm last year was produced the following:\n\n| Crop   | Quantity |\n|--------|----------|\n| Wheat  | 1000 bushels |\n| Oats   | 200 \"     |\n| Barley | 100 \"     |\n| Potatoes | 100 \"    |\n\n12.

The pupils were clean and well dressed and tidy in appearance, reflecting great credit on Miss Munro, who is a very capable woman, and her two sisters, who comprise the rest of the inside staff.\n\n5. This school had a very successful farming season in 1916, the returns being as follows:\u2014\n   1700 bushels of No. I wheat\n   800 \" Barley\n   600 \" Oats.\nThey also had an ample supply of garden stuff. The wheat is still on hand and will be sold later on. The oats and barley will be fed to the stock.\n\n6. The school own 90 head of horned stock and 65 head of this number is kept at a ranch some miles away. The balance is looked after by the pupils under the direction of the farmer. The school has been fortunate in having a good man throughout the year. I was sorry to learn that he is leaving on April 1st.\n\n7. It is perhaps superfluous for me to refer to the dilapidated condition of the buildings at this point, as this matter has been reported on\non so often. Everything about the place is in bad shape. The interior furnishing of the dormitories is in very bad condition, but I must say I found everything scrupulously clean.\n\n8. Mr. McKay is particularly fortunate at this time in having capable people on his staff, but owing to the condition of the buildings and equipment they are laboring under great disadvantages.\n\n9.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBelcarres, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-6, part 1)\nRound Lake Boarding School\n\nI visited this school on the 8th. It is situated in the Qu'Appelle Valley at the east end of Round Lake just across the river from the Ochapowace reserve. It is under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. The Staff consists of the Principal, the Rev. Mr. Greer, Mrs. Ed. Garrett, teacher, Mr. Ed. Garrett, Farming Instructor, Miss N. Campbell, Matron, Mrs. C. Burgess, Assistant Matron, Mrs. Goth, Cook and Miss Handford, Laundress. At the time of my visit there were 68 children on the register comprising the following grades,\n\n| Standard | I. | II. | III. | IV. | VII. |\n|----------|----|-----|------|-----|------|\n|          | 26 | 7   | 15   | 19  | 68   |\n\nThe day of my visit there were only 51 present, 17 being absent on the reserve. Mr. Murison inspected this school on June 6th and 7th last year and in his report he gives a comprehensive description of the building and the equipment and at that time he recommended several changes in the lay-out of the school but to date no changes have been made. I must say that this is one of the worst managed institutions I have visited in an official capacity since I have been with the Department. To me it appeared like a ship on the ocean without a rudder, even the staff were quarrelling among themselves and are divided into two factions. The Principal is about to retire, therefore, there was no use of my finding fault with the management of the school as he\ninformed me that he did not intend to make any changes and that it would be up to the new Principal. Mr. Greer has been there since sometime last summer and from his conversation I gathered that he endeavoured to take steps to straighten this out when he first went there but met with opposition from some of the staff and as he had no authority to discharge them he threw up his hands and let things drift. You can imagine the lack of discipline at this institution. What the school needs is a first class principal, who will not be dictated to by outsiders and a man with some backbone and good common sense. There is so much at fault with both the building and the management that it is useless to criticize the institution from any one angle. I will just mention a few of the essential points.\n\nThe new Principal, I was advised, would arrive about the 6th of June, upon his arrival he should be properly instructed as to what is expected of him by the Department and several changes will have to be made in the staff as those who are there now certainly cannot work together. I learned that the Department contemplate making several changes in the building. Before this is done a competent engineer should examine the building. The dormitories are too small and too many children sleep in one room and most of the girls are sleeping two in a bed. The furnaces are too small to heat the buildings. The laundry is poorly equipped and is inadequate. The Girls'\ndormitories were fairly clean but the boys untidy and the bed clothes dirty. The children were fairly well clothed but untidy. The grounds around the buildings were untidy. No provision is made in the school for the isolation of any case of sickness.\n\nAt the time of my visit one girl was ill in the girls' dormitory. The supply of water for the school is taken from the lake and is pumped from there into a tank in the building. The water pipes were only put down 12\" under ground and this means that they freeze up every winter and a new set of pipes has to be purchased. The pump house with the engine was evidently stationed on the ice this winter, when the ice melted the pump house was not moved and is now half under water. The day I was there, Mr. Hillhouse, our Farming Instructor, was with me and he tried to pull the house ashore but had not sufficient power and unless they find some way of moving it they will be compelled to carry the water from the lake.\n\nThe work in the class rooms is very poor. Mrs. Garrett I presume would be a fair teacher in a small country school but the class she has is entirely too large for her. There is only one class room and the children attend so irregularly that their progress is very slow. The discipline in the school room is poor and it was difficult to hear what the children were saying. They would not speak up so they could be heard.\nJune 15th, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nCommissioner Graham has forwarded the report of Mr. Inspector Christianson on his inspection of the Round Lake Boarding School. The Commissioner may have discussed with you the conditions found to exist by Mr. Christianson.\n\nIt would be advisable, during your visit in the West, if you could arrange to inspect this school and enquire into the work being performed by the members of the staff, the discipline and any other matters requiring attention. You will be in a position to advise the new Principal in all matters connected with the work at the school.\n\nYou should enquire specially into the matter of the frequent leave of absence granted the pupils. In the past they were allowed home for indefinite periods on the most trivial pretext. The new Principal should discontinue this practice.\n\nCertain alterations are required to the steam heating plant and the Commissioner was requested to arrange for the visit of an expert to make suggestions as to the changes that are necessary. This matter is again being drawn to the attention of the Commissioner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRussell T.

When this report is received, we propose to make whatever changes are necessary without cost to the church authorities. I shall be pleased if you will attend to this matter at an early date.\n\nI hope that the new Principal will meet with every success, and that, when he has had time to become thoroughly acquainted with the work, the conditions complained of will be overcome and there will be a decided improvement in the work at this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The inspection was made by Mr. J.W. Smith, Provincial School Inspector.\n\nI may say that there is a second class room in this school now that can be used should the Department insist on a second room being opened. I provided for this when re-modeling the detached class room at Round Lake.\n\nI do not think the Principal, Mr. Ross, is giving satisfaction to the Advisory Board of the Presbyterian church here, and I doubt whether his services will be retained for any length of time, although I have no authority for saying so. However, two of the Committee were in the office yesterday and told me that they were not satisfied.

The lower room only is used at present. Heating system is satisfactory, sufficient light is provided, but the windows are placed on both sides of the class rooms. Inside is finished in wood instead of plaster.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the general management of the school and offer any suggestions for improvement he may wish to make.)\n\nMr. Ross, the principal, has charge of the institution. The class room teaching is conducted by Mrs. Ross.\n\nPupils are divided into two groups, one group attending the class room in the morning and the other in the afternoon. The group not in the class room is instructed in household and farm duties, etc.\n\nIn my opinion the efficiency of the school could be increased by:\n\n1. Having all children up to the age of twelve or thirteen years attend the school during the whole of the school day. The time before nine in the morning and after four in the afternoon should be sufficient for instruction in light household tasks, etc., for the younger children.\n\n2. By engaging another teacher to take charge of the junior classes. The class room work is much too heavy for one teacher.\n\nA few more of the larger sized desks for the use of the older pupils are required.\nOTTAWA, January 4, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, enclosing Inspector Smith's report on the Round Lake Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The subjects are well presented. A bright, capable lady. Miss Ross is principal of the school.\n\nSuggestions: In oral class work it would be well to strive for a good effort on the part of each pupil in answering questions. For this end, the raising of hands seems best. It is desirable that pupils should speak loud enough for the rest of the class to hear. In the reading lesson, whilst one pupil is reading, the others in the class should be following in their books. Continued stress should be placed on gathering the thought and expressing it naturally.\n\nREMARKS RELATIVE TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE PUPILS\n\nLower Room\u2014Grades III, IV, V, VI.\n\nClasses examined or heard:\n\nGrade VI, Arithmetic, good\u2014accurate and neat.\n\nV, Composition, fairly good power of expression.\n\nIV, Geography, fairly good knowledge.\n\nGrades III and IV, Reading, generally very fair\u2014pronunciation and expression need emphasis.\n\nGrades III and IV, Arithmetic, generally pretty good.\n\nAll Classes, Physical Training, fairly good\u2014Music and Drawing\u2014pretty good.\n\n[OVER]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe SECRETARY,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to make the following report on Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nROUND LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL:\n\nI visited this school on November 29 which is under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church with the Reverend J.A. Ross in charge as Principal and his wife who acts as Matron and teacher for the Junior classes. Miss Carruthers who has second class professional standing teaches the senior classes, Miss E.M. Quirk is cook, Mrs. S. McIntyre laundress and Mrs. S. Runacres seamstress. Mr. Philp has been engaged as farmer and his wife who is a graduate Nurse will take up the work of Nursing Matron when she arrives; they are expected at an early date.\n\nThere are seventy-two pupils enrolled forty one girls and thirty one boys, there were thirty four girls and twenty six boys present on the day of my visit, twelve were absent on account of sickness, three of these have attained the age of eighteen years. The pupils presented a fairly clean appearance. I found three girls sick in bed.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nCity.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwith chickenpox; there is no accommodation at this school for isolation in case of sickness and these children are sleeping in the same dormitory with the rest of the girl pupils, I commented on this and the Principal stated that the Doctor said that as the children had already come in contact with the disease it was possibly just as well that it should be permitted to run its course as no doubt they would get it anyway.\n\nBUILDINGS:\n\nThe school room which was a detached building was recently burned down together with all the desks and school equipment and classes are now being held in the play rooms, they have a few old desks, some with broken legs which are very inadequate and I found the children sitting on the lockers in the play room. Teaching under these conditions is a difficult matter and I would suggest that forty-eight single desks be supplied. They would be available later when class room accommodation is provided. The new portion of the main building is much brighter since it has been re-modelled, it does not however provide adequate accommodation for the pupilage and staff. They are very cramped for room. The septic tank has been giving excellent satisfaction, the laundry is too small to permit of installing proper laundry equipment, the facilities have been improved however by the installation of sett tubs and a hot water heater, a new chimney has also been built from the laundry to replace the old galvanized one and this has added considerably to the safety of the building from the danger of fire. The old portion of the school at the rear of the new addition is of very little use, it can only be described as a rookery, being cut up with small rooms and dark holes and corners, radiation was installed in this\nportion of the building when the new furnace was put in but it is found impossible to heat them and a heating stove has been placed in the sewing room. I think it would be a mistake to spend any money in trying to re-model this portion of the building, it would be better to tear it down and add to the main building, it will be necessary to provide class room accommodation and it appears to me that it would be better to add class rooms on to the main building rather than erect another separate school as the upstairs accommodation could be utilized to good advantage. The pumping and electric light installations have so far been giving good satisfaction. The water is pumped from a soakage well located at the edge of the Round Lake into a pressure tank in the school, it may be necessary to enlarge the reservoir so as to provide larger storage capacity for water.\n\nFARM:\n\nThe farm in connection with this school consists of half a section of land about half of which is in the valley, they raised this year 635 bushels of wheat and 750 bushels of oats. They had a large garden which provided an ample quantity of potatoes and vegetables for the requirements at the school. They have 51 head of cattle, 5 hogs and a small flock of poultry, they are milking 11 cows and are getting about 40 quarts of milk a day. This provides milk for porridge and tea as well as some to drink. I made enquiry into the food provided the children and it appears to be very satisfactory. For breakfast they have porridge with milk and sugar, bread and jam, tea with milk and sugar in it and milk for the smaller children. For dinner they have meat, two kinds of vegetables, pudding, bread and lard and tea. Their fare for supper is varied, macaroni and tomatoes, potatoes, bread and butter with peanut butter or jam. Their appearance would indicate that they are getting\nplenty of good wholesome food.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nI was informed that the Church have purchased the four hundred acres of land adjoining the school from the Reverend Doctor McKay, there is a good house on this land which will be used by the Principal as a residence when it becomes available which is expected very soon.\n\nCOWESSES BOARDING SCHOOL:\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church with the Reverend Father Carriere as Principal. The inside work of the school is managed by six Sisters of Charity, two of whom act as teachers. The Reverend Sister Saint Pierre Chrysologue is in charge of the boys' class room and the Reverend Sister Areenius in charge of the girls' class room, these Sisters have Quebec model school training. The first mentioned I am told was a teacher at the Normal school in Quebec for eight years. Their methods might not be considered up-to-date by a public school inspector but the progress being made in the class rooms by the pupils appeared very satisfactory to me, the children spoke up clearly and distinctly, were quick in answering questions and the discipline in the school room was excellent. There were 32 boys and 35 girls present on the date of my visit and they presented a clean and tidy appearance. There were seven children sick with measles, these were isolated from the rest of the pupils. The children receive plenty of exercise, games are indulged in as well as regular fire drill.\nThe school is a large brick building, it is well equipped with the necessary furniture, laundry equipment, etc., it is steam heated and lighted with electricity. As this school has already been described it is unnecessary to go into details again in this report.\n\nThe pupils receive an abundance of good wholesome food, they get all the milk they care to drink. They have 26 milch cows and were milking 12 at the time of my visit. I am told that the number of cows milking is never permitted to be less than ten.\n\nFARM AND GARDEN:\n\nThe farm stock consists of about 50 head of cattle, 16 horses, 52 pigs and a large flock of poultry. They had 150 acres in wheat which yielded 1500 bushels, 50 acres of oats, yielded 1500 bushels and 35 acres of barley yielded 600 bushels. They had a large garden which yielded over 500 bushels of potatoes and an ample supply of vegetables for their requirements. This school is well managed, and the pupils are well cared for.\n\nThis report is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Crooked Lake Agency which was made by Inspector Murison during the latter part of November.\n\nDealing with the Round Lake School the Inspector draws attention to the recent fire which destroyed the two new classrooms in connection with the school and points out that the classes are now being held under difficulties without desks or benches. I think probably the Department should consider the matter of furnishing a few desks until such time as it is decided what is to be done in regard to the erection of another classroom. My opinion is that when a class room is erected it should be one storey with two rooms, a plain building 28x45 or 46, with an entrance at either end, one for the senior and one for the junior classes. I believe a building such as we require could be erected for about six thousand dollars or maybe less. I mention this in order that an amount may be placed in the estimates if it is our duty to build this. You might advise me in this connection.\n\nInspector reports that the children are well fed and are getting an ample supply of milk daily, which is a good thing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., July 10th, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report of a visit which I made to the Round Lake and Cowessess Indian Boarding Schools when making my recent inspection of the Crooked Lakes Agency. The pupils were all absent on their holidays and I will, therefore, confine my remarks to the condition of the buildings and premises.\n\nROUND LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, with the Rev. R. J. Ross in charge as Principal. I am pleased to report that I found conditions very greatly improved since my last inspection in June one year ago. The main building has been re-painted outside, and the interior walls re-decorated. An additional pressure tank has been installed in connection with the water supply and the old cistern is now being used as well, for water storage in case of emergency. The Principal informs me that the system has been found quite satisfactory. The furnace boiler was cracked, owing to allowing the water to get too low, and the broken sections have had to be replaced. The repairs are on the ground but have not yet been put in place. The school was clean and tidy throughout.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthroughout. I was pleased with the appearance of the outside premises; the grounds were tidy and the wood has been sawn and neatly piled. The ground in front of the school has been cultivated and planted with potatoes and vegetables with a view to putting it in good condition for grass seed. There is a large vegetable garden which is being kept clean and free from weeds and presents a nice appearance. The indications are that they will have an ample supply of vegetables for their requirements this year. A new implement shed, poultry house, and ice house were built last fall, too late for the painting to be done. A barn has been authorized to be built this year. This will be a great convenience and will add to the appearance of the premises. Their farm is showing a steady improvement in appearance each year. Mr. Ross is having the small bluffy patches cleaned out and the fields squared up. The crop this year includes 65 acres of wheat, 50 acres oats, 60 acres barley, 25 acres rye, 5 acres sunflowers and 2 acres corn. This crop has made a good growth and promises an excellent yield. The sunflowers and corn are grown for cattle feed. A trench silo is used in this connection.\n\nAbout 12 cows are kept for milking purposes. Included in these are two pure-bred Holstein cows, and they have 2 two-year-old heifers and 2 Holstein calves. The balance of the cattle are grade Shorthorns. There is an ample supply of milk provided to permit the children to drink all they care to.\n\nI might\nI might mention that the Principal's residence has not been repainted since it was built, and requires repainting very badly. I also think that the furnace chimney should be rebuilt; it appears to be in poor condition and is only a bracket chimney, necessitating the use of too long a pipe from the furnace for safety from fire.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Round Lake and Cowessess Indian Boarding Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, which shows that these institutions are in good shape; in fact the report on the Round Lake School is the best we have had for some considerable time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

He has very little idea of the best methods of teaching young children. The work needs systematizing\u2014it is too haphazard\u2014and the lessons working out according to some rational plan.\n\nIn teaching Reading to beginners there should be abundant use of simple, interesting sentences on the blackboard. It is better not to put the Readers into the hands of pupils for some time. In using the Reader the pupils should be carefully prepared before being asked to read.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture...\n\nIn good condition and well arranged.\n\nCare of Material...\n\nThe equipment seems pretty well cared for.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied\n\nWould suggest the addition of an up-to-date map of Europe. The provision of more books for the library suitable for the lowest classes is also desirable.\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.)\n\nThe rooms were clean, pretty well ventilated and well lighted and heated.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)\n\nThe register is well kept in the senior room. In the junior room there is a little laxness.\n\nEnrolment\u2014Senior Room\u2014Mrs. Rose, Grade IV 14, V 6, VI 4, VII 3, VIII 4\u2014total 34.\n\nJunior Room\u2014Mr. Smith, I 12, II 12, III 11\u2014total 35.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nMr. Smith is struggling earnestly and energetically and no doubt some progress is being made.\n\nThe Reading of Grades II and III is fairly fluent, but there is little expression or grasp of the thought.\n\nGrade I Sr. Reading is better. In Arithmetic the bright pupils answer mechanical questions pretty well. The classes need much practice in simple, practical problems. The Handwork and Drawing are commendable.\n\nIn questioning a class the teacher should stand in front and address his questions to the whole class, not to individuals, and endeavor to secure a response from everyone. Pupils should speak up so that the rest of the class can hear.\nSir:\n\nI enclose for your information a report by Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Robinson, of his visit on the 26th of November, to the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 22, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have examined the recent report of the Public School Inspector and I wish to pass on some helpful suggestions for the guidance of Mr. Smith, one of the classroom teachers. The report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Smith is struggling earnestly and energetically and, no doubt, some progress is being made... His work shows very clearly the need of professional training. His efforts need systematizing.... In teaching reading to beginners there should be abundant use of simple, interesting sentences on the board. It is better not to put readers into the hands of pupils for some time. In questioning a class, the teacher should stand in front and address his questions to the whole class and not to individuals and endeavour to secure a response to everyone. Pupils should speak up so that the rest of the class can hear.\"\n\nI am sure that, if you bring this criticism to this teacher's attention, his work in the future will be more effective.\n\nBest wishes for the New Year. I trust that the staff and pupils have enjoyed a most delightful Christmas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Res. School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI forward for your information Report by Provincial School Inspector Mr. R.H. Horning of his visit on Dec. 1st to the Round Lake Indian Residential School. While the Inspector speaks highly of the qualifications of Mr. Ross, his report concerning Mr. Donald Heron, who is only nineteen years of age, is not encouraging and it seems to me that a better qualified teacher ought to be secured. When teachers at our schools have not the desired qualifications, the lack of them offers an opportunity to Indians to complain that their children are not receiving the proper education and many of these complaints have heretofore been made in the past, not of this particular school, but of others where the management and training has been lacking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(Teacher of senior department.)\nDonald Heron: Age 19; Second non-professional, no normal training.\n(Teacher of junior dept.)\n\nRemarks relative to the methods employed by teachers\nPupils of Grade VI to VIII (senior room) under Mrs. Ross were instructed by good methods of teaching. The supervision of all written and oral work was very thorough and the discipline and class-management was excellent.\n\nThe Junior room of Grades I, II and III had been without a teacher for two weeks as Mr. Heron had been sick for that period and was still in bed at the time of inspection. A Grade VIII Indian boy was in charge. His methods were not approved.\n\nDec. Ist. 1927.\n\nSignature Inspector\n\nNOTE:\u2014This form to be used for Indian Residential Schools only.\nSuggestions regarding teaching methods...the methods used by Mrs. Ross (wife of the Principal of the school) are such that there is little to suggest by way of improvement. These boys and girls have been taught to be good writers in which art they take great pride. They are slow readers and speak in a very low tone of voice; the teacher explained that she had tried every means to remedy this but the pupils were so reserved that it seemed impossible to compel them even slightly until fairly inspection. Strict discipline was maintained in this room and the progress of the boys and the girls was good, for a school of its kind. Regarding the methods used in the junior room, I am unable to say what they were, but judging the exercise books and examination made of the work from the junior book and examination made of the work showed a lack, except that there was little method about it.\n\nI should at least suspect that there was little method about it.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nIn each room a teacher's desk, a sufficient number of seats, a book cupboard, and a chair\u2014in senior rooms, an addition, an organ, and a cupboard for supplies.\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture.\n\nThe preservation and care of the furniture was good and the arrangement quite consistent with the rules and regulations.\n\nCare of Material. It would appear that the best of care had been taken of all material in the senior room; there was practically no material in the junior room.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied for the junior room a good supply of Primary material, such as plasticine, weaving mats, construction paper, sewing cards, a number frame, number builders and drawing paper.\n\nFor the senior room the following text-books are required:\n\n1 Reading book V; 16 Grammars; 2 Atlases; 5 Geography textbooks; 32 Hygiene; 7 British Histories; 14 Canadian Histories; a map of each of the continents, (except North America) and the British Empire.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.) - The classrooms were clean and heated by a hot-air furnace; everything was satisfactory in this respect, except the heating of the senior room. The temperature there was 25 degrees in the morning at 10 o'clock, and rose to 56 by 12 o'clock. The main reason for this was that there were no storm windows on the seven west windows of the room. There were no toilets, nor water supply in the school - these were in the residence building.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)\n\nIn the senior room Mrs. Ross had definite knowledge of the attendance of every pupil each day. About the register had not been marked for four days. In the junior it had not been marked for two weeks; it was marked up to the day Mr. Heron took ill and apparently had been marked regularly up to that time.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement)\n\nThe senior was operated on a shift system. In the morning a part of the classes attended school while the other was engaged in husbandry and household duties. I was informed by the Principal that this was the plan of conducting the education. All subjects of the curriculum were included in the time-table but in some cases provision was made for subjects only once a week; under the system this was the only thing that could happen in the senior's five classes.\n\nIn this department there were four girls and three boys who attended school separately morning and afternoon, the policy being to give every advantage to those who were willing to take an education and who were making an exceptionally good showing in their studies.\n\nThe Junior room gave evidence of a lack of organized work; a large part of the classes were without exercise books and only a few of those who had them were showing any signs of advancement. This room is making very little progress under the present arrangement and is in my opinion, urgently in need of a fully qualified and experienced teacher.\nOttawa, December 28th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Horning's report on his visit to the Round Lake Residential School on the first instant.\n\nThe Inspector reports very favourably on the work that is being done in the senior room but comments on the junior room, as follows:\n\n\"Regarding the methods used in the junior room, I am unable to say what they were, but, judging from the exercise books and examination made on the work, I should at least suspect that there was little method. The junior room gave evidence of lack of planned work; a large part of the classes were without exercise books and only a few of those who had them were showing any signs of advancement. This room is making very little progress under the present arrangement and is, in my opinion, urgently in need of a fully qualified and experienced teacher.\"\n\nThe Inspector states that the junior teacher is nineteen years of age, has a Second non-professional and no Normal training.\n\nI feel that you will agree with me that it is most important that there should be a fully qualified teacher in the junior room and I trust that you will take the necessary steps to effect an improvement in this classroom.\n\nThe Inspector recommended a supply of primary material, also, certain books and maps.

The Inspector recommends that the library be improved by securing new books and, in choosing these, he suggests that special care be taken to have books suitable for the lower grades.\n\nThe Department is prepared to supply a reasonable quantity of books on receipt from you of a requisition stating the names of the books you consider necessary. In forwarding this requisition, the name of the publisher should also be stated. I believe that, in choosing the books, it would be well to be guided by the suggestions made in the programme of studies for public schools issued by the Provincial Department of Education in Saskatchewan.\n\nI am pleased to note from the Inspector's report that a trained teacher has been secured for the junior room. The Inspector is of the opinion that both the teachers are getting good results from their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R.J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nReport of Inspection on Round Lake Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI visited this school on December 17th., last, and made a general inspection of buildings and premises. The school is under the auspices of the United Church, with the Rev. R. J. Ross in charge as Principal. His staff is comprised of Mrs. Heron, Matron, Mrs. Ross and Miss Murray, teachers, Miss Jury, cook, Miss Rowan, seamstress, Miss Ewen, laundress, and David Bushnell, farmer. There are 75 pupils enrolled, 35 boys and 40 girls, which is the limit for which accommodation is provided. I was present at the midday meal, and noted that an ample supply of wholesome food was provided. I visited both classrooms, and found the pupils comfortably clad and presenting a healthy appearance. Mrs. Ross continues to teach in the senior classroom and appears to be a competent teacher. Miss Murray, who has charge of the junior classroom, impresses me as being well qualified for the position, and is the most successful teacher they have had in this room for some time.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nBUILDINGS.\n\nThe school building has already been reported on very fully, and there is no change in the main features. The laundry is very cramped for space, and a lack of convenience for drying the clothes still exists. The roots and vegetables are stored in the same place in this building, and although authority was granted to build an outside root house, and the Principal has been urged from time to time to proceed with the work, this root house has not yet been built. The Principal states that he could not get around to it, owing to pressure of work, and the illness of his assistant. During the past summer the facilities for fire protection have been greatly added to. The piping in the pole escapes has been replaced with a larger size, and the windows forming the exits have been equipped with hooks which can be easily opened. Four 5-gallon pump extinguishers have been supplied. A soft water tank in the basement is being utilized for water storage, and the water is pumped to this with a windmill, which appears to be giving excellent service. A 1000-gallon pressure tank has been twinned up with the 500-gallon tank which is part of the old equipment, and this makes it possible to utilize the water system through the standpipe which has also been installed. This equipment is new and in excellent condition. The new portion of the school building has been re-decorated, and the plaster is in good shape. In the old portion the plaster is broken and the floors are old and this part is very hard to heat. I found the school in a cleanly condition throughout. I was better satisfied in this connection than I have been on the occasion of former visits.\nReport of Inspection at Round Lake Residential School.\n\nThe exteriors of both the class room and the main building require re-painting. Since my last visit a new barn, 32 x 70, has been built. This barn is not large enough for all their young stock, and 16 cattle were running outside. I would suggest that a leanto shed would provide satisfactory accommodation for the young stock. The old stone stables are still standing, and are being used to accommodate the hogs. These old buildings do not add to the appearance of the place, which would be much improved if they were torn down and a suitable piggery provided. They have a small poultry house, 16 x 16, which provides accommodation for fifty hens. They should have at least three times this number of poultry at a school of this size.\n\nFARM STOCK.\n\nThe farm stock consists of 12 horses, 51 cattle and 70 hogs, 13 of which are purebred. They were milking eight cows, only three of which were giving any quantity, and the milk supply is not adequate to provide the children with all they care to drink. The farm stock provides practically all the meat requirements of the institution.\n\nFARM.\n\nTheir crop sown comprised 60 acres of wheat, which yielded 1500 bushels, 60 acres of oats, yielding 2500 bushels, 40 acres barley, yielding 1000 bushels, and 38 acres of rye, with a yield of 700 bushels. Their garden provided plenty of carrots and turnips, but the yield of potatoes was very unsatisfactory. They\nReport of Inspection at Round Lake Residential School.\n\nThey only get 250 bushels from four acres, which is not half enough for their requirements.\n\nThe school premises have been cleaned up and were in a more tidy condition than I have ever found them on previous occasions. It appears to me that an improvement has taken place in the staff, and conditions are more satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., 10th January, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School, in the Crooked Lake Agency, which was inspected on December 17th last by Mr. Murison.\n\nConditions at this school seem to be a little bit improved since the last inspection. Some of the buildings here are old, and it is hard to make them look up-to-date. I do not feel like making a recommendation for the expenditure of any money on these buildings. Authority was granted some time early in the year to build a root house, but you will note that nothing has been done in regard to this and, of course, the result will be that the money voted will not be used. The Agent was in my office this week and I told him he should at least buy the material and have it on hand so that the money would be spent before March 31st.\n\nI would draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the barn. My opinion is that this barn is quite large enough for any school, and I am not in favour of putting up a lot of small buildings to accommodate additional cattle. 51 head of cattle is too many to have on hand at a school of this kind. I would judge from the crop yield that the farming is carried on in a satisfactory manner. The yield was much better than on the reserve, which shows that the land was well cultivated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, January 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge and thank you for your letters of the 9th and 10th instant, enclosing Mr. Morrison's reports on the Round Lake and Cowessess Indian Residential Schools.

Your teachers are both of a very fine type\u2014earnest, conscientious, and interested in the children and their work. They are both very capable, have their work well prepared, and teach definite, thoughtful lessons, in a pleasant and sympathetic way. Their classrooms have been made as attractive as possible, and they are trying to make the work interesting for the children.\n\nNOTE: This form to be used for Indian Residential Schools only.\n\nForm No. 141\n\nSignature of Inspector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have made, and are making, a careful study of their work, and are adapting their methods to conditions, so as to be most effective.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nThe exterior of school is quite badly in need of paint, and the interior is beginning to show the same need.\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture.\n\nThe furnishings of school seem generally satisfactory, and are in good condition. If you have any number of visitors to your classrooms, I would suggest the provision of an extra chair in each room.\n\nCare of material.\n\nAll materials and general supplies seem well cared for, and kept in good order.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied.\n\nYour school library is very weak, but is gradually being built up. If any extra grant could be given for this purpose, it would give a better \"start\" and would help the work considerably. Both classrooms lack pictures, and I would suggest the purchase of at least one good picture for each room. There should be at least one fire extinguisher in this building, a hand bell is needed, and interior flags should be provided for each room. I would also suggest a railing for each side of the exterior steps\u2014accidents might easily happen there, as steps are quite steep.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The organization and general system, the conduct of classes, and the whole attitude of both teachers and pupils, were very satisfactory. The teaching was good, and from its nature would seem to be most effective. The children were particularly attentive, seemed interested, and were working well. The work of classes observed or tested was entirely creditable, and I am satisfied that results will be very satisfactory.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the Round Lake Indian Residential School by Provincial School Inspector, Mr. H. L. Winter. You will note that he speaks very favourably of Mrs. Ross and Miss Affleck. I have always been satisfied with the work in the classrooms here, but the rest of the management has always been reported as not being up to standard. Miss Affleck, who is mentioned in the Inspector's report, was in my office yesterday complaining bitterly of certain things in connection with the management. She has left the school, and she wished to tell me a number of things but I asked her to put whatever she wished to say in writing and if there is anything of interest it will be forwarded to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Some very good work of a project nature was in evidence, and I urged that this type of activity be extended...aiming at training the children to think and do as much as possible for themselves.

Both teachers have special ability and originality in their work, and seem entirely dependable.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture...\n\nGood.\n\nCare of material\n\nGood. Well looked-after.\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied\n\nText Books, dealing with the new Course of Study, and its separate subjects, would be helpful in practically all grades....Reference material for the same purpose is also needed... I hope the new Readers authorized for the Province will be supplied....They are a real improvement on the ones in use prior to the present term.\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.) Condition of classrooms, in general, is quite good... although plaster is getting quite soiled.\n\nFurnace seems to have been smoking rather badly... which would account for discolored plaster...

In fact, results of testing are well up to the general average of full-time schools... I feel fully satisfied that your present teachers will bring their classes along well and that we can look for a thoroughly successful year.\n\nI was particularly pleased to note the success of musical entries in Provincial Festival... and glad to hear that this work is being continued this year...

First Form, Cert., #29-29, Age 36.\n\nRemarks relative to the methods employed by teachers:\n\nThe methods followed by these teachers are such as are found most effective in this kind of work. Both teachers are students of their work, and are trying to give their pupils the best possible training in the time at their disposal. The greatest difficulty comes in senior room, where pupils attend only half-days. Here, the work has to be condensed, and placed before pupils in a form they can assimilate in least possible time.\n\nNOTE: This form to be used for Indian Residential Schools only.\n\nForm No. 141\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSuggestions regarding teaching methods... Teaching methods are very satisfactory except for difficulty mentioned in connection with senior room. That is, children are more or less \"spoon-fed\" in order to cover the regulation course in time at their disposal.\n\nBoth teachers are particularly capable and conscientious in their work, and are giving their pupils a good general training...\n\nMrs. Waywell is particularly \"live\" and original in her teaching and general management, and is securing a very creditable response from her pupils... I feel that they are gradually overcoming their difficulty of not speaking out plainly... work is interesting and effective.\n\nMrs. Ross is a capable and painstaking teacher, who holds a high standard of work before her class. Her teaching is definite and effective, well-related to the pupils' knowledge and abilities... It is rather remarkable that, with half-attendance, she can bring her classes along so that they average up well with full-time classes in regular schools.\n\nIt is a distinct pleasure to visit these class-rooms.\n\nCLASSROOM FURNITURE\n\nPreservation and arrangement of furniture...\n\nGoods...\n\nCare of material...\n\nGoods...\n\nIf necessary, indicate what additional classroom material, books, etc., should be supplied...\n\nWorking materials have been very well kept up. Your teachers will likely suggest needed additions, from time to time.\nCLASSROOM\n\nCondition of Classrooms (Ventilation, light, etc.)\n\nInterior of classrooms is rather in need of re-decoration, plaster being quite badly soiled by smoke. (A color tint might hold appearance better). Lighting, Heating and Ventilation were satisfactory at time of inspection.\n\nClassroom Register (Is a careful tally made morning and afternoon?)\n\nRegisters were quite well kept... Registers do not contain space for present age of pupils... This might be a helpful addition when re-printing.\n\nGENERAL\n\n(Under this heading the Inspector should report upon the classroom activity generally and offer any suggestions for improvement.)\n\nIn general, I was well satisfied with my general impression of this school.... Results should be very credible...\n\nI note that children just entering Grade I vary in age from six yrs. to 13 yrs. Are all children not expected to attend school within a set age limit ?? If all entered school... say at the age of seven yrs. the Mission teachers would have a more uniform class to deal with, and pupils would be under their care for an increased period of time.\n\nIf a census list of children of school-age were available, it would help an inspector to check up on this matter (if desired).\n\nI was pleased to note the success of these Indian children in Musical work, during the year... This is a fine part of their training... as long as it is a supplementary part, and does not interfere with the regular school training.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to forward herewith Provincial School Inspector Winter's report of an inspection which he made of the Round Lake Indian Residential School in the Crooked Lake Agency on the 17th instant.\n\nThis report indicates that very satisfactory progress is being made in the classroom work.

I note that $450.00 has been inserted in the Estimates for 1937-38 for this work. I am doubtful if this amount is sufficient. I would also ask the Department to refer to their letter No. 112-1-1, dated August 6th, and Inspector W.

It should not only give a better background for work, but prove helpful in actual teaching and management.\n\nMinor repairs are needed to buildings (front steps, etc.), and either sashes or a substitute should be provided for sweeping, or classroom floors should be given a LIFT ceiling.\n\nPlayground equipment is still lacking.

The machinery in the laundry, the boiler, the lighting plant, and the battery were all in first class condition. The only thing I found that required renewing was the sewers throughg. This has been on the building for years and the snow and frost have had the effect that it will have to be renewed next Summer.

It is quite possible that she could do better work teaching senior grades.\n\nThe school rooms in this school are in poor repair. Windows are broken, steps are poor, plaster is falling in places, paint is dirty and so dark that the rooms have a dingy appearance etc. Since the physical environment plays an important part in the all-round development of the children, I consider the condition of these classrooms to be unsatisfactory.\n\nAccording to reports the classrooms are quite cold in winter.\n\nE.

Mr. Bell has these junior pupils not very satisfactorily seated in an alcove of his room. He is interested in and proud of their progress and is giving them as much time as possible.\n\nI saw work in reading, mathematics, language, social studies, literature, health.\n\nTo have ten pupils in the two senior grades is an indication of the good level to which the work of the school is being raised. Mr. Bell is to be commended for his interest in these pupils.

To this end she is emphasizing the work in reading, writing and arithmetic. There is a sandtable and a table for display work, a play house, Christmas songs were being practiced.\n\nTypewritten sheets were given pupils in some of the reading assignments. It is suggested that the Guide Books for the readers be made available.\n\nThe standard of work is comparatively high. I feel confident that no limitations of subject matter within the curriculum are necessary.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nIndian Affairs.

Both reports are entirely satisfactory and both teachers are graded as A+ and B+ throughout on the teacher grading scale.\n\nThe only comment which would seem to indicate action on your part is that Mr. Moir found the outside door of the school, the only exit, locked. In all probability this matter has already been discussed with the Principal of the School, but in view of the fire hazard it should not be permitted to happen again.\n\nBernard F.

Mrs. Linton has, by the same token, been able to maintain her knowledge of the curriculum and methods throughout the elementary grades.\n\nHer classroom reflects good planning and supervision of the pupils' work.\n\nAs the future of this school is in doubt Mrs. Linton might be available for duty in a day school. I think that her performance therein would be better than average.\n\nShe would like, when time and funds permit, to attend a course that is specifically intended for teachers in Indian schools.\n\nC.A.

Her younger pupils, especially, are making extra good progress. She would continue to do well in the junior room of a two-room school.

There has evidently been a request made to the Saskatchewan Department of Education to have correspondence courses given to some pupils on a nearby reserve.\n\nMrs. Linton is a well-qualified, energetic, interested teacher who is trying to bring these pupils to the same standards that one would find in any public school in the province. It is to be noted that pupils from the school are enrolled in high school classes (e.g., Brandon, etc.).\n\nI do not think she feels sympathetic towards these pupils because they are Indians. If she were to be asked why she would probably ask: Why should I be? Her attitude seems to be that they are as well equipped mentally as other children to carry on with the school work and they should be treated exactly the same and the same results should be expected.\n\nIf an explanation is needed for Mrs. Linton's lack of warm community support, the above is offered.\n\nMay I add the following.\n\nMrs. Linton and the children were enjoying one of the evening autumn bonfires that were possible around Hallowe'en this year. She had taught them the one verse of a Hallowe'en song that the book gave and had 'made up' another. They sang the two and then Mrs. Linton suggested that the children 'make up' one of their own\u2014the book had one, she had made up one, so that they had examples to follow. One of the girls spoke for the group when she said, \"But, Mrs. Linton, yours doesn't sound made up!\"\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\nIndian Affairs.

Confer with Principal on several matters, particularly re pupil Mary Gaddie who should be kept under closer observation and away from young men of questionable moral character.\n\nI regret to report the death by drowning of a girl pupil, No.0102, Maud Tapewaywaypenasick, aged 15. It appears the deceased along with several more girl pupils during the evening of the 20th went to the large lake which is close by the school to bathe and all of them ventured by the method of joining hands too far out in the deep water. As is usual in such unfortunate daring cases the girls became afraid too late, and on the hand chain being broked several were in great danger of being drowned. One of the girls, Ida Sagit, acted in a very heroic manner and by her presence of mind and actions although in great danger herself saved at least two girls. These girl pupils were unaccompanied by any of the staff connected with the school, which is to be regretted. The police and coroner investigated the matter, and afterwards made reports to their respective departments.\n\nNumber of Pupils in 1st Standard:\ndo do in 2nd do\ndo do in 3rd do 13\ndo do in 4th do\ndo do in 5th do 5\ndo do in 6th do\n\nAgency: Crooked Lake\nDated: September 1st\n\nN.B.\u2014A separate form to be used for each school.\n*State whether \"day,\" \"boarding\" or \"industrial.\"\n\nForm No. 18.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is the S.W. of Sec. 28 Township 18 R. 3. This would be valuable to us or failing in this, the S.E. of the same 23rd Sec. or Sec. 13 in the same Township. These lands are still unoccupied & without improvement.\n\nL. Van Boughnet,\nDeputy Sup't General of Indian Affairs\nI spoke to the new Governor about this matter last summer. His reply was that the land had already been taken up. The field however unoccupied & if it can be purchased our school will be vastly much strengthened.\n\nI have also been encouraged by our Agent Col. MacDonald & by Dr. Macdonald, Inspector of Indian Schools to make application to the Department for a school some day. Application just little appear in due time.\n\nI have been making your proposed improvements in Indian schools.\n\nPerhaps I suggest that instead of erecting & building us 4 schools on Crooked Lakes Reserve, our present school at Round Lake be strengthened so as to accommodate the children of school age on the farm Reserve.\n\nThe value the school buildings already here at $5000 & which together with barns, stables, cattle etc., will amount to...\n$6000.00 we have sufficient-room to accommodate all the girls on those reserves (75). Now if we had suit the buildings for the boys we would be ready for the work. Then in regard to the support of the school, the Church is prepared to give $1800.00 per an. in support of those in charge of the work and also clothe the children. So the expense resting upon the Government would not be much more than it would be in keeping up 4 common schools. In following this plan we would have a better opportunity of accomplishing the work at which we aim viz the Civilization & Christianising of the boy Indian.\n\n1st the children are taken away from the pernicious influences of the pagan wigwam & constantly under our care.\n\n2nd we have regular attendance.\n\n3 Opportunity of teaching economy & self-support.\n\nThe girls find employment in knitting, sewing, various kinds of housework and the boys in the gardens or the army or taking care of cattle.\nTo try to give each child who enters the school an opportunity of rising first at the table, he may work for a better position, thus for better clothing & better sleeping department, and for higher positions in the society of our home. If a child has any ambitions she will rise until he wishes to become self-supporting. If he has none he will soon become weary of our home go back & spend his life in pauperism & die in the wigwam.\n\nIn I trust you will pardon me for writing, but I feel for the founders. I am ashamed to think of how little our church has done for this poor people, but I trust that the day is not far distant when by the united effort of Church & government all the Indian children of the N.W.T. will be gathered in four papamies & made useful citizens.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nHilltopp.\nMay 7 - 1888\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith an extract from a letter from the Rev.

Hugh McKay, finds itself crippled for want of a sufficient amount of farming land, and I am instructed by our Committee to ask you to use your influence to have an additional quantity of land set apart for the purpose of the school. The present school site is the NW\u00bc of 14, Township 18, Range 3. The greater part of this quarter section is cut off by Round Lake and the Qu'Appelle River and there are only about 62 acres of arable land on it. The whole of this is enclosed and under cultivation. We now ask for the adjoining North half of 13, Township 18, Range 3. There is only a part of this half section in the valley. A part of it lies in the steep hill which bounds the valley and a portion of it lies up on the high prairie level. The enclosed sketch, which is made by Mr. McKay, will give you an idea of how it is situated.\n\nFor the purpose of showing that an additional amount of land is needed, I need only say that the Mission owns about seventy head of cattle, two teams of farm horses and a team of ponies. A quantity of stock of approximately this size is needed.\nneeded to afford training for the boys in the care of domestic animals. The amount of arable land available has for several years been quite too small for use and a year ago the Mission had eighty acres beyond the limits of its homestead rented and under cultivation.\n\nBy assisting us in securing a grant of this additional half Section you will considerably increase the efficiency of the school and you will greatly oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Andrew B. Baird.\n\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a copy of a letter from the Rev. A.B. Baird, Convenor of the Foreign Missions Committee of the Presbyterian Church, relative to the securing of additional land for the Round Lake Boarding School in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nI have ascertained by enquiry of the Dominion Lands Office that the half-section asked for is vacant and would recommend that steps be taken to secure it for the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nA.C.

It will however be noticed by the sketch enclosed that the high hill flanking the Qu'Appelle River runs diagonally through the half section asked for, thus impairing its selling value. Hardly one third of the land is capable of cultivation judging from the plan. Probably, therefore, if the land were sold at the same rate as other unimproved farms in the neighborhood, it would not bring more than somewhere between $300. or $400., or about $1.00 an acre.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He was, therefore, asked to furnish this information, and to enclose a sketch of the land which had been inadvertently omitted from his previous letter.\n\nThe Department has now received this sketch and the information that the land would probably cost between $300 and $400, or about $1.00 an acre.\n\nFrom Dr. Baird's letter there would seem to be great reason why this land should be obtained if possible, but the cost would probably have to be provided for in the Estimates.\n\nAs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs Dr. Baird makes the remark in the conclusion of his letter \"by assisting us in securing a grant of this additional half-section you will considerably increase the efficiency of the school\", it may be that he does not expect the government to do more than contribute half the cost of the purchase, which would probably not be more than $200.\n\nAddendum\n\nIIth March 1898.\n\nI might add to the above Memo; that correspondence about providing the Round Lake school with additional land has been going on for some years. The land required belongs to the C.P.R.C. At one time the Department hoped to make an exchange with that Company by giving a piece of land on O'Soup's Reserve, which the company was willing to accept, as it was wanted for a station, but the Indians refused to give up land to make an exchange which would be of no personal benefit to them. As this arrangement could not be carried out, the Presbyterian Church urges the Department to assist in purchasing the necessary land, and the Indian Commissioner recommends the purchase.\n\nA perusal of the Rev. Dr. Baird's letter shows the great necessity for this additional land.\nOttawa, 11th March, 1898.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a sketch of the land recommended to be obtained for the use of the Round Lake Boarding School, I beg to say that on looking further into the matter it is observed that some years ago, when an application of this nature was first made by Rev. Mr. McKay, the Department was willing to provide the land required by the school if it could do so without an outlay of money, and it was at that time thought that this could be done by making an exchange with the C. P. R. Co., giving the latter a piece of land on O'Scoup's Reserve to be used as a station in exchange for the land wanted by the school.\n\nThe Indians, however, refused to agree to an exchange which would be of no personal benefit to them, and in consequence the proposed arrangement could not be carried out.\n\nThe proposition that the Department should assist in purchasing the land required by the school is altogether a new one, and in view of the fact that both the building and the property connected with the school belong entirely to the Presbyterian Church the Department is not disposed to expend money ---even to the extent of, say, $200, half the probable cost---in the purchase\n\nA.

Dr. Baird of the decision of the Department in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to previous correspondence on the subject of obtaining an additional half section of land for the Round Lake boarding school (No.62/37), in which the Indian Department expresses its unwillingness to expend money for the land asked for because the property now in use belongs entirely to the Presbyterian Church. The land for which we ask, the N.\u00bd of 15-18-3, belongs to the Canada North West Land Company and I am informed by Mr. L.A. Hamilton, Land Commissioner, Winnipeg, who has charge of these lands, that in case the Government is willing to exchange another piece of land for this half section, his company would be willing to agree to the request.\n\nOur request for the land therefore would not involve the expenditure of any money whatever.\n\nIt is quite true that all the buildings and the property now in use for the Round Lake Boarding School belong exclusively to the Presbyterian Church; but I venture to express the hope that, since the work done in this school is of the same character as that for which the Government provides land...\nland and buildings in the case of other Churches, this generosity of the Presbyterian Church need not stand in the way of its securing the assistance of the Government in acquiring the land necessary to carry on its work. It is not at all necessary that the land asked for should be owned by the Presbyterian Church; in fact, in view of possible taxation in the future, we would prefer that it should not be owned by us. All that we ask is that the school should have the use of the land as long as such land is required for purposes of instruction and maintenance under the care of the Indian Department.\n\nWe beg therefore to renew our request to the Government that by negotiation with the Canada North West Land Company this half section be secured and be made available for the purposes of the Round Lake boarding School, and I have the honour to be\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAndrew B. Baird.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 11th of March last, No. 117080 in regard to obtaining an additional piece of land for the use of the Round Lake Boarding School which the Department refused.

It is stated, however, in the letter from the Rev. Dr. Baird, forwarded by the Commissioner, that the half section in question belongs to the Canada North West Land Co. (not to the C. P. R. Co. as stated in a previous letter from the Commissioner) and that that Company is willing to exchange the piece of land in question for another.\n\nAs the necessity for more land for the Round Lake Boarding School was admitted by the Department as far back as 1890, when effort was made to exchange a piece of land belonging to O'Soup's Reserve for the same half-section that is now applied for, it might be well for this Department to communicate with the Department of the Interior and ascertain whether that Department could give a half-section of Dominion land in the neighbourhood of Round Lake in exchange for the land required by the school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The land belongs to the Canadian Pacific Railway and for some reason or other the grant was not secured. See File in your office No 38003. Land was very much needed, however, by this Indian school, and last Summer application was made through the Indian Commissioner in Winnipeg for the grant of the N.\u00bd of 13-18-3. In the course of negotiations for this piece of land, which belongs to the Canada North West Land Company, it was found that the half section for which we originally applied may now be had, and we therefore abandon our request for the N.\u00bd of Section 13 and renew our first request for the South half of Section 23. I was present in the office of the Land Commissioner of the Canadian Pacific Railway a few days ago when he dictated a letter to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, offering to relinquish this half section in lieu of land of equal value elsewhere, in order that it may be granted for the use of the Indian school at Round Lake. Will you be so kind as to assist us in securing the grant, the reasons for which were stated at length in my application for the N.\u00bd of 13-8-3.\n\nThe Sec/Dept/Indian Affairs,\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Professor Baird urging the Department to assist the Presbyterian Church in securing a grant of the South 1-2 of Section 23, Tp. 18, R. 3, west of the second meridian, for the use of the Round Lake Industrial School as pasture land, I beg to say that, as stated by Professor Baird, it is some years since an application for a half section was first made to the department. The original application was recommended by the late Indian Commissioner. The land at present held by the school is only a quarter section, and a great part of this is cut off by Round Lake and the Qu'Appelle River, and the whole of the remainder is under cultivation.\n\nWhen application was first made for the half section now applied for, it was found that the land belonged to the C.P.R.C., and no arrangement could be made to exchange for a similar quantity of Dominion land; and after some time the matter was dropped.\n\nLater on an application was made for the North 1-2 of Section 13, Tp. 18, R. 3; but on communicating with the Canada North West Land Co., to whom the land belonged, it was found that an exchange for Dominion land could not be effected.\n\nThe Rev.

Mr. McKay, Principal of Round Lake School did not mention the matter of our interest in land when I was there in November last, and has it so generally been known is on the ground at that time I had not had an opportunity of seeing the land which is principally on the creek, and the general idea is the valley but have been under the impression that only a portion of it was fit for cultivation, otherwise good enough for pasture.\n\nMr. McKay usually raises enough of wheat to keep the house supplied with flour and most people and generally feed and the herd of cattle supplied all the beef required as well as a supply of milk for use and to make butter.\n\nThe wheat crop last year was a failure.\n\nIf any land had been asked for I should understand the reason.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept.

A portion of it is wooded land, which of course is useless for pasturage, but it will supply a part of the fuel required for the school; a part of it is arable land and will be used for that purpose. The need of arable land at the school is so great that for several years a neighboring farm from which the proprietor had moved away has been rented and cultivated chiefly by the labor of the boys who are pupils in the school.\n\n(2nd) The land in question lies partly in the valley of the Qu'Appelle River and partly on the high prairie level above the valley. The hill which bounds the valley and which is about 200 feet high, runs through the land for which we ask and renders a considerable part of\nthis area almost useless for agricultural purposes.\n\n(3rd) The Indian Department I am sure will agree with our Committee that it is very desirable to have the Indian boys instructed in the care of cattle, a kind of industry to which they take much more kindly than to the growing of crops. With that in view, and for the purpose also of supplying part of the rations required by the school pupils, the Principal of the school has devoted a considerable degree of attention to securing a herd of cattle, and we venture to think that all the available pasture land in the half section asked for will be utilized for the purposes of the school.\n\nWe hope therefore that the request which we have made, which has been recommended by the Commissioner in Winnipeg and in respect of which we have secured the kind cooperation of the Land Department of the Canadian Pacific Railway in offering to exchange this land for another half section, will secure the assent of the Indian Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was supposed that this half section belonged to the Church but when I looked into the matter with a view of seeing that the title was in proper shape I found that the half section was vested by Order-in-Council of the 1st May, 1899, in the Department of Indian Affairs for the purpose of the Indian boarding school at Round Lake and that the Department of the Interior could not dispose of the half section. This information was conveyed by a letter received by my firm from the Department of the Interior, dated 10th October, 1910, - file No. 176506.\n\nWhile the Church would prefer to own the lot still it is required only for the purpose of the Indian School and so long as it is in the hands of the Department of the Interior for that purpose doubtless there will be no interference with the Church's use of the property.\n\nRecently a report has spread at the School that this half\nD.C. Scott, Esq.\n\nsection is being taken up by somebody and our Committee at Winnipeg has become anxious. Can you tell me if there is any truth in this report or if it is possible that the Department would in any way deal with the half section without giving the Church the opportunity of protecting itself?\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at your early convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe it to be in the interests of our work to operate the McKay farm this coming season, for the benefit of the school. You may inform your Western representative and Dr. McKay that it is the Department's intention to purchase the farm and house for the sum of $17,000, provided that an independent and competent valuator assures us that the property is worth at least this figure, and provided, of course, that Dr. McKay can give us clear title.\n\nUntil such time as Parliament has allowed the item, could we not arrange to operate the farm for the benefit of the school, on a rental or share basis? My suggestion for an interim arrangement is that Dr. McKay vacate the property, that the school supply all the labour and seed and take for their own purposes two thirds of the crop harvested. However, I consider that, if a transfer is completed before the crop is taken off, the school authorities should reap the entire benefit of their farming activity on the land in question.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn if this arrangement is satisfactory to your office and to the Rev. Dr. McKay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-0, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nThe ROUND LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL was built by the Presbyterian Church, on fractional N.E. quarter of Section 14, Tp. 18, Rge. 3, West End. Some acres had been acquired by them.\n\nAs early as 1892 church authorities, in conjunction with this Department, endeavoured, through the Department of the Interior, to secure the S. \u00a7 of fractions, Section 15 for the C.F.R.R. for school purposes. This effort was abortive for some years, and the land purchase was initiated with a view to securing the N. \u00a7 of 15 which was held in 1890 by the Canada North West Land Company. In the course of the latter negotiations, it was found that the S. \u00a7 of 15 was available, and as this was the property that was originally requested, correspondence was continued until 1899 when, by P.C. 667, dated the first of May, the property was vested in the Department of Indian Affairs for the purposes of the Round Lake Indian Boarding School.\n\nIt is proposed, at this time, to purchase the church property at this institution and, further, to secure the house and farm of the Rev. Dr. McKay, for many years the Principal of the school. A description of Dr. McKay's property is not on file. It is my opinion that he has title to the N. \u00a7 of Section 14, plus some additional 60 acres. Dr. Edmison, in a communication dated November 23rd, last, states that \"Judge Farrell advises me that Dr. McKay's farm and house are worth $17,000,\" and he further suggests that the Department reimburse the Church for their building equity and land on which it stands to the extent of about $10,000. Judge Farrell, in a letter to Dr. McKay in communication to Dr. Edmison dated the 26th ultimo, states that the Doctor will not likely accept $12,000 for his 406 acres. Rev. Peter Strang, also of Regina, advised Dr. Edmison, under cover of the 26th ultimo, that the 406 acres is worth $15,620.\n\nIn the Estimates, 1923-24, there is an item of $27,000 for the purpose of purchasing the church and the McKay property at the Round Lake School. It is proposed by Dr. Edmison representing the Presbyterian Church, that $10,000 be given to the Church for their equity in the building, and for the property - roughly acres in the N.E. quarter of Section 14. $17,000 was included as the purchase price for the McKay property.\n\nIt is proposed to negotiate with Dr. Edmison, of the Presbyterian Church, with a view to getting a proper description of the church and McKay properties and to arrange with him to have the titles in order. Dr. McKay or his Regina representative (Judge Farrell or Rev. Strang) should state whether or not $17,000 will be accepted for the entire property (church, house and 406 acres). The Minister's office should be approached for the purpose of securing the name of a competent valuator in Regina. This valuator should give us a valuation of both properties, and, provided the McKay property is worth at least $17,000 and the Church's property - less the Department's expenditures for plant - at least $10,000, this Department should make arrangements for the purchase. The Department of Justice will give us the name of their agent who will secure the titles and who will act for us in the matter of the transfers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If not, how far back should it be?\n\nTo be more specific; I live on the shore of Round Lake and it saves me more than a mile each way to and from school to ride down the lake shore, but the way is blocked by Mr. Ross, the Superintendent of the Indian Boarding School, having run the fence of his stable yard out into the water. It is not convenient to travel across another man's land but surely the lake shore or at least enough for a saddle pony to cross should be free to anyone. I have been told that in the case of the Mission the fence should not be further than high-water mark. In some cases 35 feet must be allowed, but I am writing you to be perfectly sure. If I am correct in supposing that he has no legal right to fence into the water, should he refuse to move his fence, as he is not a particularly obliging man from accounts, would I have any authority to cut his fence close enough to the water to let me through along the edge?\n\nThanking you for the desired information and trusting to hear from you soon, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Miss) F.B.

Grier who resides on the S.E.\u00bc Sec.22-18-3-W.2.M., and whose post office address is Stockholm, Sask., in which she states that she would like to ride along the lake shore through sections 23 and 14 on her way to and from school but that she is prevented from doing so on account of fences on the boarding school property which extend out into the water. She states that by being compelled to follow the surveyed road it increases the distance by one mile on each trip.\n\nFrom the position of this surveyed road on the enclosed township plan, it appears that the extra distance would be a negligible amount. However, it may be that this roadway is now situated farther North in section 23 than the position indicated on the plan. Please inform the Department as to all the circumstances in connection with this matter. If the surveyed road is not in the position shown on the township plan, I should like you to indicate its approximate present position on this plan which I would request that you return with your report. Possibly if you would discuss this matter personally with Miss Grier, you might arrive at some mutually satisfactory arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRound Lake Boarding School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nYour cooperation in the request of Miss Foster remains so\nthis morning. She is appropriately correct when she says that by\nfollowing the surveyed road the distance is increased by two or three\nmiles.\n\nMiss Foster requested the privilege of driving through the boarding\nschool property. It did not grant our request for the reason that we have\neighty acres of crop land. Last year we had considerable trouble keeping\nour horses and cattle in fence into the field to protect our crops.\nThere is no fence between the property and the lake.\n\nI state here that the surveyed road passes through the east end\nof this property, and goes between the school and the barn. Ten years ago\nwe requested the municipal council to close this road on the ground that\nit interfered with the discipline of the school. Our request was granted\nand now the public use the road between the school property and the\nlake property which are approximately eight hundred feet apart. Having\nhad this road closed, we do not need another opening.\n\nThe Board of Education demands that this road be left open. In that\ncase the only solution would be a fence built on the west side from the\nwater's edge. This fence would be nearly a mile long...\n\nI also here to call the Department's attention to the fact that\nwe have to go out of our way three miles every time we go to town with\nthe wagon and five miles every time we go with the car. The school is\nsituated in the Tappoqua Valley directly south from Stockton ten miles.\nLast year the local council built three miles of graded road crossing it\nto within a half-mile of the school property at the top of the hill. An\nold drainage ditch could be dug in reserve for about a thousand dollars. This\nroad passes through the Department's property. At the top of the hill on\nthe Mokey property, there are ninety acres of land that could be cultivated\nif we had any way of getting up the hill to it. So to learn about twice\na week and when we were looking for the new school, our four teams were\nin every day.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRound Lake Indian Boarding School\n\nIndian Affairs.

I feel sure when you take into account all the circumstances that you will not consider the Department's attitude unreasonable.\n\nYou obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(J.D.

This matter should receive careful consideration, and I have to request that you will have Mr. Ross make application to the Board of Home Missions, asking them to correspond with the Department in the matter.\n\nIn the meantime, I should like to have a report from you, concerning the most central site for a place of worship for the Protestant Indians of the reserve. You should state if the school land would be suitable or if you believe it advisable to continue using the site that was granted by the Indian Band years ago.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview,\nSask.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th instant, No. 108-1-9, in connection with the proposed erection of a church building for the United Church, I beg to say that the school premises is not the most central site for the Protestant Indians of this Agency, and it would be impossible to find a more central site than that of the old church building on the Kankewiskanaw Reserve.\n\nThere are many arguments, pro and con, in connection with the site for the new church building, but I think the strongest argument in favour of a site near the school is the fact that it is impossible at times for the missionary to get to the Kankewiskanaw Reserve for church service as a result of bad weather, bad roads, and the many other occurrences which come unexpectedly and make it inconvenient for the Principal or a residential school to be absent from his school for several hours. I might observe, however, that it has never appeared to me that the appointments of Principal of the Residential School and Missionary to a large number of Indians on the near reserves should be combined as either one or the other suffers. Some Principals look upon the school work as the more important and allow the missionary work to suffer; others look upon the missionary work as the more important and allow the school affairs to suffer. I believe that, in this case, there would certainly be a more regular church service if the church building were near the school. It would not be as convenient for a number of the Indians, yet I think it is better for the minister to go to church and find a small congregation than for a large congregation to go to church and find no minister.\n\nAs instructed in your letter referred to, I have asked Mr. Ross to communicate with the board of Home Missions asking them to correspond with the Department in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.H.Ostranger,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is therefore the wish of the Board of Home Missions that the desire of the missionary and the Indians be granted, namely, that a site on the School property be set apart for the building of the new Church.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nAB:NEF\nMEMORANDUM RE LANDS OF ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nApproximately 711 acres: parcel I having been granted by P.C. 867, dated May first, 1899 (\"vested in the Dept. of I.A. for the purposes of the Indian Boarding School at Round Lake\"); parcels 2, 3, 4 and 5 having been purchased from the Presbyterian Church and Rev. and Mrs. McKay in 1923 and 1924.\n\nFull description of the last four parcels may be found in Certificates of Title entered under Nos. 911, 912, 913 and 919.\n\nMay be briefly described as:\n\n1. All that portion of the S.W.\u00bc Sec.23, T.18, R.3, W.2nd, containing 261 acres more or less, which is not covered by the waters of Round Lake.\n\n2. All that portion of the N.E.\u00bc of Sec.14, T.18, R.3, W.2nd, containing 62 acres more or less, which lies to the north of Round Lake and the Qu'Appelle River, excepting thereout L.S. 15 and the W.\u00bd of the W.\u00bc of L.S. 16 of the said section.

(RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, May 11, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to a site for the proposed new church for the United Church Indians, near Round Lake, Sask. On second thoughts, the Department believes this question is closely related to the future of the Round Lake Indian Residential School. If the educational institution is to be continued indefinitely, I can see no objection to a site on the school property. On the other hand, if the school were closed, there would remain but the evangelical work in which your Society would be interested. In that event, you might find it better to have your missionary living on a site more central to the Indians to be served.\n\nI believe this question should be carefully considered when you are next interviewing the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church,\n299 Queen St. West, Toronto 2, Ont.\nStockholm, Sask., May 27th, 1882\n\nMr. J.F.M. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander,\n\nAs you know, we had no crop whatever last year. We had no straw for bedding except two old stacks on top of the hill. We repaired an old road in order to get this straw down. But we had to pass through the corner of a quarter-section owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, to get from this old road into our own field.\n\nWe found after repairing the road that we could use it in travelling to and from Stockholm and thus reduce the length of the return trip by 10 miles. But we required another portion of the C.P.R. quarter-section for a road.\n\nWe asked the Land Department of the C.P.R. if they would sell the two portions of this quarter-section we required for our purpose. In their reply, they intimated that they would dispose of the quarter in its entirety to the first satisfactory applicant. We offered $750 and bought it.\n\nWe were influenced by the fact that on this quarter-section there is a small spring and we have a pasture of approximately 400 acres adjoining it, on which there is no water supply.\n\n65 acres of this land is in the hills and has not much value. 35 acres can be broken and is good land. 40 acres of this has been cropped.\n\nThere are two small buildings, a house and a barn. The barn...\nwill accommodate eight horses. Both buildings seem in good repair.\n\nWhen the C.P.R. inspector was here two weeks ago, he informed us that the adjoining quarter-section had also gone back to the company and could be purchased for a reasonable figure. There is on this quarter a 76 acre field adjoining our property in the valley. The rest of the quarter is in the hills. We are negotiating for the purchase of this quarter also.\n\nHeretofore, we have been dependent on the reserve for much of our summer pasture. Now our herd is accredited and we cannot let them mingle with other cattle. We think these two quarters would supply our needs so far as pasture is concerned, especially if there is considerable rain during the summer.\n\nWe ask for the privilege of having the transfer of the North-east quarter of SS-18-S West End made to the Department of Indian Affairs, and we hope that when times become normal, the Department will consider with favor a request for the repayment of the amount we paid for this property.\n\nIf we get the North-west quarter of the same section, for which we are prepared to offer $300, we ask for the same privilege regarding this quarter.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nR.J. Ross\nPrincipal Rosedale Lake Indian Residential School.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith letter received from Rev. R.J. Ross, Principal of the Round Lake Residential School, in connection with the north-east quarter of section 23, township 18, range 3, W 2nd, which he has purchased for the school, also the north-west quarter of the same section which he contemplates purchasing if the Canadian Pacific Railway Company accept his offer.\n\nI may say that the matter of taxes on this land, rather than the purchase price, is Mr. Ross' concern at the present time. As mentioned in his letter, he hopes that the Department will reimburse the school for the cost of this land, at a later and more convenient date, but he is particularly desiring that the Department take over the land nominally at once in order that taxes will not have to be paid thereon.\n\nNo doubt the land will prove of great benefit to the school, on account of the pasture and spring which it contains and the fact that the distance to Stockholm, by road, will be considerably reduced by crossing this land. The arable land contained therein will be of some use to the school for grain-growing as it is particularly good land.\n\nIf it is possible to have the transfer of this land made as requested I would recommend that it be done. I have not had a case of this kind to deal with and I am not aware that it is possible to make the transfer, but I informed Mr. Ross that I would submit the case to the Department for consideration.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your S.7 of the 31st ultimo, with enclosure, concerning the acquisition by the Round Lake Indian Residential School of the N. \u00bd of Sec.23, T.18, R.3, W. 2nd. You may inform the Rev. Mr. Ross that there is no objection whatever to having the proposed transfers in this connection made to \"His Majesty the King as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\". In fact, if purchase is being made from school funds, this is the proper thing to do. If other funds than school moneys are being used for this purpose, please let the Department know without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.P.B.

I accordingly sent to the Department the application to purchase the N.W. Quarter. We have already paid the purchase money.

I may say that, had the matter been referred to me for recommendation in the first instance, I would not have recommended the transfer as all the children sent to Brandon school for higher education have proved a failure in the past and I cannot see any reason why these children will prove any better than the others.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of your letter the pupils referred to as Marthe and Adeline Kay are numbers 0156 and 0159 respectively.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.E.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that there was a child adopted by Vincent Pepeech of the Sackinay Band in 1930. The parents of this child were John Pepeech and wife of ticket No. 125, Sackinay Band. After the death of the father the child was given by the mother to Vincent Pepeech, the child's uncle. This child has been on Vincent's ticket since 1930 and was recently placed in the Round Lake Residential School by Vincent.\n\nRev. Father Carriere, Principal of the Cowessess Residential School, has protested against this child being admitted to the Protestant school as he states that John Pepeech and wife were Roman Catholics and the child was Baptised in the Catholic faith. I have no doubt that Father Carriere can produce proof of this fact, but it would appear to me that the Guardian may still place the child in the school he wishes as he has assumed responsibility for its welfare as the request of the widowed mother.\n\nI have the application for admission signed by Vincent Pepeech for this child, but I shall await a ruling from the Department before forwarding this application as I have never had a case exactly like this to deal with before.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 7th, 1931.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your S.7/ of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the request that you have received for the admission of Vincent Pepeech to the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nExtreme care has to be exercised in cases such as this and, before a decision can be made, the Department requires some additional information.\n\nPlease make inquiries and advise if the father of this boy, John Pepeech, was recognized as a Roman Catholic. You should, also, let me know the religion of his mother and where she is residing at the present time. Were any other children of John Pepeech placed in a residential school and, if so, you should state the name of the school. The Department, also, wishes to know the religion of the child's uncle, Vincent Pepeech.\n\nYou do not state in your letter when the child was given to Vincent Pepeech by the mother. Do you consider that it was a bona fide adoption by the uncle?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nBroedview, Sask.,\n14th November, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Jessie Jane Bear,\nPupil No. 0172 of Round Lake Indian Residential School,\nrecently had a severe hemorrhage of the lungs and the\nMedical Attendant of the school informs me that she has\na well advanced case of pulmonary tuberculosis and she\nis a menace to the health of the other children with whom\nshe comes in contact.\n\nI made arrangements yesterday with the\nIndian Agent at Selkirk, the girl being a member of the\nPeguis Band of that Agency, to send an escort to the school\nto take the girl home at once. She must be sent with an\nescort as she is too weak to travel alone.\n\nI beg to request authority for the discharge\nof this girl from the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 20th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your S.7 of the 14th instant, I beg to say that the discharge of Jessie Jane Bear - No. 0172, from the Round Lake Indian Residential School is approved. Please inform the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nBroadview, Sask.,\n29th December, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th ultimo,\nNo. 105-1-10, in connection with the admission of adopted child of Vincent Pepeech to the Round Lake Residential School, I beg to say that I have investigated this case thoroughly and, while I am not satisfied with statements received from Vincent Pepeech and Mrs. John Pepeech in this connection, I can see that there is not sufficient grounds for keeping the child in the Round Lake School. The adoption paper, which Vincent Pepeech said had been signed before a Notary Public in Yorkton, is now said to have been lost and there was no copy of it filed with the Notary Public who has no recollection of the transaction in his memory. Mrs. John Pepeech says there was never a paper signed and that she allowed Vincent to keep the child temporarily, and that she does not wish the child to be educated in the Round Lake School and given as her reason that she has been talking to Rev. Father Leonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle School, and the Reverend Father informed her that boys receive a better training in his school as they learn a trade, while they receive only class-room education at the Round Lake School.\n\nI have taken no action with regard to having the child removed to the Roman Catholic school, but it would appear that no other action can be taken under the circumstances and I shall await the instructions of the Department. I might say that Reverend R.J. Ross, Principal of the Round Lake School, informed me, in conversation some time ago, that he will not let the child go without \"putting up a fight for him\", but I cannot see that he has any grounds on which to argue the case as there is no proof that any adoption actually took place and the mother, who is a Catholic, says she wishes to have the child continue in the Catholic faith. If there are any Indians who know anything about this adoption they are careful now to give no information to me.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.E. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 4th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your S.7/ of the 29th ultimo, with further reference to the application for the admission of a son of the late John Pepeech to the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Before making a final decision regarding this application, the Department desires definite answers to certain questions asked in official letter of November 7th.\n\nWas the late John Pepeech recognized as a Catholic?\n\nDuring his lifetime, did he place any other children in a residential school and, if so, you should state the name of the school.\n\nWhat is the religion of Vincent Pepeech?\n\nPlease let me have this information as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nBroadview, Sask.,\nJan 8th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Quarterly School Return of the Round Lake Indian Residential School for the quarter ending December 31st, 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.Oatrender,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 15th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your S 6/ of the 8th instant, enclosing the December Quarter return of the Round Lake Indian Residential School. No applications or certificates of health have yet been received for the following:\n\nNo. 183 - G.

Haywabe - No. 182.\n\nIt is presumed that N. Pepeech - No. 181, mentioned in official letter of October 14th, is the boy about whom you have been corresponding. If so, it will not be necessary to forward an application form for him until the Department decides where he is to be sent. If this is the same boy, you should point out to the Principal that he should be returned to his guardian until the Department's decision is given - reference circular letter of November 12, 1926, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nBroadview, Sask.,\n8th January, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, No. 108-1-10, I beg to say that John Pepeech was recognized as a Catholic, but he had no other children attending a residential school as the child in question was the oldest child. Vincent Pepeech was baptised a Catholic and was at the Qu'Appelle Residential School for a very short time. He recently married the daughter of Arthur Waseese of the Kehewinshaw Band, and as she is a member of the United Church, he is inclining that way at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.R.

You should so inform the Principal and, if he is at present in the school, he should be discharged at once.\n\nThe Department is prepared to favourably consider an application for his admission to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Hitherto it has been possible to finance this matter locally but in this year of financial difficulty Rev. R. J. Ross, the Principal, informs us that the work cannot be carried without assistance. They have nineteen girls belonging to this group attending the school and there are six girls who also belong to the group will soon return from Brandon Residential School for their holidays. Mr. Ross would like to include these as members of the camp if possible.\n\nTo board these girls during the period of the camp would cost $4.50 per head or a total of $112.50. Will it be possible for the Department to make a grant of this amount to assist in this very helpful work? The camp is conducted under the very finest of leadership and I feel sure that the girls will receive great benefit therefrom.\n\nAwaiting your kind reply and with kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB:NEF\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 10th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, requesting the transfer of Winifred Gray - No. 0184; Elisabeth Haywahe - No. 0202; and Leona Haywahe - No. 0207; from the Round Lake Indian Residential School to the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nYour letter does not give any reason for desiring the transfer of these children and, as the first named is only ten years of age and the two latter eleven years old, the Department is not prepared to approve of their transfer.\n\nThe discharge of Agnes Haywahe - No. 0203, from the Round Lake Residential School is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland.\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 108-1-10 of the 10th instant and have to advise that I understand it is the intention of the Department when convenient to transfer children of the Moose Mountain and Assiniboine Agencies from Round Lake School to Brandon School, with a view to making room for the children of this Agency who have been kept out of school as a result of the Round Lake School being overcrowded.\n\nThe Round Lake School is practically a school for the Protestant Indian children of the Agency and naturally it has always been somewhat of a grievance amongst the Protestant Indians of this Agency that they would be told that there was no room for their children whilst there were some 15 to 20 children from other Agencies attending the school.\n\nThe children of both the Moose Mountain and Assiniboine Agencies have to travel by train to school in any case and it is practically the same to them whether they go to the Round Lake or Brandon School.\n\nWith regard to the children mentioned in your letter whilst there was no authority for these transfers the Revd. Mr. Ross had actually sent them to Brandon before I had time to ask for the authority and as there are more than enough children available from this Agency to fill the school without going outside I respectfully ask that these transfers be approved and authorised.\n\nThe Department have set the limit for the number of pupils at this school at 75 which with these transfers and with other children available leaves the school full.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, I beg to say that, in view of your explanation, the transfer of the following children from the Round Lake Residential School to the Brandon Residential School is approved:\n\nNo. 0184 - Winifred Gray\nNo. 0202 - Elizabeth Haywahe\nNo. 0207 - Leona Haywahe\n\nIn future, children should not be transferred without first receiving the permission of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am, however, in receipt of a letter from Rev. R. J. Ross, the Principal of the School at Round Lake, containing certain information which it seems to me should be in the hands of the Department. I am therefore sending it on to you so that you will know that Mr. Ross has provided us with these details concerning the case of the Belanger children.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nEnc.\nStockholm, Sask.,\nApril 17th,\n1933.\n\nRev. K. J. Beaton, B.A.,\nToronto,\nOntario.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nIt is more than a year ago that Mr. Alex Belanger asked me if he could put his children in Round Lake School. As Mr. Belanger is a Catholic, I referred him to the Indian Agent. The Agent later informed me he had received the request, that he had informed Mr. Belanger that he would require to sign an affidavit agreeing to have his children brought up in the Protestant faith and that he was giving him a good long time to consider the matter before giving him the opportunity even of taking that step.\n\nAt some time during the winter the affidavit was signed and forwarded to Ottawa for approval. The oldest child was sent to us by the mother about a month ago and has been here since. A recent letter from the Agent informs me that the Department has ordered that these children must attend a Catholic school.\n\nA number of Indians gathered on Friday near the school to be with their children during the holiday and to take part in the communion service which was held here yesterday. With these Protestant Indians came Mrs. Belanger and she requested that I baptise her three months old child.\n\nI asked as to her past. She informed me that she was born at Ramsack and had been baptised in her infancy by Rev. Mr. Mawhinney. She had received her education at File Hills school. She had joined the Catholic church when she married and had had her four children baptised by the priest. But as neither she nor her husband wished to have their children trained in a Catholic school, she had decided to come back to her own church.\n\nWhen I told her what the Department ordered, she asked if she could have all her children baptised. So we baptised all five last night.\n\nHer husband is at present serving a term in jail charged with non-support of his family.\n\nOn no occasion have I ever used any influence to induce these people to change their religion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) R.J. Ross,\n\nCopied - JGA.\nOttawa, May 9th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the letter you received from Rev. R. J. Ross, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe information contained in Rev. Mr. Ross' letter was conveyed to the Department by Mr. Agent Ostrander in a letter dated March 20th, last. This latter letter was very carefully considered and the conclusion was reached that the Belanger children should be considered Catholics. I feel that you will agree with me that it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to conform as closely as possible with the intention of the Indian Act, viz., that Catholic children should be assigned to schools conducted under Catholic auspices and Protestant children to schools conducted under Protestant auspices. Under these circumstances, Mr. Ostrander was informed that the Department was not prepared to approve of the admission of the Belanger children to the Round Lake Indian Residential School.

On my next visit to the school, after these instructions were issued, I found the children still at the school and when I enquired into the matter the Principal informed me that his church authorities were making arrangements about them.\n\nThe Principal now informs me that he has had a communication from his church authorities to the effect that if the father joins the United Church it will be in order for the children to be sent to the Round Lake School. Belanger has not yet joined the United Church but has signed some kind of an acknowledgement which the Reverend Principal has forwarded to the Church authorities for further action. I have not seen this document.\n\nI may say that Belanger is now out of goal, having recently completed his sentence, has been working for a white farmer near the reserve and assisting his family as far as possible from wages earned, but I am having some difficulty keeping the husband and wife from separating as the wife has now become stubborn and refuses to live with the husband any longer.

P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nStockholm Sask. February 14th, 1934\n\nMr. J. P. R. Ostrander\nBroadview Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nMr. Alex Belanger returned last night and recounted a conversation he had with the priest at Cowessess School. He told the priest that he and his family were Protestant and that his children would be Protestant when they left school if they were forced into his school. He asked that his children not be taught the Catholic Religion. In comparing the educational advantages of the two institutions he said you had only to see the children together to decide which was giving the better education. He instanced the case of a little girl named Tanner aged 13 years and whose father asked him to find out from her the time of day. She could not tell the time of day although she had been 6 years in school. When the priest hinted that influence had been brought to bear upon him to become Protestant, Mr. Belanger at once corrected him, and told him that since his boy was two years old he had been planning to have him educated at Round Lake.\n\nMr. Belanger says he intends to fight the case. He seems to have the sympathy of the Indians, even of the Catholic Indians. If the case goes to court, he will have the sympathy of the public. My own opinion is that he is right in his contention and that he will likely win out in the long run. I therefore strongly advise the Department to drop the case at this stage.\n\nThe case of the other Indians to whom you referred yesterday is entirely different. In fact, they have no case. My chief interest is in seeing that this Indian gets fair play.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned. R. J. Ross.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter 108-1-10 of the 27th ult., and my letter of the 6th instant in the matter of admission of children of Alec Belanger to Cowessess School.\n\nI beg to say that Belanger has agreed to place his oldest child in the Cowessess School at once, but is to take up the matter through a lawyer. It is my intention to prosecute if he does not comply at once.\n\nI have today received a letter from Revd. R. J. Ross, Principal of Round Lake School, a copy of which I am enclosing for consideration.\n\nI would be better able to understand Mr. Ross' attitude in the matter if he was having difficulty in keeping his pupilage up to the maximum of 75 allowed by the Department, but as a matter of fact there are a number of Protestant children in this Agency who are of school age for whom there is no room in Round Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter 108-1-10 of the 27th ult and my reply of yesterday's date I have to advise that this morning G.C. Neff Esq., K.C. of Grenfell phoned me on the matter on behalf of Alec Belanger who had consulted him. He informed me that he had advised Belanger to take his child to Round Lake School.\n\nShortly after this phone message the Revd. Mr. Ross, Principal of Round Lake School phoned me on the matter to ask if it would be permissible for him to take the child in his school. I told him not to do so as he had received very definite instructions from the Department vide your letter 108-1-10 March 14th, 1933 that these children were not to be taken into school pending the Department's decision and also your letter 108-1-10 of the 27th ult which definitely instructed these children to be placed in the Cowessess I.R. School.\n\nI may say that although tomorrow is the last day of grace for Belanger to place his child in the Cowessess I.R. School as instructed under penalty of prosecution, I have decided to delay any proceedings until I receive further instructions from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. F. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 16th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letters of the 16th and 17th ultimo, with reference to the Belanger children.\n\nYou will remember that, when Mr. Sutherland was in the West last fall, this case was fully discussed with him by Mr. Murison and yourself. It was decided at that time that the children should be placed in the Cowessess Indian Residential School and, consequently, instructions were later issued to you to that effect.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to approve of the admission of these children to the Round Lake Residential School. At the same time, we do not wish the compulsory clause of the Indian Act to be invoked in order to compel their entrance to the Cowessess School.\n\nYou should again direct the attention of the Principals of the residential schools in your agency to the instructions contained in circular letter of November 12th, 1926, copies of which are enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.,\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBradview, Sask.\n\nMarch 21st, 1934\n\nSir:\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School has requested the transfer from his school to the Brandon I. R. School of Selina Ironstar and Vera Gray.\n\nThese children are from the Assiniboine Reserve at Sintaluta and as there are vacancies at Brandon School to accommodate them and there are also children waiting to be admitted to the Round Lake School from this Agency I beg to recommend that this request be granted.\n\nThe cost of transportation will not be a charge to the Department.\n\nThese cases are similar to those dealt with in your letters 108-1-10 of December 21st, 1932 and 108-1-10 of May 22nd 1933.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from the Revd. R. J. Ross, Principal of the Round Lake I. R. School with reference to the admission of a son of Louis Crowe of Kaskewistahaw Band to his school.\n\nThis case is very similar to that of the Alec Belanger children regarding which there has been a great deal of correspondence between the Department and this office and to which a definite ruling has been given that the children must not be admitted to the Round Lake School.\n\nSince receiving this letter I have had a talk with Louis Crowe and he has furnished me with the following particulars.\n\nHe and his wife were both baptised as Catholics when babies. For some reason Louis was admitted to the Round Lake School where he received his education. His wife was educated at the Qu'Appelle I. R. School at Lebret. The child now in question was baptised as a Catholic at Lebret (the father states that this was against his wishes but that is beside the point). In conversation with Louis Crowe today he expressed a willingness to place the child in any other I. R. School but he strongly objects to placing him in the Cowessess I. R. School.\n\nAt the present time there seems to be a strong feeling amongst the Indians against the Revd. Fr. Chatelaine, Principal at that school and I think his refusal to allow the boy to be placed there is because of this feeling at the present time.\n\nThe boy is only 7 years old and I do not think that there is any need for him to be placed in school immediately but if the Revd. Fr. Leonard of the Qu'Appelle School is looking for recruits the boy could be sent there if the Department so desires.\n\nKindly instruct me in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nCOPY.\n\nStockholm Sask.\nMarch 31st, 1934\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\u2014\n\nMrs. Louis Crowe is in the office just now. She tells me her boy is 7 years of age and that she and her husband wish to put him in this school. As you know she is Catholic and Louis is Protestant. Without her husband knowing it, she had the boy baptised by the Priest. Please ask the Department for permission to admit this boy after the summer holidays. Mr. Louis Crowe was a pupil of this school for many years. He is not here himself or else I would have asked him to sign an application form.\n\nYours truly,\n\nsigned. R.J. Ross.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Through correspondence with Mr. Ostreider, the Indian Agent, it appears that at the moment the children in question are not attending school, and of course this is unsatisfactory for all parties concerned.\n\nAs you are aware this man and his family are no longer Roman Catholic, in fact the wife never has been; they are all members of the United Church and have applied to have these children admitted to Round Lake School, but permission has been refused.\n\nThere appears to be some regulation to the effect that children shall go to the school of the church in which they are first baptized. This is hard to understand, and appears to be a direct contravention of the Indian Act, for under the provisions of such a Protestant child cannot be forced to attend a Roman Catholic school. The result in this case appears to be that the children are refused attendance at the school of their religion, and now are barred from an education.\n\nFrom a legal angle it would appear as it would be possible to take the necessary action through the courts to force admission to Round Lake school, but surely there is some way whereby the matter can be arranged without going to this extremity. I may say however, that my client advises me that he positively refuses to have his children attend the Roman Catholic institution.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is not, however, prepared to approve the admission of his children to the Round Lake School at the present time. This school has the full number of pupils for which a per capita allowance is provided, and, therefore, there is no accommodation in it for the Belanger children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Belanger, #770- your 108-1-10.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant in this matter, and note what you say. My client takes the position that his child has the right to an education as a matter of right, both under the original treaty, and under the Indian Act, and cannot understand why you cannot make provision for same.\n\nAt the moment the father is liable to prosecution under the truancy provisions of the Indian Act, although he is ready and willing to have his child go to the school of his choice. The fact that the Round Lake School is now up to the number for which a grant is paid, does not assist my client, and he contends it does not relieve the department of its responsibility of furnishing an education. As it now stands the child is deprived of the beginning of an education, for which no one is responsible other than your department. It is neither right, nor fair that the matter should rest as it is; therefore I shall be glad to hear from you definitely whether the department refuses to arrange a proper school for the child in question.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was decided that the death was purely accidental and that no inquest was necessary. The facts were as follows:\n\nThe school is on the north side of the lake. On the 29th, the day before the accident, there was a high wind from the south, which carried a boat, belonging to Charles Assinaboine, Indian of Ochapowace Reserve, from the south to the north shore, near the school. That evening some of the school boys were seen playing with the boat and were ordered to stay away from it and they were again warned the morning of the 30th by the Reverend Principal. When the children were let out for recess at 3:00 P.M., three of them went down to the lake, unknown by any of the school staff. They commenced playing with the boat and the deceased boy was in the boat. There was a high wind from the north, which carried the boat away from shore with the boy in it. The other two boys tried to catch the boat, but it drifted out into deep water and they were unable to reach it. It continued to drift out and when it was about 200 feet from shore the boy became very frightened and jumped out of it into about eight feet of water. The boy could swim a little, but as the waves were high, he soon sank. The other two boys immediately ran to the school and informed the Reverend Principal and every effort was made to locate the body, but it took two hours and there was no life in the body when it was found.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask.\nJuly 21st, 1934\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to advise that I have received a request from the Reverend Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential school that:\n\n- Georgina Haywahe\n- Julia Ironstar be transferred to the Brandon I. R. School in order that room may be made for pupils from these reserves wishing to attend school.\n\nI beg to recommend that these transfers be granted.\n\nThe Revd. Principal also requests that Leonard Stevenson of Cowessess Band be also transferred as he wishes to go to the Brandon School to take a technical course but I do not feel that I can recommend this as the additional expense would not be justified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. E. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st instant, I beg to say that the Department approves the transfer of Georgina Haywahe, No. 0194, and Julia Ironstar, No. 0195, from the Round Lake Indian Residential School to the Brandon Indian Residential School. The transfer is approved, on the understanding that the Department will not be responsible for their transportation expenses to Brandon.\n\nIn view of your report, we are not prepared to approve the transfer of Leonard Stevenson to the Brandon School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nStockholm, Sask., July 21st., 1934\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 18th inst. and also the Deputy Superintendent's circular of the 15th ultimo.\n\nOn receipt of the circular I investigated the ages of the older pupils and found that some of them were reported one or two years older than they really were. I had taken the ages the parents gave me when the children entered school. In the second quarterly report, the revised list of ages is given.\n\nJean Thomas, age 16, wishes to take her Grade VIII examination next year.\n\nSelina Ironstar, age 18, has been transferred to the Brandon School. Albert Wasacase, age 17, is expected to leave school on August 16th. and we intend to ask for his discharge at that time.\n\nLeonard Stevenson, age 16, wishes to attend the Technical School at Brandon and we have already applied for his transfer to the Brandon Indian Residential School. He passed his Grade VIII Examination.\n\nArthur George, age 16, was not able to attend school when he was of school age owing to the condition of his health. He also had trachoma in an advanced stage. He has not had the advantages in school that the ordinary Indian child has and we recommend that he be allowed to return if he so wishes. He has been in school only\nand a half years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal Round Lake Indian Residential School.\nOttawa, July 27, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, Jean Thomas may remain in the Round Lake Residential School for another year. If Arthur George wishes to return he may also remain for another year; but, in view of his age, the Department considers that it would be advisable to keep him in the school for any longer period.\n\nMr. Agent Ostrander has been advised that the Department is not prepared to transfer Leonard Stevenson to the Brandon School.\n\nIn order to carry out the instructions contained in the Deputy Superintendent General's circular of the 16th ultimo, you should, at the end of each academic year, in future, forward to the Department, through the office of your local Indian Agent, a list, giving the names and register numbers of the children in the Round Lake School who are 16 years of age and over. In the case of those who, you consider, should remain for a further period, such permission should be requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nSaskatoon, Sask.\n\nSeptember 4th, 1934\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter 108-1-10\nof the 16th March last concerning the Belanger children\nI have to advise I am in receipt of a letter from G.C. Heff\nEsq., K.C., making further enquiries as to what has been\ndone in the matter.\n\nI would be glad to be advised what action I shall take\nin the matter.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. F. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 13, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with further reference to the Belanger children.\n\nWhen this man first endeavoured, about a year ago, to have his children placed in the Round Lake Indian Residential School, the information received by the Department indicated that he had been recognized as a Roman Catholic, and, consequently, the Department refused to admit his children to the Round Lake School. From subsequent information, it appears that Belanger is now recognized as a member of the United Church of Canada.\n\nPlease make definite enquiry, and if you are satisfied that Belanger and his family are now adherents of the United Church of Canada, you may forward applications and certificates of health for the admission of his children to the Round Lake Indian Residential School. When forwarding these applications, you should state definitely if you have made the enquiry mentioned in this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask.\nSeptember 25th, 1934\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Revd. Principal of the Round Lake I.R. School requests that Albert Wasacase #148 be discharged from that school as he is now 17 years of age.\n\nI beg to recommend that this request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 4, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I have to say that approval is granted for the discharge of pupil No. 148, Albert Wasacase, from the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Please advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. P. B.

Under these circumstances, the Department has no alternative but to allow the education of the children under Protestant auspices and the admission of Norman and Reynold Belanger to the Round Lake Indian Residential School is approved. The Department does not consider that this case should form a precedent as only those children can be admitted to the Round Lake School whose parents are recognized as Protestants.\n\nThe Principals of both schools in your agency should be urged to confine their recruiting activities to families who are recognized as members of their respective churches.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nPP/O'M.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that there is an Indian girl at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, Mary Taggart by name, who has an opportunity of going to Vancouver to take her Grade 3 and continue in her studies there until permitted to take up her duties in training for a nurse. She is an exception girl and the matron of the school has a married son in Vancouver who wants Mary to stay there with them during the time she is at school where she will have a home and proper supervision during the time she is attending classes. Mrs. Therian, the Matron of Round Lake School, who has been granted furlough for three months, proposes going to Vancouver and would take Mary along with her, provided arrangements can be made with the Department to permit Mary to go there and attend school as cited above. Dr. Therian and his wife have offered her a home and the church authorities have taken up the question of her admittance in training for a nurse with the Hospital authorities in Vancouver and received definite assurance that when she secures the required certificates, she will be admitted.\n\nAs there is considerable expense as to her books & clothes in attending a school in Vancouver, the school authorities here ask if she could be continued on their roll as a pupil of Round Lake School, when they would attend to her tuition and board themselves from here.\n\nMary has about $15. here at the office which would do for pin money en route, to Vancouver and asks that her treaty and interest be kept for her to draw upon while at school for her other requirements. Her parents have agreed to let her go. Mrs. Therian, the matron's son, Dr. Therian and wife, have agreed to give her a home with them while attending school, and now seek Department's permission with the continued grant to Round Lake school for Mary to send her there where she has an opportunity to make good. She has attained the age for leaving school and wants to go to Vancouver to finish and go into training for a nurse.\nMay I have Department permission to authorize this and if so as Mrs. Therian is leaving for Vancouver on June 29th, would I be authorized to issue her a free transportation requisition from Broadview to Vancouver.\n\nFor the extra clothing she would need in attending an outside school, Mrs. Therian states that the church are prepared to look after that and she herself personally will look after Mary's purchases.\n\nAs there is not very much time between now and the end of the month could I have this authority by wire so that Mary can get ready in time to go with Mrs. Therian.\n\nAll arrangements have been made by the church authorities for her tuition and board, the whole thing hinges on securing Department authority to permit the Round Lake School to continue her on their roll as a grant earning pupil, from which her tuition, books and board will be attended to.\n\nShe is an exceptional girl for an Indian and believe she warrants this opportunity of furthering her studies being granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.

At this time the mother was a widow running all over the place and had no facilities for looking after this child. Now she has remarried and is asking for the child to be returned to her until she becomes of school age. The Revd. Principal of Round Lake School says the child is too young to gain any advantage from class room work but I personally feel that now the child is in school it might be as well to let her remain there. I would be glad to receive instructions from the Department in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.R.

Such action would have the tendency of making the mother realize that she is at least partly responsible for the child's maintenance. However, if the home conditions are not suitable it would appear preferable to leave the girl in the Round Lake School.

Restriction in this regard seemingly is something new to this group of Indians, so much so that I fear they lay the blame for the exercise of discipline in this matter on what may be termed the enthusiasms of a New Principal.\n\nTrusting we may receive from you at your earliest convenience the information that will result in making the above matter clear and satisfactory to all, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFOR ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nSeptember 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the principal of the Round Lake residential school in which he requests a definite ruling regarding the allowance of Christmas holidays to the pupils.\n\nFor the information of the Principals of the Indian residential schools in your Agency and yourself I enclose copies of the regulations covering the granting of holidays in Indian residential schools. For reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you the Department has always taken the position that the allowing of holidays during the winter season is neither in the best interests of the pupils themselves nor conducive to the progress of the residential schools. We would have no objection to the children going home for Christmas day only provided that they would return to the school the same evening. As a matter of fact it would be preferable for the schools to arrange some special celebration on either Christmas day or one of the days of Christmas week and have the parents come to the school and spend the day with their children.\n\nPlease advise the principal of the Round Lake residential school and the principal of the Cowessess residential school regarding our wishes in the above matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Though I have made several inquiries I can add very little to what I mentioned in my letter of July 14th.\n\nLequahquay is at present in the army. I interviewed Mrs. Lequahquay and while she admitted signing the declaration mentioned in our previous letter (copy of which is enclosed herewith) she stated that she had done so because Round Lake School was full at the time and as her husband was away she was unable to support her children. She signed the statement that she and her husband were Roman Catholics as this was the only way she could have them admitted to Cowessess School.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter from Lequahquay forwarded to me today by Mr. Huston. From this and from Mrs. Lequahquay's present attitude it would appear that it is the parents wishes that the children should be sent to Round Lake School.\n\nI may add that I asked Lequahquay for a written statement but he evidently forwarded it to Mr. Huston instead of myself.

C.,\nSept. 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir-\n\nMy wife writes that the children have not been yet admitted to the school on account of Religion. I myself as a child was first admitted to the Crooked Lake School, but was transferred to the Round Lake school and I have never had any intention to let any of my own children enter into the Catholic School and it was certainly a big mistake that my wife made in letting my two little ones go there, of course she never had anything to do with Catholic religion or was never in their church or knew about their beliefs, so that I do not blame her for putting them there. When Rev. Ross told her that the Round Lake School was full, I was out working at the time and she must have run short of food, and I understand that Mr. Ostrander the Indian Agent would not help her at the time. She thought that one Industrial School was just the same as another, I had the experience of being in both schools so that I will go to any means in getting my little ones educated in the Round Lake school or any other but a Catholic school. My wife and I are both strong believers in the religion that Mr. H. McKay taught us and I am sure that Rev. Huston, you will do all you can to have my little ones educated in the school I attended.\n\nNow that I am older and have the responsibility of looking after a family, I am sorry that I did not try to learn more when I had the chance so that I wish to give my children all the chance of learning that I can,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nPte. Archie Mequakquay.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant the Department is prepared to approve the transfer of Henry Bear from the Round Lake Residential School to the Brandon Residential School. I note that this boy is past Grade 8 and presumably the mother wishes him to attend high school. It should be distinctly understood that in transferring him to Brandon the Department will only pay his per capita grant at that school. Any extra expenses that may be incurred in sending him to high school will have to be paid by the mother. These extra expenses will probably amount to $100.00 or more each academic year. I am so advising the Principal of the Brandon Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nOttawa, September 3, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Huston:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to Bella McKay.\n\nOur funds are so limited this year that it is found impossible to favourably consider allowing tuition grants for pupils who wish to attend high school for the first time. As you are probably aware, if this girl was transferred to the Brandon School in order to permit her to take high school work, there would be considerable additional expense, over and above your per capita allowance. This amount would increase as her education advanced. There is the additional fact that, even though Indian girls are given higher education, our experience shows that it is extremely difficult for them to obtain positions as a result of their educational qualifications. I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your application regarding Bella McKay, but I feel you will realize that she has been treated in the same manner as many other applicants throughout the Dominion.\n\nMrs. Ross has decided to teach in our Walpole Island Day School during the coming academic year. She was very successful at Moraviantown, and I feel certain that she will meet with equal success in her new school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend A. C. Huston,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Residential School,\nWhitewood, Sask.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nYour letter of August the twenty second was handed to me along with an accumulated amount of mail when I returned from my holidays last night. That will I trust explain my delay in reply.\n\nRegarding your enquiry concerning Belle McKay #0217, we had hoped that she might be permitted to go to Brandon. She is the only one among all our graduates for whom we are making this request. We hope the Department will see fit to grant this favor. The only expense to the Department would be the amount of grant allowed the Indian Residential School at Brandon for each pupil in attendance. This girl I had hoped would be able to begin her studies when school opens to-morrow but due to my absence there has been considerable delay. Would you kindly give this matter your immediate attention. Our new address is Whitewood, Saskatchewan.\n\nMrs. R.J. Ross often spoke of you. Mr. Ross who retired three years ago died about two months ago. We hope sometime to have Mrs. Ross back on our staff. There are few teachers could compare with her when it came to transforming Indians. Trusting you too have had a good vacation. I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This admission form has been forwarded to me by Indian Agent, W.J.D. Kerley, requesting that I complete the Medical examination and forward the original copy direct to Ottawa.\n\nThis Indian child was admitted to the Qu'Appelle Indian Hospital on December 21, 1941 with a minimum Pulmonary Lesion.\n\nThis little girl was living with her Grandparents at the time of her admission to hospital. Her Mother is dead and her Father has not remarried. Both the Grandparents are chronic spreaders. To return this child to that home is only going to expose her to mass re-infection. According to the information received from Mr. Kerley, there is accommodation at the Round Lake School. They already have their allotted number, therefore, no grant is available at present for this child.\n\nThis child will not benefit further from hospital care, she has reached the age when she will benefit by attending school. It would be folly to return her to her Grandparents home, which is just a hot bed for Tuberculous infection.\n\nFor the above reasons, I beg to recommend that the annual grant be paid to Round Lake School for this child, so that she may be admitted, thereby freeing a bed in the hospital, which is needed for other cases requiring immediate treatment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.D.\nMedical Superintendent\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA\nOttawa,\nJanuary 25, 1943.\n\nMr. W.J.D.

King Acoose and his son Ernest who is attending Cowessess School. I understand that King Acoose has been to P.C. Jeff of Greenfell to get him to write a letter to the Department about the boy being taken back to school in the spring time. Mr. King came by me and asked me to phone the Agent about getting her boy Ernest out of school to help with the thrashing as his father was unable to work on the thrashing gang due to boils on his elbow. I thought to let the Agency and I could not contact the Agent so I told Mr. Blanch the clerk what she wanted and he said he would tell the Agent as soon as he saw him. The next day the boy was home on the reserve and he did not show up at the thrashing outfit.\n\nI had to go to Greenfell to get some welding done for the thrashing outfit.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nImagine several days after he was home and he was in town with his father and mother on a load of wood. I met the Agent who was there and he asked me where Raymond Acrose and Ernest Acrose were at\u2014they both had to be returned to school. Raymond Acrose had come to town with me so I told the Agent that both boys were in town so he said he would take them back to school. The Agent said I want to see King Acrose about it so I went with him and found King Acrose and the Agent explained to him that the boy had to return to school.\n\nKing Acrose told the Agent that he needed the boy home to help him put up his hay. The Agent told him that his hay would have been up long before this.\n\nKing Acrose has about three or four loads of hay up, he has all the horse power he needs and more, his mower is in good repair and there is no reason for him not having his hay up in July. In the month of July he had his boy home from school and his two grown up sons also and there was no reason why he could not have put all his hay cut and stacked then. The trouble was he bought...\na car and they were to bury running around in it.\n\nI got king enough clover seed in the spring of 1943 to sow ten acres and it turned out to be a good crop. After Regina Fair I got him to cut it and told him he could stack it after it had laid for a day, so he stacked it and that is as far as he gets there was two lovely weeks of buying weather at the time, but it just laid that in coils and up to two weeks ago it was still laying out there. I have not seen it lately as I have been busy with road work.\n\nHe has two big hay flats with about forty loads of hay in them. He has not touched and I asked him if he would let another Indian put it up on stores but he refused. He has his married son George from helping him manage the farm and they are in no season with the equipment they face that they could not be right up to date with their work.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nH.C.

King Acoose has eight horses and twenty head of cattle.\n\nThe boy Ernest has been in school seven years and is now in Grade 7. He is a fairly good pupil. I discussed this matter with the Reverend Principal of Cowessess School and we both feel that this boy is not essential at home as King Acoose has a married son living on the farm. If we gave permission to this boy we would have many similar requests on the same grounds.\n\nHe had the boy home during the two months of holidays and instead of putting up hay was driving around in their car. He has only a small stack of hay up but has plenty of straw and there is an abundance of hay on the reserve which can be purchased from the proceeds of his crop.\n\nI am returning Mr. Neff's letter herewith and also a letter on the above matter from Mr. Ainger, Farm Instructor on the Sakimay Reserve.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 10, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 8, with reference to the son of King Acoose of the Sakimay Band. For your information I may say that the statement Acoose made to you, namely, that he has 35 cattle and 15 horses, is incorrect, as this Indian only has 20 head of cattle and 8 horses.\n\nWe have carefully investigated Acoose's request to have his son discharged from the Round Lake Residential School. It appears that the boy is making reasonable progress at the school mentioned, as he has completed one grade each year, which is the average for any child. Reports that we have received indicate that Acoose does not need his son to help him, as an older, married son is now living at home. Taking everything into consideration the Department feels that it is in the best interests of Ernest Acoose to remain at the Round Lake Residential School and we are not prepared to grant his discharge at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-10, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, January 25, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your December Quarterly Return. It is very important that your school have this Return properly prepared as the Per Capita Allowance is paid on the average attendance which is paid from the number of days pupils are in residence during the Quarter.\n\nIn reviewing your Return, we find that in some cases you have not requested as many days grant as you should have. I believe, that you have not carefully noted circular letter of December 29th, 1944, nor the notes on the preparation of the Return shown on the back page of the form.\n\nI wish to direct your attention to the following specific cases:\n\n1. No. 250 is stated to have been transferred to the Gordon's School. No grant is requested for this pupil nor is the date of transfer given. If she was transferred to the Gordon's School on October 1st, this is correct not to request grant but if she was in the school for any period during the December Quarter grant should be requested.\n\n2. Pupil No. 258. Grant is requested for seventy days but there is no explanation in the column for remarks stating why she was not present during the full Quarter.\n\n3. Pupil No. 265. If this boy was not in residence at all during the Quarter the Return is correct. If he was in residence for any period, grant should be requested for that period.\n4. Pupil No. 273. Grant is requested for twenty-four days as he is stated to have been out of school for five weeks. If you refer to circular letter of December 29th, 1944, you will note that the Department allows grant for thirty days sick leave. Consequently, in this case if the boy was in residence for twenty-four days the school is entitled for grant of fifty-four days.\n\n5. No. 0244. The name of this pupil was shown on the September Return and grant requested for her. The statement is made \"Not in attendance\". What is meant by this? Was she absent for the full Quarter?\n\n6. No. 0248. What is stated above regarding pupil No. 250 also applies in this case.\n\n7. No. 0255. What has been stated regarding pupil No. 273 also applies in this case.\n\n8. No. 0259. The same case as No. 0255.\n\n9. No. 0266. The Return states that she was in the classroom for twenty-one days and no grant is requested for her. Under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during the Quarter\" is marked nil.\n\n10. No. 0270. What has been stated regarding No. 0266 also applies in this case.\n\n11. No. 0282. What has been stated regarding No. 0285 also applies in this case.\n\nIt is possible that you are entitled to grant for the full Quarter if the pupil was in attendance at the school for sixty-two days or more. You are entitled to ninety-two days grant when you take into consideration the thirty days grant allowed for sick leave.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. Gard,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Res. School,\nStockholm, Saskatchewan.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention, Mr. Philip Phelan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith an amended quarterly Return for quarter ended December 31st, 1945 and may I thank you for your letter of instruction covering specific cases.\n\nI note that I made one careless mistake in dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of pupils in residence\" instead of the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nApart from that I should like to say that, at the time I came to this school the Principalship had been vacant two weeks and there was no one to guide me in the work. What I have learned has been mostly by experience.\n\nMay I say too, that I have not found a copy of the circular letter of December 23rd, 1944. If one is now available I should like to have a copy.\n\nHowever, the instruction you have given me in regard to specific cases has been informative and helpful.\n\nI am sending a revised quarterly return to Mr. Kerley for his signature and asking that he forward it to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFOR ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Looking in my file I find that I had a copy of such report. It may be that I sent both copies to the Agent at Broadview in error. At any rate he has not as yet notified me of any such omission.\n\nI have made new copies on which I have placed two more names. One of them, Verna Baer is helping at home and has no apparent intention of returning to school. In any case we have a full roll at present. The other pupil, Evelyn Baer, is at the school in Brandon.\n\nWe have three other pupils not in attendance at present through sickness and injuries and these will show on the January-March Report. These three will return when the Doctor so advises.\n\nThanking you for the direction you have given in the matter of the Quarterly Returns,\n\nyours truly,\n\nFOR ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

J.A. Card,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School,\nStockholm, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Card:\n\nWe have received your telegram of April 16th, but as stated in my wire the information was too indefinite to make any decision. When we hear from Mr. Ostrander the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nIt is difficult for us to understand why there should be any disagreement in connection with Easter holidays. It has never been our practice to authorize Easter holidays at residential schools. It has always been understood that the pupils should remain in residential schools during the Easter session.\n\nThe only authorized holidays are the months of July and August and the Christmas holiday leave about which you are advised each year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to the telegram which the Department received from Reverend J.A. Card, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, and Army Message, File 661-10 (B.1), dated April 19th, 1949, to me in connection with truancy of the children in the Round Lake School, and Mr. Card's recommendation that they be expelled, I have discussed the matter with Indian Superintendent W.J.D. Kerley, and certainly the expulsion of two boys will not correct our troubles at this school.\n\nThe story seems to be that an Indian of the Cowessess Band, John Stevenson, received permission from Mr. Card for his daughter to go home to the Cowessess Reserve for Easter. Upon hearing this, Herbert Sparvier, an Indian of the Kahkanistahaw Band, who had a boy, Crawford, 12 years old, and a younger boy, in the Round Lake School, made the request that he be permitted to take them home for Easter, and was refused. Crawford Sparvier has been truant several times, and, fairly recently, was one of several boys who broke into the pantry at the school and stole extracts, which is the reason for Mr. Card refusing to permit him to go home for Easter. Sparvier then took Crawford and his younger brother away from the school without permission of the Principal, following which Mr. Card apparently wired the Department, as he says, \"to see where I stood\".\n\nMr. Card does not have proper control in his school, as is quite evident by the fact that some of the boys were able to break into the pantry and steal extracts. He makes little attempt to keep control most of the time, and on the rare occasions when he does attempt control, he is not very successful. I am certainly not in favour of expulsion of the Sparvier boys, and I am also not in favour of transferring them to the Brandon School, which has been suggested by Mr. Kerley.\n\nI have heard rumours that Mr. Card is slated for the Principalship of another Indian residential school when the Round Lake School folds up. I hope the Department will not permit this,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-10, part 3)\nas his management at the Round Lake School indicates that he is entirely unsuited to such work.\n\nJ.B.B.

J.A. Card,\nPrincipal\n\nWhitewood,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is my duty to inform you that a number of our school boys ages 12 to 16 have been crossing into the reserve without leave.\n\nIt is apparent that more than one has had access to spirituous liquor while away. Some of these boys were among those who broke into the pantry some weeks ago and took four bottles of extract, 16 oz. size. One boy was in very bad condition and had to be carried up to the dormitory.\n\nOur punishment does not seem to deter these lads from going across into the reserve where the supply of liquor seems to be.\n\nSome action must be taken to remove this menace and if not successful a strict ban must be put against all visiting on the reserve.\n\nSgd. J.A. Card,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School.\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe Woman's Missionary Society\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nRev. J.A. Card,\nPrincipal\n\nWhitewood,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my other letter.\n\nAfter the Christmas Holidays we had a number of run-a-ways which brought about an investigation by Mr. Kerley with a member of the R.C.M.P. here in the school.\n\nAmong the run-a-ways were two boys of one Herbert Sparvier. This parent brought charges against the teacher who had administered punishment in a perfect manner. The children were given the support of the parents and directed to run away if punished.\n\nThis day I had good reason to punish the older boy and again he left the school and I suppose headed for home.\n\nHe has been somewhat of an agitator. He took part in breaking into our school pantry and taking four 16 oz. bottles of extracts. One of the group was blank out and had to be carried in to bed.\n\nAt Easter the parents were encouraged to come down to the school and visit the children, but not to take the pupils back home. The visiting hours were 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and this for 4 days.\n\nIn spite of this privilege the mother took her school children home for the four days against my warning. Had I been sure of my authority in this matter I should have requested that they be barred from this school.\n\nNow I shall refuse to accept this boy back again. His school will have to continue somewhere so far as I am concerned.\n\nOn one occasion when this boy had skipped out I went in bob sleigh to bring him back. The father threatened my life at that time. These people are thinking and agitating for day school which they are not ready for.\n\nIf you can give us any advice or direction in handling these situations, and especially the liquor problem, we should be grateful.\n\nI am,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSgd.

Card, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School in connection with the truancy and misconduct of certain boys in his school, and referred to in Department Army Message to me dated April 19th, 1949.\n\nI have no comment to make in connection with this other than that it is a rather clear indication that Mr. Card has little control over the children in his school. It is to be hoped that if this school is to continue in operation for the next term a more capable Principal will be placed in charge.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nTo Mr. Philan:\n\n1. Indian schools should use the non-alcoholic flavourings.\n2. Principals should not pursue pupils outside the school premises. Some other officer should take over.\n3. A register of punishments, corporal and other, should be maintained in all schools. It is useless to talk about punishments that were not recorded.\n4. The Easter season should be spent in school with due regard for religious observances.\n\nC.R.C.\n2/5\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bell\nActs.\nJuly 16th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Murison,\n\nFor your information I am enclosing herewith the auditor's report on the Round Lake Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report of an examination made of the books and records at the above school on June 12th, 1936.\n\nThe examination covers a period of one fiscal year dating from 1/4/35 to 31/3/36.\n\nBank Reconciliation - Statement #1\n\nThere are two bank accounts kept at this school, one being a Trust Account and the other the Savings. The two pass books from the Imperial Bank, Broadview, were on hand and written up to the end of March.\n\nThe Trust Account balance was $37.97 and the Savings $273.65. The outstanding cheques amounted to $310.95, leaving a net balance of 69 cents, which agrees with cash book.\n\nRevenue in the Dr. cash book was compared to pass book entries and all cancelled cheques to the Cr. entries. Vouchers were attached to the cancelled cheques and these were compared to synoptic entries.\n\nThere has evidently been an improvement in analysing the vouchers as they all appeared to be in the correct column in synoptic.\n\nA bank adjustment is made every month and the balance carried forward.\n\nReceipts & Expenditures - Statement #2\n\nThis statement was prepared from an analysis of the monthly synoptic totals and shows the total receipts to be $13,282.27 for the year.\n\nThe revenue from farm $1742.52 is somewhat lower than last year owing to the poor crop, but the sale of six purebred cattle helped materially.\n\nThe revenue from other sources includes the night watchman, $280.00, prize money $583.25, and sale of candies etc. $127.60.\n\nThe expenditures were $13,282.58 and it will be seen that they are $3,000.00 over the per capita grant.\n\nN. G. Allen, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReceipts & Expenditures (Cont'd.)\n\nThe salaries show a reduction from last year and also the food and fuel. The fuel is exceptionally low for a school of this size, but the wood was secured from the school land. The farm expenses have always been very high at this school owing to the Principal concentrating so much time and money on his herd of purebred cattle. While the prize money won at the several fairs is fairly large, it is questionable whether it will pay the expenses in freight, hired help, etc., which is necessary for the purpose.\n\nThe cost per day shows a decrease of $10.00, but the estimated revenue from farm was included in this amount. The cost of food this year shows a reduction of $42.00, but here again the cost \"in kind\" was included.\n\nOwing to the Principal being away all week, I was not able to get all the information required, but the farm instructor advised that 12 cattle and 6 pigs were killed for use in the school.\n\nThe livestock consists of 86 cattle, with 24 milking, 19 pigs and 19 horses.\n\nThe crop last year produced 900 bus. Wheat, 1500 bus. Oats and 100 bus. Flax.\n\nThe farming operations consist of 350 acres under cultivation and with present prospects, the returns should be real good this year.\n\nThe books and records appear to be kept in very good condition at present, which is evidently an improvement over previous years.\n\nThe Principal has always concentrated his efforts to maintaining a large herd of purebred cattle and, in a school of this kind, it is very questionable whether this is a good policy.\n\nAs stated above, I was unable to discuss the several matters with the Principal, but the cash book and cheques were made available by Mrs. Ross.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report:\n\n1 - Bank Reconciliation, Receipts & Expenditures\n2 - Cost of Operation & Salaries\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Allan, Esq.,\nAudit Accountant,\nAuditor General's Dept.,\nConfederation Bldg.,\nOttawa.\n\n/B\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my report on an examination made of the books and records at the above School on March 27th., 1938.\n\nThe examination covered a period of twenty-one (21) months, dating from the last audit, March 21st., 1936, to December 31st., 1937. Although the entries for January and February had been made in the Cash Book, there were no totals and the Pass Book and paid cheques were only available to December 31st., 1937.\n\nThe Pass Book balance at that date was $1,032.51, with outstanding cheques of $537.52, and no cash on hand. The net balance of $494.99 agreed with Cash Book.\n\nAll receipts are deposited and were compared to pass book credits. All cheques were examined and compared to Cash Book entries and all vouchers are attached to the paid cheques. These were compared by test to Synoptic entries and appeared to be posted correctly.\n\nPrevious to March, 1937, there were two Bank accounts maintained but since that time the savings account has been discontinued and only the Current account remains. The banking is done in the Imperial Bank, Broadview, thirty-five miles away.\n\nA bank adjustment is made every month and the balance carried forward.\n\nReceipts and Expenditures.\n\nThis statement was prepared from a recapitulation of the monthly totals from Synoptic. The total receipts for this period amounted to $30,646.27, with the per capita grant being $22,940.95. The farm revenue was $6,156.94 and is made up as follows: Sale of 1938 grain $1,540.00; prizes at fairs $2,154.50; sale of cattle and hides $1,640.00; and sundry revenue $322.42. The revenue from other sources of $1,547.71 includes refund gas tax $267.00; store sales $742.00; watchman's grant $400.00; and sundry receipts $168.71. The Store Sales are sales made to Indians of clothing donated by the Church and candies, etc., kept at the School for that purpose in return for wood, fruit and some cash supplied by the Indians.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $30,211.28, which is $9,270.98 above the per capita grant. The clothing costs of $6,134.77 is an increase of 11.58 per child, or nearly 100%, but should not be criticized. The food costs of $4,582.62 at $4.92 per pupil does not include the beef, milk and butter supplied from\n\nL. W. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nsupplied from the farm. The repairs and equipment of $1,276.92, is low for an old school of this size for a twenty-one month period and the sewing room and dormitories are in need of urgent repairs and equipment.\n\nThe transportation costs of $1,443.59 include a new car, $550.00; gas and oil $360.00; freight $280.00; and train fares $126.50. The miscellaneous of $577.80 could be reduced by a more accurate budgeting of petty cash expenses into the correct columns of Synoptic.\n\nThe farm expense of $6,947.80 is still very high, and includes expenses re fairs $1,150.00; feed $2,722.22; seed $361.74; combine $321.00; gas and oil $456.00; hardware and repair $742.00; purchase of bull $400.00; and threshing $380.00. While the farm expense is very high this year, owing to the lack of feed, the Principal relies on the revenue from the farm to help finance the School, and has always shown a profit in the prize money at the Summer fairs. He reduced his herd by twenty-five last Fall and butchers an average of twenty-five head a year for the School's needs.\n\nThe farming operations consist of 350 acres under cultivation and 480 acres in pasture. This year 40 acres will be sown to wheat and the rest to oats and barley for feed. The livestock include 75 pure bred cattle; 15 horses; 6 hogs; and 75 poultry. A tractor is also used in the farming operations and Indians are employed for extra labour during the Summer.\n\nThe operation cost of $230.16 per child is very high, but is offset by the revenue from the farm and Store Sales as this cost was based on the actual expenditures as shown in Cash Book.\n\nThe books and records were found to be in very good condition and overdraft charges were only $1.42 during the period. With prospects being excellent for a good crop and pasturage, the Principal should have no difficulty in showing a profit this year, but in continual dry years a large herd of cattle becomes a definite liability.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the co-operation given by Mr. Ross during my audit and all records were made available.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report:\n\n1.

The examination covered a period of fifteen (15) months, dating from January 1st., 1938, to March 31st., 1939.\n\nBank Reconciliation.\n\nThe balance in pass book, as at March 31st., 1939, was shown as $1,420.23. The outstanding cheques amounted to $1,680.05, and the net balance of $57.15 agreed with the cash book. All revenue shown in cash book was deposited and all expenditures are made by cheque. All cheques were examined and compared to cash book entries. Supporting vouchers for expenditures are attached to the paid cheques, and these were compared to synoptic entries. A bank reconciliation is made every month, and balance carried forward.\n\nRevenue and Expenditure.\n\nThe total revenue for this period is shown as $17,822.43, of which the per capita grant was $14,168.40. The revenue from the farm shows $1,013.53 received from the sale of cattle and horses and $1,096.83 from exhibition prizes at the several fairs. A few stores, such as candy, tobacco, etc., are kept for sale, and $416.50 was received from this source.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $16,200.27, and are shown in detail on Statement 2. All expenditures appear to be about normal, with the expenses of exhibiting the cattle at the several fairs being $732.22. Under Farm and Garden I have shown a refund to Church in the amount of $264.80, which the Principal calculates as ten percent of the actual farm revenue. I submit that there does not appear to be any valid reason why this refund should be made, and I advised the new Principal, Mr. Huston, who is to take over in June, to discontinue this procedure, and to retain the total farm revenue for the benefit of the School.

The cost of clothing and food per pupil is about normal at $25.09 and $64.87 respectively. The average number of pupils in attendance was 75.\n\nThe farming operations include 350 acres under cultivation, and the crop cut-turn last Fall was 400 bushels of wheat and 9000 bushels of oats. The livestock consists of 85 head of cattle, 11 horses, 3 pigs and 20 poultry. The Principal has sold about twenty head of cattle, and, with the present prices of milch cows being very good, he intends to dispose of about twenty-five head this Summer.\n\nThe books and records were found to be in very good condition and up-to-date.\n\nWith very little help from the Church, this School has been able to finance itself on its earnings, and, with close supervision of the farming operations and curtailment of the cattle herd to about fifty (50) head, there should be no difficulty in continuing in this manner.\n\nAll questions relating to the financial administration of the School were discussed with Mr. Huston, who is to assume the duties of Principal in June.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the co-operation of Mr. Ross during my examination, and the following statements accompany this report -\n\n1.

Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 26th,\n1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of May 17th, in which you give a quotation from the Report of the travelling auditor relative to Round Lake Indian Residential School. I should like to raise the question of the relation of the auditors to the schools which are operated by the United Church, and I should like to know by what authority any auditor gives instructions to any principal as to how he is to manage the affairs of the school.\n\nOf course, you and I have come into relation to this work quite recently, and it may be that I have not the situation quite clearly in mind. As I see it, we are operating these schools under an agreement entered into between the various Churches and the Department of Indian Affairs in 1910. I have before me a copy of the agreement\u2014in blank of course\u2014and I find that it was to be in effect from April 1st, 1911, for a term of five years. I cannot find in the office any information about its renewal or otherwise. You can, however, advise me what changes have taken place in this agreement.\n\nI find that the Church entered into an agreement with the Superintendent General to do certain things which, in the main, can be stated as to support, maintain and educate in a manner satisfactory to the Superintendent a certain number of pupils. The agreement goes on to state the regulations that govern the admission of the pupils. It says that the school shall be conducted under such regulations as may from time to time be approved by the Superintendent General. The Church agrees to provide such sufficient number of teachers as may, in the opinion of the Superintendent General be necessary for its satisfactory conduct. It agrees to provide teachers and officers qualified to give the pupils religious instruction; to instruct in care of stock, farming, and a whole lot of other things that are laid down in paragraph 9.\n\nThe Church is also to supply the pupils of said school to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General with sufficient clothing, subsistence, etc. The Church undertakes to keep the pupils clean and free from vermin, and to keep and maintain the school buildings in a sanitary condition; also to make certain reports on the school as may from time to time be required.\nThe Church is to permit the Superintendent General, or any person or persons named by him, to inspect the said school buildings and premises.\n\nThat is practically the whole of the agreement from the side of the Church.\n\nThe Superintendent General agrees to pay a certain rate per annum per pupil; the number of pupils so to be paid for not to exceed a certain number. The Superintendent General also agrees to provide the pupils of the said school with medicine, school books, etc.\n\nNow the position which we take is this: That the United Church having made a contract to educate a certain number of children at Round Lake Residential School, for which the Government pays a certain sum, we are under no obligation to render to the Department of Indian Affairs an account of how the money is spent, and we are practically coming to the place where we must ask the Department to confine the attention of its inspectors to their proper sphere\u2014which is to discover whether the Church is living up to the agreement made to provide certain facilities for the education, moral and intellectual, of the children placed in its care. We are quite prepared to admit that the Department has the right to send in as many inspectors as it likes to see that the purpose for which the money is spent is realized; but the details of the method in which this is to be done, we cannot agree are subject to inspection or audit by the auditors of the Department.\n\nI think that, if you will look into it, you will realize that the position which we are taking has very much to support it. I think the alternative would be that, if we are to be subject to audit, etc., then we shall have to take it that the agreement which has been made is null and void. The Department pays us a certain per capita allowance, and we are responsible for providing for the education of the children within that amount of money. If that is not enough, we have to supplement it. If the position which seems to be implied in the auditor's actions and orders were carried to its logical conclusion, then I think the Department would be responsible for any deficit in the operation of these schools. I do not think you can have it both ways.\n\nI wish you would look into this whole matter rather carefully. Some time ago I think a representation was made and the Minister was to give a ruling. I do not know whether this has been done. I may say that if a ruling is given that the auditor has a right to give orders to the school principal, then we shall reserve to ourselves all the rights of protesting against this ruling, and at the same time of drawing the attention of the Minister to the fact that a regulation which is made to apply to one or more institutions must, of necessity, apply to all the institutions of all\nMr. R. A. Hoey-\n\nthe Churches that are operating these schools. I think I am quite within the mark in saying that, at the present time, there are schools in connection with some of the Churches where the principal refuses to allow the auditor to have anything to do with his books.\n\nIf you like to take time to think this over and see under what agreement we operate, I shall be glad if you will let me know, because there is no particular hurry; and it may be that during the summer months, when the Department perhaps is not as busy as it is at some other times, there would be opportunity to make this study, and then you and I can discuss it some time in August.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs.

No change whatever in the procedure followed has taken place in the interval. I shall be glad, however, to go into the matter rather carefully just as soon as the time at my disposal enables me to do so.\n\nThe Treasury officials inform me that about two years ago the Minister assured Parliament that in view of the substantial grants paid by the Government to residential schools a careful audit of these institutions would be made by the Department from year to year. This does not mean, of course, that the auditor has the right to give instructions to any particular Principal with respect to the conduct of a school and I am inclined to agree with you that the Treasury auditors have not the right to issue such instructions.\n\nI feel sure you are in error when you state that there are Principals who refuse to allow the auditor to\n\nRev.

The\naudit covered the period of forty-two (42) months, dating\nfrom April 1, 1939, to September 30, 1942. Because of the\nPrincipal's absence, this school was not audited during Mr.\nWillis' last visit.\n\nBank Reconciliation.\n\nThe pass book from the Bank of Montreal,\nWhitewood, Saskatchewan, showed a deficit of $325.83, as at\nSeptember 30, 1942, and there were outstanding cheques\namounting to $182.07. Cash on hand totalled $15.25, and\nthe net debit balance of $422.65 agreed with the Cash Book.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined and compared to\nCash Book entries. There were vouchers on file for the\nexpenditures, and these were compared to the synoptic entries.\nSeveral changes were necessitated in the synoptic, as little\nattempt had been made to apportion such costs as gasoline and\noil, or hardware. All revenue was deposited and small\ncheques drawn for petty cash purchases. A careful petty cash\nbook is kept, and balanced each month, and all expenditures\nare shown in the synoptic. Although there appeared to be\nvouchers for many cash payments, the method of filing made it\nalmost impossible to check to individual expenditures. This\nmatter was discussed with the Principal, and he promised to\nkeep each month's petty cash vouchers together and filed in\nsequence.\n\nThe total revenue for the period amounted to\n$54,830.25, including per capita grant and bonus of $42,965.81.\nChurch grants amounted to $3,133.34, and farm revenue totalled\n$6,742.14, chiefly from the sale of cattle. The present\nPrincipal has discontinued the practice of exhibiting cattle\nat fairs, and this source of revenue shows a great decrease.\nHowever, the records show that most of the prize money obtained\nin former years was eaten up in expenses.\n\nRevenue from other sources amounted to\n$1,988.96, of which $1,000.00 was in night-watchmen's grants.\n\nThe item.\n\nL. W. McCutcheon, Esq.,\nActing Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe item 'Staff-Board' is refunded by certain members of the Staff in payment of their board.\n\nThe expenditures totalled $55,380.05, and are shown in detail in Statement #2. National Defence Tax is shown separately from salaries, and starting with September, 1942, the income tax payments are shown.\n\nThe cost of operation per day was $43.29, an increase of $3.29 per day, while the cost per child per year was $217.34, an increase of $23.22. Fuel and light costs were up by about $7.00 per month, while Buildings and Repairs show an increase of about $18.00 per month, but this item was almost negligible in the last period. The cost of house equipment shows an increase of about fifty (50%) percent per month, and the Farm and Garden show an increase of about $7.00 per month. Several newspapers of farm equipment were purchased, including a new tractor, binder, cultivator and set of harrows. The School car and the old tractor were traded in on the tractor, and, as a result, the tractor cost only $385.82 in cash. No School car is now operated. Transportation costs show an increase of about $15.00 per month. During this period two trucks and a car were purchased.\n\nExtra labour costs are down by about $10.00 per month, and Miscellaneous is up by about $3.00. The bank charges totalled $105.76, and include exchange on Toronto cheques from the Church authorities and interest on overdrafts.\n\nThe cost of clothing per pupil per year was $15.64, which is lower by $9.45, while food costs at $37.50 show an increase of $2.63.\n\nThe average attendance was 72.8, a decrease of 2.2.\n\nBecause of the extreme length of the period, I have prepared Statement #1-4, to show the revenue and expenditures for each of the fiscal years of 1939-40, 1940-41 and 1941-42, as well as for the first six months of the 1942-43 year. The greatest fluctuations in revenue are noted in Church Grants and farm. The large sale of cattle in 1939-40 makes that year's revenue about three times as great as in the other years. The expenditures are about normal throughout the several years, with the transportation costs of 1939-40 being rather high.\n\nStatement #2-4, was prepared to make comparison of the operation costs for the various years included in this period. The highest cost per day was during 1939-40, with the cost during the first half of the current fiscal year coming next. The highest cost per pupil per year was also 1939-40. This was the year in which a change of Principals was made, and part of the increase was likely due to the inexperience of the new Principal, and also to the necessity for repairs and improvements to the buildings.\n\nThe costs of clothing and food are about the same during the various years, except that the food costs are higher during the current year.\n\nI was informed that the farm consists of about 2,000 acres, of which about 300 acres are cultivated. No grain is grown for...\nis grown for the market, but is all fed on the farm, and made into flour. The livestock consists of about 70 head of cattle, of which all but two are registered Holsteins. There are two purebred Shorthorn heifers, and the Principal intends to gradually build up this breed, while cutting down on the Holstein. There are also 10 horses, 50 hogs, and 130 hens and turkeys. The farm supplies all the milk and butter and vegetables, as well as a large part of the meat.\n\nThe Principal advised that the liabilities, other than the overdraft at the Bank, amounted to about $650.00, all of which are current bills. The sum of $500.00 was received on October 1st, from the Church authorities, in payment of the per capita grant, and a Church grant of $500.00 is to come shortly. There are also a number of hogs nearly ready for market. The Principal expects to operate without undue difficulty.\n\nThe books were in very good condition, with the exceptions noted above.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the cooperation of Mr. Huston during the audit.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report -\n\n1.

McCutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to submit a report of an audit made at\nthe above school on July 15th, 1943, covering the period\nof 9 months dating from October 1, 1942 to June 30, 1943.\n\nBank Reconciliation (Statement #1)\n\nThe pass book from the Bank of Montreal,\nWhitewood, gave a balance of $77.71 as at June 30, 1943.\nThe outstanding cheques totalled $22.00, and there was\n$4.96 in cash on hand. The net balance of $60.67 agreed\nwith the cash book.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined and checked to\nthe cash book entries. Vouchers were on file to cover the\nexpenditures and these were compared with the specific\nentries. The allocation to supplies was $204, with\nthe exception of soaps and cleaners which were under\n\"Miscellaneous\". I transferred these to \"House Equipment\".\nAll revenue is deposited and the principal pays small accounts\nfrom his petty cash fund, which is re-inbursed monthly by\ncheque. A petty cash book is kept and the items transferred\nto the cash book each month.\n\nRevenue and Expenditure (Statements #1 and #2)\n\nThe revenue for the period amounted to $11,760.93,\nof which $5,592.05 was from the per capita grant as received\nfrom the Women's Missionary Society in Toronto, and $2,000.00\nfrom Church grants.\n\nFarm revenue totalled $976.88, of which $451.88\nwas from the sale of hogs, and $415.00 from the sale of\ncattle.\n\nThe nightwatchman grant amounted to $280.00 and\nthere was also a $5.00 refund.\n\nThe expenditures for the period amounted to\n$11,207.61, at an average cost of $41.05 per day, which is\n$2.24 lower than for the previous period. The cost of operation\nper pupil per year works out at $196.62 which is $20.72 lower.\n\nThe cost of clothing was $10.93 per year - a\ndecrease of $4.71 per pupil. However, a good part of the\nyear's clothing was purchased during the latter part of the\nprevious audit period.\n\nThe food costs were $37.59 per pupil per year -\nan increase of 9 cents.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\nThe average attendance of pupils was 76 - an increase of 3.2 - a fact which aided in keeping the average costs down.\n\nFuel and light costs were at about double the monthly rate of the previous 42 month period, but are only slightly higher than for the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nBuildings and Repair at $296.59 were quite low, while House Equipment at $388.62 shows a considerable reduction.\n\nFarm costs totalled $1,166.70, and are down for the whole, and also any portion of the preceding period. It will be noted that no feed was purchased during the period. A milking-strain Shorthorn bull and heifer (with calf) were purchased for $400.00 during the period, as well as a team of driving horses for $180.00. The remaining $104.04 of the livestock purchases were for hogs, poultry and bees.\n\nTransportation costs at $411.75 show a large decrease. No school car is operated, but the school pays for the operation of the principal's private car.\n\nExtra labor at $168.42 was also down.\n\nMiscellaneous was kept quite low, and includes bank operating charges and interest on an overdraft.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe principal advised that the total acreage of the farm is about 2,000 acres, with about 300 being cultivated. No grain was sold during the period, but is fed to livestock. The livestock consists of approximately 75 head of cattle, of which about 14 are milking. The above are all purebred Holsteins with the exception of 5 Shorthorns. There are also 11 horses, about 60 hogs and 175 poultry.\n\nThe farm supplies the school with milk and butter, and most of the meat. The 1942 vegetable crop was very good, but because of inadequate storage facilities considerable losses were sustained. A new root cellar is under construction this summer.\n\nThe principal also advised that there were no liabilities at June 30th except for about $120.00 incurred during June.\n\nThe books and records were in good condition and up to date, and are audited annually for the Church authorities. Mr. Huston co-operated fully during the audit.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report:\n\n1. Bank Reconciliation - Revenue and Expenditure\n2. Analysis of Expenditure\n3.

Macdonald, Esq., Chief Treasury Officer, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI beg to submit the report of an audit made at the above school on\nAugust 15, 1944, covering the period of 12 months dating from July 1, 1943 to\nJune 30, 1944.\n\nThe principal was absent at the time of my visit, as he had to undergo\nan operation. However his daughter was kind enough to put the books at my\ndisposal. All vouchers were available, but the paid cheques for the first\nsix months of the period could not be located.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nThe pass book from the Bank of Montreal, Whitewood, showed a balance of\n$673.09 as at June 30, 1944. Several outstanding cheques totalled $185.05\nand cash on hand amounted to $1,428, leaving a net balance of $489.46 which\nagreed with the cash book.\n\nAll cheques available were checked to the cash book, and the cash book\nentries for the period for which there were no cheques, were checked to the\npass book. Vouchers were on file to cover the expenditures, and these were\ncompared with the synoptic entries. Allocation to the synoptic was good. All\nrevenue was deposited and petty cash reimbursed by cheques drawn on the bank\naccount. Cash expenditures were not large.\n\nRevenue & Expenditure\n\nA total revenue of $16,680.31 received during the year, of which\n$11,614.50 was received from the Women's Missionary Society on account of the\nper capita grant. Church grants totalled $2,000.00, and the night watchman\ngrant $300.00. Farm revenue amounted to $2,645.27, mostly from the sale of\ncattle. Revenue from other sources amounted to $40.54.\n\nThe expenditures totalled $16,251.52 and are shown in greater detail\nin Statement #2. The following table shows the approximate yearly increase or\ndecrease per each synoptic heading, as compared with the last period:\n\n| Increase | Decrease | Per Cent |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Salaries & Tax | 205.00 | 3.0 |\n| Clothing | 260.52 | 31.0 |\n| Food | 223.70 | 7.5 |\n| Phone, Light, Fuel | 241.84 | 16.5 |\n| Buildings & repair | 516.17 | 130.5 |\n| House Equipment | 459.52 | 68.5 |\n| Farm & Garden | 444.04 | 28.5 |\n| Transportation | 296.16 | 34.0 |\n| Extra Labor | 12.26 | 5.5 |\n| Miscellaneous | 45.51 | 22.5 |\n\nTotal yearly increase | 2005.56 | 697.54 |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|\n\nIt will be noted that, in 7 out of the 10 headings, increases occur,\nwith building costs and house equipment showing the largest increases. Farm\ncosts were considerably lower, due chiefly to the lower livestock purchases.\nThe Bank charges shown under \"Miscellaneous\" were for exchange on the Women's\nMissionary Society cheques, and two or three small overdraft charges.\n\nThe cost of clothing was 31 per cent higher, and the per pupil cost\nof $14.57 was up by $3.64. Food costs were up by 7.5 per cent, with the per\npupil cost of $41.14 showing an increase of $3.55.\n\nThe total yearly cost was higher by 9 per cent, and the cost of\n\noperation per pupil...........\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\noperation per pupil per year at $216.98 shows an increase of $20.36. The pupilage shows a decrease of 1.1 pupils.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe books and records were in good condition and up to date to July 31st. However, as the July cheques could not be located, the cut-off was made as at June 30th.\n\nThe farmer, Mr. Osborne, gave me the following information regarding farming operations:\n\nThe farm consists of approximately 2,000 acres of which about 300 are cultivated. The 1943 crop yielded about 700 bus. of wheat averaging 35 bus. per acre; 7000 bus. of oats averaging 85 bus. per acre; and 750 bus. of barley averaging 40 bus. per acre. The 1944 crop is also good with harvest operations under way at the time of the audit.\n\nThe livestock consists of approximately 70 head of cattle of which 20 are milch cows; 7 sows, and 24 pigs; 10 horses; and 300 poultry.\n\nI was unable to obtain a list of staff members for the coming year. I was given to understand that the principal is being transferred to the Portage la Prairie Residential School. There were apparently several vacancies, including the principalship, but the total number of staff members will be about as shown on the last statement.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the co-operation of staff members during the audit.\n\nFollowing are the statements which accompany this report:\n\n1. Bank Reconciliation - Revenue & Expenditure;\n2. Analysis of Expenditure;\n3. Cost of operation.\n\nW. R. Butchart,\nAuditor.\nOttawa, September 27, 1944.\n\nW.R.

Cutcheon, Esq.,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI submit herewith the report of an audit made at the above school on July 15, 1946, covering the period of 24 months ending June 30, 1946.\n\nThe school has been under 3 principals during the period, and because of the changes, some difficulty was encountered in making a balance over the period. The fact that cheques and vouchers were not filed in sequence also caused some difficulty.\n\nBank Reconciliation\n\nThe Pass Book from the Bank of Montreal, Whitewood showed a balance of $554.89 as at close of business June 30, 1946. The outstanding Cheques totalled $263.04 and cash on hand amounted to $57.25, leaving a balance of $329.10 which agreed with the cash book.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined and checked to the cash book. Vouchers were on file according to months, but there appeared to be no particular sequence. They were fairly complete. Most revenue was deposited in the bank, and some used to reimburse Petty Cash. A separate Petty Cash book is kept and a recapitulation made at the end of each month. All cash payments are also recorded in the school cash book.\n\nRevenue and Expenditure\n\nA total of $37,741.66 was received during the period, of which $24,058.62 from the Women's Missionary Society appeared to be in payment of the per capita grant. A further $1,900.00 from the same source would appear to be a church grant. The night watchmen grant amounted to $400.00 and $95.69 was received from the Department as a refund for the purchase of a water heater.\n\nFarm revenue was quite high at $10,401.11, largely from the sale of cattle and grain. $886.27 was received from other sources.\n\nThe expenditures amounted to $37,903.22 and are listed in greater detail in statement #2. The following table shows the respective increase or decrease per year per each symptotic heading as compared with the preceding period.\n\n| Item                  | Increase | Decrease | Per cent |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Salaries              | 1071.92  |          | 15.1     |\n| Clothing              | 315.78   | 213.03   | 29.0     |\n| Food                  |          |          |          |\n| Phone, Light, Fuel    | 607.87   |          | 49.0     |\n| Buildings & Repair    |          | 381.45   | 42.0     |\n| House Equipment       |          | 149.30   | 15.5     |\n| Farm & Garden         |          | 200.66   | 18.0     |\n| Transportation        | 816.41   |          | 96.5     |\n| Extra Labor           | 654.74   |          | 308.5    |\n| Miscellaneous         | 177.31   |          | 75.0     |\n| Total Yearly Increase | 3644.03  | 944.44   |          |\n|                       |          | 2699.59  |          |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTransportation costs were very high during the period due largely to very heavy bills for repairing the school truck.\n\nThe cost of clothing per pupil per year was $19.143, an increase of $4.573, and the cost of food at $39.024 per pupil per year was down by $2.116.\n\nThe cost of operation per pupil per year was $251.809 an increase of $34.829 with the average attendance showing a drop of 1.4 pupils.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe books and records were in fairly good condition and up to date. The principal advised that the liabilities as at June 30th amounted to approximately $540.00.\n\nI was further informed that the farm consisted of 875 acres of which 340 acres is under cultivation. The livestock consisted of 26 dairy cattle, 17 beef cattle, 1 bull, 6 horses, 27 swine, 74 hens and 160 chicks, 41 turkeys, 4 geese.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the co-operation of Mr. Card during the audit.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report:\n\n1.

Outstanding cheques amounted to $295.94, cash on hand $87.02, leaving a net balance of $1,238.20.\n\nIn the second reconciliation for December 31, 1947, the balance per certificate was $1,767.90, outstanding cheques accounted for $706.45 and cash on hand $221.66, leaving a net balance of $1,233.11. Both balances agreed with Cash Book.\n\nCash received and not deposited amounted to $61.46 and $22.51 respectively.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined for endorsements and checked to relating entries in Cash Book, and vouchers on file (in cheque sequence) received similar attention. In addition, the latter were checked for their admissibility.\n\nCheques #5 and #12 for $9.90 and $7.90 respectively, issued March 1945, are still outstanding, and I would suggest the Principal be instructed as to disposal of same.\n\nRECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS\n\nA statement of these items for the period under review is attached to this report and, for the purpose of comparison, a condensed summary showing monthly costs, is shown below.\n\n| Item                  | July 1/46 to June 30/46 | July 1/46 to March 31/47 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                       | 24 Months               | 1 Month                 | 9 Months                | 1 Month                |\n| Salaries              | 15,233.77               | 634.74                  | 6,386.35                | 709.59                 |\n| Clothing              | 2,813.95                | 117.25                  | 1,045.25                | 116.21                 |\n| Food                  | 5,736.48                | 239.02                  | 2,383.53                | 264.81                 |\n| Phone, Light, Fuel    | 3,690.32                | 153.77                  | 2,074.48                | 204.48                 |\n| Building & Repairs    | 1,600.13                | 44.18                   | 333.52                  | 37.59                  |\n| Office Equipment      | 1,656.75                | 69.03                   | 642.04                  | 71.54                  |\n| Farm and Garden       | 1,821.81                | 75.91                   | 726.82                  | 80.76                  |\n| Transportation        | 3,327.14                | 138.63                  | 1,135.95                | 126.22                 |\n| Extra Labour          | 1,734.08                | 72.25                   | 604.40                  | 67.16                  |\n| Miscellaneous         | 827.37                  | 34.47                   | 121.88                  | 13.54                  |\n| **Total**             | **$37,902.22**          | **$1,579.25**           | **$15,459.35**          | **$1,717.70**          |\n\nAverage Attendance: 73.5 Pupils\nAverage Monthly Cost Per Pupil: $21.486\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lauchlan,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nO T T A W A.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIndian Residential School\nRound Lake \u2014 Saskatchewan\n\nI have examined the accounts and records of the above school for the nine month period ending March 31, 1947, and hereunder is a report of the audit.\n\nBANK RECONCILIATION\n\nThe certificate from the Bank of Montreal, Whitewood, Saskatchewan, showed a balance of $1,447.12 at the close of business March 31, 1947. Outstanding cheques amounted to $295.94, cash on hand $87.02, leaving a net balance of $1,258.20.\n\nIn the second reconciliation for December 31, 1947, the balance per certificate was $1,767.90; outstanding cheques accounted for $705.45 and cash on hand $221.66, leaving a net balance of $1,283.11. Both balances agreed with Cash Book.\n\nCash received and not deposited amounted to $61.46 and $22.51 respectively.\n\nAll paid cheques were examined for endorsements and checked to relating entries in Cash Book, and vouchers on file (in cheque sequence) received similar attention. In addition, the latter were checked for their admissibility.\n\nCheques #6 and #12 for $9.90 and $7.90 respectively, issued March 1946, are still outstanding, and I would suggest the Principal be instructed as to disposal of same.\n\nRECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS\n\nA statement of these items for the period under review is attached to this report and, for the purpose of comparison, a condensed summary showing monthly costs, is shown below.\n\n| Item                  | July 1/46 to June 30/46 | July 1/46 to March 31/47 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                       | 2 Months                | 1 Month                 | 9 Months                | 1 Month                 |\n| Salaries              | 15,235.77               | 654.74                  | 6,386.36                | 709.59                  |\n| Clothing              | 2,013.95                | 117.25                  | 1,045.95                | 116.21                  |\n| Food                  | 5,756.48                | 239.02                  | 2,383.33                | 264.81                  |\n| Phone, Light, Fuel    | 3,690.52                | 153.77                  | 2,074.28                | 230.48                  |\n| Building & Repairs    | 1,060.35                | 44.18                   | 338.32                  | 37.59                   |\n| House Equipment       | 1,566.75                | 69.03                   | 642.04                  | 71.84                   |\n| Farm and Garden       | 1,621.81                | 75.91                   | 726.82                  | 80.76                   |\n| Transportation        | 3,527.14                | 138.68                  | 1,135.95                | 126.22                  |\n| Extra Labour          | 1,734.08                | 72.28                   | 604.40                  | 67.16                   |\n| Miscellaneous         | 527.37                  | 34.47                   | 121.68                  | 13.64                   |\n\n$37,902.22 $1,579.25 $15,459.35 $1,717.70\n\nAverage Attendance 75.5 Pupils 67.5 Pupils\nAverage Monthly Cost Per Pupil $21.486 $25.447\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe increase in the per capita costs for the period under review is primarily due to increases in salaries, and a general rise in prices for food stuffs and other supplies.\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe Principal provided me with the following information regarding farming operations:\n\nThere is a total of 875 acres belonging to the school, of which 340 acres are under cultivation.\n\nLivestock consists of: 22 Dairy Cattle, 1 Bull, 2 Steers, 17 Yearlings, 6 Calves, 2 Sows, 15 Pigs, 6 Horses, 186 Hens, 11 Turkeys, 8 Geese.\n\nNo records were available to show the number and value of farm and school assets at the beginning of the period under review.\n\nThe accounts and records are maintained in accordance with departmental requirements, and were in good condition.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for the cooperation received from the Rev. J. A. Gard during the course of the audit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWm. Charlton,\nTreasury Auditor.\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nH. G.

Charlton,\nRegional Administrator, Prairie Region,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Treasury,\n709 McCallum Hill Building,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nFrom: Wm. Charlton, Treasury Auditor\n\nRe: Indian Residential School\nRound Lake - Saskatchewan\n\nAn audit of the records of above School has recently been completed for the period November 1, 1948 to August 8, 1949.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements\n\n(a) Bank Reconciliation\n\nThe certificate from the Bank of Montreal, Whitewood, Sask., certified to a balance of $5,171.38 to the credit of the Round Lake Indian Residential School account, as at the close of business August 8, 1949.\n\nOutstanding cheques (6) amounted to $162.48, cash on hand $100.30, the net credit balance of $3,109.20 being in accord with Cash Book.\n\nDeposits have been made as occasions demanded and without undue delay.\n\n(b) Receipts\n\nAll deposits were checked through from deposit slips to bank pass and cash books and no irregularities were noted.\n\n(c) Disbursements\n\nPaid cheques were examined for endorsements, admissibility, etc., checked to relating entries in Cash Book and audit stamped.\n\nVouchers were checked approximately 60% to cash book, those relating to Building and Repairs were checked 100%.\n\nReceipts for petty cash disbursements for the months of July and August were not in evidence in numerous instances. However, a memo account of same was kept. A number of the major items were verified by visiting local vendors and checking the source of origin. This occurred during the absence of the Principal on vacation, and whilst he was in hospital.\n\nFarming Activities\n\nThe figures as shown in the above statement, as relating to acreage and livestock, were supplied by the \"Farm Manager\" and can be assumed as reasonably correct.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA large proportion of both farm and dairy produce is consumed at the School kitchen.\n\nTaking into consideration the livestock, etc., on hand and sales included in \"Receipts\" there appears to have been little change in the assets in this respect since last audit.\n\nNo records are available to show the value of farm equipment or other assets at the date of audit.\n\nOperating Costs and Staff\n\nIn analyzing these costs a slight decrease in per capita cost is noted. This is no doubt due to the increase in number of pupils attending school.\n\nChanges in staff since last audit have taken place in the teacher and gardener positions, and a cook and assistant farmer have been added to the staff.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe deferred account with the T.Eaton Company Ltd., commented upon in the last report has now been absorbed in the costs and it is not proposed to renew same.\n\nOwing to the absence of the Principal through illness, a few minor questions remain unanswered and at the request of Mr. Ostrander, the Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs, Saskatchewan, it is proposed to conduct another audit in about two months time, when the principal will no doubt have resumed his duties, or another principal will have been appointed.\n\nBuildings inspected need extensive repairs and decorations, this applies particularly to the main school building.\n\nCertificate\n\nI hereby certify that I have examined the books and records of the Indian Residential School, Round Lake, Saskatchewan, and with the exceptions noted above, the attached statements reflect the transactions of the School, according to the records and explanations given me.\n\nMr. Charlton\nTreasury Auditor.\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nOriginal signed by\n\nE.

Charlton, Treasury Auditor\n\nRe: Indian Residential School\nRound Lake - Saskatchewan\n\nAn audit of the records of above School has recently been completed for the period November 1, 1948 to August 8, 1949.\n\nReceipts and Disbursements\n\n(a) Bank Reconciliation\n\nThe certificate from the Bank of Montreal, Whitewood, Sask. certified to a balance of $3,171.35 to the credit of the Round Lake Indian Residential School account, as at the close of business August 8, 1949.\n\nOutstanding cheques (6) amounted to $162.48, cash on hand $100.30, the net credit balance of $3,109.20 being in accord with Cash Book.\n\nDeposits have been made as occasions demanded and without undue delay.\n\n(b) Receipts\n\nAll deposits were checked through from deposit slips to bank pass and cash books and no irregularities were noted.\n\n(c) Disbursements\n\nPaid cheques were examined for endorsements, admissibility, etc., checked to relating entries in Cash Book and audit stamped.\n\nVouchers were checked approximately 60% to cash book, those relating to Building and Repairs were checked 100%.\n\nReceipts for petty cash disbursements for the months of July and August were not in evidence in numerous instances. However, a memo account of same was kept. A number of the major items were verified by visiting local vendors and checking the source of origin. This occurred during the absence of the Principal on vacation, and whilst he was in hospital.\n\nFarming Activities\n\nThe figures as shown in the above statement, as relating to acreage and livestock, were supplied by the \"Farm Manager\" and can be assumed as reasonably correct.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA large proportion of both farm and dairy produce is consumed at the School kitchen.\n\nTaking into consideration the livestock, etc., on hand and sales included in \"Receipts\" there appears to have been little change in the assets in this respect since last audit.\n\nNo records are available to show the value of farm equipment or other assets at the date of audit.\n\nOperating Costs and Staff\n\nIn analysing these costs a slight decrease in per capita cost is noted. This is no doubt due to the increase in number of pupils attending school.\n\nChanges in staff since last audit have taken place in the teacher and gardener positions, and a cook and assistant farmer have been added to the staff.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe deferred account with the T.Eaton Company Ltd., commented upon in the last report has now been absorbed in the costs and it is not proposed to renew same.\n\nOwing to the absence of the Principal through illness, a few minor questions remain unanswered and at the request of Mr. Ostreider, the Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs, Saskatchewan, it is proposed to conduct another audit in about two months time, when the principal will no doubt have resumed his duties, or another principal will have been appointed.\n\nBuildings inspected need extensive repairs and decorations, this applies particularly to the main school building.\n\nCertificate\n\nI hereby certify that I have examined the books and records of the Indian Residential School, Round Lake, Saskatchewan, and with the exceptions noted above, the attached statements reflect the transactions of the School, according to the records and explanations given me.\n\nWm.

Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nPrairie Region,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Treasury,\n709 McCallum Hill Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nFROM: W.E. Jackson,\nTreasury Auditor.\n\nRE: Round Lake Indian Residential School\nRound Lake, Sask.\n\nAn audit of the records of the above school has recently been completed for the period 9 Aug. 49 to 31 Mar. 50.\n\n(a) Bank Reconciliation\n\nA certificate of the Bank of Montreal, Whitewood, Sask., was obtained and the cash balance as shown in the school synoptic was reconciled with this certificate as shown in Statement No. 1. Cash on hand was not counted but the Principal stated that he had on hand the balance as shown in the statement.\n\n(b) Receipts\n\nAll receipts as shown in the cash synoptic were checked to the bank book. It was found that some receipts had been used to make payments without being deposited in the bank. The principal was shown how an imprest petty cash account should be maintained to take care of such payments. The amount listed in receipts under \"Bazaar Receipts\" is apparently derived from the sales of second hand clothing which has been donated to the school by the women's missionary society.\n\n(c) Disbursements\n\nAll paid cheques were examined as to signature and endorsement and checked to the cash synoptic. Two cheques numbered 5 and 9 in the amounts of $9.49 and $7.90 respectively which were issued prior to 1945 are still outstanding. Also cheque No. 64 in the amount of $5.58 is still outstanding. It was suggested to the Principal that he should immediately contact the payee in these instances in an endeavour to trace the missing cheques. Cheque No. 64 or 1950 in the amount of $358.30 was not seen at the time of audit although it had been cashed. It has presumably been misfiled and the invoices regarding it were audited. It has been the practice here to issue unnumbered cheques of varying amounts for use as petty cash and not enter them in the cash synoptic but in a separate \"Petty Cash Book\". This has had the effect of confusing the cash synoptic and as has been previously stated the proper method of operating a petty cash advance has been explained to the Principal.\nIt was also noted that the sum of $25.00 is being paid yearly to the local Postmaster for a quarterly audit of the school books. This is unusual and would not appear to be necessary.\n\nFARM ACTIVITIES\n\nThe information regarding farm activities is very meager due to the fact that the roads were impassable and it was impossible to contact the farm manager. This is explained further under the \"General heading.\"\n\n21 cattle died and a John Deere Tractor was burned as the result of a fire caused by the tractor back-firing while in the barn. This is a very serious loss as the cows supplied a great deal of milk for the school. It is understood that a new tractor is being purchased. The fire damage to the barn is reported by the Principal as not extensive.\n\nOPERATIONAL COSTS\n\nStatement No. 4 shows the comparison of operational costs for the last two fiscal years. The enormous increase in overall cost of operation per pupil would appear to be due to the large decrease in attendance and an increase in expenses. The addition of an engineer to the staff at a salary of $125.00 per month for the 1948-49 school period increases the salaries paid. This was explained by the Principal as necessary due to the poor condition of the heating and plumbing system in the school.\n\nLIABILITIES\n\nIt was stated by the Principal that there are no outstanding liabilities in excess of the current monthly accounts, salaries, etc. There would appear to be sufficient funds on hand for these.\n\nGENERAL\n\nDue to the seasonal condition of the roads the audit was carried out in Whitewood. Mr. Card, the Principal, was not familiar with the various crop acreages and yields.

Charlton,\nRegional Administrator,\nPrairie Region,\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Treasury,\n709 McCallum Hill Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nFROM: W.E. Jackson,\nTreasury Auditor.\n\nRE: Round Lake Indian Residential School\nRound Lake\nSask.\n\nAn audit of the records of the above school has recently been completed for the period 9 Aug. 49 to 31 Mar. 50.\n\nRECEIPTS & DISBURSEMENTS\n\n(a) Bank Reconciliation\n\nA certificate of the Bank of Montreal, Whitewood, Sask., was obtained and the cash balance as shown in the school synoptic was reconciled with this certificate as shown in Statement No. 1. Cash on hand was not counted but the Principal stated that he had on hand the balance as shown in the statement.\n\n(b) Receipts\n\nAll receipts as shown in the cash synoptic were checked to the bank book. It was found that some receipts had been used to make payments without being deposited in the bank. The principal was shown how an imprest petty cash account should be maintained to take care of such payments. The amount listed in receipts under \"Bazaar Receipts\" is apparently derived from the sales of second-hand clothing which has been donated to the School by the Women's Missionary Society.\n\n(c) Disbursements\n\nAll paid cheques were examined as to signature and endorsement and checked to the Cash synoptic. Two cheques numbered 5 and 9 in the amounts of $94.90 and $77.90 respectively which were issued prior to 1945 are still outstanding. Also cheque No. 64 in the amount of $5.58 is still outstanding. It was suggested to the Principal that he should immediately contact the payee in these instances in an endeavour to trace the missing cheques. Cheque No. 64 of 1950 in the amount of $328.30 was not seen at the time of audit although it had been cashed. It has presumably been misfiled and the invoices regarding it were audited. It has been the practice here to issue unnumbered cheques of varying amounts for use as petty cash and not enter them in the cash synoptic but in a separate \"Petty Cash Book\". This has had the effect of confusing the cash synoptic and as has been previously stated the proper method of operating a petty cash advance has been explained to the Principal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 661-24, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIt was also noted that the sum of $25.00 is being paid yearly to the local Postmaster for a quarterly audit of the school books. This is unusual and would not appear to be necessary.\n\nFARM ACTIVITIES\n\nThe information regarding farm activities is very meager due to the fact that the roads were impassable and it was impossible to contact the farm manager. This is explained further under the \"General heading.\"\n\n21 cattle died and a John Deere Tractor was burned as the result of a fire caused by the tractor back-firing while in the barn. This is a very serious loss as the cows supplied a great deal of milk for the school. It is understood that a new tractor is being purchased. The fire damage to the barn is reported by the Principal as not extensive.\n\nOPERATIONAL COSTS\n\nStatement No. 4 shows the comparison of operational costs for the last two fiscal years. The enormous increase in overall cost of operation per pupil would appear to be due to the rapid decrease in attendance and an increase in expenses. The addition of an engineer to the staff at a salary of $125.00 per month for the 10-month school period increases the salaries paid. This was explained by the Principal as necessary due to the poor condition of the heating and plumbing system in the school.\n\nLIABILITIES\n\nIt was stated by the Principal that there are no outstanding liabilities in excess of the current monthly accounts, salaries, etc. There would appear to be sufficient funds on hand for these.\n\nGENERAL\n\nDue to the seasonal condition of the roads the audit was carried out in Whiteswood. Mr. Card, the Principal, was not familiar with the various crop acreages and yields. Mr. Card reports that the school buildings are in very poor condition and a very definite fire hazard.\n\nOwing to his physical condition Mr. Card has resigned, such resignation to take effect at the end of the school term. He has requested that another audit be made immediately prior to his leaving. The continued illness of the Principal would account for the errors and omissions found in the accounting system.\nCERTIFICATE\n\nI hereby certify that I have examined the accounts and records of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, Round Lake, Saskatchewan, for the period 9 Aug. 49 to 31 Mar. 50, and with any exceptions noted above, the attached statements reflect the transactions of the School, according to the records and the explanations given me.\n\nW.E.

Only five or six children receive the benefit most.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nof them cannot, either because they are too far away from the school or because their relatives, who are hunters, having no place where they can leave them, are obliged to take them with them when they are hunting. To provide instruction for the children of this reserve it is absolutely necessary that we should have a boarding school.\n\nI have shown the necessity and several occasions made request of the Department of Indian Affairs. For one reason or another I have never received anything but a discouraging refusal.\n\nAt last I conceived the idea that if I could be able myself to meet the first expenses, that is to say, to build and put a house in a condition to receive the children, the government would not find any difficulty in granting us the assistance that it gives to schools of this class. Therefore...\nI appealed to some friends, I collected funds and set myself to work. Then, through the mediation of His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface, again asked the Government for permission to build. The same refusal, under the pretext that to grant us permission to build would be virtually to promise to establish a new boarding school for us. Our request had, however, the recommendation of the Indian Agent and of the Indian Commissioners.\n\nI do not understand this refusal. We are not asking for a privilege; the Protestants have a boarding school fifteen miles from here, on Cote's Reserve. Neither do we ask for an increase in the expenditure that the Government is disposed to make for the education of the Indians. If we wanted to send our children to Cote's school, the Government would pay for them; if we want...\nto send them to an industrial school, the government would still pay for them, and much more than it would have to pay for their maintenance at a school here. Why then this proposal?\n\nAgain I do not understand it, but what is easy to understand is that we are not treated in the same way as others; we and our Indians here are deprived of a great benefit that others enjoy.\n\nIt is in order to remedy this disadvantage from which we suffer with the Indians of this reserve on account of the lack of a boarding school that I take the liberty of addressing today and praying you to be so kind as to intervene in our favour.\n\nThe Indians of Keesekonk's Reserve charge me to entreat you in their name and to tell you that they love their Premier Chief and that they trust to his sense of justice and sympathy for them.\nAs for myself, I am sure that you will do whatever is possible to be done for us, and I pray you to accept my gratitude and devotion.\n\nA. Deroche, P.O.M.,\nMissionary to the Indians.\n\nP.S. I have been a missionary in Manitoba and the North-west for thirty-two years. Besides the Indians of the District of Fort Garry, I have to give the services of my ministry to a great number of whites of different languages and different nationalities,\u2014English, French, German, Belgians, Poles, and others, sometimes grouped together in small parishes, sometimes scattered and mixed in the midst of this strange medley which is the characteristic of the population of the North-west Territories.\n\nJ. D.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, 12th May, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe Father DeCorby's communication addressed to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, asking for permission to build a boarding school on the Keeseekoose Reserve.\n\nSimilar applications have been received from time to time since 1894, and in reply to the last request made in February through the Indian Commissioner, that officer was informed that if authority were given to put up a new building on Keeseekoose Reserve, it would, judging by past experience, entail expense in the near future, either for the maintenance of pupils or the erection of buildings and would virtually be opening the door for the establishment of a new boarding school on the same lines as those already in operation. This answer was sent to the Commissioner in view of the Minister's decision not to increase the present expenditure schools of that class.\n\nI find, on referring to the census return of the Keeseekoose Band, that the total number given is 126 souls, belonging to the Church of England, 15 Presbyterians, 66 Roman Catholics and 62 pagans, with 29 children between the ages of 6 and 15 in the entire band. Nine pupils from this reserve are...\nenrolled at the Qu'Appelle Industrial school (R.C.). Out of the entire school population of 29, not more than 14 are presumably of the Roman Catholic faith, 9 of whom are at Qu'Appelle, which would leave only about 5 to be educated on the reserve, where there is a day school now in operation. I have no doubt that the Roman Catholics lay claim to the pagan Indians as members of their Church, and that a number of their children are enrolled in the day school, which has 17 pupils on the register, with an average attendance of 3 for the year.\n\nIt does not appear to me that a boarding school is necessary at this point as it would establish a precedent for opening boarding schools on nearly every reserve in the Territories.\nOTTAWA, 15th May, 1899\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, addressed to the honorable, the Premier, in which you ask for permission to build a boarding school on the Massawossie Reserve; and in reply I am directed to inform you that the Department does not consider that it would be justified, in view of the opportunity the children on this Reserve have of attending Industrial schools, in authorizing the expenditure your application would involve, if granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Rev.

Je dois \u00e0 cette r\u00e9ponse quelques observations.\n\nJe ne sais comment Monsieur L'Heureux de l'Economie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate; mais en des consid\u00e9rants \u00e9tait qu'on ne pouvait plus employer des enfants aux Ecoles Industrielles. On en a envoy\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 un bon nombre basques en ait en soin de n'envoyer que ceux qui affichent les meilleures garanties de sant\u00e9; tous sont morts, \u00e0 l'exception d'une fille.\n\nEt ceci n'est pas une surprise pour qui a eu l'occasion d'observer les conditions sanitaires des sauvages.\n\nSans \u00eatre docteur en m\u00e9decine je crois pouvoir dire que quarante-quatre ont eu des refus.\nSauvages sont atteints plus au moins de sensibilit\u00e9.\n\nQui peut ou attendre, malgr\u00e9 les nouveaux syst\u00e8mes de ventilation, sinon bien elles d\u00e9clencher au milieu de ces pauvres enfants, portant presque tous des germes de la maladie et plusieurs l'ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 un degr\u00e9 bien avanc\u00e9, enferm\u00e9s ensemble durant de longues heures du jour et de la nuit aux salles d'\u00e9tude ou aux dortoirs ?\n\nJ'ai pens\u00e9 attirer votre attention sur ce fait dans ma lettre, mais que l'ignorance de peur de la rende trop longue.\n\nMaintenant, en quel milieu ou ces pauvres enfants sont oblig\u00e9s de vivre commencent l'ennui, provoquant de l'\u00e9loignement de la famille et de la s\u00e9paration lorsque la maladie avance, l'\u00e2me. Un bien pour les parents apprenant que leur enfant est l'objectif de la sauvegarde qui a l'ambition de se prot\u00e9ger contre les \u00e9pid\u00e9mies. Il ne peut se faire \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de voir passer son enfant dans une autre localisation de lui faire le dernier adieu.\n\nUne telle situation aux Pauvres, en certains maisons des Pauvres, a \u00e9t\u00e9 constat\u00e9e ; les enfants n'y sont qu'en petit nombre, aux premiers sympt\u00f4mes de la maladie, ils s'installent \u00e0 la maison o\u00f9 la vie de la famille, la libert\u00e9...\nLe plaisir de la vie est une maternit\u00e9 qui commence avant \u00e0 la vie.\n\nIl ne faudrait encourager aux \u00c9coles Industrielles que des enfants ayant un certain \u00e2ge et un attestation de bonne sant\u00e9.\n\nUn nouvel \u00e9tablissement serait encore plus n\u00e9cessaire l'\u00e9tablissement d'une \u00c9cole Professionnelle \u00e0 la Rivi\u00e8re de Kessessassse. Le gouvernement a r\u00e9pondu pour les \u00c9coles industrielles de tenir en les ouvrages de cette nature avant d'agir toujours le privil\u00e8ge de prendre du fait et ainsi faire \u00eatre oblig\u00e9 de s'adresser pour aider \u00e0 former leurs animaux aux Montagnes.\n\nVous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 assez bien pour me permettre ma premi\u00e8re lettre de faire passer en la recommandant \u00e0 l'Honorable Ministre charg\u00e9 de l'Affaire indig\u00e8ne, j'esp\u00e8re que vous voudrez bien accorder la m\u00eame faveur \u00e0 celle-ci.\n\nVous faites une bien bonne chose pour nos pauvres montagnes qui laisses de l'apport du D\u00e9partement elle leur donner une a bien attrait\u00e9 et vous aura un nouveau titre \u00e0 la profonde reconnaissance.\n\nDe votre humble et devan\u00e7ant serviteur,\n\nJ. Decorey\n\nD. D. M. 7\nDear Sir:\n\nI do not like to add to the importance with which you are assuredly engaged, but I must write again to thank you for your kind letter and the recommendation that you were good enough to give to our request for permission to build at our expense a house for a boarding-school for the Roman Catholic children of Reesekhouse Reserve.\n\nThe reply from the Department of Indian Affairs was that our request could not be complied with because we had the industrial schools at our disposal.\n\nNow to make some observations on this reply. We do not know in what manner His Lordship the Archbishop of St. Boniface presented the request, but one of the considerations was that children could no longer be sent from here to industrial schools. Already a good number have been sent. Although care was taken to send only those who gave the best assurances of health, all are dead with the exception of one girl.\n\nAnd this is not a surprise to those who have had the opportunity of observing the sanitary conditions of the Indians. Although not a physician myself, I believe that I can say that 95 out of every hundred Indian children are tainted more or less with scrofula. What can we expect, in spite of the new systems of ventilation, but death in the midst of these poor children, nearly all of whom bear germs of disease, and many of them in a very advanced degree, shut up together during long hours of day.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nday and of night in the school-rooms and dormitories?\n\nI thought of calling your attention to this fact in my letter, but I did not do so for fear of making it too long. Now, that which begins while these children are obliged to live assembled together, homesickness, the result of their being so far from their families, and of their isolation when the disease appears, completes.\n\nSome day the parents learn that their child at the school is dead, then the Indians, who have the same love for their children as white people, cannot bear the idea of their children dying far away without the consolation of saying their last farewell to them.\n\nBoarding-schools on the reserves, while costing less, would not have these objections; the number of children at them would be small, on the first symptoms of the disease appearing they would be sent home, where the sight of their families, the freedom and fresh air and maternal care would often restore them to health.\n\nWe can only send to the industrial schools children of a certain age and having a certificate of good health.\n\nA new circumstance renders still more necessary the establishment of a boarding-school on Keesekouse Reserve; the Government has reserved for the Dhourkabours lands where the Indians of this Reserve have for a long time had the privilege of taking hay, and the latter will now be obliged to go a long way in order to winter their cattle in the mountains.\n\nYou were good enough to pardon my first letter, and to recommend to the Honourable the Minister charged with Indian affairs. I beg you will be so kind as to grant the same favour to this one. You will be doing\n\nIndian Affairs.

In fact Father DeCorby was informed on the 15th May '99 that it did not consider that it would be justified, in view of the opportunity the children of this reserve have of attending industrial schools, in authorizing the expenditure his application for a boarding school would involve. Letter turned out.\n\nA similar application was shortly afterwards addressed to the Premier and the reply of the Deputy Minister hereunder shows that the Department did not consider a boarding school necessary at this point. Letter also turned out.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer to a memorandum prepared by me on the 12th May '99 in which I took figures from the census to show that there very few children of school age on the reserve. In fact the last return from the day school shows an enrollment of only 8 pupils with an average attendance of only 4.\nThis building has been put up at his own expense by Father DeCorby just outside the Reserve but with the expectation of receiving a grant for the maintenance of pupils and being recouped for the outlay in connection with the building in the near future.\n\nI may add that the industrial schools in Manitoba and the Territories are experiencing difficulty in obtaining the maximum of pupils they can accommodate owing largely to the increased number of boarding schools on the reserves, and Rev. Father Lacombe whom I saw in Ottawa a short time ago, assured me that this is a fact.\n\nAll the religious denominations carrying on missions work among the Indians are anxious for the establishment of boarding schools as the Government grant is a great help to their work and many of the missions would have to be discontinued if it were not for this assistance. It has not been proved, however as was once expected that these mission boarding schools would act as feeders to the Industrial schools and Indian children educated at boarding schools are Indians first last and all the time.\n\nShould the Department consider the Archbishop's application favorably the day school grant would have to be dropped.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Decorby. In reply, I beg to state that in the month of May, 1899, Father Decorby was informed that the Department did not consider that it would be justified in authorizing the expenditure which his application for a boarding school would involve. The total population of the Keeseekoose Band at that time did not exceed 155 souls, and out of a school population of twenty-nine children not more than fourteen were presumably of the\n\nHis Grace\nArchbishop A.

It may be further pointed out that according to the last returns from the day school on this Reserve it would appear that there is an enrollment of only eight pupils, with an average attendance of four. Under the circumstances, it not felt that a boarding school is necessary at this point, more especially as other similar applications had to be refused in the endeavour to carry out the policy of the Department not to increase the present expenditure for schools of this class. I regret, therefore, that there does not appear to be any way in which the request of Father Decorby can be entertained.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister\nArchbishop's palace of St. Boniface, 6th March 1902\n\nTo the Honourable Clifford Sifton,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nHonourable & Dear Sir,\n\nYour deputy minister, the Hon. M. Smart, has answered our petition for a \"Boarding School\" on Keesickhouse Reserve by stating that there were not enough Catholic children.\n\nI beg leave to say that according to the census taken lately by Rev. Father Jules Decoodie (February 6th last) there are (25) twenty-six catholic children of age to go to school, and the Pagans who wish to unite with the Catholics for the school, are willing to send eleven (II) children, so that there is a total of (37) thirty-seven children of school age ready to be sent to a \"Boarding School\".\n\nAt present, only six catholic children attend the Day-School and three others (catholic) are boarders in the \"Presbyterian school\" on Cot\u00e9 Reserve! The eleven (II) Pagan children and (18) nineteen catholics children go to no school.\n\nSo that if the Department are anxious to help towards the instruction of (25) twenty-five children going to no school whatever they have an excellent reason to establish a \"Boarding School\". The Presbyterian Boarding School on the Cot\u00e9 Reserve for several years and I fail to see why we are not granted the same advantage?\n\nConsequently I beg leave to express the sentiments of the parents of 37 children, 26 catholics, II Pagans, etc. (I understand that are preparing now joint a petition) and also our own wishes by asking that a \"Boarding School\" for Indian children, with (25) twenty-five boarders, at $72 per head, be granted to the Reserve of Keesickhouse Swan River Agency; I beg also as a favor Rev. Father Decoodie be appointed Principal of the said school. A large school with accommodation for 35 or 40 children has already been built by the Rev. Father, at the expense of the Mission, but it is not furnished yet.\n\nTrusting Honourable & Dear Sir, in your sense justice and fair play, I have the Honor to be yours very truly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

General.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 13th March, 1902:\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nIn reply to the enquiry made by the Deputy Minister in his memorandum of the 13th instant I beg to say that so far as the Department is aware the only building on the Keeseekoose reserve put up by the Roman Catholics is a church. There is a day school on the reserve towards the erection of which the Department contributed $300.00 in 1897.\n\nThe church was no doubt put up by the Roman Catholics under the general authority which allowed any denomination which desired to do so, to erect a church on a reserve for mission purposes, provided the Indians gave their consent.\n\nIn February 1899, His Grace, the Archbishop of St Boniface informed the Department that Father DeCorby who was in charge of this mission, intended to build at his own expense on the reserve, a new house to be used as a boarding school for Indian children who lived too far from the mission, or whose parents are willing to leave them at the mission while they are on hunting expeditions. His Grace added that he supposed that there would be no difficulty in the way because this was but an extension of the permission already granted his Church to build on the said reserve. The Indian Commissioner, when forwarding the letter above referred to...\nto, stated that he saw no objection to this as the Roman Catholic Church was the only religious body working there, having been on the reserve for many years. In reply to the Commissioner, he was informed that the Department did not see its way to grant an application of this kind, as if such authority were given, it would, judging by past experience, entail expense in the near future, either for the maintenance of pupils or the erection of buildings, and would virtually be opening the door to the establishment of a new boarding school on the same lines as those already in operation.\n\nMartin Besser\nSir,\n\nWe, the undersigned, Indians of Hesquahs River, Billy Agency, beg leave to send you this petition for a Boarding School in our Reserve.\n\nOur reasons for asking are as follows:\n\nWe have over 30 children of school age in this reserve, and of this number there are about 24 whose parents are very anxious to comply with the Government's wishes by giving them a good education.\n\nOn Cole and Key Reserves there are 8 children who are enrolled and who are intended by their parents to be sent to a Catholic school, but without a boarding school, it is impossible for most of these children to have any education, the majority being too far to attend the day school regularly.\n\nWe could send our children to Opi Offella, but it is too far and anyone who knows the Indians is perfectly aware of their weak constitution. Of all the children we have sent to the Opi Offella Industrial School, but two are living, all the others died there or came back to die on the Reserve.\n\nWith this prospect before us, it is hard to expect us to send our young children so far away, as in all probability many of them would go there and die without the comfort of both parents and relatives.\n\nOn the other hand, we are quite prepared to send them there to complete their education when they are strong enough and advanced in age and learning.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\nThe Reverend Father Decody, the Priest in charge of our spiritual welfare in our Reserve, is trying to build a big house suitable for a boarding school and this building is in a convenient location for all of us. We understand from the Reverend Father that it will be ready for occupation about the middle of the coming summer, if the government grant is favorable; that the expenses of building will not be required of the Government.\n\nOur neighboring Reserve, Cote, has a boarding school, and a good one of its class, and we are pleased that they have this advantage. If the same could be obtained for us, we would be grateful for the Department.\n\nWe trust you will kindly lay this matter before the Department of Indian Affairs at your earliest convenience for their kind consideration.\n\nWe remain your petitioners,\n\n[Signature]\nRev.

The way school as taught at present is useless as an educational factor, the attendance being ridiculously small and in any case the education of these children in habits of thought and discipline is certainly not taught at their homes, but moved he so at this school.\n\n4.

A similar application was received a few days ago from His Grace the Archbishop of St Boniface on which I prepared a memorandum on No.1 of this file which is now before the Deputy Minister.\n\nSome years ago they had an excellent day school on this reserve with an average attendance of over 40 and Agent Herchmer in his report for '85 stated that the Keeseekoose Band possessed the most successful school he had yet seen and if it has been allowed to run down it is not the Department's fault. Father DeCorby, who is missionary in charge of this reserve and who prepared the petition now under consideration states that \"we could send our children to Qu'Appelle, but it is too far and any one who knows the Indians is perfectly aware of their weak constitution. Of all the children we have sent to the Qu'Appelle Industrial school but two are living; all the others died there or came back to die on the reserve.\"\n\nMr Agent McKenzie in his last annual report says that \"the general health of the Indians has not been as good as in former years the cause being traceable to pulmonary troubles and a good deal of mortality amongst the children, the result of measles.\"\n\"A certain number of chronic cases suffering from\n\"scrofulous tuberculosis are attended by the medical\n\"health officer, Dr Cash, on his several visits; How-\n\"ever but little can be done for this class of patient\n\"toward a permanent cure, although the doctor is very\n\"earnest in his work and gives a great deal of care\n\"to those he attends\".\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that it would not\nbe wise to bring children who are likely to be so\nweakly together in a boarding school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This permission was not granted, so they selected a spot just off the reserve to the East, and started building.\n\nNow they have their building almost completed and with their usual persistence, they are going to worry the Government into giving them a grant, and it will require all that we can do to prevent it. If they get it opened it will be a decided injury to us.\n\nQuite recently the priest gave the Indians provisions to have a feast and a palaver that they might talk up the matter and urge upon the Government to give them a boarding school. I have a report of that meeting and am told they counted 23 children they could put in the school to begin with. But of these 23 children 7 are pupils of our school. One of these seven belongs to the Roman Catholics and if they had a school they would have a right to claim him. The other six are the children of one man, a hunting pagan Indian. He is not a Roman Catholic and we have helped him continuously in the matter of clothing for many years. But the Catholic school would be within about four miles of his home and would of course be more convenient for him when he wanted to see his children. At the meeting he, while acknowledging our kindness to him for so long and our good care of his children, expressed himself anxious to have his children that much nearer home. If they can worry the Government into giving them a grant, there is no doubt a strong effort will be made to take this family from us. And that will only be the beginning of the trouble. We have in school children of...\"\ndians who have not joined any Church and whose children were not baptized. Now the Priest is after these people and getting them to permit him to baptize those smaller ones of the same family at home, so that he can claim them when they are grown old enough for school.\n\nThen too it is going to spoil the Indians having the two schools so near. Both schools will want to get the children, and the Indians are cunning enough to take advantage of that and grow very unreasonable.\n\nNo doubt the Catholics are now after the Department, trying to get a sum placed in their estimates for next year, so that it would be well to take action at once if you think anything can be done to prevent the Government giving them a grant other than they have already for their day schools.\"\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted relative to the proposed establishment of a boarding school on the Nez Perce Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe building is of logs on a stone foundation, brick plastered on the outside. Sleepers & joints are but no flooring laid down yet. Roof on, also doors and windows. Cellar dug. 14 x 15 x 6. Lime, Sand, & Lumber on the premises. Enclose a sketch giving an idea of the size and shape of the building. The ceilings are 9 feet high upstairs & down.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\ntwo miles and one quarter each of the old day school and about 135 yards off the Reserve.\n\nI must say that the present day school from an educational point of view is no use & I consider its maintenance but a waste of money.\n\nA great many Indians on this Reserve are hunters & when they go hunting take all their family with them therefore the attendance is irregular whereas if a boarding School was in operation the parents would leave their children there & a good many more whose children have never even attended day school on account of the distance from their homes would be willing to send their children where they knew they would be well cared for.\n\nIn respect to the health of the Indians on this Reserve they certainly are predisposed to typhoid & other diseases but I think that owing to the school being in the locality where they have been brought up seeing their parents occasionally moved have the effect of making them cheerful, happy and contented. They would have more\nmore freedom than in an\nindustrial school & their numbers\nfewer.\n\nThe Rev. Father Debooy\nexpects to have the building ready\nfor occupancy in about three\nmonths. He also intends to\nmove the mission to that point\nalso erect separate buildings\nfor the staff required.\n\nIn provision consider\nmade to house a family towards\nthe maintenance by 12 or 15 people\nto start.

This application was not favorably entertained and in June of that year the Premier was advised, in reply to a further communication addressed to him by Father DeCorby, that the Department did not consider it necessary that a boarding school should be established at this point.\n\nHis Grace Archbishop Langevin again brought this matter to the attention of the Department in 1901 when the Minister approved of the action already taken by the Deputy Superintendent General and directed that His Grace should be so informed and advised of the reasons as to why it was not considered expedient to accede thereto, which was chiefly on the ground that there were not enough children on the reserve to justify its establishment. His Grace renewed his application on the 6th March 1902 and on the 29th of that month he was informed...\nthat the Department had not sufficient information to enable it to arrive at a decision before the supplementary estimates would be submitted to Parliament, but that steps would be taken to officially enquire into the educational needs of these Indians. The Indian Commissioner, who was directed to make the necessary enquiries reported on the 30th ultimo, that after consulting with Mr McKenzie, who has charge of the Pelly Agency, he is of opinion that the recognition of a boarding school at this place might be postponed for a year or two as the Agent informed him that not a few of the Indian children are diseased and could not pass the necessary medical examination, there not being more than ten on the Reserve sufficiently healthy to be taken into such a school.\n\nOn the 4th instant the Commissioner was advised that the Department approved of his recommendation that the recognition of this school be postponed.\n\nThe Archbishop's statement that there are thirty children regularly going to school is not borne out by the Agent's report. The Roman Catholics have a day school on Keesekhouse reserve which is not well attended at present although some years ago it was in a prosperous condition. It is not the Department's fault that it has been allowed to run down and I think that if the missionary was as anxious to keep up the day school as he is to obtain recognition for the boarding school, much better results would follow.\n\nThere is no use disguising the fact that it is more in the interests of religious bodies carrying on mission work among the Indians to extend...\nthe boarding school system at the expense of the day school. The Indian in this district are chiefly hunters and their children will have to follow the same pursuit, and as I have frequently pointed out life in a boarding school is not the best means of fitting them to follow the chase.\n\nI am of opinion that Indian education should be adapted to the mode of life of the Indians. They can obtain the rudiments of an English education at day schools, which is all the nomadic Indians will ever require. Boarding schools are best suited to the needs of Indians who are likely to take up farming and follow the white mode of life, while Industrial schools should only be for such Indians as are likely to come into closer contact with the whites.\n\nThe Department has knowledge that a building has been put up with the intention of carrying on a boarding school, but no encouragement was ever held out to the Church authorities that they would be recouped for the building or furnished a grant for the maintenance of pupils. In fact they were not allowed to put up their building on the reserve. A protest was received from Rev. Dr. Baird, of the Presbyterian Missionary Society against the recognition of this school, as a boarding school is conducted by that Society at Crowstand in this neighborhood. The only weight that could be attached to this protest was that there was no possible need of a second school there for the Roman Catholics.\n\nLimiting their request to a grant for ten pupils, as I take it for six years, is only another way for inserting the thin edge of the wedge as past experience shows that if a school is once recognized\nthere is practically no limit to further demands.\n\nThe Archbishop's postscript that the local Agent and the Indian Commissioner are both in favor of this school is not borne out by the Commissioner's report above referred to.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to my report of the 28th of April last upon the proposal from the Church authorities to take over the St. Boniface School and to substitute therefor boarding schools. The proposal was to build three boarding schools, each to cost $11,174.27, and convey the same to the Government; the per capita grant now provided for the St. Boniface School to be divided among these three and the boarding school erected in the Pelly Agency near Keesekcuss's reserve. The suggested division was as follows:- The proposed school at Fort Alexander to be allowed 45 pupils, that at Sandy Bay 42, that at Fort Francis 40, and the school at Pelly 25.\n\nNot knowing whether the proposal would be entertained, I reported after my visit to Pelly in favor of provision being made for paying a per capita grant to the School at Keesekcouse. Provision was accordingly made in the draft estimates for fifteen pupils at $72.00 per capita, and a copy of my memorandum in the matter was attached. When in conference with the Minister on the estimates I learned that the proposal for the taking over of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\nthe St. Boniface School had been favorably entertained and I then stated that as this proposal included the apportioning of a part of the St. Boniface grant to the new school at Keesekouse, it would not be necessary to make a special provision in the estimates. The Minister agreed with this, and the amount was struck out.\n\nFather Magnan has today applied for payment on account of the pupils of the School at Keesekouse out of the St. Boniface grant. The last return shows that there are 69 pupils at St. Boniface. 100 pupils are provided for. There are therefore funds immediately available for paying for up to 25 pupils at the new School. When at the Pelly Agency in the Fall I visited the School I found a number of children there well provided for. The building is a substantial and commodious one that can easily accommodate 25 pupils. I do not know whether that number has yet been secured, but I do not think there will be any difficulty in securing the full attendance.\n\nI would therefore recommend that a per capita grant of $72.00 be allowed to the new School at Keesekouse's out of the grant for the St. Boniface Industrial School, and that returns be sent to Father De Corby, the Principal, so that he can report the number of pupils in attendance for the quarter beginning the 1st of October.\n\nIt is of course understood the St. Boniface grant will be lessened to the extent it is\nis thus deflected, and that the maximum number of pupils to be paid for will be proportionately reduced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, 24th February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner writes under date of the 16th instant recommending that a per capita grant of $72.00 be allowed for the new Roman Catholic boarding school at Keoseshouse, out of the unearned grant made for the St Boniface school, and that the Principal be authorized to fill in a return from 1st October last in order to draw this grant for 25 pupils, if he has that number in attendance.\n\nThis school has been put up without consulting the Department or obtaining its consent, and if we accede to the request it will be another case of recognizing the right of the Roman Catholic Church to open boarding schools when and where they please and then obtaining the recognition of the Department by the voting of a per capita grant.\n\nYou will see by the second paragraph of Mr McKenna's letter that he discussed this matter with the Minister and that no special provision is being made in next year's estimates for this new school, but there is nothing on file to show that the Minister consented to the above proposition.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School.\nBy admitting the Pelly School into the organization of the St.\nBoniface matter, we have virtually recognized it even though we did\nnot agree that the building should actually be erected.

Commissioner's statement that\nthere are 69 pupils now at St. Boniface is correct, although Mr.\nBenson has not said so. I know that 100 pupils are provided for,\nand if the actual attendance is 69, there is a considerable surplus.\n\nI am as much opposed as ever to recognizing unfounded\nclaims from denominations for new schools, but in the present ins-\ntance we have virtually recognized the school, and it might be con-\nsidered a hardship if we were to refuse to assist it with a per\ncapita grant now that it is in working order.\n\nThe Ass't.

Father De Corby in respect to providing for the fifteen Indian pupils at the new Boarding School. I read him the letter which was quite a disappointment to him.\n\nI went into the whole question of the proposed exchange of the St. Boniface Industrial School building for three Boarding School buildings, and the division of the grant now made to the St. Boniface School among four Boarding Schools, and I had no idea at all that under the arrangement none of the grant of the St. Boniface School could be deflected until an exchange of properties was effected.\n\nAs stated in my letter to you of the 16th ultimo provision was made in the estimates for the coming year for paying for 15 pupils at $72.00 per capita at the Boarding School at Keesekouse's, and it was only struck out of the estimates because it was understood by the Minister that the arrangement in regard to the exchange of the St. Boniface School building and the division of the grant admitted of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe proposed grant for the School at Keeseekoose's being paid out of the grant for the St. Boniface Industrial School. It was part of the policy adopted this year of using the unexpended balance of the School vote to meet increasing demands instead of enlarging the appropriation year by year without taking into account the extent to which it annually lapsed. If it had been for a moment supposed that provision could not thus have been made for the School at Keeseekoose's the item would have stood in the estimates and money would have been available therefore to have paid for 15 pupils at that School from the 1st of July next. If nothing can be done until the exchange of properties is effected the School will be without a grant for a couple of years, because we cannot expect that the Church will erect and completely equip three large boarding school buildings much within that time. In fact, I am given to understand that the authorities do not expect to have the buildings in a position to hand over much before two years.\n\nIt strikes me that if our object is to have the Indian children educated we should gladly avail ourselves of the opportunity offered by the erection of the School by Father De Corby rather than imperil its success by refusing to pay it the regular grant out of money that is lying idle.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.S.

The Minister took no objection to the provision; but agreed with me that as this was one of the schools to participate in St. Boniface grant, it would be better to strike the item out and pay the amount out of the unused portion of the St. Boniface grant, as the agreement for the exchange of the St. Boniface property for boarding schools and the division of the grant was approved, and the providing by Parliament, pending the formal transfer of properties, of a grant for the Keeseekoose's Boarding School might complicate the matter.\n\nYou will see at a glance that to now debar the Keeseekoose's school from any aid until the three new boarding schools are completed and transferred to the Government would be a great hardship and a violation of the understanding on which the amount was struck out of the estimates; for it was struck out not merely because of the arrangement.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\narrangement in regard to the St. Boniface School, but because it was considered that under that arrangement money was made available to admit of the contribution being made which it was the design of the provision in the estimates to provide for the School.\n\nI feel quite sure that if the matter is submitted to the Minister he will recall what took place between us at the time that the estimates were before him in regard to this school. I am afraid if assistance is not given to Father De Corby he will be unable to continue the school, to the great disadvantage of the Indians in that part of the Country, and that even if he succeeds in keeping it open he will be so crippled at the start as to permanently interfere with the success of the institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He says he came once to tell me but as I was away he overlooked it.\n\nHe lays the blame on the fact that he had a new staff who trusted the girls and did not take the proper precautions with them. He also lays the whole cause of this trouble on Sarah Keshane, whom he says is a very bad girl and whom he has had discharged during last month. The Rev. Father assured me that nothing like that would happen again as he was now sleeping in the main building himself instead of in the boy's building adjacent. I might add that the school building in general as well as the children are not nearly as clean and tidy as before the Sisters left the school.

Every thing went on all right until about five O'Clock. I was always awake watching, we went to the camp only after dinner, but as it was rather cold and rainy like I went in a tent to get warm, I was not very long in maybe minutes when I came out I noticed that four of the girls had disappeared in a little bush near by and that some of the young Indians who were playing a little distance at foot ball, had deserted them. Without delay I was starting bringing back two bad girls and smaller ones and sending all back to the school.\n\nThe girls say that they have been followed without their knowledge. I wasn't aware of that; but I am pretty sure that nothing very strange has not been done by the fact that they have only been a short time since their disappearance and that there were too many boys all day and night to tell them.\nStarted to go back alone to the Camp all the same. It was a great act of disobedience, a very risky step and very bad example.\n\nThe boys were eight, the girls ten, children from the Boys Reserve 3 from our school; all boys and girls pretty near the same who have been a cause of trouble to our school last fall.\n\nThe names of the girls are:\nMary Stevenson 11-2\nHelen Browne 10-6\nMary Adelaide Thomas 5\n\nOnly one, that had in her mind to keep a boy, an Indian from Key's River 2 months when she has kept him winter, a secret correspondence until we came to the discovery of it.\n\nThe Indian Agent will deal with the boys as he will think proper but for the girls I beg to ask from the Indian Department: 1. The transfer of Mary Stevenson to the Industrial School at St. Joseph - she is completely an orphan and she wants a protection for the Holidays. 2. The discharge of Miss Helen Browne, if by other means not to send her to be apprenticed off the land, and matters are living, that can take care of her. 3. Mary Adelaide Thomas is young and we will keep her here.\n\nHoping that the Ind. Dept. will understand this sad business and be indulgent.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will also observe that, as we had several schools to improve, it was difficult, not to say impossible for us, to carry on this work simultaneously of all these points.\n\nWe gave our attention to Kenora and Touchwood schools first, where we carried on very extensive alterations, even in excess of what was strictly required by the Department. We have left the Keesekoose School till the last, as it was the least important one, and because we were somewhat undecided if conditions there would guarantee the expenditure. I think that, on the whole, we have been more expeditious than the Department itself, with its own schools, since the enlargements planned for Fort Alexander, Fort Frances and Sandy Bay have not yet been started.\n\nI trust therefore that the present Grant of $100.00 will be\nSt. Mary's Church,\nWinnipeg, Man.

I may say that all that we have done is the gathering of the stones necessary for the basement of the new addition which we intended to build.\n\nWe were expecting to receive plans for said improvements. But the principal reason, I must say, was that, owing to certain causes and especially to the establishment of a day-school on the Key's Band's Reserve, we did not feel sure enough to be able to recruit a sufficient number of children, and we did not think it wise to undertake an enlargement of buildings, which would cost so much, before making sure whether we will be able or not to recruit a sufficient number of children.\n\nIn the mean time, I think we have done our best to keep the school in good condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter mature consideration we have come to the conclusion to close the Keesekoose Boarding School at St. Philips, Sask. It is a question of rebuilding or closing, and as the prospects are not bright for the future of that School, and as the few children there could easily be drafted into our other schools, we consider we would not be justified in either building ourselves or asking the Government to build. Moreover, the Principal, Rev. Father Ruselle, has been quite unwell for the past year and has to be withdrawn from the work altogether.

Father Magnan was informed that the Department's architect would shortly have plans and specifications of the proposed new building ready for transmission. Blue prints were sent to Father Magnan last year, but nothing further was done. Father Cahill, as before mentioned...\nwishes to have an entirely new building, which would not cost much more than the proposed addition and would be much better adapted for school purposes than if the alterations and additions were made. He wishes the Department to assume the whole cost and own the building and told me that they would be content with the grant allowed for Government owned buildings.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The old building was divided so as to provide the other accommodation necessary, including a fully equipped isolation infirmary, with nurse's room and ward for boys and girls with separate entrance from outside thereto.\n\nThe new portion of the building is designed as a boys' wing for what will ultimately be a complete building, the old portion only remaining in use until it was possible to finish the balance of the new building required, as the present building is not expected to remain in condition longer than five years at most.\n\nThis method of extension is not, however, an economical one if the building is to be erected and owned by the Department, as the adapting of the old building for school use is a temporary expedient only, and an entirely new building will prove less expensive in cost of erection and maintenance.\n\nThe plan of the buildings prepared and sent to the school authorities was of a preliminary character only as it appears that early in 1912 the Department contemplated the establishing of an Indian day school in the vicinity of the Keeseekoose school on the Key's Band reserve which\nit was feared would interfere with their chances of recruiting a sufficient number of pupils for this school when the plans were sent to the Rev. Father Magnan; this was called to his attention; but so far as I have been able to determine no further information respecting this is on file.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that providing a sufficient number of pupils can be recruited to establish and maintain this school, and it is decided to proceed with this as a departmental owned school that an entirely new building be erected.\n\nArchitect.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nI have read the reports of Mr. Benson and Mr. Ogilvie on the question of the proposed new school building owned by the Government on the Keesekoose Reserve. I have hope that the Church will go on with the additions and improvements to their own buildings. It might almost be said that the said buildings are unfit for occupation as an Indian Boarding School and it was the only school which continued to receive the grant at the old rate, that is $75.00 per capita when we made the changes in 1911. Please note Father Magnan's letter of the 27th November and our letter of December 2nd. We have continued the per capita grant of $100.00 although in the Spring of 1912 no very vigorous action was taken to meet the conditions imposed in our letter of December 2nd 1911. We provide for 25 pupils at this school and there are now 25 in attendance. There are only about 500 Indians on the Reserve, of which 204 are Roman Catholics and 88 Pagans.

Grain,\nMedical Inspector, Boarding\nSchools, etc.\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that the Indians of Keeseekoonse land have expressed a desire to have a day school on the Reserve, as it is understood, the St Phillips School is not to be reopened. There are about 20 children of school age to attend school, and several others now at boarding school; these latter need not be returned to the day school unless so desired by the Department and principal of the Boarding school. A married teacher would have to be employed, as there is no suitable boarding place for a teacher. The Indians asked that the old school house, fitted up for a farmer, be used as a teachers residence, and no new farmer be appointed. They wish Farmer Anderson of Cote Band to look after them also. If I am allowed to retain Mr Christianson as Clerk this would work out, as he too is a good practical man, who talks the Indian language and would be willing to aid in the farmers work whenever needed. He and I could, in spare time, give help enough to enable Farmer Anderson (who is the best farmer we have ever had here) to enable him to look after both reserves. If this be granted the old church near the residence above mentioned, could be used as a school till a new one is built. The Indians agree to do the work of building, if the Department supply the material, or consent to have a school built from their Capital Account entirely.\n\nThe school would have to be frame as no logs are available in this reserve, or near by. It should be about 18ft x 24 ft. and would cost, if built by a contractor, about $1000.00\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I understand, the reason the Rev. Father Brouellette, spoke of these Indians moving to Shoal River Reserve, as previously reported, was to get sufficient numbers together, to enable them to get a good Boarding school at Shoal River instead of at St Phillips, but the Band does not want to move.\n\nIf this request is deemed advisable to be granted I should be glad to have a reply in time to prevent Mr Clerk Christianson leaving at the end of this month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S.\n\nThe new school house, if built should be about one-half a mile from the Farmer's residence, to be in a central location, but this would be near enough for a teacher to walk to school every day.\nOttawa, May 2, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo stating that the Indians of the Keeseekoose Band have expressed a wish to have a day school on their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is disposed to give favourable consideration to their request, but it cannot entertain the proposition submitted by you to use the farmer's house for a teacher's residence. The Department would like to know what prospects there would be of obtaining a competent teacher to take charge of this school and also to have an approximate estimate of the cost of erecting a combined school-house and teacher's residence.

O'Connell Fathers receive only $15.00 per month for the renting of St. Philip's Indian School, which the above Corporation considers too little for the trouble & expenses resulting from it. Kindly inform the Department that the said corporation has had to remodel the school almost completely in order to answer the purpose, & they have to keep up two large rooms (school-room) & three recreation rooms in a good sanitary condition; & they have to allow at least two acres of land to be used as a school recreation yard. For these very reasons the above Corporation think it just reasonable to receive an extra $10.00 per month for the renting of the said School.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Consequently, our own servant girls' attention will have to keep the cook stove in management of course.\n\n2nd The Inspector has proposed that the Oblate provide meat and whatever is necessary for the purpose of serving this meal. But this seems practically impossible to us. The school is located too far out of town and we have no refrigeration whereby to keep fresh meat or any other groceries.\n\nTherefore, the above Corporation suggests\nThat an extra $10 cents per head be paid by the Deps. for every meal - and the Corporation itself will see to provide such meal as requested by the Deps.\n\nNow, dear sir, we trust you will take these matters up with the Deps. and that a favorable answer will soon reach us.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nThe Rev. Oblate Fathers\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Poulet, principal of St. Phillip's School. The Church evidently think they are not receiving sufficient rent for School. They have added a recreation room and greatly improved the general conditions both inside and outside and are under the impression that they should receive $25.00 per month instead of $15.00 per month as is now paid. Regarding the matter of mid-day meal to be served at the School which Father Poulet offers to serve for 10\u00a2 per child, I think this is very reasonable and should work out just as cheap and satisfactory as if the Department furnished the supplies.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 28, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev.

The first time the Indians\nHad their treaty it was said to have\na day school in the reserve.

GRAHAM\nCOMMISSINNER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nREGINA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn several occasions, the Indians of the Reserves around Kamsack, appealed to me for the reopening of the old St Philip Boarding School.\n\nLast month I sent Rev. Father Chaumont and R.F. Brassard to make a special inquiry into the conditions and dispositions of these Indians.\n\nA careful census showed 52 children of school age, all Catholics, in the Reserves of Keeseekonse, Key and Valley River. Most of these do not attend any school; an average of seven only going to the St Philip day school.\n\nI do not need to insist on the necessity of reopening our Boarding school, with You, who have a wide and long experience of the Indians all over the West.\n\nThis former Boarding School was closed, we being unable at the time to provide for the necessary staff. This we are now in a position to furnish; but unfortunately, lack the financial means to erect a substantial building for from 50 to 60 children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe old school building could be used as a residence for the principal and male employees of the school, the remaining space serving as store rooms.\n\nI consequently join with our Catholic Indians to ask You and through You The Indian Department, to grant us the said Boarding School; the Oblate Fathers agree to transfer free of all charge to the Indian Department all the land necessary for the erection of the school and provide the necessary staff in Fathers and Sisters to satisfactorily manage same.\n\nI feel confident, Master Graham, that You will receive this our petition favorably, knowing that You have devoted Your life to the civilisation and welfare of the Indians, with a zeal and success not surpassed by anyone in our North-West. Your helping hand has gone to all, irrespective of race or creed.\n\nYour Humble Servant\n\nJ.B. B\u00e9langer\nProvincial O.M.I.\n\nW.M. GRAHAM\nCOMMISSIONER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nREGINA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\n\nNOV 29 1921\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter which I received from the Provincial of the Oblate Order, in which he makes an appeal to have the St. Philip's Boarding School, on the Keesekoonse Reserve in the Pelly Agency, reopened.\n\nAs you will notice, the Provincial points out that there are 52 children in this Agency who are not attending school. This is a situation which should not be. So long as we carry out the present plan of having a Day School on the Reserve, we can only get those children who are immediately surrounding the school to attend. It would be impossible for these children at any distance to take advantage of a Day School. No matter where it was situated on the Reserve there would always be those who would be too far away. I have not the slightest doubt that the Church would be quite willing to reopen the School, and use the existing building for the time being; but sooner or later, the Department or the Church will be called upon to erect suitable buildings to carry on the work. I feel quite satisfied that if the Church had been able to furnish the proper staff, the School would never have been closed, but now, from the Reverend Father's letter, I would judge they are prepared to go into the matter again and furnish a proper staff to carry on the work. Perhaps the Department would see fit to put an amount in the Estimates this year for the purpose of erecting a school to accommodate from 50 to 60 children; and if not to erect a school, place an amount for the maintenance of so many children in the existing building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 1, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a letter from the Provincial of the Oblate Order, in which he requests the reopening of the St. Phillips (Keesekouse) boarding school.\n\nI have read the Reverend Gentleman's communication and have noted your recommendation concerning this school. When preparing the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, this claim on our finances will receive earnest consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 1, 1921.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nThe subject matter of the communications from Father Beys and Commissioner Graham was discussed by the Reverend Fathers Guy and Boyer at the time of their visit to the Department yesterday.\n\nThe situation, in brief, is as follows: The 1915 census shows that on the Leeseekouchee, Kay and Valley River reserves the Roman Catholics have a following of 132, as compared with 89 adherents to all other denominations. The Day School has been more or less of a failure: an average attendance of only 7 obtained. There are 52 children of school age, and the Reverend Father Beys is asking for the erection of a residential school to accommodate that number.\n\nThe old building, which in the event of a new school being erected could be used as a residence for the staff and storehouse, would be given to the Department of Indian Affairs in addition to perhaps 40 acres of land. I am convinced that if we asked for the whole of the quarter section that belongs to the Oblate Fathers and which is contiguous to our reserve, our request would be granted.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham is in favour of a boarding school at this point or the reopening of the old building, with a view to ascertaining whether the Church would at this time make a success of a residential school at this point.\n\nI personally believe that the Oblate Fathers would rather not try to carry on their activities in the old building, as it was a matter of accommodation that discouraged them some years ago. If we cannot afford to build on the Leeseekouchee reserve this next fiscal year, I believe that Father Beys and his staff would rather postpone commencing operations until such time as we can finance the project.\n\nIn the meantime, Sir, I will give this request due consideration in connection with the papers from the Reverend Father Guy, that you handed to me yesterday.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nFather Boyer, of Father Beys' staff at Winnipeg, wishes to draw the attention of the Department to the fact that there is now available a principal and staff for the proposed St. Phillips Boarding School on the Keesceckcuse reserve, Felly agency.\n\nThe Reverend Father wishes to impress upon the Department that if no building programme for this school is arranged for this year, in all probability an efficient staff and principal would be very hard to secure in future years. The R.C. Church authorities are willing to give us certain property rights at this time, as mentioned in my memorandum to you on this matter, of the first ultimo. If nothing is done this fiscal year, Father Beys will likely dispose of the property which they own in the Felly agency.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nHaving been notified by the Board of Indian Commissioners to undergo a course of observation and treatment, I am at present an inmate of the above hospital. I was engaged in teaching at St. Philips' Indian Day School, Pelly Agency, Major Bradbrook being Agent of the said Reservation, and they concerned. I beg to acquaint you with these facts in case my detention here should cause any delay in my opening the school.\n\nI don't think any loss will accrue to the school being closed a little longer during this\ncold weather, as there is a marked decrease in the attendance during the winter months. I will be ready to resume my duties as teacher as soon as I am discharged from the hospital.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nN. Edmonaghan\nOttawa, January 31, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 22nd instant, referring to your enforced absence from the Keesekcuse Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department regrets to learn of your ill health, and I wish to assure you that Mr. Agent Bradbrooke will be instructed to hold your position open for you for a few weeks. I might suggest that you write him direct, explaining your absence and intimating your desire to return to your duties as school teacher. He may be able to arrange for a substitute for you during the interim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E.

Monaghan, Teacher of the Keeseekhouse Indian Day School. Mr. Monaghan is undergoing treatment at the City Hospital in Saskatoon and may be absent a few weeks from his duties.\n\nIf you feel that the work at the Keeseekhouse Indian Day School will suffer if no substitute is appointed for the interim, the Department would be grateful if you can arrange to keep the school open. Perhaps some Indian graduate of a residential school could carry on while Mr. Monaghan is absent.\n\nI have intimated to Mr. Monaghan that his position will be kept for him while he is undergoing treatment at Saskatoon, and I have requested him to communicate with you direct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

I therefore earnestly hope that the construction of that school shall not be delayed for another year.\n\nErnestly praying You to give that matter Your powerful support, I remain,\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nYours Faithfully.\n\nJoseph H.

The class is being carried on in the old boarding school building. The teacher is Mr. W. E. Monaghan, who is paid a salary of $60.00 per month.

We might call it an Improved Day School.\n\nThe old buildings could be repaired for a few hundred dollars and made habitable for a staff of perhaps 3 and 20 younger pupils. The 3 members of the staff could be called Senior and Junior teachers and Field Matron. Their duties would be to take charge of the house and to carry on the teaching operations in conjunction with a principal or Mr. Monaghan, who is at present conducting a day school on the property.\n\nIf the Department could make a liberal grant for salaries and for provisions (on the Improved Day School plan) Father Boyer is of the opinion that a nucleus would be set up, from which would grow a small boarding school when funds could be provided for a new building.\n\nThe aim for the interim before a building is erected would be 2 classrooms - one for girls and one for boys - a total of perhaps 50 pupils, 20 of whom would be boarders.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nThe future of the Keesekouse Indian Day School has been discussed at some length by a member of Father Pears' staff of Winnipeg and this Department. I refer you also to your file No. 316-14 and your memorandum of November 26th, last. In all probability funds will not be found for the erection of the new Filip Boarding School, on this reserve, in the next two or three years, and it has been suggested that the Keesekouse day school be enlarged in its activity to semi-boarding school in type. We might call it an Improved Day School. The old buildings could be repaired for a few hundred dollars and made habitable for a staff of perhaps 3 Sisters and about 20 younger pupils. The Sisters could take charge of the house and carry on the feeding operations in conjunction with a principal or Mr. Monaghan who is the present incumbent at the day school on the same property.\n\nThe Department might make a liberal grant for salaries and for provisions (on the improved day school plan) and a nucleus for a future small boarding school would be established. The aim in the interim before a building could be erected would be two classrooms, one for girls and one for boys\u2014a total of 50 pupils, 20 of whom would be boarders. Equipment could be provided from either stores or from that which is at present in Le Pas, Man. This last supply has been lately mentioned by you on your file No. 205/15 (12th instant).\n\nIf you believe that such a scheme is worthy of our attention and would achieve results, I would be pleased if you would instruct Mr. Agent Bradbrook to give every assistance to a member of Father Pears' staff, who will visit Kamloops the first week in May. Our representative and the Rev. Father can give the Department an idea as to how much is needed in the way of repairs and what equipment should be provided.\n\nAs far as the cause is concerned, I agree with you and the church representatives that the Indian children are numerous enough to warrant this, and even a larger undertaking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

She has had some experience in teaching, and our Public School Inspector - who also knows her - offered to grant her a permit to teach in case she cared to try to get a school in his Inspectorate. Until she is able to get a professional certificate for work.\n\nI think she is twenty-eight years of age, and of sound constitution.

Wallace, who inspected Cote School was very helpful in this way as he left his report for me to forward to Regina and also discussed the School with me.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nThis is to certify that Mr Joseph Dugliet was a student at the Seminary (Gozo) for many years and at Bagheria (Palermo) College for five years, and at St Mary's Hall (Stonehurst) where he completed the course of Philosophy with great success.\n\nHe is a member of a well known and respected family in Malta.\n\nI strongly recommend him as a teacher for his abilities, especially for his knowledge of Latin, Italian and Philosophy.\n\nSt Aloysius College\nBirchircara - Malta\n28th October 1913\n\nJ.

A. Scott, Deputy\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. C. A. Bradbrooke, Indian Agent,\nPelby Agency, called on me yesterday in\nregard to the report made by School\nInspector, Mr. Arthur D. Merrill, against\nMr. J. Inglett, as not being qualified to\nteach in the St. Philips Indian School.\n\nMr. Merrill says in his report that\nthere is no progress. How can he know it,\nfor he was coming for the first time?\n\nThe word \"progress\" fore-supposes two\npoints of comparison. How can he form a\njudgment, if he sees only one side of the\nquestion, unless he wishes to imitate the\nhunter, pointing his gun, without taking\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\nany aim? Moreover, how can Mr. Herrill substantiate his statement that there is no progress, for the most of the pupils arrived at school when the inspection was over?\n\nMr. Herrill started his inspection at nine o'clock. As the children come from a distance, they generally arrive at nine-thirty, or ten o'clock, when the weather is bad. Therefore, he found in the class-room only seven pupils, of whom three were white children, and the new teacher, Mrs. Inglett, not yet dressed for her class.\n\nHad Inspector Herrill come at ten o'clock, he would have found twelve children, Indian children; fifteen including the three white children, and the teacher, in proper attire.\n\nHe would then have made a more complete and satisfactory inspection.\n\nI was present myself at the inspection.\nand I am glad to state that the three white children passed a good, interesting examination, and could compare favorably with any other pupils of their age in the public schools. Mr. Merrill should at least have given credit for them, or does he belong to that class of men who see everything black in Catholic schools?\n\nI may say that I have had some twenty-five years experience in Indian schools, and I can certify that the Indian pupils, who were instructed by Mr. Merrill, showed as much proficiency as those in other Indian schools. This Indian school may be the first one Mr. Merrill has visited.\n\nAnother point to consider is that this school has been closed for months at a time, giving these children less chance than other children to make a good showing. Comparing their advancement\ntoday, to what it was three months ago, their progress is evident and proves much in favor of their attendance at school and the efficiency of their former teacher, Miss De Reich.\n\nBut even if there was no progress, as stated in the Inspector's report, Mr. Merrill should not throw the blame on Mr. Ingloft.\n\nMr. Ingloft was appointed by the Indian Department as teacher to begin his duties, as such, at the beginning of this quarter. After Miss Reich left St. Philips on the 24th of September and, through kindness, Mr. Ingloft finished out her term, beginning to teach on the 25th of September, two days before the inspection. No wonder he was not prepared for a complete and advantageous examination of his pupils. He hardly knew their names, nor their standing in the school. Mr. Merrill was\ninformed of this fact, and, for that reason, his indulgence was requested.\n\nHowever, Mr. Kerrill had the boldness to use a convenient word, to make a report against Mr. Biglopp, stating he was not qualified to teach in the St. Philips Indian School, and suggesting his dismissal.\n\nAn explanation of Mr. Kerrill's lack of judgment, common justice, and of his faulty reasoning, could not be found in the deep dissertations of Aristotle's philosophy.\n\nWas it because, since Mr. Reich being a Protestant, he wanted to cover him with his paternal cloak, preferring to throw whatever blame there was, on Mr. Biglopp, who is of the Catholic faith, belonging to that faith, which makes him a ready mark for unfairness and injustice?\n\nIf this is so, Mr. Kerrill is certainly...\nteaching in the most elementary qualifications required for an instructor, unless one must infer he is afflicted with a sudden aberration of mind, a thing to be regretted, but not to be condoned.\n\nI am strongly protesting against this stupid, senseless report, apt to hurt and injure a first class teacher, who is, probably, more informed on educational matters than his superior himself, as proof of which, I refer you to the enclosed two copies: references of his qualifications.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Ingloff, in 1912, was teaching the Latinization class, in the Jesuit College, in Malta. Therefore, there is no question about his qualification for teaching in an Indian school. He is fully competent to be a Professor in any school or University, where he would find a ready admission, had he in view, a good salary, and the comforts of life.\nInspired by a high ideal devotedness,\nand self-denial, he prefers teaching in\nIndian schools, at a poor salary, with\nall the attending discomforts of teaching\nin a poor Indian school.\n\nThe Indian Department should be\nproud to count such a man on the staff\nof teachers in Indian schools, and should\ncertainly encourage him, by appreciating\nhis worth.\n\nIt is a duty for me to rehabilitate\nhis reputation before the Indian Depart-\nment against the unjust accusation\nmade by Mr. Herrick, who was lacking\nin justice even common sense, or he\nwould have suspended his judgment\nuntil his second inspection.\n\nI beg, at least, that you advise\nMr. Herrick to make an apology for\nhis unfounded accusation against\nMr. Inglett; otherwise, I would be forced\nto have recourse to the public press.\n\nI also desire that the St. Philips Indian school be inspected by another School Inspector than Mr. Kerrill.\n\nI have given many proofs that I have very much at heart the education of the Indian children, and will always be pleased to receive any advice or suggestion benefitting the schools under my care; but I would be disheartened to have the St. Philips school inspected by such an unfair partial and so evidently ill disposed a man as Mr. Kerrill has shown himself to be.\n\nTrusting in the fair play, and sense of justice of the high officers of the Indian Department, regardless of creed or race,\n\nI am, Most Respectfully,\n\nS. Perreault, O.M.D.\nMissionary.\nOttawa, Nov. 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 11 of the 27th ultimo, relative to Mr. Public School Inspector Merrill's report on the Leesekouse Indian Day School. I have noted that Mr. Inglott, the Teacher, had but a few days with his class before the inspector's visit, and undue importance will not be attached to his rather critical report.\n\nAs was suggested to you in official communication of this file number, of the 20th ultimo, you might give the teacher any assistance possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. A. Bradbrooke, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Nov. 13, 1922.\n\nDear Father Perrault:\n\nI have received your letter of the 26th ultimo, referring to the report made by a provincial public school inspector on the Leeseekouse (St. Phillip's) Indian Day School.\n\nOn receipt of the report referred to, this department wrote Mr. Agent Bradbrooke, asking him to help the teacher in any way he could and to discuss with you the advisability of making a change in teachers. When our representative reported that Mr. Inglott had commenced teaching but a day or two prior to the inspector's visit we, of course, did not attach so much importance to the critical remarks of Mr. Inspector Merrill; and a communication is being addressed to Mr. Bradbrooke, again suggesting that he give every assistance to the new teacher as he commences his work.\n\nI have noted your remarks concerning Mr. Inglott's qualifications, and I look for a career of much usefulness in his case.\n\nThe teachers of Indian day schools are not directly responsible to public school inspectors, as these schools are controlled and managed by this department. The powers of appointment and dismissal rest with the church authorities and the Department of Indian Affairs. When we asked the provincial Department to inspect Indian schools, the aim was to obtain uniformity. If the teachers and others interested in the work consider the inspection from this point of view, much assistance will be given by the provincial officers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. S. Perrault, O.M.I.,\nSt. Phillips,\nSask.\nSt. Philips' Sask. September 6th 1922\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have received lately an application for the St. Philips' Indian school from a married man who has been teaching for 3 years in a lonely mission of Lake Winnipeg. He has to quit on account of the bad health of his wife. He has applied to teach at St. Philips where they will find a more comfortable life which they much deserve. He will teach and his wife will keep the house. They have no children. Consequently they will be the right people in the right place. I have decided to accept them as much for my advantage than for theirs. He shall begin his functions at the beginning of October. Therefore your services as teacher are no more required after this month.\n\nI am taking this opportunity to thank you for your\ndevotion, certainly, you have been very punctual in your functions as teacher, and taking much interest in your class, so the Indians are well pleased of the progress of their children, and satisfied with the way you treat them.\n\nI am thanking you also for the trouble you are taking in cleaning my house and the church.\n\nI may assure you that I will keep a good souvenir of your stay at St. Philips, and I will be always happy to see you coming into this little mission when you have started your functions as teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nS. Perreault.\nDear Sir,\n\nMiss A. S. McLeod was engaged to teach the above school on July 3rd, on the understanding that she would be employed until Christmas.\n\nShe was dismissed on Sept 30th without good cause. I enclose the letter of dismissal which speaks for itself.\n\nMiss McLeod claims her salary in full until Christmas. Miss McLeod is my wife's sister and has asked me to see about the matter.\n\nYours Truly,\nHugh Monaghan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, Nov. 22nd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the dismissal of Miss A. S. McLeish who formerly taught the Keesekouse (St. Phillip's) Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as this school is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, the services of Miss McLeish were engaged by the authorities of that Church, and they are responsible for any change that is made in the teachers. The Department had no correspondence with Miss McLeish regarding her engagement or dismissal and she should therefore take this matter up with the missionary who notified her of her dismissal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should immediately take up with Rev. Father Perrault, the Missionary on the Reserve, the matter of obtaining the services of a qualified successor, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the next Christmas holidays. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by Father Perrault should be submitted by you for the approval of the Department. It is hoped that the services of a suitable teacher can be obtained in time to continue the work after the beginning of the new year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nasst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. A. Bradbrooke, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nST PHILIP INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\nREOPENING:-Very Rev.Fr Beys has sent me a very strong letter urging the reopening of St Philip Boarding School and advising me that he considers this request as the most important matter concerning the Indians in the territory under his jurisdiction. He admits of the enlarging of certain schools but he states that before proceeding with that work it is a duty for the Department to build first in places where children are entirely deprived of educational facilities. Enlarging of schools come after in his opinion specially in the schools under his care. But the construction and reopening of St Philip should be the first consideration of the Department and he suggests that economy be practiced on some items and this would afford the necessary money for the work to be done at St Philip. He even adds that the neglect in which the reserves around Kamsack (Keesekouse, Key and Valley River) are kept in regard to education is a dark spot for the Department. Commissioner Graham must have sent to the Department a letter sent to him by Very Rev.Fr Beys on November 21st, 1921 and giving all details in the matter. If there is no copy of said letter on file at the Department I will be pleased to forward one at your request.

We feel, however, that he is well qualified to do day school work and he has been given a second opportunity under our auspices. His appointment to the position of teacher of the Leeseeckouse Indian Day School is approved. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $650 per annum, supplemented by any bonus provided by law. I hope that his efforts will meet with success at this point.\n\nWill you please arrange with Mr. Rossington to take charge of the school immediately after the new year.

(RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to say that I am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent at Kamsack in which he informs me that a meeting was held at the Agency office of the Keesekoonse Band and that they requested him to write and ask that a day school be situated on the middle of their Reserve for the better convenience of their children. They point out that the present school (St. Phillips) is situated off the Reserve and it means that the children would have to travel a considerable distance to get to school, in fact some of the children are going without education on this account.\n\nThere has been considerable correspondence on the subject of a school on this Reserve during the last year, and I have before me your letter of the 20th of April last No.117-3-1 and I discussed the subject of this letter with Father Beys who was in this office some time after the receipt of the letter, and nothing definite was arrived at at the time.\n\nI may say that there were three teachers on this Reserve during the last year and we have not had any success to speak of so far. A report made by Inspector Merrill on the 28th of September last was anything but satisfactory. You will recall that he thought we would be just as well not having the school open at all as going on as we were. I understand Mr. Rossington has been appointed and I have my doubts whether this man will be much better than any one we have had in the past. Personally I think the solution of the question is to build another school there to take in all Roman Catholic children on\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept.of Indian Affairs - Ottawa.\nKey, Keesekoonee and Cote Reserves. This might be built at some point near Mamsack. If the Department cannot do this then steps should be taken by the Roman Catholic church to put the existing school in good shape and take the children in as boarders.

Rossington, Esq.,\nSt. Philips,\nSask.\nSir,\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the condition of the Keesekoose Indian Day School. This building is rented from the Roman Catholic Church and is situated just off the Keesekoose Reserve, which condition means that the children have to come long distances, which in bad weather is a hardship, as they have to travel on foot or otherwise as best they can.\n\nThe School itself has long past its useful-ness, as it is badly lighted and heated and no proper ventilation, the ceiling is low, and there is not the cubic space of air necessary that there should be to keep children in good health and mental alertness while studying.\n\nThe place looks patched and dilapidated, the Indians are anxious to have a School centrally situated on the Reserve, and am of opinion that this course would be of benefit to all concerned.\n\nThe number of children of school age on this reserve is about 35 and there would be better control in getting a fuller attendance with a school on the reserve than there is at present, with the school situated where it is.\n\nI therefore beg your consideration in this matter, as the conditions are such that this school has outlived its usefulness and is now on the score of health alone, unfit to use.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter #117-3-1 of the 7th inst., concerning the temporary appointment of Mr. George Barton as teacher to the Keesekoosse Indian Day School.\n\nI have known Mr. Barton slightly for some time and he appears to be a reliable man, but regarding his teaching ability I cannot yet report upon this at present, as this day school is closed until 1st March.\n\nAs soon as the school is in operation I will then have the opportunity to observe Mr. Barton's work and report whether this gentleman should receive permanent status or not.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Jan. 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 11 of the 17th instant, with reference to the qualifications of Mr. George Barton, whose temporary appointment to the Keeeseekoose Indian Day School has been approved. The Department desires you to make a report upon Mr. Barton's ability, some time after school is opened on the first of March.\n\nI have also your No. 11 of the same date, relative to the condition of the building in use at this school. I have noted that it is long past its usefulness and that it is unsatisfactory for day school purposes. I have to inform you, in reply, that the Department has given serious consideration to the advisability of erecting a small Indian residential school for the Roman Catholic children of this vicinity and no action with reference to day school building will be taken until after the program for the future has been determined.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They therefore apply to you for a Boarding School for this Reserve and the surrounding Reserves.\n\nThe school should be built close to the present buildings of St. Philips Roman Catholic Mission.\n\nThere are a great many children left without any education, especially on Key Reserve, Valley River and Shoal River.\n\nThe necessity of this school has been recognised and approved the year before last by a vote of Parliament. The building however of this school was postponed for a more pressing one.\n\nWe beg to state that the necessity of a boarding school here is very urgent, and we hope that you will take immediate steps so that this school may be built next summer and our many children receive a proper education.\n\nWe on our part will do our best so that the school will prove a success in every way. We would willingly grant on our Reserve all the land necessary for the buildings and management of the school. In fact we have all signed our names on a petition to show that we are of the same mind as our chief in this matter, which petition is attached to this letter.\n\nSignatures of Keeseekoose Chief \u2014 Wabecuganee X\nCounsellor \u2014 John X Musqua\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nVery Rev. Fr Beys and myself have examined different sites on the KeeseKouse reserve and in the municipality of Ramsack and surroundings. In our estimation, the S.E. \u00bc of Sec. 3, Tp. 32, Re. 32, W. of 1st M., and the N. E. \u00bc of Section 4, Tp. 31, Re. 32, W. of 1st M. would be most adequate for the purpose stated. In fact, those two quarter sections are situated in front of the church and former school (just across the road). The Indians have signed a petition to surrender the two quarter sections and I herewith join same to the present request.\n\nI also annex a map of the locality the portion circumscribed in yellow pencil fascinating the recruiting grounds of the intended school.\n\nI therefore urgently press the Department for a favourable decision in the above matter by enclosing in the Estimates a sum of about $80,000.00 for the construction of a frame building on the site referred to at St. Philip's, Sask., for the accommodation of 100 children.\n\nJoseph [signature]\nCONSTRUCTION OF A RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL AT ST. PHILIP'S, SASK.\n\nIt has been the matter of serious thought on the part of Oblate Missionaries authorities for the last few years to provide for adequate educational facilities for a large number of Indian children, living on KeeseeKouse, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Key, Valley River, Nut Lake, Birch River, Swan River, Pelican Reserves and others.\n\nA residential school has been already in full activity at St. Philip's but has been replaced by a temporary Day School for reasons known to the Department. After a careful survey of the situation and in consideration of repeated requests from the Indians, we have come to the conclusion that the erection at St. Philip's, Sask., of a modern building to accommodate about 100 children has become a necessity of such an importance that we do not hesitate to place the request for the construction of said building as the very first item on our list of major needs in view of the Estimates.\n\nCommissioner Graham has discussed the situation thoroughly with Very Rev. Beys, O.M.I., and has reached the same conclusion as the latter, viz: The immediate necessity of the erection of a Residential School at St. Philip's.\n\nOf course, we are aware that some of the above mentioned reserves are nearer certain other schools if a straight line is drawn but in reality we deem that it is only at St. Philip's that railway accommodation is most convenient and recruiting work possible.\n\nIn the course of my last visit West Very Rev. Fr Beys and myself met the Catholic Indians of KeeseeKouse and C\u00f4t\u00e9 Reserves who made to us a very strong request and offered to surrender a half section of land on the KeeseeKouse Reserve for the proposed school. Herewith annexed please find copy of petitions from the Indians of KeeseeKouse, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Valley River Reserves, to build a residential school at St. Philip's.\n\nThe matter of the site might be a source of discussion but I take the liberty of expressing the Oblate Missionaries' opinion in the matter without prejudice to the decision of the Department.\nSt. Philips Sash.\n\nDec. 5th 1925.\n\nRussell H. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Education Ottawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to get permission to make a change in the vacations of the St. Philips Indian Day School on Keeseekoose Reserve. For about the last three years the vacations at this school have been taken in Jan. and February. I would much prefer to divide the study time up a little better, by taking January, (the coldest month), and August, the hottest months. Two months at one time seem rather long for children to be away from school, and they are likely to forget a great deal. And it is a pretty long grind from the beginning of March until Rinas, through all the hot harvest weather, for both children and teacher.\n\nAll the schools around here, including the Otoe Indian school, have vacations in August. The teachers can get away in summer for a rest far better, and most children are wanted, and are kept home for help during the harvest in August anyhow.\n\nI have always had a good attendance in December and March here, and I am pretty sure I would also have in February if the school was open.\n\nI think my suggestion is well worthy of your approval. In fact it was only on account of one teacher here 3 or 4 years ago, that the present system was adopted. The teachers following since, though no liking it, thought it had always been that way here, and said nothing.\n\nIf the change of vacations from January and February to January and August, meets with your approval, and I feel sure it will, perhaps you will be kind enough to let me know as soon as possible, so I can then notify the children before they leave for Rinas.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nGeorge Barton - Teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 9th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mr. George Barton, teacher of the Keesekoose Indian Day School, in which he suggests that one month's holidays be taken in January and the other month in August. He states that he feels that this would meet with the approval of all concerned, and would be a better arrangement than the present one of taking the holidays during January and February and continuing school throughout all the summer months.\n\nPlease discuss this matter with the teacher, and, if you consider it advisable to have the holidays taken in the manner he suggests, you may give him the necessary authority.

Please inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nIn preparing his quarterly returns in future he should state definitely thereon the periods which the school was closed as authorized above for annual holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. A. McConnell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs the teacher of the Philip's Indian Day School at Messickhouse Reserve-Pelly Agency, I beg to bring to your notice a few facts, of which perhaps you are unaware, and of which I respectfully beg your favorable consideration.\n\nThis is one of the very few day schools that provide the children with a full hot meal at noon. This naturally entails considerable extra work, and in fact in some of the other day schools that do likewise, a special nation is engaged, and the teacher has only to attend to the teaching.\n\nThe children here get hot meat and vegetable soups, bread, rice, beans, jam, biscuits, and tea sugar, and milk, and sometimes eggs in summertime. The vegetables I provide\u2014potatoes, carrots, onions, and turnips\u2014by putting in a good school garden, which provides enough for the whole year. Milk, jam, and eggs I also provide free myself. The rest is provided by the Department.\n\nNow a great deal of this cooking has necessarily to be done by my wife during school hours, and takes up an hour or two every morning, besides baking bread twice a week for the school. Then although I am with the children during the dinner and washing up, she comes and watches them while I eat my dinner, so they are never alone.\n\nYou see we are doing our very best to conduct this school in the way such a school should be run. At the same time the salary for all this work is very small. We would therefore like to ask you if you could not see your way to allow my wife a small allowance of say $10 per month for the burdens which she is obliged to do for this school, and which she has done now for over two years.\n\nIf you can see your way to assist us in this, and which I think you will agree is not asking too much of the Department, I assure you we will be very grateful indeed.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nGeorge Watson (teacher)\nOttawa, February 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, explaining the amount of work attendant upon the noonday lunch at the St. Philip's Indian Day School. I am corresponding with our local representative in this regard, and, when a decision is reached, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeorge Barton, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nSt. Philips, Sask.\nOttawa, February 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nRepresentations have reached the Department relative to the amount of work attendant upon the preparation of the noonday lunch for the pupils of the St. Philip's Indian Day School. I am informed that a full hot meal is served, that the vegetables are grown in the school garden, that milk, jam and sometimes eggs are provided by the teacher. It is stated that Mrs. Barton bakes bread twice a week for the school and spends considerable time in connection with the noon meal.\n\nPlease let me have a report in this connection and make a recommendation concerning allowing $100 a year for this work. It is not proposed to appoint Mrs. Barton as field matron, but the Department might increase Mr. Barton's salary because of the work that his wife is doing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nC. A. McConnell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.117-3-1 of the 25th ultimo concerning the work in connection with noon meal at St. Phillip's Indian Day School.\n\nI have to report that the noon meal is prepared by Mrs. Barton at her own home about 200 yards from the school and placed on the school stove to keep warm until the pupils are ready for the meal.\n\nMilk is supplied daily from Mr. Barton's own cows for the children's tea and used with the rice; bread is baked twice a week and jam and eggs are supplied on Friday. Mrs. Barton does the baking and prepares the vegetables at her own home and the children are not used for this work.\n\nAs all this entails considerable work for Mrs. Barton and as both Mr. Barton and his wife do a great deal for the welfare of the children, I beg to recommend that the $100.00 a year you have in view to Mr. Barton for this purpose and wish to inform you that Mr. Barton's is a very conscientious man and does his duties in a manner that should have some praise from the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, concerning the work being performed in connection with the preparation and serving of the noonday meal to the pupils of the St. Phillip's Indian Day School and the question of allowing a grant of $100 a year for this work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report and recommendation, the Department will approve of allowing the sum of $100 a year in payment for this service. This will be paid as an increase in the salary of Mr. George Barton, the teacher, from April 1st, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year. This will make Mr. Barton's salary from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Barton of this increase and that it is provided as a remuneration for the work being performed by himself and his wife in the preparation and serving of the midday meal to the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. A. McConnell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been decided to grant an increase at the rate of $100 per annum in the salary of Mr. George Barton, teacher of the St. Phillip's Indian Day School.

In reply I beg to say that it is hoped he has been able to resume duties by this date.\n\nWhen he forwards his return showing the attendance, etc., for the current quarter, it should be accompanied by a doctor's certificate covering the period he was absent on account of ill-health.

And that the salary would be increased by $100 per year, commencing from April 1st.\n\nFor this kindness my wife and I wish to thank you very much but we are very much disappointed at the delay.\n\nShe has carried on this work all through the years 1924 and 1925 for nothing. So do you think it is quite fair Mr. Smith, to delay it for another whole quarter in 1926?

SCOTT\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis year, in the immense territory of which I have charge, only one small school is to be built, the one of St Philips, near Kamsack, Sask.\n\nRecently an increase in the grant has been attributed to some schools. In union with the four Bishops of my territory as well as their advisors and mine, I want to express that public moneys would be better used in building schools or enlarging the present ones, so as to give an opportunity to every Indian child to receive an education. The schools were going on and I am not aware that the cost of living has increased lately. Instead if the sane part of the population of Canada were acquainted with conditions in many reserves where all children are left in absolute material and mental neglect, a cry of protest would rise from one end of the Dominion to the other.\n\nI am very anxious that the little granted to us be executed as early as possible so as to have some possibility to gather up the children next fall. I expected the tenders for our school to come out with those for the Sturgeon Landing School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am therefore writing to You, so that this matter may be attended to.\n\nOur first impulse was to write to the Minister; but I know too well how kind and attentive You have been towards us and therefore have perfect confidence that You shall do all You can to help us.\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nJ.B. BEYS O.M.I.\nProvincial\nTo Mr. DUNCAN C. SCOTT\nDeputy Superintendent General\nIndian Department Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn April 29th, I wrote to You on important matters which, after consulting with those closely interested in Indian work, I felt it was my duty to let known to You.\n\nToday, I am really sorry to have to point out, that receipt of my letter has not as yet been acknowledged.\n\nYours sincerely:\n\nJ.B. Beys O.M.I.\nProvincial\nMay 26, 1926.\n\nReverend and dear Sir,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of April 29th, and your note of May 20th reminding me that you had received no acknowledgment of it.\n\nI am very sorry indeed that I have not had time to reply at an earlier date, but the matter was receiving constant attention and the case of the proposed new school on the Keeseekoose Reserve has not been in any way prejudiced by my delay in replying. Father Guy has kept diligently before me the needs for this school, and has promoted in every way the interest of the project. The Department, however, has to look over the whole field and make a fair distribution of the restricted appropriation which Parliament will allow us this year. We will not be able to build the school at Keeseekoose this summer, but intend to build on the Peigan Reserve, to begin the school on the Onion Lake Reserve, and finish the school at Sturgeon Landing. We must undertake this last-mentioned work because the school was erected in part last year and cannot be allowed to stand uncompleted. The claims for new schools at the Peigan and Onion Lake Reserves are pressing, and our own officers find that there is no situation which so urgently requires to be improved. I beg to remind you that the erection of the St. Philip's school was set aside in favour of the new establishment of the McIntosh school. In view of this fact and of the large expenditure within your province during the last few years in the purchase of residential schools, it was thought that the erection of St. Philip's school could be again postponed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J.B. Boys, O.M.I.,\n340 Provencher Avenue,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nKAMSACK, SASK. June 17th 1926\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been reported to me several times of late that it is the intention of the Government to build a rather expensive Indian Boarding School on the Kesekoose Reserve five miles north of the present Cote Improved Day School on the Cote Reserve. In connection with this I would like very respectfully to call your attention to the following considerations which may not have come under your notice:\n\n1. There was a boarding school at or near the same location several years ago, which was closed owing largely to a lack of sympathetic support from the Indians. Later a day school was started in the same buildings.\n\n2. There are only about ten Roman Catholic families on this Reserve and in order to get any considerable number of pupils from the neighboring reserves an effort may be made to recruit from Protestant families. This would naturally lead to friction and difficulties for Departmental officials.\n\n3. If, as is stated it is the intention to draw a large number of pupils from other Reserves a hundred or more miles away, would it not be better to build the school nearer those Reserves from which most of the recruits would naturally come?\n\n4. The Cote Day School has been serving the educational needs of the great majority of the Cote Indians for the past ten years, but as you may readily suppose there are some who would like to be set free from the responsibility of caring for their children and these have been talking of petitioning the Government to replace the present Cote Day School with a boarding school. I do not think such action is necessary at the present time but the grounds for the request are as good as in the case of the proposed school on the Kesekoose Reserve. But if that School is erected then the situation is changed and it may become very desirable from our point of view.\n\nYou will see therefore the complications that this proposed building would lead to and quite unnecessarily. The needs of the Kesekoose people could very well be served at a fraction of the expense by the erection of a day school in a central position. Such a school could be so located that only one family would have more than two miles to come to school.\n\nIn conclusion, let me say, that I write you in confidence that this matter will receive your careful consideration and that you will try to do what is best for all concerned.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is true that the advisability of providing a small institution at this point has engaged the Department's attention. There is no likelihood of any building activity in this connection this year.

McWhinney,\nKamsack,\nSask.\nOttawa, June 18th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. McPhee,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th June with reference to the proposal to erect an Indian boarding school on the Keeseekoose reserve, north of Kamsack. It was necessary to present to Parliament a moderate estimate for building operations during 1926-1927 and it was found impossible to provide for this building.\n\nThe Department is endeavouring to substitute modern buildings for those which were erected years ago by the missionary societies and to establish new schools where they are found to be necessary. Certain reserves have a prior claim to the Keeseekoose reserve at Kamsack but it is hoped that the building there may be supplied before long.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge W.

If the Department would consider this proposition, my advice would be that the matter of building a new Roman Catholic School on the Keesekoose reserve be deferred. I do not see that the R.C. Church authorities would object very much to this being done. They could transfer their appropriation to the building of a school at some other point for this year.

D. McLEAN,\n\nCHG DEPT. I.K.\nOttawa, May 21, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the St. Philips Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. Brouillet, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Philips, Sask.\nSir\n\nIn answer to your honored of May 21 No 117-3-I I beg to say that so far the older girls of this school have been trained in the butter making but as yet have not milked the cows for lack of a proper local we have so far had to use an old stable of a neighbor but when we have a stable at this school the girls will be doing the milking except in the too severe winter months.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. Brouillet O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nKamsack, August 15th, 1929\n\nMr. W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letter of August 3rd. to hand and note what you say in regard to increased accommodation at the Cote School.\n\nI would like again to repeat what I said before that I have no wish whatever to build up a boarding school at this point. No one would be better pleased than myself to find that there was no necessity for such a step, because I am fully aware of other problems which would be raised thereby. But as I said before the conditions which have given rise to this request have been brought about by the Indian Department erecting the St. Phillips School in such close proximity to the Cote School and where there was no real necessity for such action. I am told that we can send our pupils who cannot attend the Day School to File Hills or Brandon. Why did not the Department tell the Keesecoose R.C. people to send their children to Lebret or some other R.C. boarding school? They have less pupils who cannot attend a day school than we have. If this had been done two years ago, many thousands of Government money would have been saved and the present problem which is troubling us would not have arisen.\n\nYou assure me that our Protestant children cannot enter the St. Phillips School because the Department would not allow it. I know this is an old principle but you must know that it exists more in theory than in practice. A year ago two Protestant girls were taken into the St. Phillips School. I protested against it. The parents insisted on keeping them there where they could see them at any time. I brought the matter to the attention of Mr. Russell Ferrier when he was here a year ago and he stated that where the parents insisted on such an action and continued to insist the Department did not insist on the regulation being carried out. Therefore you will see very clearly that I have good grounds for feeling that the present conditions are bound to work out in such a way as will be unfair to us and will give an undue advantage to the R.C. people. Let the Indian Department give me a sufficient guarantee that none of our pupils will be allowed to go into the St. Phillips School and I shall be satisfied. Otherwise I shall carry this matter to such authorities in our Church as will compel justice to be done. Surely this is only what is fair.\n\nThere are a number of children on this Reserve now who should go to school but are not going anywhere. I shall be pleased to hear from you further in regard to this matter.\n\n(Sgd.) W. McWhinney.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter that I received from Rev. W. McWhinney, of Kamsack, in which he takes serious objection to the Department's action in building a Boarding School on the Keeseekeonse Reserve in the Pelly Agency; and more particularly to the attitude of the Department in not enforcing the regulation re children of Protestant parents being taken into the R.C. School. I think it is just as well that this matter should be brought to the attention of the Department, and I should be glad to be advised if it is proposed that any action shall be taken. I am informing Mr. McWhinney that I have taken the matter up with Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 310-11A Gen. of the 19th ultimo, enclosing copy of a letter from Rev. W. McWhinney, of Kamsack. I do not believe there is anything to be gained by answering this missionary's objection to the establishment of the St. Philips Indian Residential School. You may inform him, however, that the Department will not approve of the admission of Protestant children to this institution. Where parents insist on an education under Roman Catholic auspices and continue to do so and the Department is convinced of the bona fide of their wishes, their children may quite properly be considered Roman Catholics. The Department of Justice has so ruled.\n\nMr. McWhinney refers to the daughters of Joe Keshane. The information from the Indian agent was that Joe Keshane was pagan, although his wife was Protestant. After considerable correspondence and a delay of some months, to make sure that the father's wishes were bona fide, the children were admitted to the St. Philips School. You may forward the information concerning the Keshane children to Mr. McWhinney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKamsack, Sept. 13th 1929.\n\nMr. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th stating that the Department has stated it will not approve of the admission of Protestant children to the St. Philips School. I have delayed replying because Mr. Rhodes had promised at my request to come over and see what children he could get to go to File Hills. He came last week and I spent a day with him taking him to those I thought might and should go to File Hills. I gave him every assistance but as far as I am now aware his visit did not get him any pupils. I was not with him the last forenoon and do not know what assurances he may have received but fear they did not amount to much. This corroborates what I have said previously that these people do not want to send their children away to a distant school. When they cannot find accommodation for them at Cote there is always the temptation to put them into St. Philips.\n\nSince writing you last I have discovered that a child of Bob Cote's who has been cared for by her grandmother, Mrs. Jimmie Cote has been admitted to St. Philips. Her mother was protestant but is now dead. Her father is nominally a protestant and the grandmother is a member of our Church. The reason the grandmother placed her in that school was because she was unable to provide for her at home. This is a clear case of a violation of the Department's regulation and I demand that she be taken out from St. Philips at once. I am told that she and her younger sister were both baptized before she was admitted but this was done merely to give the admission an appearance of legality.\n\nOur difficulties of this nature as well as the difficulty of getting pupils to go to File Hills would be much lessened if the Department could put some restraint on the recruiting activities of Father Brouillete and keep him from enticing these protestant children to his School.\n\nSince commencing this letter I have discovered that Allan Fiddler signed an application while Mr. Rhodes was here for one of his children to go to File Hills School.\n\nI Remain,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n(Sgd) W. McWhinney\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which I have received from the Rev. W. McWhinney, Missionary on the Cote Indian Reserve. In your letter of the 5th instant, No. 117-3-1, you informed me that the Department would not approve of the admission of Protestant children to the Roman Catholic School.\n\nI am merely passing this letter on for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOctober 3rd, 1929.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nWith reference to Indian Commissioner Graham's letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing copy of letter received by him from Rev. W. McWhinney, it will be noted that the letter protests against the admission of Charlotte Cote to the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nOn File 117-3-10, there is an application for the admission of this girl to the St. Philips School, enclosed under cover of Agent McKenzie's letter of August 24th, 1929. The application form states that the father is living, the mother dead, and that the religion of the child is Roman Catholic. The application was signed by the father, Robert James Cote, and the admission was approved by Mr. Agent McKenzie.\nThe work in the senior classroom is supervised by Sister St. Veronica. This Sister has only been in charge since the fall term opened, but I understand she is a qualified teacher and I would judge that she will obtain good results. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade I - 4  \n\" II - 11  \n\" III - 4  \n\" V - 5\n\nThe children appeared to be well along in their grades and, when questioned, answered freely.\n\nThe classroom was neat and tidy, as also were the children.\n\nThe junior classroom is in charge of Miss Samson and there are 25 children, all in the primary department. A number of these children have only been in the school a few months, but are showing marked progress, and I would judge that Miss Samson will prove a successful teacher.\n\nThe work in the sewing room, laundry and kitchen is supervised by the various Sisters, and the children undoubtedly are given the best of instruction.\n\nThe building throughout was spotlessly clean, and the dormitories were all well aired. The battleship linoleum, which covers the tables in the children's dining room, curls up badly around the edge of the table. It is difficult to keep it from being broken.\nbroken. This could be remedied by using binding which can be purchased for this purpose.\n\nThe following buildings have been erected during the summer:\n\n- A large barn where cattle & horses can be housed.\n- Implement Shed\n- Granary\n- Chicken House\n- Pig Pen\n\nAs everything is new at the school, the general upkeep should be very light for some years.\n\nThe Department supplied a number of Ayrshire cattle here last year, so that the school now has plenty of milk for its needs.\n\nOn account of the extreme dry weather, it was impossible to get a lawn started this year in front of the school, but the Rev. Father Brouillet intends to have this work carried out next year. At present in front of the school the fence is built of three strands of barbed wire. The appearance would be greatly improved if the school could be provided with a woven fence along the front and at each side in order to protect the ground where it is the intention to have the lawns. Cedar posts should also be provided for the erection of this fence.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Oct. 5th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection made at the three schools in the Pelly Agency.\n\nThe Inspector speaks highly of the condition in which he found the St Phillips School, and the manner in which the children are taught. This is entirely due to the efforts of the teachers.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMay 3rd, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nWill you please cube up the dormitories and classrooms at the St. Philip's Indian Residential School, and advise as to the number of pupils for which there is air space (500 cubic feet per pupil). While this school was erected for 50 pupils, the Church authorities claim that there is sufficient air space in the dormitories to accommodate a larger number.\n\nMEMO:\n\nAt 500 cubic feet per pupil the dormitories provide accommodation for 51, but I see no objection if the principal was allowed to accommodate 60 pupils in the building.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, May 5, 1930.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to our conversation regarding the accommodation at the St. Philips Indian Residential School, I wish to inform you that there is room for a maximum of 60 pupils. At a later date, when funds can be provided for the purpose, a pupilage of this number could be allowed. For the present fiscal year, of course, the pupilage has been fixed at 50.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnan, O. M.

Christmas Tree concerts were attended, at Cote day school, Key day school, St Philips boarding school, and Keesekoose Homemakers club also held a tree in the old school at St Philips for all the Keesekoose children that are not attending school. These affairs were all a success and much enjoyed by old and young.

The crop harvested last Fall was only fair.\n\nCattle\n\nThe number of cattle kept at the School is 20 and 9 of these animals are cows. The Principal informed me that naturally the 9 cows did not furnish sufficient milk for the School as there are times during the year when some of these cows are dry and to keep more cows at the School it would be necessary to build an addition on the barn, which is a good building but not long enough to take care of more cattle than are being housed at the present time. However, I notice that the School has built a stable out of logs and they house some of the younger stock there. They have 7 horses, 2 of which are old, and they also keep pigs and chickens.\n\nHealth\n\nThere are 76 children in residence at the School and this is two more than the grant of 74. I spoke to these children in their classrooms and playrooms and they all looked well and happy.

Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING JUNE 30th, 1945, ON PELLY INDIAN AGENCY\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nWe only have one Residential school situated in this agency, but they have been fortunate in being able to keep a capable staff of teachers all during the war, and children attending are much further advanced than those attending the day schools, and are also obtaining other useful instruction, in house work, cooking, sewing, carpenter work, painting, and care of stock, and are certainly much better fitted for a useful life upon leaving school. About the only complaint from the Indians that you hear about this school is that too much time is devoted to religious training. It would be a great help to many of the girls if they were allowed to continue their studies until they were at least 17 years of age, they would thus avoid some of the pitfalls that face them as they leave school at sixteen. Unfortunately in many cases they get little help or encouragement to conduct themselves properly, and parents appear to have very little control over them, and in many cases the example of the parents leaves a great deal to be desired.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe war is over but our difficulties are not. To-day I thought of presenting you one of my difficulties and not the least.\n\nI am paid here for 70 children. This year for some reason, family allowance, or other, we have a much greater number of children in school. In fact we have now 82 children. And if had had more room we would have still more.\n\nSo you can see by yourself that this is a great burden on me and my finances. I talked the thing over with Mr. J. Bryant, and He told me that He would write to the Department on this matter.\n\nI am requesting that the Department pay me for the number of children in school. I think this is just fair and just. On account of the present conditions of living it is extremely difficult to make both ends meet.\n\nHoping that the Department will be favourable to my request,\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 24th September, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant requesting an increase in pupilage of the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the last report we received, your school gave the size of dormitories as follows:\n\nBoys - 36 x 31\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 10 = 32 beds\nGirls - 39 x 31\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 10 = 37 beds\nSmall - 22 x 12 x 10 = 7 beds\n\nThe cubic capacity of the dormitories as computed from the above figures is 29,410 cu. ft. and the total number of beds available is 76.\n\nConsidering the cubic content, I may say that it is our desire that practically all residential schools have a cubic capacity in the dormitories of 500 cu. ft. for each child. When we allowed an enrolment of 70 at St. Philips School it was really larger than the cubic content of the dormitories warranted. Consequently I do not feel it is advisable for you to take another 12 children as this will still further reduce the amount of air space for each pupil.\n\nWith the above in mind, it is difficult for us to consider increasing the pupilage.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. Tetrault, O.M.I., Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Philips, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th, answering my request to be paid for the number of children now in our school.\n\nYour answer was to me quite disappointing.\n\nIn my last letter I said we had 82 children, the exact number is 81.\n\nI saw Mr. J. Bryant this morning about this question, and his answer was that the children were not in school, and that he saw no other alternative than they remain in school. They are in here by the will of the parents who do not want to see their children going to a far-away school. And the fact is that all other schools have also more children than they should, so they can not take the ones we have to many.\n\nAnd as said Mr. Bryant, we are not to put these children in the road, they again school to stay, we have made room for them. We have exchange some large beds for smaller ones. A six foot bed is too large for a child of 7 or 8 or 9 years of age. So with smaller beds, we were able to put more in the same room.\n\nIn your letter you give an number of beds 75. We have now 81, that means only five more. As for the air space we can provide good air by more ventilation.\n\nAs Mr. Bryant was saying this morning, you have gone out of your way to accommodate these children it is but fair and just that you be paid for their upkeep.\n\nThese children have just as much right to school as any other child. And if we have to send them back home, it would be fair to them.\n\nIf our school is too small, this is not our fault. Here is the whole trouble. This school is too small all together. We had to refuse many children this year, so many children are without schooling, although it was promised to the Indians that schools would be given them and the facilities to acquire an education.\n\nYou have handled school affairs long enough to know how hard it is for a small school, to make both ends meet. I have here as many employees as in any other schools. It cost me just as much for fuel, light, water etc., as in most schools. And because these schools are paid for 100 to 120 they will receive nearly up to $1,000 every three months, whilst I receive $150.00. And these schools complain that it is hard for them to make both ends meet, what about us then?\n\nSo I sincerely hope that you will reconsider this question and that soon you may let me know that I will be paid for children present in school. I am not asking for a favour, but that justice be given to this school as to other schools.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 2)\nOttawa, October 9, 1945.\n\nDear Father Tetrault:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with further reference to your request for an increase in pupilage at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Director, Mr. Hoey, has been absent from the office through illness, but we expect him back before the end of the month. As soon as he returns I will bring to his attention your recent communications.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. Tetrault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Philips, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have sometime ago written to Mr. Hoey about our financial situation here in regard to the number of children in school, and the number for which I am paid. As you know I am paid for 70 and we have now 81 in school. This is a great burden to our school, and it is quite impossible to carry on that way.\n\nNow I offer a suggestion to the members of the Department. So far you are opposed in increasing our grant. My suggestion is this. Ask the members of the Department to adopt eleven orphans for six months or a year, and you will find out what a burden it is to feed and clothe them.\n\nTo prove my statement here is the balance of my books for each month since January 1945:\n\nJanuary ..... Deficit .... $241.11\nFebruary ..... 643.23\nMarch ..... 1242.75\nApril ..... 990.06\nMay ..... 206.40\nJune ..... 354.41\nJuly ..... 957.97\nAugust ..... Balance 210.89\nSeptember ..... Deficit 2676.93\nOctober ..... 2671.17\nNovember ..... 599.73\n\nOn top of this deficit for this month I have for $859.21 to pay for goods bought for the school in food, clothing etc., and in wages not paid. So it means that our cheque is always spent before it reaches us.\n\nI have shown my books to our Agent Mr. Bryant. In a small school as ours, the overheads are as great as that of larger schools, and our grant is from two to three thousands dollars less every three months. So it makes it impossible to make both ends meet. Moreover we had to turn down this year many children from lack of room.\n\nHoping that you will do something for us in the near future,\n\nI remain Sincerely Yours,\n\nRev. P. L. Petreault\nMr. Chelan\n\nAllowed - 70\n\nAverage Sep/45 - 78.19\nJun/45 - 76.19\nMar/45 - 73.14\nDec/44 - 70.65\nOttawa, December 7, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEX,\n\nIn addition to the requests for increased pupilage, which I brought to your attention in a memorandum this morning, the following request has reached the office this afternoon:\n\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School -\nPelly Indian Agency, Sask.\n\nThis school has an authorized pupilage of 70, but their average attendance for the past four quarters has always been over that number and for one quarter it was 78; in other words, the school management has been providing education and maintenance for several more children than the number for which grant is allowed.\n\nThe Principal points out that it is absolutely essential that the pupilage should be increased and requests that we allow grant for an additional 10 pupils, or 80 pupils in all.\n\nIf this increase is granted, the extra expenditure for the fiscal year 1945-46 would be as follows:\n\n10 pupils at $165 per capita - $1,650.00\n\nSpecial grant of $15.00 for 10 pupils ............... - 150.00\n\nTotal - $1,800.00\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nJanuary 5th, 1946.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31st 1945.\n\nEducation\n\nIndian education is a subject that has, I am sure given our department and all who are really interested in the Indians, very serious thought, the problems are many and it would appear that there is still room for some improvement in our present set up. Very few of the day schools have qualified teachers and I think these should be employed by the department and not by any church organization if we are going to get suitable men and women for this very important work. A day school teacher could be employed for the full 12 months, and they should devote considerable in organizing sports and healthy recreation for the young people.\n\nWe have one Residential school and two day schools at this agency, but have several pupils from all reserves attending residential schools at other points in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In a residential school good management and an efficient teaching staff are a prime necessity and in St Philips school here, we fortunately have a good teaching staff and a school that is exceptionally well managed. Apart from academic subjects the pupils are taught cooking, sewing, general housework, manual training, field work, care of livestock, and poultry etc. This school is filled to capacity at present and there are several pupils at home at present that should be in school if accommodation was available. There should be provision made for at least another 40 pupils and this may not be sufficient in another ten years. We would also like to see pupils that are anxious to make something of themselves, given the opportunity of staying on in school after they are 15 years old, in fact I think it would be a great help to many of the girls if they were kept in Boarding school at least another year longer.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nI beg to submit herewith a report on the affairs of this Agency, for the quarter ending June 30th, 1946.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nMiss Robertson of Cot Bay school has returned to her home and I understand will not return. She is a very fine woman and certainly did not spare herself trying to manage a very heavy school. However she has been in poor health and latterly the children became very difficult for her to handle, infact they were almost out of hand entirely. In the appointment of a successor I think we should insist on a male teacher, as I do not think there would be a bit of use sending another woman teacher for this difficult school. There is also to be a change at Key Day school, and here again I hope we can have someone appointed that really knows something about teaching and the handling of Indian children. Nothing definite has been done about starting day school at Valley River. We may have to use some of the new catholic church for this purpose until we can build a school at a rental of $40.00 per month, but here again I would not recommend starting a day school there unless we can be assured that a male teacher that has some experience can be supplied for that point.\n\nSt Philips Residential school has built an addition to the present school and will be able to accommodate more pupils this coming term. This school is well managed, children are happy and on the whole parents are satisfied with the results.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, August 6th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThe Department has been informed that a new addition has been erected on the St. Philip's Indian Residential School of the Pelly Agency, the basement allowing for a large play room, the first floor a chapel, and the second floor additional dormitory space.\n\nNow that there is ample dormitory space, allowing 500 cu. ft. per child, I would recommend that the pupilage allowed at the St. Philip's School be increased to 84 for the new term.\n\nThe total dormitory space is 41,830 cu. ft. made up as follows:\n\n- Girls' Dormitory - 11,520 cu. ft.\n- Girls' Dormitory - 13,800 cu. ft.\n- Boys' Dormitory - 12,480 cu. ft.\n- Boys' Dormitory - 4,030 cu. ft.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, August 19, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR.\n\nIncreased Pupilage for St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nAn addition has been built to this school and we have had repeated requests to increase the pupilage from the Reverend Principal, the Indian Agent, and now from Inspector Ostrander.\n\nI believe Mr. Phelan has previously discussed this request with you. The present pupilage is seventy but the average attendance has always been well in excess of this number. If this increase is granted the extra expenditure for the fiscal year 1946-47 would be as follows:\n\n10 pupils at $165. per capita - $1,650.00\n\nSpecial grant of $15.00 for 10 pupils ............... - 150.00\n\nTotal - $1,800.00\n\nThe present dormitory space is 41,830 cubic feet, sufficient to accommodate eighty-three children.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 21, 1946.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE ACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith a memorandum received by me from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nI may state by way of explanation that requests for an additional enrolment of pupils at the St. Phillips school have been considered and reviewed by the Welfare and Training Division on a number of occasions in recent years. The request is now supported by Indian Agent Bryant and by Inspector Ostrander. Inspector Ostrander in a letter dated August 5, 1946, states:\n\n\"Now that there is ample dormitory space, allowing 500 cu. ft. per child, I would recommend that the pupilage allowed at the St. Philip's School be increased to 84 for the new term.\"\n\nThe actual enrolment according to the last return received from the Principal is 82, although per capita grants have been allowed for only 70. The Indian population of the Pelly Agency classified as Roman Catholics in the last census return is 553. This figure would indicate that there must be at least 110 children of school age in the area served by the St. Philips School. While I hesitate to make a recommendation for an increased pupilage at a residential school, in view of the fact that our educational policy is now under review by the Joint Parliamentary Committee, nevertheless I feel that the requests for an enrolment of ten additional pupils should be granted in this case.\n\nDirector\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- THE ACTING DEPUTY MINISTER -\n\nI am sending forward herewith a memorandum received by me from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nI may state by way of explanation that requests for an additional enrolment of pupils at the St. Phillips school have been considered and reviewed by the Welfare and Training Division on a number of occasions in recent years.

Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nRe: Increased Pupilage for St. Philips Indian Residential School.\nYour File 117-3-1 (D.I.A.)\n\nI discussed with the Minister your memorandum of the 21st instant in reference to the above. In view of the fact that the Indian educational policy is now being considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee, the Minister thought this was not the time to increase the pupilage of the Indian Residential Schools. If the increase were allowed and it became necessary to establish a day school to provide the education to the children in the vicinity of the school, it might cause a hardship to the school authorities if the pupilage were reduced. The report of the Superintendent is returned herewith.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, August 19, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nIncreased Pupilage for St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nAn addition has been built to this school and we have had repeated requests to increase the pupilage from the Reverend Principal, the Indian Agent, and now from Inspector Ostrander.\n\nI believe Mr. Phelan has previously discussed this request with you.

Nedry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Pupilage increase for St. Philips School.\nAttention: Mr. F. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYou are acquainted with the fact that, in order to take care of the increased demand for admission to the above school, the Oblate Fathers, during the present summer, have added a wing measuring 30' in width by 60' in length, basement and two stories.\n\nWith this addition, the school can accommodate between 15 and 20 additional pupils and I have been requested by the Provincial of the Oblate Fathers, St. Boniface, Manitoba, to ask that the school be allowed to receive this additional number of pupils, as of September 1st this year.\n\nIn a former letter, I called your attention to the very large increase in the school population of this district and stated that rather than see such large number of children grow up in ignorance, the Oblate Fathers had decided to use missionary bequests to meet this expenditure.\n\nI hope, therefore, that the Department will grant Father Lavigne's demand.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOTTAWA, 12 September 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant applying for an increase in the pupilage at the St. Philips Residential School.\n\nA similar request was recently received from Mr. J.P.B. Ostreander, Inspector of Indian Agencies. When the latter letter reached this branch it was submitted to the Minister's office for approval. We were advised in reply that it was not considered timely to increase the pupilage at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Jackson,-\n\nI recently wrote to Mr. R. A. Hoey, of the Indian Affairs Branch, asking that an increase in the pupilage of the St-Philips Indian Residential School be granted, as of September 1st this year.\n\nTo my great surprise my request has been refused. As there must be some misunderstanding regarding the nature of my demand, I take the liberty of writing you about it.\n\nYou know that St. Philips has a long waiting list and that it has also provided additional space for the admittance of at least 20 pupils above its former attendance. This additional space has cost the Church authorities a considerable amount of money and it would be unfortunate if it were not used immediately. I therefore hope that you will be good enough to reconsider our request and allow the admittance of 20 additional pupils, as of September 1st, 1946.\n\nThanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 27, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 18th, in which you renew your request for an increased pupilage at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nI have been informed by the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch that somewhat similar requests have been received by them from the Cariboo, Kamloops, Lejac, Sechelt and Squamish Residential Schools, amounting, if granted, to an additional enrolment at these schools of one hundred and seven pupils.\n\nThe Minister, to whom this request was submitted, naturally hesitated to grant it at this particular time for a number of reasons. The educational policy of the Indian Affairs Branch is, as you know, under review by a Special Parliamentary Committee, the members of which will no doubt make definite recommendations with respect to the educational needs of the Indian population in due course. In addition to this, it is our intention to have a number of educational surveys undertaken by a capable educationist at the earliest possible date. These surveys will be designed to determine the educational needs of Indians over a long period of years and to determine also how these needs can be most effectively met, particularly by the establishment of improved Indian day schools. It would not, in our judgment, be fair to the Churches to grant increased enrolments at this date, only to discover later that the operation of day schools was seriously reducing the number of pupils seeking residential school accommodation. This is a matter on which the Churches cooperating with the Government in the operation of schools will no doubt desire to make certain recommendations; in the meantime and until such recommendations are made, we feel that it would be in the interests of all parties concerned to continue the operation of our schools with the enrolments already authorized.\n\nReverend J.

We feel that this is a flexible manner of handling the request for more pupilage as it permits us to discontinue the supernumerary allowance at any time if day schools are established in the vicinity of any of these residential schools. The school management will also understand that it is only a temporary arrangement.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- The Acting Deputy Minister -\n\nI am returning herewith a letter dated October 10, 1946, received by you from the Reverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nI have again discussed the subject matter of this letter with the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, who, in response to my request, prepared a memorandum which I am submitting for your consideration. It is our intention, as you know, to undertake a number of educational surveys in the prairie provinces and in northern British Columbia, with the object of discovering what type of school would be most suitable to meet the educational needs of the Indian population in each district. It is not at all likely, however, that we will be in a position to undertake this work at any time in the immediate future. The official we have in mind for this task will require to become thoroughly acquainted with our educational policy before undertaking field work. In the meantime and particularly in view of the provisions in the Family Allowance Act which compel children of school age to attend school before qualifying for allowances, the Superintendent of Welfare and Training and I are disposed to think that supernumerary grants might be authorized for Cariboo, Lejac, Sechelt, Squamish and Kamloops Indian Residential Schools, and that an increased pupilage of ten be allowed at St. Phillips. As a matter of fact, supernumerary grants will still fall short of the payment we should make if we recognize this year's actual enrolment at these institutions.\n\nI am asking Colonel Neary to go into this matter with you more fully at your convenience.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6334, file 662-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. C. W. Jackson,\nSecretary and\nChief Executive Assistant,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Jackson,\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of September 27th last written in answer to my request for an increase of pupilage at the St. Philips Indian Residential School. You also mention in your letter, a request of a similar nature which I made for the British Columbia Catholic Residential School.\n\nI am very much surprised at the stand taken by yourself and your Minister in this very serious matter. All the schools for which an increase has been asked are situated in districts where a large proportion of the Indians are growing up in ignorance. Our Church is acquainted with this fact and is doing everything possible to supply education to as large a number of children as it is humanly possible to do so; but the cooperation of your Department is essential to enable them to continue this policy.\n\nWe know that it is the intention of your Department to have educational surveys made throughout the Dominion. We approve of these surveys, but as Government Agencies move slowly, a whole generation of Indian children is likely to grow up in ignorance, waiting for their results. This is most unfortunate and should not exist. You know, for instance, that Bishop Cou\u00ebt has been asking for a much needed residential school in his Vicariate and that your Department has been delaying the execution of this project with the statement that an educational survey would be made. Nothing has yet been done and in the meantime, the Bishop has had to send over forty Catholic children to schools, a thousand miles away.\n\nFurthermore, we are not asking for these increases as a permanent policy of the Department. We are willing to take these children presently in our residential schools, on the understanding that if later on, any survey made by your Department should find it necessary to reduce the pupilage of these schools on account of the establishment of day schools in the same territory, we will gladly return to our former pupilage. What is uppermost in our mind at the present moment is that these Indian children are growing up in ignorance and something should be done, not in three or four or five years, but immediately, to relieve the situation.\n\np.t.o.\nI therefore hope that you will give the various requests which I have already made, as well as those which I am asked to present to you in this regard, more favourable consideration.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.) J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n- Mr. Hoey -\n\nI discussed with the Minister your memorandum of the 9th instant in reference to the request that has been made for an increase in the pupilage of the St. Phillips Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reconsidering the matter, the Minister thought the Department might be justified in granting a temporary increase to this school, and if necessary at the other schools mentioned in Colonel Neary's memorandum of the 6th instant, the increase to continue until the Department is in a position to provide the required day school accommodation at the various places mentioned. Approval is, therefore, given to this action being taken. It is to be understood that careful inquiry will be made into the requested increases in each case to make sure that the number is not excessive. The various church organizations concerned should be very clearly and definitely informed that the grant is only a temporary one and that when day school accommodation is provided, the pupilage will be reduced.\n\nI am returning Father Plourde's letter of the 10th instant to which you might draft a reply for my signature.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, November 20, 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nYour letter of October 10 has received very careful consideration.\n\nIn reconsidering this matter the Minister has decided that the Department can grant a temporary increase in the pupilage of the St. Philips Indian Residential School. Therefore as of November 1, 1946, the pupilage at this school will be increased from 80 to 90.\n\nAs a temporary measure the Department is also prepared to authorize the following supernumerary grants as of October 1, 1946:\n\n- Caribou Residential School - 123 plus 12 supernumerary.\n- Lejac Residential School - 160 plus 15 supernumerary.\n- Sechelt Residential School - 80 plus 10 supernumerary.\n- Squamish Residential School - 60 plus 5 supernumerary.\n- Kamloops Residential School - 285 plus 10 supernumerary.\n\nIt is felt that these increases are as large as these schools can accommodate with present dormitory facilities.\n\nThe Minister wishes it very clearly and definitely understood that this grant is only a temporary one and that when day school accommodation is provided, the pupilage will be reduced. Therefore I would request that in writing to the Principals of the Schools concerned, you emphasize this point to them and inform them that this is purely a temporary increase to accommodate Indian children for whom at present adequate educational facilities are not provided.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend J.O.

Ruest, O.M.I., who has been acting for the last two years as Assistant Principal of the Pine Creek Indian Residential School, to become Principal of the St. Philippe School, Saskatchewan.\nIn reference to the above, please be advised that in p.m. of this date Father HUST of the St. Phillips Indian School, called at this office and stated that the optionally noted was missing from the school and believed to have run away. He stated that they had missed her at about 10:30 a.m. same date as above. She was only 12 years of age and at the time of her disappearance, was dressed only in a night house dress. Father HUST was of the opinion that she may be trying to go back to LeBreton, Sask., where she used to go to school or back to her home at Carlisle. He stated that he would like police assistance and if located to make arrangements for her transportation back to the Indian School.\n\nA check was made around town by Sgt. Forbes and the writer as to the possibility of the girl having come to Kamsack. This failed to produce results, so a patrol was made to the outskirts of town on Highway towards St. Phillips. In a short while an Indian girl was sighted in the ditch walking towards Kamsack. When questioned, she stated that she was Norma WHITEHORSE from the St. Phillips School and was running away because she did not like the place.\n\nA patrol was made by Sgt. Forbes and the writer to the St. Phillips Indian School, where the girl was handed over to Father JANGOTE. Patrol returned to detachment at 6:00 p.m. same date.
