Devlin, Superintendent, Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nShawanaga Indian Day School.\n\nWe have now received Inspector Cassie's report of June 25 upon the above Indian Day School. He seems quite pleased with the work of the school on the whole and makes the following general comment:\n\n\"I wish to compliment the authorities for the improvements which have been made since my previous visit. Those noted were:\n\nNew trap-door on well.\nPainting the interior of the school in approved colours.\nAddition of more suitable reading material.\nAddition of equipment and material for duplicating seat work exercises.\nRemoval of teacher's platform.\n\nSuggested Improvements:\n\n1. Removal of two sections of very shiny blackboard and erection of three sections of good slate board in their place. (This was suggested a year ago).\n\n2. Addition of hardwood flooring where teacher's platform formerly was.\n\n3. Immediate attention to toilet conditions. The boys' toilet is positively disgraceful. I am advised that most of the trouble is caused by community use of these facilities when dances are held nearby. In\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6163, file 428-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn connection I recommend the installation of modified water toilets (not chemical) in a small anteroom which could be added to the south side of the school building.\n\n\"Mr. Morris continues to do very good work. The pupils' work is more nearly up to standard than a year ago. The improvement was most marked in oral reading but also quite noticeable in the written work. This continuity in Mr. Morris' tenure as teacher is having beneficial results.\"\n\nWith regard to his suggested improvements, would you please submit a requisition (if you have not already done so) for the blackboard required. It is now possible to get Nyleplaste board and we are endeavouring to replace all old blackboards with new ones.\n\nIn connection with the toilet conditions, would it be possible to put locks on the doors so that community use of these toilets can be stopped. We are making every effort to impress upon teachers and pupils of our schools that the cleanliness of school property and toilets is of great importance and that every effort must be made to avoid criticism such as has been made by Mr. Cassie.\n\nBernard F.

Hardwood flooring requires to be laid where the teacher's platform was taken out last year and the porch on the building needs considerable repair.\n\nAt the Lower French School the woodshed has collapsed and will require to be rebuild entirely. There is also some work to be done on the foundation of the school proper.\n\nAt the Ryerson School on Parry Island the kitchen drain has blocked up on various occasions with the result that the cellar has been flooded for lengthy periods. I believe that the drain will have to be dug up throughout its whole length and replaced.\n\nIf these expenditures are possible, I would be obliged if you would give me an accountable advance of $350.00 to pay for labour.

I wish to inquire though, whether or not the Department will supply me with the following articles for my house as they are absolutely necessary and I must have them at my own expense if they will not furnish them. I would like 5 chairs, one of them to be for the school house as there is none there, 4 window blinds, 1 padlock and staple for the door and stove pipe elbow. There are only 3 chairs in the house and they positively will not stand at one much longer in spite of my carpentering, the window blinds are in tatters, there is a hole as big as my fist in the stove pipe elbow, rusted through, and about the lock I really need it as I cannot fasten the door on the outside and if I go away Saturday & Sunday, I find my wood, coil oil & heating when I return.

She informed me that the roof leaked in several places and the lean-to or kitchen had been practically demolished by the Indians and was absolutely useless. I requested her, as soon as she returned to the school, to have one of the head men of the Band make an estimate of what material would be required to repair the roof and rebuild the kitchen. I am to-day in receipt of a letter from her giving me this estimate as follows:\n\n5000 sq. ft. Shingles at $1.25 per sq. ft. $11.75\n10 lbs.

Jacobs came and asked me to write it and tried to tell me what he wanted me to say but I really cannot make out what he is saying. Since then his son has come back so through him I have found out what he meant. He was to get a team to draw the lumber for the woodshed for five dollars but couldn't get it done for less than four dollars so that is to be paid to the chief. Mr. John Mesheky did the work at the shed but he bought goods from Mr. Carpenter to amount to eight dollars and he was to get the money when Mesheky got it from you. So that is what is owing to Mr. Carpenter.\n\nHoping I have made it clear to you.\n\nYours Truly,\nM. E. Tutt.\nIndian Affairs.

If the Department decide to put up a teacher house, the foundation could be done at the same time, so there is no hurry as long as it is done before the cold weather.

It is noted she states that the plaster has fallen in several places and that the interior needs mulescoing and the woodwork should be painted, also that repairs are required to the verandah and railing.\n\nBefore the Department can authorize the expenditure required in carrying out the repairs, I would request that you forward an estimate stating, in detail, the work that should be done to place this cottage in a good state of repair. Our funds are extremely limited and if any large expense would be involved we would be unable to provide the necessary funds.

The railing of the verandah needs to be fixed up.\n\nI understand they are doing some plastering at the church, and I have suggested to Mrs. English, the school teacher, that when they are doing that, she could get them to fix up her place in the meantime, as a neighbourly turn, and we could wait and have the repairs done after the estimates are in, in March.\n\nI have explained to Mrs. English that as teachers go she has not much complaint; as she is fairly comfortable, and she admits that this is so, but I would recommend that provision be made for repairs for this house in the estimates in March. This might amount to somewhere between $25.00 and $30.00, you can never just say how much it would cost, when patching plastering, but my intentions are whatever is absolutely necessary in the plastering line can be done now without any cost to the Department.\n\nShould the Department approve of these repairs being done during the coming summer holidays, I think the possibilities are that they\ncould be done much cheaper than at the present time.\n\nRe your letter of Oct. 10th, 22-5-4\n\nthe heater that Mrs. English has is burned out,\nand we must get her another one. The cost of these\nheaters is from $5.00 to $6.50, and I would recommend\nthat she get a heater. They are just sheet metal\nheaters. Would the Department please send me word\nat their earliest if I can get this sheet metal heater\nas the weather is getting very cold here at the present\ntime.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/BK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 29, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your T-5997 of the 26th instant, I beg to say that you may purchase a hunter for the teacher's residence at the Shuswap Indian Day School.

The houses are too far gone.\n\nBy November 1st we shall have 2 vacancies in this District, one at Pic River and the other at Pays Plat. One of the two I expect to fill shortly, as I have for sometime been in correspondence with a new teacher for the former place. The Candidate is a young lady.

In that letter you were informed that the Department concurred in the recommendation of Rev.

I should be glad to know, on behalf of Miss Clarke, whether there is any prospect of her being able to obtain board with a respectable Indian family, for the winter months at least.

Bandin asked me to inform you about the Bay's Bluff school house. The building is in fair state, but the teacher's residence wants to be repaired, the roof is not good and its windows in a pretty bad condition.\n\nBut I will let the teacher use my own room during the time of repairation of her own house if she desires to send a teacher.\n\nMiss Clarke could have her board with a respectable family, but I am very much afraid that she would be lonely at Bay's Bluff. For my part I would prefer to give that school to Miss Alice Park who already taught school there and in West Bay on the Manitobas Lake.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Bugaswith is of opinion that it would be useless to try and get a teacher unless the building were put into better shape. He suggests that the Department might spend the amount voted for salary in putting up a school building and after that a teacher might be secured. I think it very doubtful whether any competent white teacher would remain any length of time at Pays Plat and I would not recommend spending anything on the building at present. It would be better to make provision for the number of children on the reserve that could attend school either at Wikwemikong or the Fort William Orphanage than to go to the expense of putting up a new building and paying the teacher's salary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Now Mr. Paret must have noticed that there is no school house on the Reserve, the old building they had was destroyed during Mr. Neil McSorley's administration.

There are several reasons why this has not been done, one is the difficulty of securing a teacher to go there, another is that there is no suitable accommodation in the way of a school or teacher's residence and a third reason is the question of attendance. There are only 39 Indians in the band as shown by the census and 9 children of school age. Mr. Paget informs me that some of the younger children are now old enough to go to school, but the number would not exceed 10 or 12 at the most, and it is doubtful whether the attendance would justify the maintenance of a school there.

You should inform the Indians that there is a good school, with ample accommodation, at Fort William - the St. Joseph's Orphanage - to which they should have their children sent. The Department hopes that, if they desire to give their children an education, they will avail themselves of the privilege afforded of placing them in this school where they will be well provided for and receive a good education. You might also inform the Indians and the Chief of the Band that if they do not consent to send their children voluntarily, the Department has the authority, under the Indian Act, to have their children sent to a residential school.\n\nIt is hoped that these Indians will, themselves, see the benefit their children would receive and allow them to be placed in the Orphanage at Fort William. The Chief should advise the members of his Band accordingly.\n\nYou may forward a copy of this letter to the Chief.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW.

Seven panes of glass were found broken, one door and partition broken, and some of it had been used as kindling.\n\nA water pail had been lent them which was first used for boiling beans, and afterwards as a toilet which was left in the house. Old clothing left on the floor is covered with lice, and the twelve Indians who have resided inside have been using any place outside around the building as a place for garbage and toilet.\n\nI consider that it will cost approximately $25.00 to fix this Government building, known as the schoolhouse at Pays Plat Indian Reserve.\n\nA further complaint was made by Chief Louis Mushquash to the effect that on the arrival of the Indians from Robert and Heron Bay Indian Reserves to work on the Trans Canada Highway, he boarded 12 Indians from the 8th January to 26th January, keeping track of each individual meal. He made a charge of .50\u00a2 per meal, and adds up to a bill of $30.20. Up to the present time he has not received a cent from any one of these Indians, and they have now gone back to their Indian Reserves.\n\nBefore leaving the Pays Plat Indian Reserve, one of the Robert Indians Joe Bananash gave a note to Chief Louis Mushquash for $2.00, and another note to Henry Mushquash for $3.00 which they produced and showed to me, and up to the present time this money has not been paid back to them.\n\nSeveral of the Pays Plat Indians complained that although they had been laid off work from the Trans Canada Highway for nearly a month, that they had not received their last pay cheques from the Northern Development of Ontario, and that they did not owe a cent to anyone. The names of Indians with cheques due are as follows:-\n\nThomas Wesley - Approx. $35.00 Lawrence Mushquash - Approx. $1\nFred Auger - $40.00 Steve Auger - $2.6\nHenry Mushquash - $30.00\n\nOn visiting at the various Indian homes, I find that a few old people are destitute, especially Tom Waboose age 75 years, lives by himself, and has resorted to the practice of begging around Indian homes for his meals.\n\nSarah McKenzie - age 60 years, paralyzed in right arm, living by herself, makes a strong request for some wood to be furnished her as well as some rations and clothing. She is having trouble with her teeth, and cannot eat any meat.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has a wife who is also 67 years of age, and so have to rely on other people for a living. They make a request that some rations and clothing be sent to them.\n\nAll the other Indians, with exception of these old people are in a strong and healthy condition, and have no complaints.\n\nThe Officer Commanding\nR.C.M.P.

Two classes are starting at the school, and we in the little house where the teacher used to stay. I will lend her my room in the church, but that little house is repaired. Besides the windows, the roof wants to be repaired also. I was glad that Miss Clark will find the place to love. Some to stay I would prefer to see Miss Alice Barker take that school, she already taught there, and his willing to take the school again if the Department agrees to take her again. She always gave satisfaction at Bay Plat and West Bay where she was teaching last year. It seems to me that it would be preferable to give the Bay Plat school to Miss Barker because she knows the place, and also believe she would be able to board herself with her mother who would stay with her here. The Indians asked me to try to have Miss Barker.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6164, file 429-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI told them that I would be very glad to give her the school for many reasons, and especially because I am very much afraid that a stranger would be very troublesome here at Sage Flat. Of course if the Department prefers to send Miss Clark, I don't want to say anything against it. I will be very glad to have a teacher for this school because the children are forgetting all what they learned before, and the Indians are all willing to send them to school to give them a chance to learn something instead of losing their time idle in the bush.\n\nIf you can do something to have Miss Barker to teach that school I will be very glad, because I am very much afraid that Miss Clark would not stay there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

This school was only re-opened last January, having been closed fourteen years ago for want of a suitable building in which to hold school.

I was talking to Mr. Paget last summer here about that school house that I was think to buy that school house sometime. So Mr. Paget told me when he get down to Ottawa he will let me know how much it will be worth, so I never had no word yet. So I will like to hear from you this summer about that school house and this school house it long time since the school was close here, and this\nHouse is in bad shape now last summer that house it was all wet inside, roofing was leaking bad. And last fall I went to work, fix up the roofing; in good part.\n\nI remain yours Truly\n\nChief Louis Mushywash\nPays Plott Band\nOut\n\nIndian Department\nAttawa ant\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nand\nIndian Dept\nOttawa, July 8th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, stating that you desire to purchase the Pays Plat Indian day school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that enquiry will be made as to whether this building would again be required for school purposes. As soon as we have full information we will then be in a position to decide whether this building is for sale or not, and you will be advised of the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Louie Mushquash,\nPays Plat Reserve,\nRossport, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a request from Chief Louie Mushquash, of the Pays Plat Band, stating that he is desirous of purchasing the building formerly used for school purposes on that Reserve. This school has been closed for a number of years, and the Chief states that the building is falling into disrepair.\n\nPlease inform the Department as to whether you consider that this building would be of any further use for school purposes and whether you consider it would be necessary at a future date to re-open the school. If you would recommend that the building be sold, please state the sum which you consider would be a fair estimate of the value of the building. Your early reply giving the information asked for will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

It is doubtful if he would even pay for it if the Department did sell it to him.\n\nSeveral years ago the Department purchased this building from an Indian for school purposes and the records at Ottawa will show what was paid for it. It is unlikely that it will ever be required again for school purposes but I would not recommend selling it to Chief Mushquash unless he can show how he could pay for it within a reasonable time.\n\nThe Chief should have made his request to the Department through the Indian Agent and the practice of Indians writing direct to the Department should be discouraged as it impairs the usefulness of the Agent and leads the Indians to ignore him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. BURK\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the request made by Chief Louie Mushquash, of the Pays Plat Band, to live in the building formerly used for school purposes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will have no objection to his occupying this building, provided he will agree to be responsible for any repairs that may be required. The Department cannot consent to the sale of the building, but, until such time as it is required, Chief Mushquash may occupy it as a residence without rental. You will be good enough to inform him that it is expected he will keep the building in a satisfactory state of repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

I had to do it more than once to Mr. Ross, but he had dealt with him promptly, but it was only a few days ago I got just previous to my leaving the school.

In a note to me Mr. Bell had to explain that instead of March it should have been said December, for no cheque was sent me in January for the quarter ending Dec. 31. I am sorry that such error should have been made, but I must confess that it was through no negligence of mine.\n\nIf report were laid against me by the chief, as though I did not do my duty, I sufficed it to say for my justification that the children attending the school came either from the village or from the country. The village authorities would compel me to submit (as to teaching) to their laws, I said I had no law to receive from them; despite me they (of the village) refused to send their children to school; they would even coax those of the country to do the same, which the latter refused to do, having them no other children except\nHere of the country, I went to the country for some time and bought there, later on those of the village gave me no rest, they frightened me, they pulled my residence and prominent among the rest was the chief's own son.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nAnne Dwyer\n\nfor R.

(RG 10, Volume 6164, file 432-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the school teacher lately appointed for Shikshigwaning, kindly forward to the Department of Indian Affairs the following considerations.\n\nThe Indian Act, section 76 (a) says that chiefs may frame regulations as to what religious denomination the teacher of the school established on the reserve shall belong to; but because the legislators foresaw the case that a chief might be influenced by parties against the religious persuasion of the majority and the best advantage of all, they added the following restriction: \"Provided that always he (the teacher) shall be of the same denomination as the majority of the band.\" It showing that they admitted no exception to that point.\n\nNow at Shikshigwaning, according to the census taken a little more than two weeks ago by Rev. Father Specht, there are 145 Roman Catholics, and 5 Protestants. Consequently, it was not in the power of the chief to ask for a Protestant teacher, and it was the duty of those who are the guardians of the law to refuse him: \"The teacher, says the Act, shall be always of the same denomination as the majority of the band.\"\n\nBut I am told that it is upon the request of the band that the appointment in question has been made. So this Summer that his request being evidently against the provisions of the law, was not to be considered. Suppose that a band would send a request to the effect of appointing to the office of Indian Agent a man who is not a British subject; what answer would be given to that request?\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6164, file 432-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nO say besides, that it does not seem that the band ever made such a request; it is the fact of only a few troublesome people. = I sent Rev. Father Specht to the mission to inquire into the facts.\n\n216012\n\nRev. Father found that the men of age, that is, being 21 years old, were in all 54 at Nishigamang, and although many were then absent, sixteen only remaining. Seven (7) of them declared positively that they never wanted to have a protestant teacher, while five (5) only agreed that they did so. Among the eleven are one of the councillors and an ex-chief; and two widows' heads of families are to be added to them. Among the five one is now sorry for what he did.\n\nHere are now the very words of a few, whose names I have here: \"I signed my name to ask for a teacher, but I didn't, and the Indians did not ask for a Protestant teacher.\" The one who said so is a councillor; another, an ex-chief: \"We only asked the Department for another teacher; but we did not say that we wanted him to be a Protestant.\" Another: \"To say that the band asked for a Protestant teacher, is to say altogether a falsehood. Only three men spoke in favor of a Protestant. They told the Department a lie. Those who pretended that these three men represented the Band.\"\n\nThe newly appointed teacher is an intelligent man; he knows the laws, and wonders himself how he can be teaching in a village nearly all Catholic, because, as he said to the Indians \"That is never done\". As a matter of fact, no body has ever heard of a Catholic being appointed to teach in a Protestant reserve.\n\nRev. Father Specht inquired also into the cause that brought about that difficulty. It appears to be that the Division did not...\nchance enough in their studies, and that the fathers did not send better teachers.\n\nBut whose fault is it chiefly, that the children did not progress more, if not of the parents who never sent regularly their boys or girls to school, and did not see that they would talk or read any English at home? Besides it may be said that the principal reason of the failure of the school at Pishigwining, as I remember, and the cause why we could not find better teachers, is the quasi-impossibility to get any really competent person willing to remain in the country with no society, no comfortable lodging, a very poor boarding, not the least distraction, to earn only $200 or $250 dollars less the necessary expenses.\n\nIt ought to be said here also that the last teacher has not been sent by my predecessor, but after receiving a petition made in his favor by some of the principal men, and after telling them that the man was hardly fit for the situation.\n\nOn finishing this letter, founded upon the text of a letter perfectly clear, I pray the Department of Indian Affairs to discharge Mr. John Lagimaw at the beginning of the next quarter,...to increase the salary of the teacher and to inform me on time of the vacancy of the school, so that, according to the privilege granted to the Superior of those Missions I may propose the appointment of some reliable person.\n\nAlthough we are grateful to the Department for the privilege in question, and take it as a proof of its good dispositions towards us, we also know that it is one the employment of which causes us a great deal of difficulties with very little satisfaction. And it will be so as long as we cannot offer better wages and better conditions of lodging and boarding. We think also that were we to renounce that privilege the Department would be...\nvery often in the impossibility of doing any better; and having more Protestant teachers disposed than Catholic ones, they will more than once neglect to observe the Section 76 (a) of the law. However, for the peace and the proper civilization of the Indians, it is greatly desirable that the Religious Director and the teacher of a Bureau help each other and animate the people with the same spirit. It is for that, no doubt, that the said law has been voted by the legislators, and that the privilege of appointing the teachers has been given to the superiors of the missions.\n\nI hope to receive a favorable answer to this letter that has been inspired to me by the most sincere devotion to the interest of the Indians.\n\nI remain dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord,\n\nL. A. Curtis\n\nSuperior of the Missions.\nOTTAWA, 20th November, 1899\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant complaining of the appointment of John H.

Miss O'Rielly says that she cannot stay unless she is paid at least $250.00 and the Agent states that a qualified teacher cannot be got to take the school for less. Sheshegwaning is an isolated place where the common necessaries of life are expensive and I think that $250.00 is little enough to offer any white person to undertake the work there.\n\nOf the sixteen schools on Manitoulin Island and the North Shore between Garden River and the Parry Sound Agency, eight are in receipt of a salary of only $200.00 a year, while the others are paid from $250.00 to $300.00. The schools for which the smaller salaries are provided have been under the charge of Indian or half-breed teachers and have made little or no progress, they having no experience or qualifications, and Separate School Inspectors White and Prendergast will bear out this statement.\nI think that where a qualified white teacher can be obtained for a school in this locality that $300.00 is little enough, and where one is willing to take $250.00, the Department should not hesitate to pay it.\n\nThe Agent further states that the Indians of Sheshgwaning are anxious to have their children properly educated and I think that the Band might be taxed with the additional $50.00 to make up the salary of $250.00 which the Agent recommends should be paid Miss O'Rielly, as if she gives up the school at the end of this quarter, they will be left without a teacher for the rest of the winter at least.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is assuredly not the time for the Indians to rebel against your decision of last summer, and I hope that you will be anxious to keep them in respect of your own authority.\n\nBesides, they wish to have John Saginawana who is no better a teacher than was Miss O'Reilly the last one that we gave them upon their request after telling them that he was not fit. The bad spirit of the chief and of his councillor appears evidently in their feet.\n\nAgain, I am sure that the resolution as sent to you by those two men is not the desire of the band. Yesterday I received letters from the place complaining of the conduct of their chiefs.\n\nIn consequence I ask your Department to give the Agent the authority to go again to Wiikwemikong to have Miss O'Reilly officially received.\nDivided this young lady remains satisfied to go, or to close the school\nyour agent is not obliged until the land becomes more reasonable\nand promising. And if Miss O'Reilly has to give up, I pray your\ndepartment to give the chiefs to understand that it will be a duty of\njustice to pay her all her expenses in coming for them, which\nMr. Sharburn says to go near to $5. dollars, that to be paid of course out\nof the money of the land.\n\nTwo, if Miss O'Reilly has to give up Paskigwening, as she\nis ready to take another school she might take the school at\nPawnee near Manitowaning at the beginning of the next quarter,\nin place of Mr. Crockett who has no certificate and is in a situation where\nthe inspectors pretend that there should be a competent teacher.\n\nPlease write to Miss O'Reilly, your way, care of Mr. Agent Sharburn, with\nthe utmost delay possible, whether you will approve her nomination\nfor Pawnee.

He says: \"These two men alone find fault with the teacher, they hate her. The rest of the Indians are very sorry that Miss O'Reilly has gone, and they would be pleased if she came back. I have gone to the school to see what happened there, and I found that the teacher was doing faithfully her duty. Only a few children because they are lazy, do not like to go to school.\"\n\nBesides some Indians belonging to another Reserve had occasion to meet the Shingwauk men, and they say that the 2 troublesome Indians of this village in question desired that they will receive no teacher and no rule from outside; that they will appoint the teacher, and make him teach as they like, if not they will give no peace.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since Esquimaux left the school on the 30th June last, two teachers have been sent there by Father Artus, Miss O'Rielly, the first one was highly spoken of by Mr Separate School Inspector White, but the Indians, headed by the Chief, made it so unpleasant for her that she was obliged to leave. The present teacher is meeting with but little success as the majority of the Indians are withholding their children in the hope of having Esquimaux re-appointed, and have forwarded a petition to that effect. The Chief denies that Miss O'Rielly had to retire on his account but he admits that they mean to freeze out the present teacher, or any other one than Esquimaux. Mr Agent Thorburn was instructed to notify the Chief not to interfere, or the Department would be forced to consider the advisability of recommending his deposition. This is the way the matter stands at present and the Indians will have to be brought to time or the school closed. The Band pays the salary of $200.00.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI am directed to call your attention to a complication which has arisen in connection with the appointment of a teacher for the Sheshagwaning Indian school, and in order that you may be in a position to consider the case I beg to explain how the difficulty has arisen.\n\nIn July 1899 the Indians of that Reserve petitioned for the employment of a teacher named John Esquimaux to take charge of their school, and their wishes were acceded to by the Department. In November of that year Rev. Father Artus called the attention of the Department to the fact that Esquimaux was a Protestant, and was not, therefore, eligible to teach the school as the majority of the Band were Roman Catholics.\n\nEnquiry was made into this matter and it was learned that Father Artus' statements were correct, and in March last he was advised that the Agent would be instructed to notify Esquimaux that his services would not be regained after the close of the school year on the 30th of the following June, when he would be at liberty to appoint a Roman Catholic teacher to take charge of the school.\n\nRt. Rev. Bishop O'Connor,\n\nPeterborough,\n\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6164, file 432-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Department hesitated to summarily dismiss Esquimaux, as it was through a misapprehension that he was appointed and he was therefore allowed to complete the school year, in lieu of notice.\n\nFather Artus nominated Miss O'Reilly to take charge of this school, but the Indians prevented her from teaching until they were compelled by the Department to accept her services, but they made the situation so unpleasant that Miss O'Reilly was forced to obtain a transfer to another school. Mr O'Connor, who has taken her place, is meeting with little success, as the majority of the Indians are withholding their children in the hope of having Esquimaux re-appointed, although they have been assured by the Department that it is useless to agitate for his return, as it has no intention of placing him in charge of the school again.\n\nThe teacher's salary is paid from the fund of the Band and they claim that they have a right to appoint a voice in the appointment, and allege that the teachers previously sent them by Father Artus were incompetent.\n\nThe Department would be glad if this unsatisfactory state of affairs could be remedied and if the dissatisfaction continues the grant will have to be withheld and the school closed.\n\nI have the honor to be, Rt. Rev. Sir,\n\nYour most obedient servant,\n\nSecretary\nDear Sir,\n\nI think it to be my duty to inform you of what is going on at Pishigwining, and for this purpose I will only give the exact translation of a letter that I received yesterday from one of the commissioners:\n\n\"Pishigwining, Morrisville, Ont., Nov. 26th, 1900\n\nFather Godanny, Wikwemikong, Ont.\n\nDear Father: I inform you of what have decided the Indians (some of them) at Pishigwining for the school. They will not have a Catholic teacher, but a protestant one. The Secretary General wrote from Ottawa that Mr. O'Connor was going to be the teacher. Our chiefs say: A teacher sent by the parish shall never teach well; only a protestant one shall teach well. The chief John Biganinina asked all the Indians to give their names to have a protestant teacher. He gained them to do so, with the exception of 5. The following ones are the five: Ignace Mekahgiarisk, Joseph Sampson, J.B. Watson, and Joseph Wakanee. We did not like to refuse obedience to the Secretary General and to our fathers.\n\nEach chief of ours who made such a decision, he shall not succeed, for sure. At the end they will find that they injured themselves when they resisted that way the Secretary and the Fathers.\n\nI offer you, Father, my salutations.\n\nJoseph Wakanee.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

The chief here does not want to have a Catholic teacher, although he received a letter to that effect from the Secretary General. He has gone around to see each man, forcing everybody to sign a document asking for a Protestant teacher. There are only a few that dared to refuse him.\n\nThis does not want any commentary.

O'Connor, the appointed teacher for Pictouwaring.\n\nIt is perhaps better that this gentleman does not go to the place, as he might have met with the same difficulties that discouraged Monsieur O'Reilly. And in the present condition of affairs it will be better that, for this time, your Department by itself nominates and gives official appointment to a suitable teacher, provided, of course, he is a Catholic?\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord.\n\nG. A. Orton\n\nSuperior of R.C. Missions\nDear Sir,\n\nI already had the occasion to inform your Department of an arrangement that I made with a society of ladies teachers in order to have always competent persons in charge of our Indian schools. Already last year I had them at Smith Bay and Wikwemikong, where they gave more than satisfaction to parents and children. Mr. Inspector White told me that if from the solution of the difficulty, and he wished me to send similar teachers everywhere.\n\nReferring upon the word of one of your letters, dear Sir, namely, that the Department intended to ameliorate the schools and the teachers' lodgings in the Island reservation and on the North Shore, I called upon more ladies two for West Bay where Miss O'Reilly resigned, and two for Lagomog, where Miss Brown would take the latter's place.\n\nAt West Bay, although there are rooms more or less comfortable behind the school-room, there is no furniture whatever.\n\nAt Lagomog, there is no furniture at all, not even a chair.\n\nAt Cutter, they are building, but the necessary articles of furniture will have to be purchased.\n\nI wrote to the Agent of Thunder for the two last places, and to the chief for West Bay. But they did not answer me.\n\nThe teachers are already at Wikwemikong, but they will not...\ntheir residence are not habitable, to go and start teaching.\n\nAs it seems that the Agents, too busy with their other personal undertakings, do not pay much attention to the needs of the Indian Bureau, and from a long time, I would suggest that your Department allow me a certain sum for each mission for purchasing furniture. One single bed and mattress, a kitchen stove large enough to warm the room in winter, one table, one armchair and 4 chairs, one cupboard, seems to be the necessary articles. The ladies being always two together should buy by themselves their other bed.\n\nFor Shikshawenning, when your Department shall find it advisable to open the school again, it will be necessary to repair the school-house and to build for the teachers. Then, if you like to inform me, I will try to have two very good ladies whom you will kindly appoint yourself without letting Indians know that they have been recommended by me. I do not doubt that after a little while the people will be very pleased.\n\nSincerely dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord\n\nJ. R. Atkin\n\nSuperior of R. C. Mission.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I saw those who will teach respectively at West Bay and Sagamog.\n\nIn order to be sure to open the schools after the Sunday of August, they said they were ready to advance the money necessary to purchase furniture for their residences, hoping that your Department will refund to them what they shall pay, at its first convenience. \u2014 As I know by your letters of past fall and last winter, that you intend to accommodate the teachers equally, I thank God the said ladies, and send orders in their names for what is absolutely necessary. The bills in duplicate will be sent to you.\n\nBut we cannot do the same for other places or any other place presently.\n\nHoping this will be satisfactory\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour servant in the Lord\n\nJ.

Maclean.\nDeputy Indian Affairs.\n\nNecessaries relating to\naffairs of the Indian\naffairs referred to\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn addition to the reports on the individual schools\ninspected by me I beg leave to direct the attention of\nyour department to the following matters:\n\nWithout doubt the greatest improvement expected in\nthe day Indian schools has resulted from the appointing\nof the religious as teachers in several of the schools. Their\nwomen of refinement and education have accepted the plan\nnot for the small salary attached but solely that they might\ndo all in their power to instruct and elevate their native-\nted children. And no one who has visited the schools\nunder their charge and doubtless their untired services have been the benefit of both children and adults. The great influence of these ladies on the adult population was of the most encouraging features to be noted.\n\nBut to enable this good work to go on the Department must provide residences for these ladies that will be habitable during winter without serious injury to health. This applies with special force to Capilano and Skeetchewaning. Unless the residence in the first named place is put into proper repair the teachers would be forced to risk their lives to remain there during winter; and that is the time when they will find most of the business at the village. At Skeetchewaning the teachers will take charge at the opening of next term if some respectable accommodations can be provided. This is a place where little progress has been made in past years in part through the difficulty of getting competent teachers to go to such a place.\nin part through the unfriendliness of the band to having school at all. I have strong hopes that the district will effect a great improvement here if arrangements can be made to place them in charge.\n\nThe residence at South Bay has been very much improved and is well used but little effort is put into very good shape. At Whitemudhouse the accommodations are too limited and otherwise unsuitable so that the district may be forced to withdraw from this place. At Black Bay something was done to provide accommodations for the district but still further changes will have to be effected to make the place safe habitable. Shortly hereunder known to be poor.\n\nI urge upon the Department the need of seeing to this matter without delay in order that the improvements may be completed in proper time. The urgency is but too evident among our who know the situation.\nThe orphanage and boarding school at Fort William is doing very creditable work. But those in charge complain and justly so, that the Department does not treat them as generously as it does similar institutions elsewhere.\n\nThey receive in all a grant of $575, and for this they hire teachers besides feeding and clothing a considerable number of orphans. There can be no doubt of the success of the institution; the children are well looked after physically, intellectually and morally. But the comparatively small amount given by the Department is quite insufficient remuneration for this work. We recommend that this school receive the same per capita grant as is given to similar institutions elsewhere for the orphans it maintains, besides a fair grant for teaching the day pupils. This will enable the Sisters to provide a much needed school building.\n\nThe Severn Bay School requires a suitable building (a log one would do) which should be begun this fall.\n\nSharette from the\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. White\nExtract from teacher's report on the St. Joseph's school for the year ending March 31, 1910.\n\nMany help their parents during sugaring time, also planting and reaping time. Outside of this irregularity is generally due to the negligence of ignorant parents. I think it would be well to appoint some one to look up the absent ones and that a penalty or fine be imposed on negligent parents.\n\nSewing, crocheting and cooking are taught to girls and young married women.\n\nAdele Duhamel,\nTeacher,\nSilver Water, Ont.\nOttawa, April 29, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has increased the salary of Miss Duhamel, teacher of the Sheshewangan school, from $300.00 to $400.00 from the last instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRobt. Thorburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nTo\n\nThe Secretary of the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Your liberal favor of the 28th ult. received last Saturday. As mail leaves here only once a week; this is my first opportunity to acknowledge it and to express my sincere thanks to the Department for their kindness in increasing my salary to four hundred dollars. I shall try to show my gratitude by continuing as faithfully as I can, to serve them in the persons of these Indians.\n\nI must confess that last summer, and still more this past winter, I was very seriously tempted to leave this place, not only on account of the difficulty and expense to reach it, but also because of the carelessness of parents in sending their children to school. But I cannot leave now when the Department has shown such appreciation of my efforts. I am inclined to think the Department appreciates it more than many of the Indians.\n\nIf you will allow me to suggest, I would say that now is an opportune time to require attendance at school. I told the Chief and his assistant what I wrote in my report last February, and they expect...\nthat something will be done. The Chief Joseph Sampson very anxiously inquired a couple of weeks ago if the Dept. had written me anything about those who do not attend school. I answered that it is not likely the that the Dept. would write to me about it, all they want to know from me is if school is well attended. A few words of advice from the Dept. would perhaps have good effect just now. I told the chief that no doubt I would have a similar report to write next year, to show if there has been any improvement.\n\nI wish to thank the Department also for the promised assistance in supplying materials. In my next report, I will mention what I think is fair. I am most willing and anxious to interest the women in the work of cooking especially; all can sew fairly well. We have incessantly worked to teach them how to care for their sick and give them proper food.\n\nI fear I cannot do much this spring in looking after the women, as I am just recovering from a severe attack of lumbago which kept me out of school two weeks, but I will do what I can and try to have at least one or two meetings before the summer holidays.\n\nYours most gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should then lay before them the advantages that will accrue to their children from the education which is placed within their reach and endeavour to secure their co-operation. There would appear to be some parents who are very negligent in this matter and it may be deemed expedient to appoint a truant officer and enforce the school regulations, although the Department does not wish to resort to these measures until all others have failed and it is thought that your influence with the Indians may result in their taking a greater interest in the school work.\n\nBe good enough to report to the Department in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRobt.

Indial Day School activities under instruction, etc., the Chief and Council were instructed as to their duties regarding their duties to the pupils as to attendance, etc. Since that time I have twice visited the school and found the attendance good. No report was made at that time as there was no chance that the attendance would not bear out the report from the agency here when the teachers returned for the quarter were in.

I shall dwell particularly on the chapters mentioned in the Memo. As for ventilation, we often have more than we care to have, and I know their houses are the same. In the school most of the window panes are only tacked in, so on windy days we would prefer fewer openings, and as to our house which is 15 x 20 and in which we have two stoves, it is so cold that on the 6th ult. our plants froze during the day, with fire in the two stoves, the front door stuffed and lined with building paper and only two window shutters opened. In winter the snow finds its way in and in summer, the rain penetrates between the logs and around the doors and windows.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6164, file 432-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs I am writing to you, it may be well to mention that four or five children do not attend school this winter; three are away since New Year's and they do not live 1/4 miles from the schools; they are the same ones who are away every winter. Some winters the roads are bad, so they could reasonably be excused, but this winter they cannot plead the same excuse, for several men have traveled those ways with heavy sleighs, to and from their work; they were cutting timber on the Reserve; and the winter has not been severe either. Stormy days I would be the first one to excuse them, I mark those days in the attendance book. I spoke to the Agent when he was here last week to investigate the liquor cases, he said the Chief should see to that, but promised me he would speak to the people at their meeting; however, those are not in school yet.\n\nOne boy, aged twelve years, who lives quite close to the school and who is often guilty of truancy, is allowed, by his grandparents with whom he lives, to remain at home whenever he wishes; he is out of school three weeks now; they seem to think that as others can remain away, he may do so also. Maple sugar season will soon be here, shortly after that, the planting time, so he will have little school the remainder of the year if nothing is done. The acting Agent held a meeting here last June and told them that they would be compelled to send their children to school, but since they are allowed to go on the same as before, they think, when I urge the necessity of attending school, that I have a grudge.\nagainst them. I would not wish there to be fined, especially the one referred to last, as he is very poor, but he, as well as the others, needs a good raising. I know that the children who live far cannot come in the spring when the roads are bad, I am willing to make allowance when it is possible.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Duchesne.\nOttawa, March 9, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence in connection with the attendance at the Sheshgwaning school I beg to say that in a letter recently received from the teacher she states that a boy aged twelve years who lives quite close to the school is not sent regularly, although there is no good reason why he should not be, and that there are four or five other children who have not attended during the winter. In each case there is no good reason.\n\nI would ask you to investigate these cases when you next visit the reserve and reportfully to the Department. It would appear that the warning given by you last summer has not had the desired effect and it may be decided to put the Regulations in force. As you are aware these provide for a fine or imprisonment.

However, I think it my duty to tell you his conduct of late.\n\nEarly last fall, several men asked me to give them the contract for the cutting of the wood for the school and house. I had about given it to one, when the chief came and told me not to give it to anyone, that he would see to it. I then gave him in writing, the number of cords needed with\nthe kind of wood, which was 26 cords of maple and 3 cords of cedar; all 2 ft. wood.\n\nThe first few cords were all maple, then I noticed birch mixed in. I told the man who was hauling it, that I did not mind having a little birch in the school wood, as there is no chimney on the school, only a straight stone pipe, but for the house, I wanted only maple as birch fills the chimney and pipes, and some years ago, when we had accepted a good deal of birch, we had several fires. He told the chief, so the first few cords of the house wood were a mixture of maple and oak. But soon saw that there was birch, so I again spoke to the man. Then we had a thaw and no more wood could be brought.\n\nThe chief came to say that the wood was all cut and asked for the account to send the Department. I told him that he had not kept his agreement to send maple and cedar; I added that I would keep the little birch that was already here, if he would take for himself or someone else the birch that was in the bush and bring maple instead. He promised to do so, and said the three cords of cedar were cut.\nI knew and felt I was doing wrong in giving him the account with my signature, and I told him so; but he said, as they all do:\n\n\"It takes so long to get money from the Department, and there was no knowing when there would be snow, and that he would surely bring it down when there would be snow. I let myself be persuaded and gave him the paper. Two weeks ago, he began to draw the wood; the first was three cords of tamarack instead of cedar. When he brought the first load, I told him I did not want that. He said it was better than cedar for kindling.\n\nI inquired from other men, all said that tamarack is not kindling wood, that it cracks stones and easily sets fire to chimneys. The next day I asked him please not to unload that wood. He at once became very angry and said many things to me, one was that he would put the wood there and if I would not use it he would lock the school and send me away. I told him no, I would not go, and as this wood would be used only next winter, I did not think the Dept.\napprove my accepting it as it would destroy\nthe furnace they are putting in the new\nschool, and that I could not, in conscience,\ndo so. He, however, unloaded the three cords\nthen went to nearly all the men in their\nhomes, told them I was not satisfied\nwith the wood and said that if I told\nthe agent on him he would send me\naway at once; but for that, he wants\nthem to help him by signing a petition to\nthat effect. I telephoned the agent to ask him\nto keep the cheque when it would come from\nthe Department, until all was made right.\nhe said he would come the following\nweek, but no doubt the weather prevented\nhim from coming.\n\nThis week, the chief brought the\nrest of what he calls the hard wood,\na mixture of maple, elm, birch, and\ntamarack. It is useless to argue with\nhim so I said nothing. I spoke to the\nAssistant chief, he said he has been looking\nfor this trouble as he knew what wood\nwas out in the bush. he could answer\nnothing when I asked him why he did\nnot tell me before.\nThe chief who, when he was in office some years ago, annoyed the Department, I am told, by requesting several times to have a public school, is still trying to persuade the people to renew the attempt. He does not approve of Domestic Science work, gardening, calisthenics, etc., all that is a loss of time he thinks, and judges of the knowledge of the children by his own who are seldom in school. He takes good care though, not to inquire how much those know, who attend regularly. Some young men are quite put out because the chief says they can read and write very little, they say he has never asked them to read anything for him; one is our post master, Noel Dominic, another, his half brother Daniel Sampson, two smart, good and honest young men, of whom he should be proud.\n\nThe chief may not be able to do much, still he may get a few ignorant and timid ones, not willing to contradict him.\n\nI certainly do not mind him, but do my duty quietly and conscientiously, it is\nnot pleasant to have him constantly find fault and trying to influence others. The children, too, hear that language, and consequently, do not care to study since the chief says the school is no good. One woman told him last week, that he would do far better to talk less and see that the children go to school, and not allow the girls to be kept home for a trifle and the boys of 12 yrs. of age to work. Many are dissatisfied with him, even those who voted for him.\n\nI am here nearly ten years and was never annoyed by the chiefs, but since this one is in office, not one year yet, I hear nothing but fault finding, not only with me but with everyone who tries to do right.\n\nI do not know what the agent will do in regard to the wood when he comes, but I thought it well to acknowledge myself my mistake in giving the account of the wood before it was here, and to tell you some of the things I have to bear from the chief.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Ducharme\n\nIndian Affairs.

There was so much snow that I could not get views from the points I desired, but this is sufficient to give you a fair idea of it.\nThe work on the building will be resumed shortly, the Agent told me he expects the school to be finished some time in May. I trust that a well will be dug before that time. I do not think the Department would expect us to carry water from such a distance as the nearest well is.\n\nI, no doubt, will not be able to do much in the line of gardening this year, but I intend to have one or two flower beds if we possibly can manage.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Duchesne\nOttawa, March 21, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to thank you for your communication of the 15th instant, in which you report upon your work at the Sheshgwaning school and with which you enclose photographs of the building which is now under construction and the pupils.\n\nThe Department hopes that when the new building is completed it will be comfortable for both pupils and teacher.\n\nThe bread, which was baked by the girls in the domestic science class, was also received and the Department was very pleased to know that such good progress is being made in this work and in the sewing class.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Adele Duhamel,\nTeacher,\nSheshgwaning Indian School,\nMorrisville P.O., Ont.\nONTARIO,\n\nI, Mungo Robert Thorburn\nof the Town of Gore Bay\nIn the District of Manitoulin\n\nTo Wit:\n\nmake oath and say: That I was personally present and did see the within named\n\nMatthew Simpson\n\nduly sign and seal, and as his act and deed deliver the within Assignment on the day of the date thereof, and that I this deponent am a subscribing witness thereto, and that the said instrument was executed at\n\nRobinson in the District of Manitoulin and Province of Ontario\n\nSworn before me at the Town of Gore Bay in the District of Manitoulin this 26th day of March in the year of our Lord 1912\n\nM.R.

I have already told you that John Beattie Nigariiwea, the chief, enticed and coaxed by the Protestants of Silver Water (a settlement six miles from Sheshegwaning) has been carrying a real persecution against Miss Adele Duchesne, Teacher, since he is chief. Some three weeks ago he has called two consecutive meetings, principally composed of his followers, and has violently harangued them to make them consent to sign a petition for having a protestant teacher. The last of these meetings has been tumultuous and disturbed with anger. The chief tried to keep away from the meeting the few opponents who had ventured to attend the reunion.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6164, file 432-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI know that your Department has already hired Miss Dubhanel for the year 1912-1913 and it is not the fear of losing her that makes me appeal to your great equity in this affair \u2014 I just wish to put humbly before your eyes the result of the bitter and most unjust opposition of chief John Nizamivina. Through his constant efforts and calamities, he is creating a nefarious division in the Band I live in Sheshgwaning, five or six days every month. Consequently, I am in a position to know the state of minds. The really unjust and disturbing behavior of the chief has reduced the school question to this equally sad alternative \u2014 If Miss Dubhanel is removed because she is the catholic teacher of an entirely catholic Band of Indians, the staunch catholics who form the majority declare emphatically that they will not send their children to a protestant teacher, and that they will place them in a boarding school. If Miss Dubhanel is not replaced by a protestant teacher, the chief and those whom his real hatred has excited against her, will be constantly annoying her, and will\nnot send their children to her\u2014In both cases; chief J.B. Nigaminivin will have spoiled the great results we anticipated from the splendid school you have just set up.\n\nIt is really said that this chief should be allowed to create that disturbance in Sheshgaming. Before John Nigaminivin was elected chief, Miss Delamere had been teaching for nine years and not a word of complaint was ever heard against her. If a quiet chief happens to get drunk, he is removed at once. The present chief, John Nigaminivin, has done a hundred times more than getting by causing the bitter antipathy and divisions that now pervade in Sheshgaming, and he is kept peacefully in power. I was telling you last year that so long as John Nigaminivin will be chief in Sheshgaming, the Band will be in trouble. The events unhappily confirm my saying and suspicions.\n\nI hate to dictate to you, but I hope that you will deem consider the matter and help to the satisfaction of Sheshgaming.

I would like very much to keep some seasoned maple to mix with the green, so would be most grateful if the Department could have some cut as soon as possible.\n\nThe chief thinks it would be\nbetter to order now what I will likely need this winter and then later order the supply for next winter use. He thinks if we get all at the same time it will be too long before they receive their pay.\n\nWe will need, I think 15 cords of 4 ft. maple, 5 cords 22 in. maple and 3 cords 2 ft. cedar.\n\nIf the order could be sent to the chief we would be sure of having fuel soon. If sent to the Indian Office of Bar Bay we may stand chances of freezing.\n\nMr. Baxter has not answered my letters nor even sent report blanks for the past quarter. I found two old ones left by Miss Duhamel and though soiled used them. My cheque has not come yet.\n\nWhen I apply to you, Mr. Mackenzie, is it necessary to send a requisition to the Indian Office. I was told that all this matter is supposed to go through\nthe Indian Office. I have sent a requisition for duplicate to Mr. Baxter to make sure of no delay. I am almost sure he will not bother with it.\n\nAs the officer from the Department has not come, will we have to use the furnace as it is? If so, I think the best to do will be to move upstairs with the class. If you could send a good-sized blackboard on an easel, I think we could manage. I do not like this idea as the room we will occupy has only two windows or rather one double window, but I think it will be the lesser of two evils.\n\nI am enclosing the receipt of the school supplies which I have received. An invoice dated Oct. 12 came, for 12 Hygiene, 12 P.S. Arithmetic and 12 P.S. Composition but the books have not come. The second Reading Bible Stories, Ink and Lambert's also have not come yet.\nThe children are without ink for some days. I would like to prepare an exercise of dust-tells for Christmas if I can get the tells in time.\n\nAgain thanking you, Mr. Mackenzie, for your kindness. I remain,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nElizabeth Lewis.\n\nA. F. Mackenzie, Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa\n\nI made a mistake in saying P.S.

I met the teachers of both the Protestant and Roman Catholic schools and several of the more prominent Indians.\n\nWith reference to the Protestant school, a new building should be erected. Mr. Dunn, the present teacher, is leaving, and His Grace Archbishop Thernsloe has made arrangements for a married man to take up the work here. He holds a professional certificate, and I do not know where they are going to find accommodation for him. They have erected a very neat chapel, and as the work of the Anglican Church here would appear to be permanent, so far as can be judged.\nat present, it would seem advisable to erect a combined school and residence. They have a small garden plot in connection with this school, but they were late in commencing, and the results have not been very good this year.\n\nI also visited the Roman Catholic school and met Miss Leusch, the teacher. This is a splendid institution and was, if you will recollect, erected for the purpose of accommodating all the children of the village and district, who were then Roman Catholics. Miss Leusch has a splendid garden, and is doing excellent work. She has trained a band of fifteen pieces. She drew my attention to several minor repairs which I would propose to take up with the Schools' Branch and have attended to. Both these schools are really too small to do the best work, but the situation is such that no other course was open to the Department but to establish the second school.\n\nThe Indians on this reserve are showing an interest in agriculture, and although I did not have time to cover the whole of the reserve there is some very fair agricultural land. This is another reserve where a survey should be made\nat some time in the near future, although I do not consider it so imperative as the Wikwemikong survey.\n\nA.F. Macleod\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the Sheshegwaning Anglican school, the plan of the Ryerson school with some slight amendments would meet the needs. Mr. Ogilvie states that this plan and specification could be prepared in a few days, the cost would probably be in the neighbourhood of $3,500.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I pointed out the fact to both parents and children.\n\nSince then I have done a great deal of planning and thinking, wondering what could be done to encourage more, or better still, all our men to remain on their farms instead of wasting their time and money on the North Shore, waiting a week or more for a boat to come and then spending the few dollars as fast as they are earned.\n\nSeveral returned yesterday with no money, nor an idea of what they will do if there is no work the coming winter. I am questioning every one as they return and trying to make them see the foolishness of working this way. Would encouragement from the Department be a help to them?\nAmong other things I thought that if the Dept. would find it advisable to give them perhaps $5.00 for every new acre they clear and cultivate the coming year it might spur them on a little. Then next fall have a fair in the village for the grown people, giving prizes for best crops and best yield per acre.\n\nOf course, I have no experience in this kind of work and have not had an opportunity to talk it over with anyone, though I mentioned it to Rev. Fr. Papineau at his last visit. I am sorry I did not meet Mr. Abrahams, he would likely have had some good suggestions. Perhaps the Department has tried plans in other reserves and will know what is best to do.\n\nI am only trying all I can to help these people and make them better and I have found in every place that I have taught that those remaining on the farms are far better than the others.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Leusch.\n\nA.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Elizabeth Leusch,\nTeacher,\nSheshgwaning (R.C.) School,\nMorrisville, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nFor the past few days we are having a great deal of trouble and ill feeling here. A number of the Anglicans are constantly coaxing the Catholics to join them. Seeing that they cannot succeed in this, they are now trying to persuade them to send their children to their school telling them that they would learn so much more there and that they could remain Catholic while doing so.\n\nI have worked for the Department for the past sixteen years and believe that I have always given satisfaction, at least, I have been told so repeatedly by inspectors and others.\n\nOf course, there are always a few who are bound to find fault here.\nJohn Simon is the worst of these. Every now and then I have trouble with him because he does not wish his children to do garden work, manual training, fall fair work etc. His idea of school is to sit in the class room, book in hand from 9 A.M. until 4 P.M.\n\nHe is now taking his children away from here to place them in the Anglican school. William Cook who has been coaxed for a long time took his yesterday, so I have lost 6 pupils.\n\nOur Indians told me that they were told, by a representative from the Department, at the time when it was decided to open the second school that the children of each religion were to go to their own school.\n\nI should be most grateful to know if a regulation of this kind exists or could possibly be made in case it does not exist.\nA decision of this kind would put an end to the trouble. As it is now there is a great deal of quarreling and bad feeling.\n\nOur Inspector Mr. Evans was here only this week and expressed himself as well pleased so I do not think that there is any foundation for the Anglican's assurance that the children would learn more there.\n\nI would also be grateful to know if the school is Anglican or Public. He always understood it to be Anglican but those who are doing the coaxing claim it to be a public school.\n\nAssuring you of my gratitude for a favourable reply, I remain,\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lewis,\nTeacher\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 3, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in regard to the attendance of children at the two schools on the Sheshgwaning Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the children on this reserve should attend the school of the religious denomination to which they belong, the Roman Catholics should go to the Roman Catholic school and the Anglicans to the Anglican school. Mr. Agent McGregor is being instructed to inform the Indians accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Elizabeth Leusch,\nTeacher,\nSheshgwaning (R.O.) School,\nMorrisville P.O., Ont.\nOttawa, October 3, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Leusch, Teacher of the Sheshegwaning (R.O.) School, stating that there has been a great deal of trouble on the reserve in regard to the attendance of the children at school. She states that some of the Anglicans are trying to persuade the Roman Catholics to send their children to the Anglican School and that John Simon and William Cook have sent their children to this school.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Indians on this reserve that their children must attend the school of the religious denomination to which they belong, the Roman Catholics must go to the Roman Catholic School and the Anglicans to the Anglican School.\n\nThe Department considers that it might be well to appoint a truant officer for this reserve and I have to ask you to be good enough to state the name of an Indian who you consider would do this work and also state what remuneration he would expect for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Send them as soon as you get this letter. I am writing to Mr D.E. Sampson Sr to see to it, if anybody say anything to tell him that I said so and tell him to mind his own business.\" This letter is signed Pte Wm Cook #100328, Dated Shorncliffe, Kent August 27th 1917. I also saw David Sampson and extract from his letter same date \"I am willing to send my children to the Public School House at Sheshegwaning Indian Reserve and I want you to look after the matter\". I did not discuss the Religious part of it with Mrs Cook as I never interfere in their Religion in any way and don't know what her religion is but she is a daughter of David Sampson and all the rest of the family are Anglican, Pte William Cook was a Roman Catholic when he enlisted. Miss Leusch informed me that a Mr Finn an Inspector from the Department went to see David about the matter and that Mr Sampson was very stubborn. This apparently was a mistake as it made Sampson very angry.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6164, file 432-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nHe and he told me that he told Finn \"to go to Hell\". I don't know of any Anglicans trying to persuade the Roman Catholics to send their children to the other school, but it may be so, but I know that some of the latter are very much dissatisfied with their own school and think the time of the children is wasted at their school. I don't think that John Simon has sent his children to the Anglican as in the School Report up to September 29th there is no account of it and on the 3rd inst Miss Leusch informed me that he and Andrew Wabigone were both going to send their children there but that she had threatened them with excommunication and that they had not done so. I did not see John Simon, but Miss reported that Andrew Wabigone was not sending his child to school and I went to see him and he told me that the week before a small child had his leg broken at the R.C. school and that his child was blamed and that they did do anything at that school but play and he wanted his child to learn and asked me if he could send child to Anglican School and I told him that he could as they were both free and that I had nothing to do with their religion but that I had with their going to school and that he must send the child, the trouble seems to be that they think that the Anglican School is getting the children along so much better than their school, but I am satisfied that it will adjust itself and I am also satisfied that if I inform Mrs Cook that her children that there will be trouble and it would no doubt extend outside of the Reserve.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Church owing to their being dissatisfied with the Education their children were getting, and they are living together in peace and harmony but I am satisfied if Agent mixes up in the religious end of it there would be trouble.\n\nAs regards Truat officer, for the same reason I consider it the wrong time to appoint one and if thought advisable would advise that one for each school be appointed, but I have found very little trouble along that line and if any complaint I if I am on the ground look after it myself and if not I write the constable to attend to it and it always works out all right, while he is a Roman Catholic, being the Constable it is all right but if a separate officer were appointed from either side there would be trouble. The attendance is good and all children go to school, of course family are away from the Reserve working on the shore and may be going to school there, but when at home they attend regularly.\n\nI seemed to have been wrong in advising Wabigone that he could send his child to any school but I could not find anything in Act or Regulations against and I find that a quick decision is always best with them, I will await further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent,\nOttawa, October 16, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in regard to Roman Catholic children on the Geshagwaning Reserve attending the Anglican school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you were informed in official letter of the 3rd instant, the children on the reserve must attend the school of the religious denomination to which the parents belong. You will be good enough to see that this is done in all cases and you should inform the Indians that the Anglican school is not a public school, but is for the Anglican children on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

I tell you I am willing to send my children to Public School at Sheshegwaning. I had been give to D. E. Sampson permission to put my children to Public School at Sheshegwaning Indian Reserve. I understand some of the Indians get excited just because I want another school. Will you please tell Miss E. Leuch, the school teacher at Sheshegwaning, not to bother my children, and tell the other Indians not to get excited about my family. I tell you some of the Indians at Sheshegwaning alway trying to make my wife sore. I don't want any them Indians to bother my family. D. E. Sampson is the man to look after my family till I come back home. I want to tell you another thing, the priest might try to take my children to Spanish School, I don't want him to do that, will you please look after this matter, and when you see my wife tell her to mind her own business, not to listen to what the R.C. Indians say to her. I tell you my wife been worrying about me. I think she had enough trouble now. I don't want any of them Indians to bother my wife, I am the man looking after my wife, I am sure she is doing what I told her to do.\n\nJust a few words again just to let you know how I am getting along. I feel very healthy, this country we have very good meals every day, and lots of smokes, I am living first class. This is the best job I struck yet on this\nworld, I wish all my young friends come along and follow me. I have lots of fun here with the Huns. Every time I hear them Bang, Bang, Zip, Zip, I feel happy, its sound like Banjo. This is a very noisy place. I chew the tob. Here now to beat the Band, every time the big shell burst around me I take another chew and I spit about every one minute. I tell you this is lots of fun for me.

School reported to me that Angeline Andanawas was not going to school, and I wrote her father, and received a letter from Angeline and one from her mother; these letters say that on night of 14th February the girl went to dance with her mother and the next day at school Miss Leusch called her a Devil and that she made her write during recess and noon \"I am the devil's friend and I will go where she is\" and that she did not do anything bad when at the dance. The mother writes that she will let her girl go to school for two years more if there is another teacher, but want let her girl go to school to learn about devils. I saw Miss Leusch and she says that girl is nearly 14 years old, she did not call her a devil but told her something as the girl says, wrote it on the blackboard, and made her copy it, and went allow her to return to school until she apologizes, but wants her made do both. The trouble seems that some of the Catholics have been giving and attending dances during Lent and the teacher is trying to discipline them. I don't know what to do in the matter as I don't know to what extent religion can be used in the school, and await advice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Besides class-room work she also teaches gardening and sewing. Miss Leusch took the summer course at the Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, in the summer of 1913, being allowed an increase in salary from $450.00 to $600.00 then, which has remained at that rate up to the present time. There is an enrolment of 21 pupils, with an average attendance of 17.

Mr. McReynolds came and told the Indians that someone had reported them to the Government and that he would send a constable to watch them. The Indians at once suspected that I was the one who had informed the Government. To make things worse, the constable from Isle Bay came about two weeks later, early in the evening, in his uniform, and drove straight to the school. Of course they soon thought he came to get more information from me.\nAll this has excited some of the Indians very much.\n\nIn the first place, I think Mr. McGregor ought to have been more prudent than to tell the Indians that some one had reported them and that they were going to be watched. He might have known that they would be on the lookout for the constable and keep straight while they are afraid of being caught.\n\nThe Indians will get over their ill feeling in a short time because they know it does not bother me. But I thought it best to let you know where the trouble is so in case they do write, you could give them the answer they should have.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Sweet\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, June 21st, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant stating that a complaint is likely to be made by the Indians regarding your services.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that no complaints have yet been received, and as your services are quite satisfactory, the Department will be pleased if you will continue as teacher when the school reopens after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Day School to the West Bay Indian Day School, and also enclosing an application from Miss Sadie J. Burke to succeed Miss Leusch, I beg to say that, as you have been informed in a separate letter, the transfer of Miss Leusch to West Bay is approved.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Sadie J. Burke, as teacher of the Sheashegwaning (R.C.) Indian Day School, and will allow her salary at the rate of $500 per annum - the same as was paid Miss Leusch. She will also be entitled to the bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year.\n\nIt is hoped that Miss Burke will meet with every success in her work, and you should inform her of her appointment and arrange with her to begin duties when the school reopens after the present holidays on or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Should reports be favourable regarding her work, consideration will then be given to granting her an increase equal to that paid Miss Leusch.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. F.

Indian Day School, an increase of $100 per annum in her salary from the 1st of September, next. This will make the salary allowed her from that date at the rate of $700 per annum.\n\nThis increase is being made in view of the report of the Separate School Inspector, who visited this school in May, last. He states that Miss Burke is a very capable and earnest teacher.\n\nMiss Burke visited the Department yesterday and was informed that this increase would be allowed her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian Day School, visited the Department yesterday and, among other things discussed, stated that the Indians were in the habit of loitering around the school grounds and fences and had done some damage to the latter. They interrupt the work of the classes and cause annoyance.\n\nI shall be pleased if, on the occasion of your next attendance at the meeting of the band, you will draw this matter to their attention and impress upon them the advisability of keeping away from the school or the grounds during the regular class hours. Will you also inform them that they will be expected to protect the fences and the school building and not cause any further damage or annoyance. If there is a continuance of the trouble mentioned above, you should take steps to have the worst offenders prosecuted.\n\nMiss Burke further requests that a sanitary closet be installed in the basement of the school. There are closets of this type on the market, and I shall be glad if you will furnish your views regarding the installation of one in the basement of the school. Please state whether you consider it feasible to do so and the approximate cost of having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

It is hoped that, as a result of your talk to the band, this habit will cease and that the teacher will have no further cause for complaint.\n\nRegarding the sanitary closets, it is noted that the present closets at the school are in good condition, and the Department agrees with you that, if an indoor closet was installed, there would be great difficulty in giving the necessary attention to keeping it in a sanitary condition. No further action need be taken at the present time to have this indoor closet installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

It will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher to succeed her, and any applications you receive should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.

If, however, it is necessary, only an inexpensive building for the purpose should be erected.\n\nYour recommendation that both the Roman Catholic and Anglican Schools be closed on account of the small attendance, and the children placed in residential schools, has been noted. It would, no doubt, be difficult to close the Roman Catholic School, and it will have to be continued in operation for some time. Regarding the Anglican School, the Department is communicating with His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma with a view to having him consent to its closing and having the children placed in the Shingwauk Home.

Indian Day School, all current expenses were paid from Band Funds, Account No. 247, until the fiscal year 1910-11, when a portion of the salary was paid from Appropriation. I am unable to ascertain why the change was made. From 1910, a part of the salary and also some other current expenses (approximately 50% of the total cost of conducting the school) were paid from Appropriation, until the fiscal year 1919-20, when all the salary was paid from the Band Funds. Again, I can find no reason for the change in practice. From that year there has been paid from Appropriation certain current expenses other than salary, amounting to only:\n\n| Year    | Amount |\n|---------|--------|\n| 1919-20 | $21.00 |\n| 1920-21 | 6.76   |\n| 1921-22 | 118.50 |\n| 1922-23 | 92.26  |\n| 1923-24 | 14.80  |\n\nI wish to recommend that all current expenses of the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School be paid from Band Funds.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe names of the boys whose attendance is irregular, as noted on enclosed report are:\n\nLeonard O'Keefe Grandparent\nSam O'Keefe\n\nFred Marshall Guardian,\nhis uncle, Andrew Wabougi\n\nI think an official letter from Department may help to improve\nattendance in these two cases. If it does not, I will notify Agent McGregor.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Agent McGregor last week about Florence Vincent, a pupil of the school, who has defective sight. The sight of one eye is poor and both eyes appear to be affected with cataract. Florence is not a member of this band but I hope the Department will arrange some way to give her the necessary examination and treatment her eyes need.\n\nAlso mentioned to Mr. Agent McGregor that the children's teeth needed attention suggesting that the Department might arrange to send a dentist once or twice a year. There is a dentist located at Gore Bay.\n\nA boy not a member of this band has enlarged tonsils. I believe it would improve his health if they were removed.\n\nI send these remarks confident that the Department will give them earnest consideration and will arrange what is possible to promote good health among the children.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nMarcella Hickey.\nOttawa, March 31st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe teacher of the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School, in forwarding her annual report for the fiscal year ending today, draws attention to the case of two boys whose attendance is irregular. Their names are Leonard O'Keda and Fred Marshall. I have to request that you will inform the parents or guardians of these boys that unless they attend regularly arrangements will be made to have them placed in a residential school. It is thought that an intimation from you so that effect may lead to a better attendance on their part.\n\nThe teacher states that she has drawn to your attention the case of an Indian girl, Florence Vincent, who has defective sight, and requires attention. Please report whether you could arrange to have this girl examined by an optician, and if she requires glasses, if you can have the same supplied. The cost involved in having this girl given the attention her case requires should be stated. We understand that she is not a member of the Sheshegwaning Band. Please state to what Band she belongs, the names of her parents and if they are living, and, if so, whether they could pay any part of the cost in having her eyes attended to.\n\nThe teacher further suggests that the services of a dentist be engaged to attend to a number of children who require dental treatment. I shall be pleased to have your views regarding this matter, giving particulars as to any suggestions you make regarding the carrying out of the treatment required.\n\nThe teacher also draws attention to the case of a boy whose name she does not state who has enlarged tonsils. Please furnish a report giving the boy's name, full particulars regarding his parents and whether they could not pay the expenses involved in having his case attended to. If not, please state what arrangements could be made in his case and the approximate cost of any attention which you recommend he receive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nWe are requesting Mr. Agent McGregor to furnish a report regarding the medical attention required in the cases mentioned by you. We are also requesting him to notify the parents or guardians of the two boys mentioned with a view to their more regular attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Marcella Hickey,\nTeacher, R. C. Indian Day School,\nSheshegwaning, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of March 31st I beg to advise that Leonard O'Keda lives with his grandfather, whose wife has left him and Fred Marshall with an uncle, a bachelor, so in both cases they don't have much chance not having a woman to look after them. I have written the guardians in both cases and some improvement may take place.\n\nI have been unable to learn the parents of the girl, Florence Vincent, but don't think she belongs to any band is not a member of Sheshegwaning Band, but think possibly her mother was. There being no optician on the Island, it is only a travelling one that could be secured and it is hard to say whether they would be good or what the cost would be.\n\nAs regards the children's teeth, the nearest dentist is Gore Bay and the expense would be considerable and am sure the Band would not be willing to pay for his services.\n\nThe boy with enlarged tonsils is George Shewenese, also not a member of the band, or any band, but the Department have some money of his left him by his Grandfather, the late Frank Shewenese, and it might be used for that purpose but Miss Hickey doubts if his guardian would agree to have an operation. It might be arranged at about $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the cases of the pupils at the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School who require dental and medical attention.\n\nRegarding the case of Florence Vincent who has defective sight and requires attention, it might be possible to arrange to have this girl visit the nearest optician and have her eyes tested and the glasses required supplied. If this arrangement can be made without incurring any large expense, you may arrange for her to visit an optician and obtain a pair of spectacles, with steel mountings, with flat lenses. There is, no doubt, an optician in Gore Bay or a neighbouring town who would give the attention her case calls for. You might consult the teacher in this matter, and she might be able to make the necessary arrangements. The Department will expect that the expenses will be kept down to the lowest possible point. The optician's fee and the supplying of the spectacles should not exceed in cost $10, and besides there would be the girl's actual travelling expenses.\n\nRelative to the dental work required, please consult a dentist in Gore Bay and ascertain from him what he would charge to visit and perform any dental work required by the pupils on the Reserve. It behoves us, however, that only the cases among the pupils absolutely requiring dental treatment are to receive same. It might be possible to arrange with a dentist for a per diem rate, or a rate of 50 cents for each extraction, and $1.00 for amalgam fillings, and besides his expenses in travelling to and from Gore Bay. Please report what arrangements you can make with a dentist to do any work required, and the amount he would charge.\n\nWith reference to the case of George Shonenose, this boy has a sufficient sum to his credit in trust funds from his grandfather's estate to pay the cost of any operation required to remove his tonsils. If you can make arrangements to have him sent to the nearest hospital and the operation performed at a reasonable cost, you may do so. Any expense for the purpose will be charged against the amount to his credit in the Department.\n\nThe case of Leonard O'Keda and Fred Marshall who have been attending school irregularly should be enquired into, and you should ascertain on the occasion of your next visit to the Reserve as to their attendance. If they are not attending regularly, you should recommend to the Department that they be placed in an\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the present time it would require someone to take her to Owen Sound and the expense would be considerable.\n\nRelative to dental work required I received prices from Dr. Hinds, dentist here and he is willing to go to Sheshegwaning and do the necessary work there for $15. expense and $20. per day.\n\nIn the case of George Shewense I have taken the matter up with Dr. Davis, Mindemoya, as to the time it would be suitable for him to have him go there and to date arrangements are not completed. The only way it could be arranged would be to take him there as there is no stage connections from here to Mindemoya, but he could come this far on stage unless I should happen to be up at right time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, May 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the cases of the pupils of the Sheshegwaning Reserve who require dental and medical treatment.\n\nRegarding the case of Florence Vincent, I beg to say that you should arrange on the occasion of the next visit of an optician to have her eyes examined and the glasses required supplied. Any expenditure incurred for the purpose should be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nRegarding the dental work required, the Department will allow the dentist whom you engage to visit the Reserve payment at the rate of $20 per day for his services, as well as a total of $15 for travelling expenses. It is understood that his services must be engaged for a further period than three days, and you should endeavour to arrange that the work required be completed in less time if possible. The Dentist should be given definite instructions that only the most urgent cases among the pupils of the schools are to receive attention. The Department is not prepared to authorize any expenditure in excess of $75 in having dental work performed on this Reserve. You should arrange to have the Dentist visit the Reserve at a time considered convenient by the teachers and yourself to have the work done. The teachers should see that the children requiring dental attention are brought promptly to the Dentist in order that there will be no lost time or delay on the part of the Dentist. The Dentist should keep a list of the children given attention and the amount of the work done in each case. This you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nRegarding the case of George Shonenose who requires an operation for tonsils, you may arrange to have this done at a time considered suitable to have the work carried out. It may be that on the occasion of your next visit to the Reserve you could bring this boy back with you and have him sent to the place where the operation could be performed. You should arrange to see that the cost involved is kept down to the lowest possible point, and you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the operation and for any hospital charges.\n\nThe above matters will be left in your hands to have the necessary attention given, and it is expected that you will see that no large expense is incurred. The Department will be pleased to hear from you at a later date as to the action taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Indian Day School and I found quite an interesting little community centre. This is a fairly good building, with a flashed roof, which is now giving trouble and concerning which the Agent will report. They have many outbuildings, nice flower and vegetable gardens and good equipment throughout. This school is a social centre for the older people of the reserve during the evenings. Miss LaVictoire, of the Nardene Order, and one assistant comprise the staff and they are proving a very good civilizing influence. They need a few desks and an extra bed, and, as these were surplus at the closed C. of E. School, I asked the Agent to send the equipment over. He is also to send a washstand to Little Current, to be picked up by Agent Lewis for the Kaboni School. I intend to authorize the Agent to purchase four stools for community purposes.\n\nJune 23, 1931.\nDear Mr. Setter,\n\nOur status is now arranged so I can send you the names of candidates for mission schools.\n\nMiss Zoe St. James is named to replace Miss Harriet Smith at the Skeetches Indian School.

Indian Day School, is giving up duties on account of ill-health and that she requests that Miss Valentine La Victoire be appointed as substitute teacher to succeed her until the end of the present academic year, viz., June 30th, next. The Department regrets that Miss Hickey finds it necessary to discontinue her duties.\n\nIt is noted that you have interviewed Miss La Victoire and that she has had teaching experience. The Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Miss La Victoire for the balance of the present school year only. It is hoped that Miss Hickey will be able to resume duties at the beginning of the next school year, but, if not, the services of a qualified teacher will be secured. The salary allowed Miss La Victoire for the period she teaches will be at the rate of $85 per teaching month.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state the date on which Miss Hickey gives up duties and the date on which Miss La Victoire takes over the teaching duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would ask you, therefore, to take this matter up with the Council. A site should be decided upon and information given in regard to the number of children for whom provision should be made and the materials that should enter into the construction of the buildings should be given. Authority from the Band to expend the necessary sum from their capital funds should be obtained.\n\nThe question as to whether it would be better to provide a separate residence for the teacher should also be considered. In this connection you should state how many rooms are required for this accommodation. As the season is advancing and as the Department has to prepare plans for a number of other buildings which are to be erected this summer I would ask you to give this matter early attention and report as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

In the school most of the window panes are only tacked in, so on windy days we would prefer fewer openings and as to our house which is 18 x 20 and in which we have two stoves, it is so cold that on the 6th ultimo our plants froze during the day, with fire in the two stoves, the front door stuffed and lined with building paper, and only two window shutters opened. In winter the snow finds its way in and in summer the rain penetrates between the logs and around the doors and windows.\n\nAdela Duhamel\nWe the undersigned Chief and Councillors hereby certify that the above is a true statement of the vote of the band and we hereby authorize the vote for granting sufficient of the Band's funds as stated in the petition for vote and subject to the approval of Departmental plan for same.\n\nDavid Samson acting Chief\n\nWilson Simpson\n\nFrank Ladde\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie, Ottawa.\n\nDear Kind Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nIf you happen to think of Fr. Papineau who had the pleasure of travelling with you last August, you probably ask to yourself if he might not be dead and buried. I am not dead nor dying but since I have left you with my skins in Manitoba ring, I have been so busy that I could never go to bed before midnight. I visit eleven missions every month; among others Shishigwaring, West Bay, South Bay and Wikwemikong, well known to you in account of their schools. Upon returning from the Wikwemikong oil wells you were telling me that I was in a position to do much for the schools in my missions. I have endeavoured since then to realize your word. During my monthly 300 mile tour around Manitoulin (i.e., from South Bay to Muldrew Bay) I remain three or four or five days in each of the four above mentioned great missions. I devote a good part of that monthly sojourn to the welfare of the schools. I teach Sunday-school daily; I question the children, give them rewards, and hustle them.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6165, file 432-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOn Sunday, when preaching, I always have some recommendations to the Parent about the school, especially the attendance. In my numerous visits to the wigwams I insist very urgently on the school, and often bring some lost sheep back to the school room.\n\nSaturdays, before winter, I generally took the boys with me and we would go in the forest to choose various kinds of trees that we afterwards planted around the church. The boys enjoy very much these object lessons. It is to the West-Bay school that I have given more time. Miss Mary Cushing, the West-Bay Teacher, is an excellent and zealous teacher but she is only a teacher. How much we miss the Sisters this year in West-Bay! It is when we are deprived of them that we fully appreciate these Religious who are teaching in Sagawag, Wikwemikong, Shishigwaning and South-Bay. The Missionary is the only one who can measure the amount of good the Sisters perform in the betterment of the Indians, and the awfully hard life they lead amongst those disgusting people. West-Bay is pretty well developed and polished, but Wikwemikong, Sagawag, South-Bay and Shishigwaning are the most lonely places. Being extremely busy as I am, I can easily stand five or six days in those midsts; but I really cannot understand how a refined\nwoman can remain eleven months with these vile people. I am practically the only white man that visit these three villages; and when I leave to come back only after a month, the two sisters often cry when quitting their homes. They are kept very busy; visiting the sick, organizing, giving sewing classes, etc., but what a social life! Drunkards, quarrellers, injure. In Shishigwining especially, Indians have drunk desperately this year, and the full children! One cannot imagine a worst collection of silly children in all intellectual matters. They reproduce hard-work very well, but where in intellectual subjects they are extremely obtuse.\n\nI take leave to insist on the hardships of these sisters because I just have to beg you a favor that would contribute in rendering their life more supportable. It is about the residences of these sisters. They have needs that your department cannot easily think of. I wish to profit of your extraordinary kindness, and I would ask you to use your influence in making your Department adopt the plan that I will just temporarily submit to you.\n\nThey are very anxious about it at Wikwemikong South Bay and especially Shishigwining\u2014and you will never imagine the comfort you would bring them if this sort of residence was executed. At present their residences are separated very awkwardly from the class-room. They would like immensely the following combination:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6165, file 432-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nabove the class-room they could have a hall to give some sewing lessons; and above the kitchen, their sleeping rooms: a single stairs would suffice. Women could go to sewing hall by the teachers sleeping rooms.\n\nDo not laugh too much at my design!!!\n\nThey would need a little oratory because they keep the Holy Eucharist.\u2014After class, they could open the double door leading from the class-room to the Oratory and have devotions.\n\nThey would need a little parlor, because the Indians are always coming in all day, but especially when the teachers take their meals. The vast kitchen would allow them to give easily the so important cooking lessons.\n\nOh! what poor cooks are the squaws! I suffer so much from it! If this plan is liable to be adopted, please let me know at Manitowaning and I will send you a real clear plan made by an architect.\nI am told that your Department is just deciding the construction of the so needed new school here in Shishigwaming. It is a good opportunity to try this project. No where is it more needed and no where would it make the miserable teachers more happy.\n\nHoping that you will use your credit for this cause, I beg you to design and send me a few copies of the \"Indian Act\" and of the Manitoulin Island town map; and I declare myself already very gratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant addressed to Mr. MacKenzie of this Department, in which you deal, among other things, with the erection of a school-house and teacher's residence on the Sheshgwaning Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is the intention of the Department to erect a building this year. The sketch submitted in your letter above referred to has been noted, but it is thought that a building on this plan would be very expensive and hard to heat. Where accommodation for teachers of an extensive kind is provided in buildings it is usual to have such provision in the upper story. I am sending you herewith a rough sketch of a plan showing a class-room, oratory and an entrance stairway on the ground floor and on the first floor a landing, kitchen, dining-room and two bed-rooms for the use of the sisters. This building will be heated with a furnace and should, it is thought, provide suitable accommodation; however, the Department will be glad to have further suggestions and any criticisms that you have to offer. It is noted that you state that you can have plans prepared by an architect and as soon as the Department can come to a decision it would be pleased to have the work done as suggested by you. You will be good enough, therefore, to give this matter further consideration and report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. E. A. Papineau, B.J.,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 27, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your communication of the 20th instant and previous correspondence in regard to the erection of a school-house and teacher's residence combined on the Sheshegwaning Reserve I beg to say that the Department has received from the Rev. Father Papineau, the missionary, a sketch of a plan of a school-room showing certain accommodation which the sisters would like to have. It provides for a dining-room, kitchen, small parlor and a small oratory on the ground floor with living quarters above for the teachers and a sewing-room above the school-room for general use. This building is 54 feet long by 25 in all.\n\nI would ask you to state whether building stone is available and whether you think there should be a foundation and basement placed under the building and a furnace installed instead of arranging to heat the building with stoves. I would also ask you to state whether there would be a prospect of obtaining reliable contractors to undertake this work, which will be let by tender.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Thorburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nWitawemikousing, April 1st, 1911\n\nMr. J.D. McLean, Secretary Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Kind Mr. McLean,\n\nI am pleased to acknowledge the receipt of your considerate answer to my communication of March 18th re the construction of a school and teachers residence in Sheeshawaning.\n\nFirst of all I beg leave to thank you most heartily for your kindness in allowing me to make suggestions. Upon reading your first letter to me I experienced at once that all I have heard from our Fathers and the Indians about your exceptional kind-heartedness and devotedness to Indian affairs is perfectly true. Your extraordinary zeal for the welfare of our Odjibways is an object lesson to us.\n\nWe would accept with gratitude whatever you will deign grant to our teachers in Sheeshawaning or elsewhere; but since you condescend to hear furthermore our suggestions, I beg to say that our teachers find it impracticable to have their kitchen on the second floor \u2014 they have an absolute need of a cellar. They are obliged to bring with themselves, in August, their\nfood supplies for the whole year, e.g., in South Bay they are 16 miles from stores; in Sagamook they are 15 miles from nearest store, i.e., Massay; in Sheshegwaning they are 37 miles from the stores of Gore Bay and they can never rely upon the Indians to get their supply. To pack that food for the year, they need a good cool cellar and that cellar must be near the kitchen, because they have to go in at twenty times a day, to get milk, butter, vegetables, meat, etc., etc. The cook is often an elderly lady and it is morally impossible that she go down the stairs so many times a day. If they were in town where groceries can be obtained anytime, and where a small refrigerator is possible, it would be all right. But in those villages they must necessarily have a place to keep most of their food during eleven months, and I think the only practicable way to do so is to have a good cellar.\n\n2\u00b0 They would have to carry upstairs all the fuel, the water, etc., etc., very often without being able to obtain the help of the Indians; because when these Indians do not feel like it, they won't even split the wood in a reasonable way. I have often seen, this winter, pieces of fuel that no heather can carry up the stairs, and no Indian consented to split it better even for money.\nFor these reasons and others, they leave to suggest the enclosed plan.\n\nThis building would only be 45 feet long, i.e., only 10 feet longer than the one proposed by you.\n\nUnder the kitchen, the Parlor and the Oratory could be the cellar, divided in two: one part for the food and the other for the furnace\u2014and a certain quantity of fuel; one single chimney could serve for both the furnace and the cooking stove. The furnace being (being) near the kitchen, it would be an easy task for the cook to keep up the fire.\n\nI have suppressed the dining room because, having a waiting room, the teachers could be taking their meals in the kitchen and be protected from the curiosity of their every minute visitors.\n\nThe sliding door leading from the class-room to the Oratory could form a black-board and thus leave the full 24 ft wall for boards.\n\nI have suggested a separate porch for girls and boys because it's almost necessary for good morality among our so precocious Indian children that the girls should be separated from the boys in the porches as well as in their playgrounds. In Shesheyawaging, West-Bay and South-Bay, to avoid disorders in the bush, we have begun to let the girls go home, 10 long minutes before the boys.\nI am writing these suggestions with velvet gloves, as it were. Even if you throw them in the wastebasket, we shall always be grateful to you for your past great favor, dear Mr. Maclean. However, if you do not judge proper to grant a kitchen downstairs i.e., on the ground floor, I would beg you to leave the oratory near the class-room, but not to provide for a kitchen on the first floor. The teachers will, in that case, collect some alms, to build at their own expense, a kitchen on the ground floor. They declare it morally impossible to have the kitchen upstairs. They have tried it, in the school of West Bay; but they were obliged to build a kitchen on the ground floor.\n\nIn the plan I am just suggesting, the ceiling of the Oratory, the Hall and the Kitchen would be three feet lower than that of the class-room, so as to allow two very reasonable bed-rooms above the lower ceiling without making the whole building higher.\n\nHoping that the enclosed rough plan is clear enough and thanking you, in advance, for whatever you may grant, I remain\n\nVery Sincerely Yours,\n\nEug. A. Papineau, Jr.\nOttawa, April 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has authorized an expenditure of $12.50 per annum for prizes for the West Bay and Sheshogaming schools in your Agency.

Payment will be made upon the receipt of accounts showing the articles purchased with prices and the account for each school should be separately in order that the expenditure for each school may be shown in the books of the Department. The accounts for the West Bay and Sheshawanganing schools should be forwarded through the office of Mr. Thorburn, the Indian Agent, and those for the other two schools through Mr. Sims' office.

McLean,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014 I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th inst.\nNo. 151713-5.\n\nIn answer, I respectfully beg to make the following remarks:\n\nI know very well that the proximity of the church has only a secondary connection with the schools of your Department, and I would never have alluded to it if Mr. Thorburn had not first spoken to me about it.\n\nAfter my arrival here, he suspended the work, called a meeting of the Indians, and asked them if they were willing to build a church near the school. He came...\nto make the following proposition to me:\n\"If the Indians build their church in\nthe neighborhood of the school, are you\nwilling to go in the bush?\"\u2014 I told\nMr. Thorburn that I would give him\nmy answer later on.\u2014 I thought that\nMr. Thorburn had made you aware of\nhis proposition. Having been exhorted\nby Rev. Father Papineau to accept Mr.\nThorburn's offer, for the sake of peace,\nI thought it better to wire my answer\nto you in order to hasten your decision.\nI realize that my telegram must have\nappeared strange to you, since you\nwere not aware of Mr. Thorburn's\nproposal.\n\nYou may find it strange that the\nproximity of a church would change\nmy opinion about the location of the\nschool. The reason is this\u2014 The site of\nthe new school is so lonely, not a single\nhouse can be seen from it. I naturally\nthink that the church being in the neighborhood would necessarily make it a less lonesome spot. Believe me, dear Mr. McLean, it is not through a stubborn caprice that I was opposed going in the new school. I have just given the ten best years of my life to the welfare of Shishigwaming; this is a sufficient proof of my good will. But I have not the Indian nature, and I feared that a sojourn in the wilderness, added to the unparalleled ingratitude of the Indians, as shown every day, would turn me crazy.\n\nI would be greatly sorry to have appeared to dictate a line of conduct to your Department. I fought against the location in the bush, because I knew the majority was against it. You have been told that the whole Band had accepted it; and I know that your Department will listen to the report.\nof the Agent in preference to everyone else, but it is a sure fact that at the first meeting, Gabriel Niganivine, Ignatius Metategaiaask, Joseph Sampson, Frank Javenashi, Amable Wabigone, Andrew Wabigone, John Gaboni, Joseph Metategaiaask, Louis Okeda, Wilson Sampson, William Cook, Noel Dominic, Dan Niganivine, William Wakaosse, John Okeda, Alex Vincent, Antoine Wabigijig, Alex Wabigijig and Peter Okeda, were not invited. Little by little, the chief and his noisy clique worked such pressure over the timid others, that they tolerated the second and nearer spot chosen. \u2014 I do not mention this irreceivable fact to find fault with your decision, but simply to explain the strong stand I had taken.\n\nI can never be grateful enough for your kindness, Mr. M.

The builder is doing exceptionally good work considering the unskilled workmen employed. The enclosed pay rolls for October week No. 17290 completed the work up to bottom window on top story. I left them today and the walls are completed to the rafters and rafters will be put up tomorrow and a part of the gable put in as soon as the roof can be put on. It is intended to complete all the outside work if possible. The erection of the porch, finish coat on the cement wall outside entrance to cellar etc before the frost gets heavy.\n\nThe isolated place the school is in is costing slightly more for transportation than was anticipated but the arrangement made still gives the freight at least 140% less than the settlers are paying to the regular wharf 5 miles farther out the harbor.\n\nIt has been found that the measurements of the two flats do not correspond by about 6 inches the discrepancy was noted and corrected before any damage was done. The extra heavy fell timber ordered in the construction plans is making a very strong...\nSir,\n\nStructure there is practically no vibration of any part when the workmen are wheeling cement or other materials.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nK.

I will leave for the steamer in the morning and report from there Saturday morning if possible on the progress made thus far with the exception of last week all work has been done for considerably less than could have been done by a contractor. A revision of the cost of the materials will show in most cases a considerable reduction on cost of the local prices and the cement of best grade at first wholesale cost less the freight which is not usually allowed. There will be an overplus of cement nearly half a car. This will be taken over by Mr. Clark and in the item alone a big saving has been made by obtaining first costs prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The records show that accounts have been received from the Sheshagwaning School quarterly since that date for amounts approximating $6.25.\n\nAs the allowance of $6.25 per annum for each of these schools may be a little small the Department has decided to increase it to $10.00 and the teachers may, therefore, expend $2.50 at the end of each quarter for these prizes for distribution. You will be good enough to advise them accordingly and see that the accounts do not exceed this amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.

Work will be started in a few days to complete the building. I understand that an inspector would visit the building before its completion from Ottawa. It would be a very important point not to make any alterations or deviations from the specifications can be adjusted with very little trouble which would entail considerable expense later on.\n\nThe installation of the furnace, plumbing and materials used therein are now being examined and if there is an inspector available to lend up next week or at the latest the week after it would materially assist the agency here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6165, file 432-5, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM:-\n\nMr. Agent Thorburn asks that an officer of the Department be sent to Manitoulin Island to inspect the work on the new school and teacher's residence in course of erection at Sheshegwaning. The building is being put up by day labour and is nearing completion and should be examined before the plastering is done and the finished floors laid.\n\nAs no provision for a water supply in the building is made the bath and stationary washstand shown on the plans could be omitted and an old fashioned tin bath tub and washstand with enamelled chamber set be substituted. Mr. Chene, who prepared the plans, states \"As the plans of the Sheshegwaning School had to be prepared without any description of the ground where this building was to be erected no provision could be made on plans or specifications for the drainage of the basement and sewage water, but the same could easily be attended to before...\"\n\"before building is completed, if an officer would make the\n\"necessary inquiries as to the best and most economical\n\"arrangement to be considered for the completion of the\n\"work.\"\n\nMr. Agent Thorburn says the inspection\nshould be made now so that any alterations or deviations\nfrom the specifications could be adjusted with very little\ntrouble, which would entail considerable expense later on.\nHe no doubt refers to the upper flat, which is to be\nused for the teacher's quarters. The teacher may have\nsome suggestions to make as to the laying out of the\nrooms. Changes could be made now without additional\nexpense before the partitions are up and plastering done.\n\nAs neither Mr. Chene nor Mr. Ogilvie can\nleave the work they are now engaged on I might go on from\nBelleville next week and report on the work already done\nand see what changes or alterations in the interior arrange-\nment are necessary. I have gone carefully over the\nplans and specifications with Mr. Chene, who considers\nthat I would be quite competent to make the inspection.\nOttawa, May 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant reporting that the Sheshagwaning Indian School, now under construction, is nearing completion and asking that an officer be sent from the Department to inspect the work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Benson of this Department, who is going to Central Ontario, has been instructed to proceed west to Gore Bay next week and will reach there on Friday or Monday the 3rd proximo at the latest.

W. Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Act Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nSend June 13th\n\n[Handwritten number]\n1296\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nI reached Gere Bay by the \"City of Midland\" on Friday morning, the 31st ultimo. When I got there I found that Mr. Agent Therburn had been superseded by Mr. Frank Baxter. Mr. Baxter secured a gasoline launch and accompanied by Mr. Clarke, the foreman engaged by the Department for the erection of the school building at Sheshegwaning, we proceeded to Sheshegwaning, distant from Gere Bay some 26 miles by water and arrived there early in the afternoon. We called on Miss Duhamel, the teacher of the school.\n\nThere were ten children in attendance at the school, seven boys and three girls. I examined them and found them so shy that I could hardly make out what they were endeavouring to say. As I was anxious to visit the new school I got Miss Duhamel to dismiss the pupils and she accompanied us up the road back from the lake to the site of the new school.\n\nThe building is well under way and it is a most imposing structure, being built of concrete on a stone foundation, is 50 feet by 27 feet and is a story and a half high. The site is well chosen as to drainage and is about as central as can be had.\nhad. The lathing was all done and there is only the plastering and the laying of the hardwood floors needed to complete the interior of the building. Cement rendering had been completed on a portion of the outside walls to represent stone masonry and the remainder of the walls will be finished in the same manner. The sills were not placed, but single block concrete sills were ready to be put in position. The whole of the basement has a concrete floor and a large concrete tank has been built across the southwest corner of the building near the stairway.\n\nThe heating and ventilation plant was all in position and is thoroughly modern. The furnace installed is a McClarey furnace, 1904 model, No. 416a. On the first floor there is a large bath-room with stationary enamel tub and wash-stand and all modern appliances and connected with the tank in the basement by a force pump. The account of Jackson & Company, who did this work, would show that no expense has been spared in making a thoroughly up-to-date job.\n\nAll the material to complete the building is on hand except some lime to be used in the plastering. The lime supplied by the Indians Mr. Clarke did not consider was good enough quality to be used. I am attaching some prints which show the old and the new school buildings.\n\nThere were some slight changes made in the layout of the building for the convenience of the teacher and her assistant. The Oratory was reduced in size and a portion laid out for a dining-room.\ndining-room. A door was cut from the hallway into the school-room on the south side and the linen room was divided so as to leave sufficient closet room and to make another bed room.\n\nThe outside closets are well built and have concrete pits seven feet deep. They are not screened as the teacher and the Priest say they are better left open to view. They are placed one hundred feet back from the school. The whole of the ground is high and drains have been dug and tiled from the school building and closets and there is ample space for a good playground on the north side. The ground should be fenced when the building is completed.\n\nThere is an enrolment of 30 pupils at this school, which is about the full number of children of school age that could attend and the average for last year was 15. The school-room in the new building has seating capacity for 40 and could easily hold 10 more without overcrowding. I was forced to the conclusion that it is much in excess of the needs of the reserve. It is a very handsome and well constructed building, but too good for the place. It has cost up to the present time $4177.26. There are unpaid accounts amounting to $306.24 for the heating, plumbing and ventilating plant, in addition to which there will be the cost of the plasterers' wages as skilled workmen will have to be secured. I doubt if the whole building will be completed for less than $5000.00. $4500.00 was the estimated cost. The work so far has all been done by Indian labour under the guidance of\nof Mr. Clarke, who is a practical builder and contractor and a thoroughly competent man. I am surprised that Agent Thorburn should have recommended such an expensive building for this reserve, as a smaller and cheaper building would have answered the purpose and would not have looked out of place. The old school and residence is more in keeping with its surroundings.\n\nMartin Benson\nPoor. Copy\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think the building is well finished but think that it would be better to have an inspector examine the building before it is fitted for use.\n\nA. W. Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Hon.

Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Chief Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the Sheshawang school is badly in need of a well on the school grounds under the present conditions. The teacher has to carry all water for domestic purposes about a quarter of a mile.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. W. Baxter\nIndian agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary\nDept of Indians affairs\nOttawa\nSheshigwaning\nMorrisville\nOct. 31, 1912\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRespected Sir:\n\nI waited till we were settled in the new school to write to thank you for it and for the comfort so kindly afforded us. I received the keys of the school Sept. 26th and moved into it on the 27th. I cannot adequately express my gratitude to you, knowing as I do, the many annoyances which you have had to bear and which may continue for some time.\n\nI heartily thank you for your firmness in not heeding the false and antagonistic reports which you have received at different times, in regard to the school. Your experience in dealing with the Indians no doubt restrained you from yielding to\nthese few malcontents, as their example might be followed by such people in other places. I should not, perhaps, refer to the subject since you have not requested me to do so; but I feel it my duty to inform you that nine children of the troublesome party of five families, are not in school; one of these is not quite six years of age and two are nearly fifteen; these last will probably not go to school again. Will the others be allowed to grow up ignorant? I do not think you will tolerate it. Five of these were in school before and did very well indeed, for the time they were here, and the complaints are groundless.\n\nI regret that the school Inspector has not been here this fall; I trust he may yet come; first to see the work done by the children, also to note several defects in the new building. I might mention one which I find most important: All the windows are made to open only from the bottom; the top can be moved only\nby breaking a strip which keeps in\nand which, the men say, is inserted\n\u00bd in. into the frame. The Agent came\nthis week. I had a man at work\ntaking out a side strip and sand-\npapering the varnish off the bottom\nsash; the windows were not opened after\nthe woodwork was varnished but were\nlet dry closed. Mr. Baxter suggested sav-\ning that strip which keeps the top part\nin but he said it would have to be\nput in again and taken out every time\nwe wash the windows. The man was\nafraid to attempt it and preferred to\nwash the outside of the tops for us, as\nwe cannot reach. I doubt if the De-\npartment will approve hiring a man\nevery time we wash windows.\n\nMr. Baxter told me that you have\nwritten to him regarding a well; I shall be most\ngrateful if it can be dug before\nwinter. At present, we have fire in the\nfurnace only a part of the day, it\ntakes at least three pails of water;\nyou may reckon from that how\nmuch will be required when we have\nfire all day. It takes fully fifteen\nminutes to go to the nearest well for water, and it is the poorest of roads in winter.\n\nThe children are doing well in school. I received the supply for the cooking and sewing class only two weeks ago, but we had these lessons regularly since the reopening of school. I had some print with which the girls made aprons; they are now crocheting mittens for themselves and for the boys. When these are finished, they will make dresses, then shirts.\n\nMost gratefully yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Ducharme.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo stating that the Sheshewaning School is badly in need of a well.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if you can obtain a reasonable price per foot for sinking a well you may have this matter attended to at once. When a suitable supply of water is struck the well should be covered and a pump placed in position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo stating that Miss Duhamel, teacher of the Sheshegwaning School, has asked to have an Indian hired to look after the firing of the furnace during the winter months.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow $4.00 a month for this service and you are hereby authorized to engage a reliable Indian to perform this work during the winter months.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Duhamel, in which she states that some Indians are keeping their children away from school. The Department thinks it would be well to appoint a truant officer to see that the children are sent regularly to the school and you may engage a reliable Indian to perform the duties of truant officer, which are defined in sections 9 and 10 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. Probably the man selected to act as caretaker might assume this additional duty, for which he will be paid an extra wage of $25.00 a year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. W.

McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nMr. R. J. MacKenzie\n\nRespected Sir:\n\nYour very kind letter of the 22nd received yesterday.\n\nThe cheque for the sum of seventy-six (76) dollars which you mention, was received by Joseph McKategaishk on March 10th. This is not the account of which I spoke to you. Not having wood enough for the furnace, I asked for fifteen cords more. Mr. Agent Baxter not acting, I thought it best to write to Mr. Parker who came to Shoegwanning in February, and who knew we really needed the wood. The Department, as usual, answered promptly. Just at that time the Indians were making ties on the Reserve, and were not anxious to cut the wood unless I promised to pay, because it took so long to get the cheque from the Department. I agreed to advance the money and Joseph McKategaishk again took the contract, he got several men to help, so the fifteen cords were brought in a few days.\nMr. Baxter happened to be in Skeeshog during and at the school when Joseph brought the last load, I made out the account, had it signed, and gave it to Mr. Baxter who promised to forward it to the Department at once. As I have not my diary here, I cannot give you the exact date of the account; it was either March 28th or April 4th. Joseph was to give me the cheque when he received it.\n\nIt might be as well for me to mention the other accounts due. One, three and five dollars for work done by Wilson Sampson\u2014putting up window shades. The Agent brought them only in spring though they were in Gore Bay since last fall. I did not write an account for this amount, for the Agent told me that he would send the account to the Department himself. I do not know if he sent it in Wilson Sampson's name or mine; he knew that I paid it.\n\nI have received no money for caretaking of the classroom (sweeping, etc.) since last October, for the September quarter. When we moved into the new school, last September I told the Agent I thought the caretaking of the school was worth more than twelve dollars a year, this one being so much larger than the old school; he said that\ntwenty dollars had been granted for the West Bay school and he thought the same amount would be given us. He said he would write to the Department about it, but never gave me a definite answer. In March, the girl who did the sweeping wanted to stop because she had not received any money yet, so I paid her for the December and March quarters and did the same at the end of June and sent the account in my name.\n\nAnother account is for caretaking of the furnace. Mr. Baxter told me, last fall, that the Department would allow four dollars a month for that work. I could not depend on an Indian to do the work, I would have had to look after him, as well, so I preferred to do it with the aid of Miss Lutz who was staying with me and to get help when it was necessary. I sent in the account of this in Miss Lutz's name, for five months, although we had to have fire in the furnace much longer.\n\nI will give you, as you kindly requested, a list of the furniture we need:\n\n1 single iron bedstead with spring mattress\n12 day chairs, I would be pleased to have one of these, a rocker.\n\n1 long handled brush to wash windows (the top sash of the windows cannot be moved. I would be grateful if they could be put on pulleys.)\nAlso 2 rollers for window shades. I have not the measurements here, but I think rollers in windows of ordinary width will do, as they are not for the widest windows.\n\nThanking you most sincerely for your prompt and thoughtful attention, I am,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Duhamel.\nOttawa August 2, 1913\n\nSir,-\n\nBefore the Sheeshawaning school re-opens certain articles of furniture for the teacher's quarters are needed. You will be good enough to purchase the following articles at once:\n\nOne single iron bedstead with spring and mattress\n5 plain chairs\n1 rocker\n1 long handled brush for washing windows,\n2 rollers for window shades,\n\nThese articles must be in the school before the re-opening in September.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

They are for amounts which she has paid but has not yet received from the department. Miss Dubanet had sent the bills and asked for furniture and supplies through Mr. Baxter but received neither money nor supplies. She said she explained the whole matter to Mr. MacKenzie while at Creelp last month.\n\nAt the same time she spoke of several necessary improvements, such as having the school grounds fenced in, having a well dug, repairing several leaks in the roof of the new house, also leaks in cellar wall.\n\nShe also spoke of considerable trouble with the furnace as it does not heat well.\nand smoker.\n\nThe plots for children's playgrounds have not been cleared yet. Also, the plot for the school garden ought to be cleared and ploughed this fall. Much of the place needs levelling.\n\nNone of the windows in the classroom can be lowered from the top. Both yesterday and today the wind was too high to allow for lowering a window raised from bottom.\n\nThere were several other items Miss Hinkamell said she had spoken of to Mr. Baxter but I do not remember them. I am including a list of the materials she asked for and another of those which I would like.\n\nAs I intend giving tea or soup each day to pupils bringing lunch I would like a dozen of cups instead of the two on first list. Instead of 2\u00bd lbs. each of flax & grey yarn, I would be grateful for 1 lb. of each of these and 5 lbs. of black worsted fingering as I wish to teach knitting stockings.\nIf the Dept. wishes me to teach manual training as I did at South Bay, the tools and lumber on requisition will be needed. Also I prefer blank drawing books to the sheets asked for by Miss Duhamel.\n\nI have sent, a few days ago, a requisition in duplicate, same as the one enclosed, to Mr. Baxter at Gore Bay. But since Miss Duhamel had trouble in getting supplies I thought best to send one also direct to the Dept. as I am anxious to have some of the books as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you in advance, I am\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lewis,\nTeacher.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSupplies asked for in April.\n\n1 globe 12\"\n1 set of maps in case\n2 drinking cups - agate\n\nSupplies asked for in June.\n\n1 box chalk\n2 state pencils\n2 dog lead\n1 box pine\n1 qr. footcap\n2 dog sheets drawing paper\n14 copy books\n12 scribblers\n3 bars soap\n4 yds travelling\n1 piece flannellette\n2 1/2 lbs. blue, 2 1/2 lbs. gray yarn\n1 bag white sugar\n1 flour\n1 pair card\n6 chairs - one to be a rocker\nbrick & pencil crayons\n2 paper needles\n6 spools thread\n1 iron bedstead with spring mattress\n1 long-handled brush to clean windows\n2 rollers for window shades.\n\nStationery on May\nOttawa, September 26, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing accounts for sums owing to the late teacher of the Sheshegwaning school, Miss Duhamel.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque will be sent to Miss Duhamel for the amount involved.\n\nWith regard to your requisition the stationery asked for will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office, with the exception of the case of maps, which cannot very well be sent in. Kindly state the maps that you have already in the school and those that are needed in addition. Mr. Agent McLeod will be asked to purchase the other articles.\n\nThe Department is not prepared just at the present time to send in for you the manual training outfits and the dumbbells, but, should conditions warrant it, the matter might be favourably considered at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Eaton Company, was not made by me; I did not order those goods nor did I receive them. It may be that Miss Lewis, present teacher at Shestegnaming, ordered these for the September quarter.\n\nThe account still due me, which I mentioned some time ago, was also for goods purchased from the J. Eaton Company, it was white lawn I bought for the June quarter rewards, it amounted to two and four (2.43) I wrote to Mr. Agent Baxter asking him to forward the account to the Department, evidently he has not done so.\n\nI will take this opportunity to thank the Department for the generous assistance.\nto continue the sewing and domestic science classes. The girls are very anxious for lessons, but everything is at a stand still at present. You doubtless have been informed that by order of the Health Officer, on account of smallpox, the Reserve is quarantined and school closed. It is to be regretted that this precaution was not taken several weeks ago. The Indians have a great fear of the disease, the attendance at school has consequently been poor the past month.\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that we have at last moved into the dwelling as kindly prepared for us by the Department. It has been difficult to obtain good laborers; then too, our stove came only last Thursday. The work at the school is not finished because the desks are not all here yet. I trust everything will be ready when we re-open school.\n\nMost sincerely,\n\nAd\u00e8le Duchesne\nSheshawangan, Ont.\nThomisville P.O.\nOct. 7, 1913.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter No. 157713/5 of the 26th inst., I beg to say that we have a map of Canada and a small map of Manitoulin Island in use. There is also a good 6 ft. map of Ontario but as there are only two 5 ft. spaces for maps we cannot hang this one. The spaces between the windows are 3 ft.\n\nI would be grateful for a map each of the World on Mercator's Projection, Ontario, United States and Europe. If they could be mounted on spring rollers and portable board mounting they might be hung one above the other or above the blackboard.\n\nI am sorry the Department is not prepared to send the manual training outfit as I have always\nfound it a great help to the boys both because it makes them more useful at home and gives them more interest in work at school.\n\nThe girls have cooking every Wednesday and sewing, knitting etc on Friday while the poor boys have nothing.\n\nNothing has been done towards clearing playgrounds and garden plots. The children have no good spot except the road to play. I hope the work can be done this fall.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nElizabeth Lewis,\nTeacher.\n\nL. D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nYour letter of the 26th ult. came only today. I intended to write to you before but as I did not remember your full name and was afraid the letter might go astray I directed it to the Secretary. Part of the stationery came today and also a letter from Mr. McLeod saying that he had shipped the bed, chairs etc.\n\nI had a letter from Mr. McLean a week ago saying that the Department would not send the manual training outfit nor the dumbbells. I am sorry because I find the work a great help to the boys.\n\nSome of the South Bay boys did quite a bit of work at home after having learned how at school.\n\nAs to the dumbbells, they give exercise in calisthenics and play at the same time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOct. 11, 1913\ntime. Besides, the grown people like very much to watch their children perform with. Whenever I have the bells we use them at every school entertainment.\n\nWinter is fast approaching and our furnace is not in working order. I have let a fire several cool mornings. All the heat goes upstairs and very little in the class-room. There are four registers in the back of the room almost seven feet from the floor. If they were evenly distributed and near the floor it would be better.\n\nOne pipe runs along the end of the blackboard to the room upstairs. It is just above the furnace and throws out much heat. A register in that would give good heat in the class-room as we do not need heat upstairs, at least not much, during the day. Vampers in the pipe leading upstairs would also be a great help towards heating the class-room.\n\nI am giving you this detailed\nexplanation because I know you have not seen this school and it might be hard to know just what is wanted.\n\nMr. Burtie promised to come some weeks ago to have the playgrounds and school-garden plots cleared but we have not heard from him since. The chief here seems to be a very good man. Perhaps he could be trusted with the work. He is as anxious as I am to have the work done this fall as the men have time whereas in spring they will have their farming to attend to.\n\nWe would also be very grateful for a well as walking almost \u00bc mile through the snow next winter will not be very pleasant task.\n\nThe chief thought I might mention also that he would also like three other wells on the reserve, one in the village and two on the farms. He said he asked for them in a letter to the Dept. last week.\nThere is no fence around the school-\ngrounds yet.\n\nI am enclosing the bills for prizes\nfor this quarter as I do not know to\nwhom to send them. The prizes came\nonly yesterday. I will give them on\nMonday.\n\nI hope I am not boring you with\nthis long list of wants. I know you\nare interested in the schools and will\nunderstand.\n\nThanking you Mr. MacKenzie for\nall your kindness. I remain,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nElizabeth Lewis,\nTeacher.\n\nA. J. MacKenzie, Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, October 29, 1913.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to let the Department have particulars as to size, price, etc., of the map cases supplied by your firm.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThe Geo. M. Hendry Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto, Ont. Nov. 1st, 1913.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n-- RE YOUR NO. 151713/5 --\n\nReplying to your favor of the 29th ult., we are pleased to give you a description and prices of our Map Cases, such as we supply to schools, and also such as we make up for Office and Commercial use.\n\nUnder separate cover, we are mailing you a copy of our catalogue, and on page 1 you will find a Johnston spring roller Map Case. This is a strongly made case, box style, with panelled lid. At the present time the stock we have has lids of three panels, instead of two, as illustrated. This case is made to accommodate maps of the Grand Series, 50 inches in length, such as you order for your schools. The case will hold any number of maps up to 8. The price is $5.00 for a case, and when the maps are fitted in the case, an additional charge of 50\u00a2 per map is made for the spring roller and fitting.\n\nThis case is made up 1000 or more at a time, which enables us to sell it at such a moderate price.\n\nFor longer maps, and up to 84 inches in length, which includes our map of Canada, we supply the Imperial Map case, as listed at the bottom of page 3 of the catalogue, to hold 4, 6 or 8 maps. These cases are similar in style to the Johnston map case but are proportionately longer. These are made either for Imperial maps 72 inches long or so as to include the map of Canada 84 inches long, at the same prices, which are as follows:\n\n| Imperial Box Map Case | for 4 maps | $8.50 |\n|-----------------------|-----------|------|\n|                       | \" 6 \"     | 10.50|\n|                       | \" 8 \"     | 13.00|\n\nShould you wish cases for Office use, we would refer you to page 2, for our special Imperial Case, which is made up to order as required, for 6, 8 or more maps. These cases are strongly made of solid oak, well finished in any color to match the trim.\nof an office. A neat moulding surrounds the cap of the case, and the same style of moulding is used that will match the trim of the room in which the case is to be hung. The price of this case to hold six maps is $25.00, or 8 maps $30.00., exclusive of the spring rollers.\n\nIf desired, we make this style of case up in any other kind of wood, such as birch mahogany, or genuine mahogany, at prices depending upon specifications.\n\nKindly let us know if this gives you the information you desire, and if you have in mind the supplying of cases to your Indian Schools.\n\nAny further information that you wish, will be gladly given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcK/WS.\n\nTHE GEO.

I waited until Christmas, but as lately there has been a smell of scorching wood I did not think it safe to wait any longer.\n\nNearly all the heat of the furnace went to the bath-room upstairs. I made an opening in this pipe so as to allow this heat.\nto go to the class-room.\n\nThere being no register I had to close an opening in a room that is not used much and use this register in the class-room.\n\nOn the 30th of December I went to see Mr. Baxter at Rose Bay and told him what I had done. He asked me to make all the repairs needed about the school, that he would come in a week or two to get an account of my time.\n\nMr. Baxter said there was a check damper needed in the furnace so I made one.\n\nA great deal of heat left the class-room, especially on\nwindy days so I made a trap door for the ventilator. The furnace pipes came apart a number of times in several places. I made them secure by bracing them with wooden supports.\n\nThe grate of the furnace was cracked in two places and was in danger of falling so I repaired it.\n\nAs the school grounds have not yet been cleared and the children had no place to play I cleared a small strip on which they could slide.\n\nHaving not the proper tools for some of the work it took me a long time to do it.\nI have worked 5 days and would like $2 a day. As Mr. Baxter has not come yet I thought it best to send the report to the Department direct.

W. Baxter\nIndian agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSpanish, Ont.,\nJuly 3, 1914.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014I regret to be again obliged to remind you of a small sum due me by the Department of Indian Affairs, $2.50 and 75 cents, ($3.25) for reserve school quarter, 1913. I wrote to Mr. Agent Baxter, Gore Bay, three times, twice last fall and once this spring, but received no answer. He knows I have nothing to show for it, as I sent him the bill from Eaton's, Toronto, twenty-seven yards lawn at nine cents per yard, last July.\n\nYou no doubt have received my report of the Wikwemikong Day School. I think many parents do not understand the necessity of sending their children to school regularly. The girls of the Domestic Science class did very well, staying after school, one hour twice a week, for it. The weekly cooking lessons were given by Miss Laplante, the\nThe lady who is staying with me during school.\n\nThe school garden is quite nice considering the ground and the dry weather we had. Several brought home radishes different times these last three weeks; the lettuce was also ready for use. If nothing happens to the vegetables during the holidays, we hope to have a good crop in the fall.\n\nI did not go to Guelph for the second year's course; having been in the hospital all winter, I had no time to read the books required.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Ducharme.\nOttawa, December 5, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with regard to the furnace in the Sheshgwaning School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your having the changes you suggest made for the purpose of heating the class-room and you will be good enough to have this attended to at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She states she furnished you with the account which she received from Eaton's Store in Toronto, and that although she gave it to you last July she has heard nothing further in the matter.

One of the walls in the basement is defective and admits the water. This could be remedied.\n\n3. A well is badly needed as the pupils have to carry water a long way.\n\nDate of Inspection,- October 2nd, 1914.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir: You did quite right to deduct from my salary for the September Quarter, the sum of twelve and five dollars which I still owed on the money so kindly advanced to me by the Department in July, 1913. I was about to write to tell you this when I received your letter.\n\nAs I closed my accounts during the holidays, I found that I sent the Department the bill for rewards for the September Quarter, 1913, twice\u2014in October, 1913, and again in June last, and both times received the sum of two and five dollars. Therefore, I did not send the bill for the rewards for the last September Quarter, but got the rewards just the same.\n\nYou wrote me last July that you had written Mr. Baxter, Indian Agent at Gore Bay, for a voucher for the small amount due me for rewards for the June Quarter, 1913, for the Shechequoming School. He evidently has not sent it and probably will not, at this late date. I shall not trouble you again by mentioning the fact, for if it depends on him, I shall not get it. He has ignored...\nthe different letters I wrote him on the subject. His oft repeated negligence are worthy of note.\n\nThe new floor in the classroom is finished and is very nice; before the men began the work, I asked the agent if the floor was to be oiled; he said he feared he would not have enough money, so I had the school boys take up the desks which were screwed to the old floor and take them out of the room. I also made them take out the old lumber, to save the men's time; but I asked the agent for linseed oil and I oiled the floor with the help of the boys; we also painted the new cupboard. The work is not quite finished, as soon as the agent sends window fasteners, the men will come one day more.\n\nI am very grateful to the Department for granting me an assistant; I expect Miss Kelly early this week.\n\nThe children, I think, are doing very well; on account of the large number, I had to give sewing and crocheting lessons after school twice a week. The girls have each a pair of mittens finished; five are now crocheting wristlets to send to the Patriotic League, Little Current, for the Canadian soldiers. Last Thursday, at the usual lesson, we cut under skirts and under garments for all the girls. When these are finished the girls will make shirts for the boys.\nI will begin the sewing class for the ex-pupils as soon as harvest work is over.\n\nIn spite of difficulties in spring, the school garden was quite a success. From one bag of potatoes which we planted, we got eleven bags. All those who had gardens took home radishes, lettuce and carrots all summer; this fall, each had about one half bag of turnips, beets, etc. The little ones of the general garden had a good share of corn, beets and turnips to take home. We try at the cooking lesson, to make use of the garden things; thus, for one lesson the girls had to shell beans, cut corn off the cobs and make soup. They also made pickles with small musk melons and radish pods, and all took a bottle home. This week they will make citron preserves, and take some home; they have also made tomato preserves. The parents greatly appreciate these lessons.\n\nI wish to thank you, also for the increase in my salary.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Dubuc.\nOttawa, October 23, 1914.\n\nMadam\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant reporting the result of your gardening operations at the Wikwemikong School during the past season, which were very satisfactory.\n\nWith regard to the small amount due you for prizes given in 1913 when you were teaching the Sheshegwaning Day School and the account for which you state Mr. Baxter has failed to send in I beg to say that his attention will be called to this matter and he will be instructed to forward the account at once.\n\nI may also inform you that Mr. Agent McLeod called the Department's attention to the shortage in the amount of the cheque sent you for the September quarter, as through an oversight he was not informed that $12.50 was deducted on account of the advance for expenses attending summer course at the Guelph Agricultural College. The Department is now writing him explaining the reason for the deduction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nMiss Adele Duhamel,\nTeacher,\nWikwemikong Day School,\nWikwemikong, Ont.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nOttawa, October 23, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss Duhamel claims that there is a small amount due her for money expended for prizes in the June quarter of 1913 while she was teacher of the Sheeshewaning School. She says that this account was sent you for transmission to the Department. If this is so you will be kind enough to certify it as to its correctness and forward it to the Department at once, when payment will be made. You will be good enough to attend to this matter at once, as Miss Duhamel should not be kept out of her money any longer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOttawa October 26th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a recent report on the Sheeshewnaning R.C. School, Inspector J.F. Finn states that the following supplies are required: - 2 brooms, 6 cups, 1 looking-glass and 4 yds. towelling. Kindly purchase these articles for use at this school.\n\nThe Inspector also reports that one of the basement walls is defective and admits water. You will be good enough to have this repaired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.W. Baxter, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSheringham, Oct.\nOct. 30, 1914\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe work of drilling the well at the Roman Catholic school was begun yesterday and I am most grateful to the Department for it. Some of our Indians though are very much disappointed to find that only the schools are to have wells and several have asked me to intercede for them with the Department.\n\nOur chief, Wilson Sampson, told me last year that he had asked for three wells for the Indians and expected that they would be dug when the ones at the schools were.\n\nMany of these people live a great deal farther from the water than we do. From my first coming here I have tried in every way to encourage our people.\nto build on farms. William Cook has just finished a house and Raphael Riggiwina is just beginning one on a farm, or rather what is to become a farm. Several others already living on farms have to come through the village to the bay for all their water. The distance from water is a great drawback to farm life here.\n\nIf the department could have several wells dug at centres where several families could easily reach them it would be a great help. The men who are doing the drilling of our wells expect to remain about two weeks, so if the Department see fit to have more work done they might be glad to have it done while the drill is here.\n\nThanking you for any favor you may bestow on our Indians, I remain,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\nElizabeth Dewar\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 6, 1914.\n\nMadam\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to drilling wells on the Sheshegwaning Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Agent has been instructed to get a resolution and have two wells drilled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would be grateful to know if there is any danger of the water becoming contaminated.\n\nA hole had been started at a greater distance but the Indians employed did not like taking out large stones to get to the rock so abandoned the place. Two other Indians dug the second hole and struck rock in a short time. They claim that if they had worked on at the first hole they would as easily reached the rock.\n\nIf there is no danger of drainage from the closet the second spot is as good as the first but it would be...\na pity to have the well spoiled when it could be avoided.\n\nThe rock is about 10 feet from the surface and no drilling has yet been done.\n\nHoping that if it is necessary, you will order the sight for the well changed.

I may say that since writing you the Department has received a voucher for the wood, but the other accounts have not reached Head-quarters.\n\nIt is desired that you will proceed to Gore Bay without delay, and that when there you will not only attend to the matter of accounts, but that you will make investigation with regard to expenditure incurred on the old church building which has been converted into a school house. I may say that the agent has exceeded the authorized expenditure on this building by $337.00. I have also to inform you that the Department has recently written Mr. Baxter informing him that if replies are not received by the 20th of the month to certain official letters, his neglect in attending to his official duties will be brought to the attention of the Minister.\n\nDEPT.

But on re-considering the matter, I find\nit too unjust to let it pass. Has not Mr. Baxter answered your request? It seems to me that such a letter should have been like an order to him, and he should not have allowed himself the liberty to overlook it. If you will kindly look up your accounts for the June Quarter, 1913, you will find that the sum promised for rewards was not sent me for that quarter. I am sure you will see how unfair it is to make a teacher lose, no matter how small an amount, because of the unfaithfulness of an agent to forward a bill which was duly sent to him.\n\nTrusting you will not be annoyed at my repeated, but just request, I am,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nAd\u00e8le Ducharme.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 27/11/191\n\nMr Benson,\n\nSee your letter of 23rd October last.

On the 20th of December I gave Mr. Baxter duplicates of the other three bills enclosed. I am forwarding these to you in case that he has not sent the others.\n\nMr. Baxter has been very careless lately. I have been obliged to write several times to the Department about supplies I had asked for but not received.\nHe brought nearly all a few days ago but the pump in the bath-room and the repairs of the plaster have not yet been attended to.\n\nBut the money, just now, is the most important. I have been obliged to advance some to keep us he could not wait so long.\n\nAll at the school goes on as usual. Last week the children gave an entertainment which Father Capricorn, Mr. Baxter as well as the Indians found good.\n\nDistribution of prizes took place at the same time. Instead of having prizes for September quarter we have both at Christmas. The children choose what they wish for from the catalogue. They enjoy it very much. I have done this the past five years and find it good.\n\nHoping that I am not giving you, dear Mrs. Macdonald, too much trouble, remain\n\nWith best wishes for the New Year,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lenzel.\nShealigwaring, Ont.\nJan. 31, 1916\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nLast mail brought me your kind letter and also Noel Dominic's cheque for $30.60 and John Simon's for $2.20.\n\nI am very grateful for all especially to you for your great kindness in seeing to the matter at once.\n\nThrough my fault there was, however, an error made. I had put Noel's bill for $17.05 of July and the one of September for $15. on the same sheet of paper. The one of September was overlooked.\n\nHis cheque of $30.60 pays July bill of $17.05 for work done last spring and December bill of $13.55 for work done upstairs and at his house.\nThe bill of $15. for clearing bare fall grounds still remains unpaid.\n\nI am very sorry I caused this extra work and disorder in the accounts by not using an separate sheet for each bill but as I had sent duplicates several times of these bills I did not think it necessary.\n\nAgain thanking you, dear Mr. MacKenzie for your great kindness,\n\nI remain,\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Leuck.\n\nA.

There is a well cleared space on this side for athletic purposes and swings are erected, the cleared space is quite ample for the present and much more spacious than is usually found around a schoolhouse in the country. I think the pupils and some of the fathers should be interested enough and see by example what can be done, to do any more.\nmore clearing that may be necessary and I cannot recommend the expenditure annually but would recommend that $15.00 be allowed for this year.\n\nA lawn mower is necessary and Rev. Papineau has loaned one to the teacher which he is willing to sell, Miss Leusch informed me. She thought it worth $5.00 but I think $5.00 would be a fair and reasonable price for it and I would recommend purchasing it at this price, ($5.00). Miss Leusch said Department had authorized her to have someone care for garden during vacation, but I would suggest that Noel Dominic be paid for cutting the lawn and the Indians look after the garden plots themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are four Registers in School room and as they are from 30 to 50 feet long and run that distance on a dead level it is needless to say they never heated anything and never will, these Registers are 7 ft from floor and two of them extend to upstairs and serve as ventilators to carry the foul air to the dwelling, the upstairs heats all right, the cold air pipes are not large enough for capacity of hot air pipes, and one takes the cold air from the lobbies and is twin part to furnaces, the one is used principally for a cuspidor for the pupil tobacco chewers.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the foregoing, I have to request that you will explain why the Department is requested to make payment to the amount of $11.03.

The desks we supply are the ordinary single school desks. We have never furnished any of our schools with the \"Moulthrop\" type of desk. You should take this matter up with your local Indian Agent, and if he recommends that desks be supplied, we will be prepared to favourably consider the furnishing of same. It would be necessary, however, to state the sizes of the desks required and the number of each size. I enclose a page from the catalogue of the Globe Furniture Co.

If desks are to be ordered, care should be taken to see that the number and quantity of each number required are stated.

You should report as to what you would advise having done to have the painting and repairs carried out, also the probable cost of any work recommended by you.\n\nThe teacher some time ago asked that 21 single movable chair desks be supplied. We obtained prices for this number, but owing to the cost, informed her that we were not prepared to supply this type of desk. We stated, however, that if they were absolutely necessary, we would furnish 21 single desks of the ordinary type, and we asked her to take this matter up with you. The Inspector recommends that this number of desks be supplied. If you consider they are necessary, you should forward a requisition from the teacher for the sizes required and the number of each size.

School be painted, the Contractor could, no doubt, paint the class room at the R.C. school at Sheshgwaning, being on the ground and having his appliances there, or it might be possible to have it done by the Indians under my direction. It is not in a very bad state but might be considered necessary to have it done viz., the ceiling and walls painted and wainscoting varnished, the ceilings are high and would make the work slow and would probably cost $50, including cloak rooms.\n\nRegarding new desks I would advise that there are there now 9 No.3; 5 No.4; and 2 No.5 double desks, all but one in first class condition, one having one seat off and can only accommodate one pupil, these with a coat of varnish stain and some new ink wells would be as good as new, but Miss Burke would like single desks and has made requisition for 3 No.3; 11 No.4; & 6 No.5.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, July 11th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the painting of the classroom of the Sheeshewaning R.C. Indian Day School. It is noted that the ceiling and walls should be painted and the wainscoting varnished, and that the cloak-room should be painted, and the desks given a coat of varnish stain.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should purchase the paint and other materials required at the time you make the purchase of the materials for the Anglican school. The work should also be performed by Indian labour, and proper time sheets of the labour employed should be kept. This work should be completed during the present summer holidays, and should be carried out under your supervision and finished to your satisfaction. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of the material used, and time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed should also be forwarded. No undue expenditure should be incurred, and the cost should be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nWe consider that the desks at present in the school should be sufficient for the purpose. We are not prepared at the present time to supply the single desks asked for by the teacher. If you will state the name of the manufacturer of the double desks, we will then be able to place an order for ink wells of the size to suit the desks.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to arrange to have the painting required carried out at both this school and the Anglican school at a very reasonable cost.\n\nA supply of time sheets for the labour employed is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C. School. September 12, 1923.\n\nThere is no woodshed at this school. Don't you think one should be built? The wood becomes so wet in the fall and winter that a woodshed is a necessity.\n\nIt appears as if the rain had entered through the roof. Upstairs plaster is marked with it. It might be looked into before it is too late. If it was my own house I would certainly attend to it.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInsp.\nOttawa, Sept. 21st, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School, recommends that a woodshed be built for the use of the school. He states that the wood becomes so wet in the fall and winter that a woodshed is a necessity. I shall be pleased if you will state your views regarding this matter, and if you think that a woodshed should be erected, you should state the approximate size and type of building you would recommend, and the probable cost of the same. This matter should receive your prompt attention, in order that, if it is decided to put up a building, the work can be done before the cold weather sets in.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the rain has entered through the roof of the teacher's living quarters, and the upstairs plaster is marked with it. He states that repairs to the roof are urgently needed, in order to prevent further damage to the plaster. You will be good enough to see that the roof is placed in good condition in order to prevent leakage. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred for the purpose, and this matter should receive your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 21st instant re woodshed at R.C.School, Sheshegwaning, I beg to advise that I have taken up the matter of same with Miss O'Driscoll, and she would like one built next Spring, as the winter wood for kitchen is nicely piled convenient to back door and she would not want to go to the expense of moving it into the wood shed when built, but if built next Spring the new wood could be piled in when split.\n\nThe furnace wood could not be placed in it as it is too far from cellar entrance.\n\nI would consider that a shed 12x16 would be large enough for the kitchen wood, would advise that it be built on cedar sills so next teacher could have it moved if she wishes, as it cannot be built at rear close to building, owing to kitchen and dining room windows, so would have to be detached.\n\nAs regards cost it is difficult getting lumber there but it could be cut at Meldrum Bay this winter and teamed down and sills could also be got on the ground during the winter all being done cheaper during sleighing. I could not at the present time give an estimate of cost, but it being small would not run into much money, almost impossible to get shingles there but roofing could be used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, September 29th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, regarding the building of a woodshed at the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange next spring to have a woodshed of the dimensions considered necessary erected on a location suitable for the convenience of the school. This shed may be built on cedar sills, and you can arrange, during the coming winter, to have them cut and delivered at the school. While a woodshed of a type suitable to meet the requirements should be erected, the work should be done and the material supplied at the lowest possible price. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the building erected early next spring, to be of a size to meet the requirements. A lock should be put on the door, the key of which should be kept by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that, unless you consider this woodshed is absolutely required, you should not undertake the work of building the same. If, however, it is necessary, only an inexpensive building for the purpose should be erected.\n\nYour recommendation that both the Roman Catholic and Anglican Schools be closed on account of the small attendance, and the children placed in residential schools, has been noted. It would, no doubt, be difficult to close the Roman Catholic School, and it will have to be continued in operation for some time. Regarding the Anglican School, the Department is communicating with His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma with a view to having him consent to its closing and having the children placed in the Shingwauk Home. As soon as a reply is received from His Grace, you will be advised regarding the decision reached in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. R.

We note that this lamp will cost approximately $10. You may also purchase and have supplied a small quantity of a good grade of gasoline, to be used in the lamp. Care should be taken by the teacher in the storage of this gasoline.

I am unable to ascertain why the change was made. From 1910, a part of the salary and also some other current expenses (approximately 50% of the total cost of conducting the school) were paid from Appropriation, until the fiscal year 1919-20, when all the salary was paid from the Band Funds. Again, I can find no reason for the change in practice.

If they are his property it is considered that he should pay for the work which was done. If the tools belong to the school it would seem that the pupils using them should be taught to sharpen them and make necessary repairs. It is usual for this to be done by pupils taking a Manual Training course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.B. McLean),\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of 24th instant re sharpening tools for R.C. Scheel, Sheshegwaning I beg to advise that the tools &c. are the property of the Scheel and while the boys can use stone to keep an edge on the chisels, planes &c., still in time they become rounded and they are too small to trip them up, even if they had a grindstone and as far as sharpening drawing knife, saws, spokeshave &c. they cannot do it and Miss Hickey could hardly be expected to do it. The handles they could, no doubt, put on but Mr. Johnstone purchased them and put them on for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR'S REPORT ON THE SHESHGWAN-\nING INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, MAY 13, 1925.\n\nFor the first time in my visit here I nearly stumbled going up the stairs and then discovered the reason. Each step is a ten inch one in height when the average is 4\". I cannot see how ladies can regularly use these without finally injuring their health. The landing room upstairs is used for an exhibit room, and for germinating and growing early vegetables. Both pupils and teacher use these stairs. I would recommend that 6\" stairs be made as soon as possible.\n\nKitchen might be painted in colors asked by teacher. The stairs should be attended to.\n\nThe present kitchen stove has been in use for 18 years at least and is not good for baking. I would suggest a modern range and allow the teachers to suggest the kind they want.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 22, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School, recommends that the kitchen be painted, in colours as chosen by the teacher, and that a modern range be supplied - the teacher to be allowed to suggest the kind she wants.\n\nPlease report whether you would recommend that the kitchen be painted and a range provided. If so, you should state the approximate cost of the material and labour required in painting the kitchen and the cost of a range.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 22nd instant re range and painting at Sheshegwaning R.C.School, I beg to advise that the teacher and housekeeper are perfectly satisfied with the cookstove they have and it is in good condition, sometime in the future it will require a cross piece for the top but it is all right so far.\n\nThe teacher would like the Murexce taken off the kitchen and walls and ceiling painted and the cost would not be very much as work can be done with Indian labor. The ceiling is high and scaffolding would have to be built. The work not to be done until after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, May 30th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to the range and painting of the kitchen at the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the teacher is satisfied with the present cook stove and that it is in good condition.\n\nRegarding the painting of the walls and ceiling of the kitchen, I beg to say that the Department will approve of having this done. The muresco should be taken off the walls and they should be given a coat of paint of the colour chosen by the teacher. This work should be done when it is considered timely by you to have it performed. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials required and for the labour in having the work done. You should see that no unnecessary expense is incurred and when the work is completed you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have an account from Thomas Symon, Sheshegwaning, evidently for work done at Sheshegwaning R.C. School, but I have no record of any request from the teacher to have this work done. The ploughing and harrowing of school garden has been previously charged at $4.00, the balance being no doubt for similar work done for grain they grew there but which has not been charged for. The fence was repairing the chicken run for which the wire was purchased a short time ago.\n\nAwaiting your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, June 2, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing an account for $13.30 for the work of ploughing and harrowing the garden and for manure and fencing at the Sheeshgwaning R. C. Indian Day School. We note that this expenditure was incurred by the teacher; but, as it is considered that the gardening at this school is an important feature of the work, this account should be paid. I am returning the account herewith and should be pleased if you would prepare a voucher, in duplicate, which you should certify and send to the Department, when payment will be made. Please give this matter your early attention.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. H. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n**Indian Affairs.

Please arrange to have this done at the proper time.\n\nA request has also been made for painting the front fence, front fence posts, front porch and outside doors of both school and residence.

It will take 1/2 gal of green paint $3.00 / qt light \" \" $1.60 / qt white paint $.85 / brush - $.40\n\n$5.85\n\nRegarding store I have made some inquiries and also got Miss Hickie's opinion and she is of the opinion that Mr. Eaton Co can supply her with what she wants for the least money.

C. School and found that the stairs now are a good nine inch rise and nine inch tread and in order to reduce this to a seven inch rise and still use the nine inch tread, which would have to be done as less than a nine inch tread would be of no use the doorway at the bottom of stairs leading into the kitchen would have to be moved and there would have to be quite a lot of new material gotten as the wainscoting new on would have to be torn off and there would have to be new banisters and some new spindles for the railing and some new wainscoting and material for some new steps.\n\nThe whole stairway would have to be taken down and rebuilt and the cellar steps also as they are the same rise as the others but of course they would not be such a job.\n\nYour authority to have these alterations are in letter dated Sept, 17th and also authority in letter of July 18th for steps over fence these letters numbered 12-3-8 and 12-3-5 respectively.\n\nI can obtain two competent men in the vicinity to do the work but as they would have to drive about seven miles night and morning they will not work for less than 60 cents an hour.\n\nI do not estimate that the main stairs in the school and the cellar stairs and the steps at the pump can be done less than $150.00 and it might be a little more. You could ask Mr Phalen re this as he saw the steps and interviewed me re same.\n\nWould like to know soon if it is all right to go to this much expenditure in connection with the above. The teacher is very anxious to have this done at once.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6165, file 432-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nOn Saturday 22nd inst when I visited Sheshegwaning Miss Hickey the teacher at the R. C. School had me look at their well pump and I found it in very bad shape.\n\nThe casting at the top of pump that holds the handle, etc has been so badly broken and parts of it lost at different times that they do not use same at all and at present time have a sort of a scaffold built over the pump with three small pieces of timber and have a wire running down from it and another wire on the sucker rod of the pump and use a stick for a handle using the wire running down from the scaffold as a leverage, the sucker rod has become so worn at the threads down inside of pump that it comes right out every little while.\n\nI do not know if the cylinder is worn out or not but Miss Hickey says that it is terribly hard to pump the water.\n\nAs there are several families use the pump for their water I would suggest and recommend a new pump head at least which can be bought for $10.00 and still use the old cylinder if any good and if it was found to be no good upon lifting pump a new pump with cylinder and all could be got for around $18.00\n\nThis pump was repaired some time last spring and as it is used so much and is so old that I do not think it advisable to try and have repaired, in any case the casting at top would have to be got new and also some new sucker rods or those other's newly threaded so that I believe for all the extra cost to get a new pump it would be a lot more satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, October 28, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, reporting on the condition of the pump in the well at the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nIt is considered, in view of your report, that it would be advisable to have a new pump installed, and you may arrange for the purchase and installation of same. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase of a pump of a satisfactory type should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price. After the pump has been supplied, you should arrange to have same installed in the well. It is not thought that it would be advisable to have the present old pump fitted up with a new head and cylinder, but that it would be more satisfactory to install a new pump. After this pump has been obtained and installed in the well, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nI have also your letter regarding the stairway in the school building and the cellar steps. With reference to reducing the height of the tread, I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work carried out. You may purchase any material required for the purpose, including new bannisters and spindles for the railing, also any new wainscoting and other material. We note that you can obtain the services of two competent men in the vicinity to do the work, and that you estimate the cost of altering the main stairs in the school and the cellar stairs and the steps at the pump to be approximately $150. You should arrange to have this work carried out at an early date. All expense should be kept as low as possible. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the necessary alterations in the stairs at the lowest possible cost. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the amount due for the labour and for the material should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

C. School as they have no wrench that will take hold of pipe and they often have need for one in connection with the distant pump and the well pump.

There are three rooms upstairs and the hall and stairway downstairs that have not been done for several years and I would say by the looks of same that it needs doing very bad. It would probably take eight or ten packages of kalsomine and three or four days labour as there are some cracks that should be filled with plaster of paris.\n\nThe window frames and sash should also be painted, and there is a new leak in the roof that should be repaired.\n\nThe wood shed at the school has never been painted and would be the better of a coat of arsenite paint but it may be too late to have it done this fall.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, September 15, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the Sheshogwaning R.

C. Indian Day School and I found quite an interesting little community centre. This is a fairly good building, with a flashed roof, which is now giving trouble and concerning which the Agent will report. They have many outbuildings, nice flower and vegetable gardens and good equipment throughout. This school is a social centre for the elder people of the reserve during the evenings. Miss LaVicteire, of the Mariane Order, and one assistant comprise the staff and they are proving a very good civilizing influence. They need a few desks and an extra bed, and, as these were surplus at the closed C. of E. School, I asked the Agent to send the equipment over. He is also to send a washstand to Little Current, to be picked up by Agent Lewis for the Kaboni School. I intend to authorize the Agent to purchase four stools for community purposes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the first place the roof only leaked at the gutters but this spring Miss LaVicoire claimed that there was several places leaking slightly at different points in the roof.\n\nAs it is the wish of the Department to keep expenditures as low as possible this year I would think that a suitable paint might be purchased and applied twice to this roof with a tar or cement in the gutters that would last a few years and not cost very much.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the repairs required to the roof of the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide the cost of installing a new roof. It is considered that it would be satisfactory to have two coats of a suitable paint applied to the present roof and the gutters given a coat of tar or cement, and you may arrange to have this done. You should arrange for the purchase of a suitable type of paint and for the labour in having same applied. The roof should be given two coats and the gutters covered with tar or cement. While a satisfactory job should be completed, all costs for material and labour should be kept as low as possible. This work should be carried out before the school reopens after the present summer holidays. Only Indians should be employed.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all materials and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

School Sheshgwaning.\n\nThe teacher has asked for material for supplying hot lunches to the scholars and in addition to this she is starting a sewing class and asks for material suitable for girls dresses and boys shirts and it is her intention to have the class make the garments and then give the dresses to the scholars and the shirts to the boy scholars. I think that a sewing class would be much more valuable to the Indian girls than a crocheting class and the children can certainly use the dresses and shirts to wear in going to school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nOttawa, October 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Sheshegwaning R. C. Indian Day School for supplies for a hot lunch to the pupils, sewing materials and supplies for the use of the school.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the list to receive consideration, of the following: 1 gal. floor oil, 1 alarm clock (Big Ben type), 6 bars Comfort soap, 2 wash basins (white granite), 1 pail for chemical closet, 1 nine quart tin pail, 2 brooms, 12 generators for Coleman lamp, 2 shut-off valves, 10 gals. coal oil, 5 gals. gasoline, 2 mantles for Aladdin lamps and 1 cleaner.\n\nRegarding the supplies for the pupils' midday meal, I have to say that our funds are limited this year, and it will only be possible to supply materials for the serving of a hot drink at midday. You may, therefore, purchase a small supply of cocoa and sugar. If the Indian children are unable to bring milk, you may purchase a small quantity of condensed milk. I may say that the purpose of the hot drink is to augment the lunch brought by the pupils from their homes.\n\nRegarding the sewing material asked for, you may purchase 12 spools black thread, No. 60, and 20 yards flannelette. You should consult the teacher regarding the colours of the flannel-ette required.\n\nAfter you have made the above authorized purchases, you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nI may add that the half dozen tooth brushes, text-books, etc., will be forwarded to the teacher from here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. F. Priddle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to advise that the R.C.School at Sheshogwaning requires some cod liver oil but I can take out some of what I have ordered for West Bay and take to Sheshogwaning. I would recommend an expenditure of $5 to buy suitable presents for the scholars in this school for Xmas.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario\nOttawa, November 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, and in reply I have to inform you that one case - 2\u00bd gallons - of Cod Liver Oil will be forwarded you in due course for the use of the pupils at the Sheshegwaning R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nYou may incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $5 in the purchase of gifts for the pupils at Christmas. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. This account, you should attach to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. F.

I counted eight different places where the water comes through and some of them are real bad spots. Two years ago we painted the roof to make it stop leaking and it served very well up till now but it is a metal roof and it will either have to be soldered or else a new roof. It is doubtful if it can be soldered properly to stop the leaks.\n\nThe pump is not working either and the Indians do not seem able to repair it properly. I would recommend that I be allowed to take Mr Baxter up from here and let him look over the roof and make an estimate of a new roof or see if the old one can be repaired and also repair the pump at same time. This would probably cost about $5 and would be very satisfactory as Mr Baxter is a plumber and tinsmith.\n\nThe trees at the back of the school are very dense and shade the garden a great deal. I would recommend that these be trimmed out and the lower limbs trimmed off. There should also be a new ladder made that will reach to the roof of the school as the old ladder is broken and rotten and there is no way of getting on the roof in case of fire etc.\n\nI would estimate the cost of underbrushing and building of a ladder at $10 and a competent man could be employed to make a good job of the work. As I am discontinuing all relief on the reserve for next month except to aged and infirm I could employ a man that needs the work.\n\nI also beg to advise that there should be about 10 cords more furnace wood supplied to school as there is going to be a shortage of dry wood for next winter as more wood was burned than was figured on leaving a shortage. I would recommend that someone be given the job of cutting 10 cords and leaving it in the wood to dry till next winter when it could be drawn to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nJune 16, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Buxton,\n\nIt is necessary to carry out some repairs to the metal roof of the Sheshagshuning Indian School, near Goro Bay, Manitoulin Island, Ont. Will you please give me the name of a competent tinsmith who may be employed to do this work. The Indian Agent has recommended a Mr. Baxter of Goro Bay.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 17th, 1933.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nIt will be quite satisfactory to engage Mr. Frank Baxter, of Gore Bay, to carry out some repairs to the metal roof of the Sheshawaganing Indian School, referred to in your memorandum of the 16th instant, your file 12-3-5.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJune 22, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th with reference to the condition of the roof of the R.C. School at Sheshagshening, would you please arrange to have Mr. Baxter examine the roof and see if same can be repaired and submit an estimate of the cost of same to the Department. At the same time you might submit a price for a new roof.\n\nI may say that the funds available at the present time for repair work are extremely limited, and only such repairs as are absolutely necessary can be authorized. Further instructions will be sent you on receipt of your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. F. Priddle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The pole would still be plenty long enough and as it is now it is hard to get anyone to risk climbing same. The necessary change could be made at a cost not exceeding $4 or $5 and I would recommend that this be done.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept.of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs.
