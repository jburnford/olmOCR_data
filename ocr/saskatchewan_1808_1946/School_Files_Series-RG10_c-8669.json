Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nDay Star Indian Day School.\n\nSuperintendent Logie's report on the above Day School has been received here. His comments on the whole are satisfactory and he has the following remarks to make about the teacher:\n\n\"The situation may be summed up thus: Mr. Hick has the confidence and affection of his pupils but his teaching methods leave much to be desired.\n\n\"Of course it is always a problem in such schools to find someone who combines the qualities which gain the confidence of the Indians together with the best teaching techniques. Further would such a paragon be content to live in isolation in order to teach these children?\n\n\"It is my opinion, in the light of these facts, that Mr. Hick is doing a fair job, for he has the primary requisite, a love for and the confidence of the children.\n\n\"The children are being instructed much in the same way as Mr. Hick was taught, as far as I could learn. But the test shows that they are learning to read, to write quite neatly, to handle the English language to some extent, both oral and written, and to do simple arithmetic. (The test papers and record sheet are being forwarded under separate cover. [Progressive Achievement Test]).\n\nWith regard to the condition of the building he has the following comments to make:\n\n..... \"Before\n\"Before another winter storm windows ought to be provided for the main northern exposure windows. With insulation this would make the school much more comfortable. This winter, using wood only, the school was difficult to heat and the teacherage was used instead at times.\n\n\"I found the classroom floor untidy as was the basement also.\n\n\"Sanitary facilities need improving as follows:\n\n(a) Wash stands, instead of makeshift boxes, to encourage the children to keep clean. The girls have a room set apart for them in the teacherage and a few added facilities of this kind would be welcomed. The boys need more encouragement along this line than the girls.\n\n(b) Drinking water. Snow was being used when I visited. It was melted on the teacherage stove. In the summer a large wooden barrel is used and the water is hauled. The barrel is extremely unsanitary and at present is so dried out as to be useless. Some attention to this problem is urgent.\n\n\"Six chair desks are used but 20 more are needed. The other desks are in poor condition and do not fit the children.\"\n\nIn conclusion he makes the following remarks:\n\n\"In general, there is a happy atmosphere and the children are learning.\n\n\"It is my opinion that the situation at this school could be much improved in the following ways:\n\n(1) Insulate school, provide storm windows, better sanitary facilities.\n\n(2) Provide more reading material 'children's books'.\"\nespecially for grade 2, 3 levels. At present there is not much more than the readers.\n\n(3) Provide Mr. Hick with professional books or magazines on improved teaching techniques.\"\n\nWould you please see that a requisition is submitted for the desks required, being certain to indicate the sizes needed. Desks come in small, medium and large sizes.\n\nWe would also like to have your ideas with regard to the improvement of the sanitary facilities and also with regard to the storm windows. If Mr. Hick will requisition for the library books which will be described in the next issue of the Bulletin, he will be able to start a small school library, as recommended.\n\nBernard F.

I tried to have these repaired last fall, but could not get glass. However, I will get in a requisition before the winter comes.\n\nRegarding the untidiness of the school, Mr. Hick is a bachelor, and gets careless. I have taken this matter up with him and he has promised to do better in future.\n\n(A) Regarding the wash stands, there is very little room in this school to put these in. On my next visit, I will see what can be done and make a recommendation.\n\n(B) The water situation at this school has never been good. We have dug six wells without getting any adequate water supply.\n\nFor the past year I have been having the water hauled from a well a mile and a quarter north west of the school, in a barrel. However since your letter I have ordered two large cream cans which should be much more sanitary, and should overcome this problem for the time being. I am also enclosing a requisition for a drinking fountain.\n\nAs it will be necessary for us to build a teacherage, as the old building is not worth spending much money on, and has no basement, I would recommend that this school be moved a mile and a quarter north west where we can get water, and a new teacherage built. This should be done next year as do not think Mr. Hick can carry on more than a year or so as his health is not good, and a married couple would be more suitable.\n\nIf this suggestion meets with your approval, please advise me and I will see that the amount for the school is included in the 1949-50 estimates.\nThe desks in this school that was mentioned in the Inspector's report are the old style and are not much different to the ones used in other schools. While these children are growing out of the desks, it will not be long before a smaller group will come along and fit the desks. However, I will forward a requisition for your consideration.\n\nI have taken the matter of reading material for grades two and three level, and Mr. Hick will be requisitioning for these in due course.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nSuperintendent.\nMay 10, 1948.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nWe have your recent letter with reference to the Day Star Indian day school. The Department approves the purchase of a water cooler.\n\nIt will be in order for you to include in your estimates for the fiscal year 1949-50, a teacher's residence. Of course you understand that at the present time I am not in a position to definitely assure you that it will be possible to obtain the funds for the purpose. However, we will keep in mind your recommendation in the matter.\n\nWith reference to moving the school, you are in the best position to judge where it should be located, not only to obtain a supply of water, but also for the convenience of the pupils attending it.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/EGD\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\nMay 6, 1948\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Day Star Indian Day School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nVOTE 516\n\nSHIP TO R.

BADHAM,\nSecretary of Synod and Registrar,\nSynod House, Regina, Sask., dated June 24, 1948.\n\nAt the DAY STAR Reserve we found Mr. Hick enjoying his work. He has done much to improve the appearance of the place since he went there and in our opinion he is doing a very good job of work. Although we have not been advised by your Department of the School Inspector's Report on Mr. Hick, we understand that it was a very satisfactory one. I wish to make the following observations. The school is very difficult to heat in the wintertime and Mr. Hick has to take the youngest of the children to his residence because it is too cold for them to play in the school during the noon hour. There are no storm windows on the school despite the fact that this need has been made known to the Department of Indian Affairs for some time. The teacher's residence at Day Star requires a lot of work to be done to it before it can be made warm and comfortable. The interior is badly in need of paint and calamine and nothing was done to it before Mr. Hick took over the work as teacher. There is no supply of drinking water which has to be hauled to the school during winter and summer.\n\nThe Indian Department expects Mr. Hick to provide the twenty-six children with a hot noon-day meal each day. The grant made to him for this work is approximately $8.00 per month, while the actual cost to Mr. Hick for feeding the children is $25.00. Incidentally out of the $8.00 per month, Mr. Hick is expected to provide brooms and soap, etc., for cleaning purposes at the school.\nJuly 8, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDay Star Indian Day School\nKey Indian Day School.\nFishing Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Madham recently visited the above three schools and had many favourable comments to make concerning the work being done. However, he did make a request concerning the painting of the interior and exterior of these schools. He also asks concerning insulation of the building.\n\nHe made a comment concerning janitor supplies at the Day Star School. He stated that Mr. Hick was expected to provide brooms and soap for cleaning purposes out of the amount granted monthly for lunch purposes. It is presumed that we will be hearing from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n**THE SPORT SHOP**\n\nFRANK I.

Simpson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6283, file 605-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith requisitions for material required together with a copy of Superintendent Simpson's covering letter regarding necessary repairs to the Day Star Indian Day School.\n\nThe cost of labour is only an estimate as it is not possible to know how much work will be required until part of the damaged wall is removed. Mr. Luthi is a reliable builder and can usually furnish a very close estimate on the amount of work required but in a case such as this school the work required is not all apparent from exterior examination.\n\nIt is very important that repairs be made to save further damage and I would recommend that Mr. Simpson be given authority to make local purchases of the material and have the work carried out as soon as possible.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** MINEC and RESOURCES  \n**BRANCH:** INDIAN AFFAIRS  \n**DATE:** August 17, 1948\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Touchwood Indian Agency Trust Account | $36.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. S.

From what I have seen of the Nut and Fishing Lake Band I firmly believe that for Missionary work it would be the most difficult field in the Territories and would therefore require a first class man.\n\nI understand that the Rev. A.C. Kettle of the Church of England has been nominated by the Bishop of Qu'Appelle as School teacher and Missionary at Fishing Lake. As he does not understand their language nor habits, being I understand, only a short time in this Country, he has a bigger contract than he anticipates, and there are nine chances out of ten that he will fail, and it might be well to see what can be done before building a school.\n\nIt would be impossible to build the school by the first of May next.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nsgd.

Industrial Schools have not been established with relation to particular dioceses, and the Church of England has control of its full share as compared with other denominations,\u2014in fact, more than any other excepting the Roman Catholic.\n\nFor the best interests of the pupils it is regarded as beneficial to have them at a distance from the interruptions and influences attending proximity to the Reserves, and they are situated at the most eligible points throughout the country, and in numbers which have caused difficulty in procuring the grants necessary for their maintenance as part of an educational system which has steadily increased in extent and cost until it has assumed large proportions. Concessions have been made relative to a Boarding School at Touchwood Hills in consideration of there being no Industrial Institution connected with the English Church nearer than Elkhorn, which, however, sufficiently meets the necessities of the case.\n\nHis Lordship has seen the wisdom of\u2014 as he states\u2014refraining from pressing for this.\n2. Funds to complete and maintain Industrial School at Medicine Hat.\n\nHis Lordship recently stated that he accepted without complaint the Department's refusal to make provision in the Estimates for maintenance of pupils unless the Church would guarantee the completion of the building, which refusal was the result of provision made during several consecutive years, having been unused in consequence of the failure of the Church authorities to mature their plans. The idea of establishing a school at Medicine Hat originated with Rev. Mr. Wilson, whose habit it was to act independently, and selected the point which the undersigned would have opposed, had he been consulted, and has never been able to view favourably, and it is significant that the Bishop of Calgary and Saskatchewan, in whose diocese the building is, has never been disposed to connect himself with the undertaking, but pressed for the Institution recently established at Calgary.\n\n3. Establishment of Day Schools at Fishing Lake Reserve.\n\nDespite the new established policy being to reduce rather than increase the number of Day Schools which Industrial and Boarding Schools are intended to take the place of as far as possible, and despite the very poor prospects for getting these particular Indians to avail themselves of a school which they say they do not want, and the Department having refused applications from other denominations, at His Lordship's urgent\nurgent solicitation a promise was made that if by the first of the current month the teacher were provided the Department would pay the usual amount of $300 per annum towards his salary, but little if any hope of being able to provide a school building was held out, before provision should have been made in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nIn fulfilment of this promise provision has been made in Supplementary Estimates for 1896-97 for a schoolhouse and salary grant.\n\nThe Department communicated with the Indian Commissioner as to cost of schoolhouse, but said that it did not at present see its way to authorize the expenditure, but said nothing about inability to implement its promise of a salary grant from the beginning of the current month, and probably there has arisen some confusion at the Regina Office between the two things, and its attention is being drawn to the matter, so that there is nothing to prevent His Lordship from proceeding in accordance with the terms of the promise just described.\n\nDept Indian Affairs,\nMay 30th, 1896.\n29 May.\n\nIndian Head, N.W.T.\n\nI have just seen Mr. H. W. Mawald on account of our Indian School. I thank him for your kind letter. He is writing you himself by this mail and has asked me to write this note to inform you that after my visit to the Fishing Lake school I certainly feel that after a short visit and seeing the Indians already there and the way they are doing business and their manner of life, I have a grievance against the school. Still I feel that after the visit I might be able to help a school. If not for the reason that I think you would agree I really thought that perhaps we might have adopted them. They are in the hands of a man who cannot deal with them. I believe this is a great loss to the children for this is an important thing.\n\nI think that the Department have done me this favor in the matter of this school.\n\nI have a claim for help in this matter. If this work is to be agreed upon I would like to give it an opportunity to special arrangement for the Indians at the Fishing Lake if possible. I will do all I can to help it.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Commissioner was at once reminded that the promise to give a salary grant at any time after the 1st ultimo was definite, and as he has doubtless by this time corrected any false impression which may have been conveyed, Your Lordship will have learned that the Department has no desire to withdraw from what it undertook to do.\n\nSince therefore, the main reason upon which Your Lordship presses for immediate aid to complete the school at Medicine Hat and maintain it, does not exist, it may probably be assumed that Your Lordship will not urge it more especially in view of the fact that no provision has been made in the estimates.\n\nAs to Your Lordship's statement that the want of an Industrial School in the Diocese, whereat to complete the education of more advanced pupils under the control of the Church, I may point out that Industrial Schools must, on account of the great expense of maintaining them, be necessarily limited in number, and consequently have had to be established at the most favorable points in the country without reference to diocesan limits; that children sent to Elkhorn would still be under the control of the Church; that the Church has under its immediate direction, in addition to the one at Elkhorn just referred to, one Industrial School at Battleford and one conducted in its interests at St Paul's, Winnipeg, as well as one about to be opened at Calgary, as against three conducted by the Roman Catholic Church at Dunbow, Qu'Appelle and St Boniface respectively, one by the Presbyterians at Regina and two by\nthe Methodist at Red Deer and Brandon respectively.\n\nI may add that the Department has had comparatively recently to resist demands made by the Roman Catholic Church for new Industrial Schools made on the very same grounds of having none in certain dioceses, because the cost of these already existing and of the educational machinery generally, is over-taxing the Department's resources.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is undertaking Indian education in its broadest sense and everything must not be left to the Teacher; all should co-operate to obtain appreciable results.\n\nThe Department would like you in the case of this school to use your influence to have all the Indian children attend, and would like you to impress upon the Teacher and the Farmer the necessity for exerting themselves to improve the present unsatisfactory situation above referred to. It is to be hoped that when Mr. Graham next visits this reserve he will be able to report an improvement along these lines.\n\nThe remarks just made with reference to the duties of employees are applicable to all reserves and the\n\nW.

I have taken advantage of every opportunity of impressing these Indians with the importance of sending their children to the School and the present attendance was obtained through my efforts alone.\n\nThese remarks apply to the other schools in the Agency as well.\n\nThe facts are, that the School was placed at Fishing Lake before the Indians were ready for it. The Indians at that point have so far had to depend upon hunting, trapping and working out for their means of support. These employments have necessarily taken them away from their reserve during the greater part of the year, and as they have no means of leaving their children behind them, the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nattendance at the school has been of a very desultory character.\n\nI am making every effort to get these Indians to adopt farming as a means of livelihood and meeting with a fair measure of success so far. They have harvested their first crop this year and as it was a good one it has had the effect of making others wish to start, and as soon as the Indians have employment which will keep them residing continually on their reserve, there will be a possibility of getting all the children of school age to attend.\n\nI have already explained the condition existing to Mr. Graham and the Indian Commissioner.\n\nI recognize the importance of co-operation and have asked the Teacher to visit the Indians in their houses so that the younger children would have an opportunity of becoming used to him and this I think would have a beneficial effect in overcoming their natural shyness.\n\nThere is only one man at Fishing Lake who has shown active opposition to the school and who absolutely refuses to send his children, and while I am opposed as a rule to using forcible measures, I think that if the Department will authorize me to take his children and place them in a Boarding School forcibly, it would have a very beneficial effect.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 4th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo in reference to the conditions as they exist on the reserve at Fishing Lake with regard to the day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that the efforts which are being made by yourself and others will result in a much better attendance at the school.\n\nIn reference to the last paragraph of your letter I beg to say that the Department does not approve of the course suggested by you to forcibly remove the children of an Indian on the reserve to a boarding school.

I regret to say that there is absolutely no improvement in this school in the last two years. Instead it has gone back. I found a new teacher, an old bachelor about 60 years of age. School was being taught in one of the upstairs rooms in the farm house and there were only five small boys in attendance. They knew little or nothing. You will notice from the returns sent in from time to time that the attendance has been very unsatisfactory. This school has now been in existence for over five years and I regret to say the results obtained do not warrant the small expenditure it has occasioned.\n\n2. The difficulty seems to get a qualified teacher, one who can influence the parents. Another trouble is the home conditions, which are very poor, and any little good that children receive at school is soon offset by the home influence.\n\n3. The children were dirty and poorly clad.\n\nThe secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6283, file 606-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n3. At one time I was of the opinion that a school building might help matters somewhat. Now I do not think this would make much difference. So much depends upon the teacher and the farmer, and as Mr. Field has left the service, conditions are far from promising. Practically no results have been obtained during the five years in which school has been open here, and from what I can gather there is not likely to be any great improvement.\n\n4. In view of all this I cannot recommend a new building and I would strongly recommend closing the school and opening up the reserve for recruiting for Boarding and Industrial schools, of course giving Elkhorn the preference. If this is done the children will receive an education which will be of some value, as it is they are getting nothing.\n\nMr. James Clare is the present teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInter. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 12, 1912.\n\nEXD.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Mr. Inspector Graham on the Fishing Lake Day School. This report shows that conditions on this reserve so far as the school is concerned are far from satisfactory. The attendance has not been very satisfactory and it would appear that matters are not likely to improve while the school is under Mr. Clare's management.\n\nIn view of the very small attendance it is considered that it would be in the best interests of the children to close the day school and have those of school age enrolled at one or other of the various boarding and industrial schools.

I thought your letter before my to him to accept it. I thought your letter before my\n\ncommittee yesterday and we have decided not to continue the school or we cannot write for the children.

The one I sent to Nut Lake will be superior to the man that was there last year. I was quite disappointed in him. Young men could be sent in for about four or five months in the summer.\n\nWould the Department be willing to make a grant of about Three Hundred Dollars in each case for such services?

His Lordship Bishop Harding when in Ottawa a few days ago made reference to this school and it is the intention of the Department to communicate with His Lordship.

You know we have in former years had a teacher on this Reserve, we were perhaps unfortunate in not having the right stamp of man, but I feel now that if a suitable small building were erected by the Department, we can furnish an experienced man in Indian work who would make a success of the school. We should like very much to be given a chance and the only matter that seems to stand in the way is the need of the building.\n\nI hope you will be able to do something for us in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. William Dottie\nCommissioner\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nRev. Archdeacon Dobin has been in to see me on several occasions with reference to school work on the Fishing Lake Reserve. You will recall that several years ago, we had a day school there, but it never was a success. I think this was largely due to the fact that the church did not have the right class of man as teacher and of course indifference on the part of the Indians. The Archdeacon informs me that they can secure the services of Mr. Lows, who was for a long time teacher of the day school in Keys Reserve and a very successful teacher he was, to take the school at Fishing Lake, should one be established.\n\nI am not prepared to ask you to spend any large sum of money in building an up to date school but I think the Department might spent seven or eight hundred dollars on a small building, which should be situated near the farm house, which is near the Indians' farms. This building could be used as a school and if it should happen that the school was not a success, the Department could find good use for the building as a granary, a warehouse or implement shed.\n\nI may say that the church authorities are quite sure they can make a success of the school and I would like to see them given some encouragement especially in view of the fact that we have been unable to build a new school at Gordons Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.

I have no doubt that the lack of success was in part due to inefficient teachers, but I also note that from the reports received it would appear that the indifference of the parents may have been the chief contributory cause.\n\nWere a building available I would be disposed to give my concurrence, but I hesitate under the circumstances to consent to the capital expenditure necessary to provide accommodation. With the present prices of material and labour I hardly think a suitable building could be erected for $700.00 or $800.00. Your estimate in 1910 was $1200.00 and it is well known that the cost has more than doubled since that time. In the meantime, however, you might let me have a sketch of the building that you think could be erected for the sum mentioned, with information as to how you propose to have the work done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen -\n\nIn 1912 the day school on the Fishing Lake reserve was closed for lack of attendance, due largely to the indifference of the Indian parents. This lack of interest was no doubt owing to some extent to the inferior class of teacher nominated by the Church authorities.\n\nOn June 12th, last, Mr. Commissioner Graham recommended the erection of a small building in a more central situation and the reopening of the school, as a Mr. Lowe, who was for a long time teacher of the day school on the Keys Reserve and who there conducted what Mr. Graham states to have been one of the most successful day schools within his then inspectorate, is now available to take up the work.\n\nIn view of the fact that we have not been able to take up the erection of Gordon's boarding school, I am disposed to support Mr. Graham's recommendation. His proposition is to erect a cheap building the cost not to exceed $1,000.00, which, should the school not prove successful, might be used as a granary, warehouse or implement shed in connection with the agency buildings. Mr. Graham would buy the material and get an estimate of the cost of labour and would detail one of the inspectors to supervise the work.\n\nWith your approval I shall grant the necessary authority.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon.

Mr. Laws, a former teacher in an Indian day school in the Pelly Agency, has been nominated by the Church authorities as teacher and the Department is allowing him a salary at the rate of $750.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the time it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nIt is hoped when this school is open that there will be a good and regular attendance and that the parents will show more interest in the education of their children than they did when the former school was in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

Hardinge, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nCOPY OF REPORT.\n\nfor the quarter ending Sept. 30th, 1920.\n\nFISHING LAKE RESERVE.\n\nI was sent here by Commissioner Graham to re-open the Day School which had been closed for some years.\n\nThe old building previously used as a school is no longer habitable, but a new one is to be erected shortly.\n\nThe last three months I have been organizing the work here, for two months, lessons were given in a large tent kindly provided by our Agent, but I have now secured an Indian house, which can be heated, until a permanent building is ready.\n\nOn this Reserve there are 23 children of school age, the majority of them can speak no English at all, but the few I have been able to induce to attend school seem very intelligent and eager to learn, with the exception of one or two.\n\nThe Indians are anxious for their children to receive an education, and I feel confident that as soon as the children begin to speak English, the interest of the Parents will be aroused, of course it will need great patience and perseverance to conduct a school here, and I fear that for some time the attendance will be small.\n\nI hope the Indians will eventually appreciate the school by sending their children regularly.\n\n(SGD) A.J. LAWES.\n\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a report by Mr. A.J. Lawes in regard to his work on the Fishing Lake Reserve for the quarter ended September 30th, last. In forwarding this report the Agent states that Mr. Lawes has been on the Reserve reorganizing the school during the period for which Mr. Lawes reports, and assisting in getting the school built. I beg therefore, to recommend that he be given a Grant from the Department for his services during the quarter in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 7, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing a copy of a report from Mr. A. J. Lawes, the teacher of the Fishing Lake Indian Day School, for the quarter ending September 30th, last, and recommending that he be paid salary for his services during the period which he was on the ground and assisting in getting the school built and ready for occupation.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that salary will be allowed him for the full quarter.\n\nIt is noted that classes were held for two months and Mr. Acting Agent Hardinge will be requested to have Mr. Lawes prepare a return on the proper form for that purpose showing the attendance, days taught, etc. In the meantime a cheque for the amount of salary and bonus due him will be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 7, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham has forwarded a copy of a report which he received from Mr. A. J. Lawes, teacher of the Fishing Lake Indian Day School, for the quarter ending September 30th, last. The teacher states that he spent one month organizing the work and that lessons were given in a large tent during two months. The Commissioner recommends that, in view of his services during the full quarter, he be allowed salary.\n\nA cheque for the full quarter's salary, together with a cheque for the amount of the bonus due, will be sent.\n\nI have to request, however, that you will have Mr. Lawes prepare a return on the proper form for that purpose showing the attendance, days taught, etc., for the two months he held classes during the September quarter. This is required to complete the records of the Department. You should attend to this matter at once and forward the return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. B. Hardinge, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nI visited this school on October 4th, and found a good attendance, the progress is fair. Mr. Lawes has the good will of both parents and children and the attendance is uniformly good.\n\nThe only fault I have to find is that he is too familiar with the Indians. On the occasion of my visit I found his house full of Indians with the reactionary element most in evidence, sitting on his chairs and bed everywhere. This does not appear to me to be the best educational advantages.\"\nOttawa, Nov. 29, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to a matter which arises out of your report dated the 4th instant. You informed the Department that although the Reverend A. J. Lawes was doing good work at the Fishing Lake Indian Day School, you had fault to find with his familiarity with the members of the Indian band.\n\nI have written a kindly letter to the Reverend Dr. Westgate, of Winnipeg, who keeps a supervision over the Anglican missionaries in the Indian work, and I am sure that he will drop a word in the ear of the Rev. Mr. Lawes, that may have a salutary effect. You will please treat this matter in a confidential manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. B. Hardinge, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa, November 29, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to draw your attention to a matter that arises out of the report of the Indian Agent at Punnichy, Sask., on the Indian Day School of the Fishing Lake reserve. I might state that Mr. Hardinge is known to me, personally, and is a fair-minded gentleman. I regret that in my last tour of inspection I was unable to visit the Fishing Lake reserve, due to its remote situation.\n\nPermit me, Reverend Sir, to quote from our Agent's report which is to hand:\n\n\"I visited this school on October 4th, and found a good attendance; the progress is fair.

Lawes is paid the sum of $750.00 per annum, together with a bonus at the rate of $150.00, while teacher at the Fishing Lake Indian Day School. The agent of the Department of Indian Affairs criticizes the teacher at this point, and it is only fair that I communicate with you, with a view to having you address a letter to the Rev. Mr. Lawes, asking him to be careful in the matter of his relations with the band at Fishing Lake. I am convinced that he is doing good work, but neither this Department nor your Church would be pleased to see him drift if a kindly word of admonition would bolster him up at this time.\n\nI am sure, Reverend Sir, that you will not mistake the attitude of the Department in this matter and that you will accept this information in the spirit in which it is sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

He also says that you have the good will of both the parents and the children, and that the attendance is uniformly good.\n\nHe however, thinks that you are too familiar with the Indians, and calls attention to the reactionary element which was met in evidence, as on the occasion of his visit he found the house full of Indians, with them sitting on the chairs and beds everywhere, and he does not think this to be the best of educational advantages to the Indians.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education writes very kindly about the matter, and is convinced that you are doing a good work, but he is anxious concerning the possibility of your drifting into too familiar ways with the Indians.\n\nI know perfectly well how deeply interested you are in the Indians and their children, and also how highly they regard you as teacher and missionary, but I hope you will be very careful to guard against too much familiarity.

You taught during the months of May and June, last, the school having been closed for holidays during the month of April instead of the month of July.

If you teach during the present month of July payment will be made for that month.\n\nThe cheques which you forwarded are returned herewith and you should have them cashed as soon as possible.\n\nWhen your return for the quarter ending September 30th is received, full payment of salary and bonus on a monthly basis for the period you teach during that time will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

A. J. Lawes, Kylemore, Sask. - $900.00 - $90.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose return for September quarter from the teacher of the Day School at Fishing Lake.\n\nIt will be noticed that the teacher taught school during August and asks for permission to close it in November; he did not ask for permission to keep the school open in August but I recommend that he be allowed to substitute August for November.\n\nI inspected this place on the 3rd inst and found 23 on the register, with six boys and seven girls present, the school inspector had been at the school on the 1st inst. The place is tidy, children healthy, and a lot of vegetables put away for school use. The pupils get a noon luncheon.\n\nThey had all been promoted to new classes a few days before my visit, I will see later on if they advance any in their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFishing Lake School No. 606 will be closed during November but as the school was open in August and no payment was made to the teacher for that month, the teacher should be allowed salary as usual for November.\n\nO.K.\n\nNov. 12/35\n\nM. M.\nA lazy man who will not work to get food for his family and to get a good place for them to live is sure to see his children sick.\n\nA good house should be big enough for two families, but only one family ought to live in it.\n\nThe sun is a great friend. He cannot get in unless you put a big window in your new house. Sickness is sure to visit people who live in dark houses.\n\nTwo windows are better than one. One window should be open a little all the time. You can tack a piece of cloth over the hole to keep out the wind.\n\nAn open fireplace is a good thing. When many people stay in a house the air gets bad and the fireplace carries this bad air off.\nOttawa, June 30, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, the Department approves the Fishing Lake School being kept open during the month of August and closed during the month of November, 1936.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The following few details will get you up to date in case he asks anything.\n\nAt the school is a dwelling, one story, in good shape, painted about ten years ago. Also a small 16 x 18 building once used as a school now a warehouse. Also the school building. The places are all lumber construction.\n\nIn 1932-33 estimates an item of $60.00 was in on page 16 for painting the school but funds were not available.\n\nThe boss went with me to Gordon and Muscowequan Schools, they were in apple pie order and probably the best he has seen on his trip. Then we went to Day Star Day School and found this place ready for any sort of an inspection, dandy garden and place a treat to look at. Then to Fishing Lake where everything was also in best of shape except for need of paint. I think he went away in good humour (some spelling).\n\nGive my best regards to Mr. Southerland. I hope he will soon be back again signing the old letters again. Not that I wish you any come down at all, I know you run the office as a good will partnership as far as employees are concerned.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At present I receive $25.00 for that purpose, and every year I have to buy food out of my own pocket to have sufficient for them. We give them an excellent dinner each day in winter, which is really the only decent meal they get. As we have no basement at the school, the food is prepared in our own kitchen by Mrs. Lawes assisted by two school girls. We think that if the children are properly fed, it will help them to keep well, and to combat TB. Good food is far more necessary to them than medicine, which is frequently wasted. We have been here over seventeen years, and not a single request for food has ever been refused at the mission for the sick and aged, as every Indian on the reserve can testify. If any food is left over after the school children have had sufficient, it is sent home for the sick aged, and young children, and is appreciated by them, as often the food...\nthey have is extremely poor. I have today written to Mr. Waddy and told him of my appeal to you.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. L. Harris\n\nDr. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\nRegina,\nSask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit attached letter from Mr. Lawes re allowance for midday meals.\n\nThere is no need of my stressing the importance, I might say vital necessity, of a good midday meal for our day school children during the full school term.\n\nThe allowance of $25.00 for 26 children is totally inadequate and simply means that the children are not receiving enough food to be of any benefit or the teacher is paying for it.\n\nI would recommend that an allowance of $8.50 per month for the full 10 months be authorized for midday meals in this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Waddy, Touchwood Agency, in which he states that the day school buildings at Fishing Lake are in need of some repairs, that nothing has been spent on them for quite a while and the teacher has been asking if we will try and assist this year.\n\nThe sitting room is very small and he would like the wall moved in 3 feet and take this space off the kitchen. This would require some plastering work afterwards and the cost, including labor and material, would be about $50.00. The lean-to back kitchen is a flat roof and this could be corrected by fixing the foundation and cutting down rafters. The place leaks as the pitch is not sufficient to let the rain run off. This would cost approximately $25.00.\n\nThe platform in the school should be rebuilt and the verandah roof repaired, the total cost of which would be approximately $35.00.\n\nMr. Waddy states the carpenter who does the work in this district is Mr. J.R.F. Best of Wadena.\n\nThere is an amount of $100.00 for painting the dwelling and the warehouse of the Fishing Lake Day School in the 1938-39 estimates.

It is probable that the Purchasing Agent ordered the biscuits though I have no instructions from him re the shipment.\n\nI have delivered to Fishing Lake School 750 lbs of these biscuits.\n\nThe balance of 700 lbs in 28 cases I shipped here from Kylemore on C.N.Ry for Day Star School and I have issued requisition for freight collect here to sum of $4.97, the requisition being #F.316 payable to C.N.Ry.\n\nI can use the total amount of the shipment though the amount received is different than your advice in letter of July 3rd last.\n\nPlease advise if I can clear the voucher for total sum of $155.15. If your shipping instructions to the biscuit people show some to be shipped to Punnichy I should deduct the amount of freight I paid out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the biscuits for the Fishing Lake and Day Star Indian Day Schools. I regret that a larger quantity of biscuits than was originally intended was ordered. I note that you have sent 750 lbs. to Fishing Lake School and 700 lbs. to Day Star School. It is hoped that none of these will be wasted.\n\nYou may forward a voucher for $155.15 covering the cost of the biscuits that have been supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Owing to this fact we fully believe that it will take approximately 12 gallons of paint for the walls and trimmings. Of course if it would take less it would cost less. That is priced at $4.20 a gallon.\n\nIt will take approximately 25 gallons of roof paint to do the two roofs and approximately $50.00 for labor. The roof paint is $2.50 a gallon.\n\nNow if you desire to do this we have a painter that would do the work and we would be pleased to supply the material for the same.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

I would also suggest for the walls, \"ashes of roses\" a color a few shades deeper than is on the school which will not fade out so quickly.\n\nThe school doors etc (painted light) are appalling dirty, and I intend with your permission to paint them leather brown if the finishings on the cottage and storeroom are done in that shade.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.

K. Irwin of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle was in the office and had quite a long conference with me in connection with the Indian work.\n\nThe Archdeacon and two of the laymen that are on the Committee visited the different points in the Diocese where our Indian schools are located and there are a lot of things that this Committee is not satisfied with. I shall take them up with you just as soon as I have the time, but the only matter that is real urgent is the kalsomining and doing a little painting at the Fishing Lake Day school. The Archdeacon informs me that this has not been touched for 8 years and is very dark and dingy. This should be kalsomined before the school opens on the 1st of October. I presume we will have to get someone at Wadena to do the work and we will also be able to buy the kalsomine and what little paint is required.\n\nHe also pointed out that the fence around the School and premises would have to be renewed because the posts were all rotten and that it would take 160 tamarack posts to do this. There is however no hurry in doing this. I expect to visit this school when there is a change of Agents at the end of the month and the fence could be left in abeyance.\n\nI hope, however, that you will give me authority to get someone to do the kalsomining at the school and authority to purchase the kalsomine immediately. As I stated before, the other matters will be taken up as soon as we get through with the Estimates.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nMG/AH\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSeptember 12, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fishing Lake Day School\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 9, in which you intimated that certain repairs are urgently needed at the above-noted school.\n\nYou are authorized to take the steps necessary to have these repairs undertaken and completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSaskatoon & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I advised you that the Indian Committee of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, Anglican Church, interviewed me in connection with certain matters pertaining to the Indian work. The only thing that was urgent at that time was the kalsomining of the interior of the school at Fishing Lake. This I took up with you, authority has been received and the Farming Instructor at Fishing Lake has this in hand, also the posts around the school being rotten, this will be looked after by myself when I am there on the first of the month.\n\nThe next item to be dealt with is the school curriculum. They were of the opinion that more manual training should be taught at these institutions. I quite agree with them and informed them that as far as I knew Mr. Doucet had this matter in hand.\n\nThe Water supply at the Gordon school: They claimed this had never been satisfactory and they want us to send an engineer to make a thorough examination of this immediately. Since then I have been talking to Mr. Frayling, the Principal, and when I am up at Touchwood next, which will be the end of the month, I think that I can get all the information that is necessary and shall advise the Department.\n\nThe mid-day meal: This affects Fishing Lake, Day Star and Key Reserves. At the present time the policy of our Branch is to give the teacher from $40.00 to $60.00 a year to provide a mid-day meal for the children. The Indian Committee, after visiting these schools, claim this is inadequate and that instead of allowing the amounts mentioned they should allow the teacher $100.00. They were quite emphatic in this connection and gave me instances at these schools where the teacher's wife had told them that she had to provide food out of her own larder; in other words, to take food from her family to give to the Indian children when they were hungry. In this matter I agree\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nwith them 100%\nwith them 100%. It is astonishing how our Branch has always been very liberal with the boarding schools but God help the Day schools. I know that I shall receive a letter advising me that there are no funds, as usual, to increase the mid-day meal, but it is more or less of a joke to ask a teacher to supply a mid-day meal for 20 to 25 children out of $40.00 a year.\n\nWill you give this matter consideration? Because if you do not take any steps to increase this I am going to see the Fishing Lake Band if they will not vote enough money to give the children a fair mid-day meal the next time I am there.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

The response to these instructions has been, on the whole, somewhat encouraging. An officer of the Department is devoting the whole of his time to the organization of these courses. A number of worth-while courses have been prepared at considerable expense and are now available for distribution to our schools. In this connection there is an old saying that it is comparatively easy to provide a horse with water, but it is somewhat difficult to compel him to drink. This saying applies to a limited number of our schools, particularly our day schools, insofar as the promotion or organization of vocational instruction is concerned.\n\nWater Supply at Gordon's School -- It is noted that you have discussed this matter with the Principal of the school and that it is your intention to visit the school and secure additional information in the immediate future.\n\nThe Midday Meal -- You will be interested to learn that a great deal of consideration has been given during the last year to the best ways and means of providing the Indian population of the Dominion with a well-balanced diet. A nutritional survey has been made in northern Manitoba and several conferences have been held with a number of nutritional experts. Dr. Kruse, who is at this time nutritional adviser to the United States Armed Forces, visited this Department last week with the object of discussing with the acting Superintendent of Medical Services the results of certain experiments that have been undertaken amongst groups of under-nourished peoples in a number of states of the Union. The programme of the Department has in mind cannot be adopted overnight, but will, we are convinced, prove of great advantage to our Indians in the course of time. In the meantime certain initial steps have been taken. This year we purchased fifteen tons of a special biscuit prepared under the direction of the Dominion Cerealist. These biscuits have been distributed to schools in the northern sections of the Dominion. The distribution, however, has been confined to areas where vegetables have not been produced in\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSaskatoon & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\n\np.t.o.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6283, file 606-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nquantity until now. I am enclosing the formula of this biscuit for your information. It is just possible that a much wider distribution of this biscuit will be made next year. A great deal will depend upon the funds available. The cost of this biscuit is more than double the cost of biscuits purchased at any time in the past by this Department.\n\nA number of Indian agents have, in co-operation with a great many of our day school teachers, succeeded in organizing worth-while gardens and placed the vegetables from these gardens at the disposal of the teachers for midday meals. In addition to this, a large number of root houses have been constructed during the summer months. It has been estimated by the officials that more root houses have been constructed during the present season than have been constructed at any time in the history of the Department. A great many of these root houses are designed to meet the needs of all the Indians in the band and are proving very helpful in that they ensure a constant supply of vegetables, not only for the adult Indians but for the Indians in attendance at day schools, throughout the winter months. Goat herds have also been established at a large number of our reserves. Doctors with whom this matter has been discussed are of the opinion that it is almost impossible to provide a well-balanced diet for Indians, lacking as they do an adequate milk supply. Our experience in the establishment of goat herds has been, on the whole, encouraging and satisfactory. In this connection the Department communicated with Indian Agent Davis a few weeks ago in respect to the multiplication of a number of goat herds in his agency. The receipt of this letter has not been acknowledged.\n\nIn the case of the Indian day schools referred to in the second-last paragraph of your communication, may I suggest that the teachers concerned submit to you through the agent or to the Department a list of the supplies which, in their judgment, are necessary to provide a fairly nutritious meal during the academic year. If the cost of these supplies exceeds $50.00, they will be submitted to the Purchasing Division in due course with a recommendation that the supplies requested be purchased, or that authority be granted to the agents or teachers to make such purchases. The utmost care, however, should be exercised if the purchase of tea or sugar is recommended. These purchases must be in strict conformity with existing regulations. These supplies, however, should be looked upon by the teachers and agents as temporary expedient. All our field officials should look forward to a time when the supply of vegetables and an adequate supply of milk will enable the Indians, including Indian pupils, to enjoy a diet sufficiently well balanced to encourage physical development and maintain health.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Wood is expensive and hard to secure, consequently an oil stove would be more useful and more efficient.\n\nWhen funds are available in a year or two a full sized basement should be completed under this school and a furnace installed. This would make the room much more comfortable and allow a considerably larger floor space for more desks which will be needed with the improved attendance expected with the Family Allowances.\n\nJ.P.B.

You should let me have complete information regarding the type of stove required and if possible you should state the catalogue number in order to assist our Purchasing Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept., Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 121-3-5 dated July 31, 1945 regarding material for repairs to Fishing Lake Day School, I would advise that I obtained the prices for plaster board, lumber, shavings and nails from the North American Lumber and Supply Co. Ltd., Punnichy, and estimated the cost of labor myself.\n\nMr. J.E. Hicks of Wadena gave me a price of $97.75 on a number 575 Duo-Thern Heater, capacity 2300.\n\nHe also has a good two burner Enterprize Heater#40, which he used in his house last winter. This is in good condition. The original cost was $130.00 but he is willing to sell for $100.00. This has a greater heating capacity than the Duo-Thern, and I think would be a better buy.\n\nWill you please advise me by return airmail if authority is given for this work, as it should be completed before the school re-opens this fall, and workmen are hard to get.\n\nR.S.

You will note that it is dated June 29, 1946. We have, therefore, asked the Provincial Department of Education to make certain that this school is inspected again this year.\n\nThe last report upon the Key Indian Day School is dated November 2, 1945 and was submitted upon Mr. Walter Browne. We have also asked the Provincial Department of Education to submit an Inspector's report upon Dr. Mansbridge who is now teaching there.\n\nWith regard to the question which you have raised concerning janitor work at the schools, I would suggest that this be taken up through the Indian Agent's office so that they can make a definite recommendation in each case. I will expect to hear further from you concerning these matters.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. F.E.R.

Neary, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA - Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter of June 18th, 1947 you advised me that you had not received a Provincial School Inspector's Report upon the work of Dr. Mansbridge at Key Indian Day School, but that you would forward a copy of such report when it became available. To date we have not received any Inspector's Report and I am wondering if this is because no inspection has been made. We are anxious to also have copies of the Provincial School Inspector's Report upon the work of the Rev. A.J. Lawes of Fishing Lake Reserve and Mr. Robert Hick of Day Star Reserve as well as a report from your Department on the work of these gentlemen.\n\nWe would like to know if it is possible for the Department of Indian Affairs to remunerate our Day School Teachers for the janitor work they have to do at their schools, also for providing the mid-day meals for the children. I may say that in the white schools of our Province any teacher who is required to do janitor work receives an allowance for doing so, and it is felt that this should also apply to the teachers in Indian Day Schools.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you regarding these matters, especially the first mentioned as if it is considered necessary that we should replace any of our teachers, it is advisable to soon advertise for others.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of Synod.\n\nB/F\n**THE SPORT SHOP**\n\nFRANK I.

I wish you could see the condition of the property and grounds. Everywhere is so neat and tidy and attractive. Here again we heard of the inadequacy of the amount allowed these good people by the Indian Department for the purpose of providing the children with a noon day meal.\nJuly 8, 1948.\n\nMr. J.F.B.

However, he did make a request concerning the painting of the interior and exterior of these schools. He also asks concerning insulation of the building.\n\nHe made a comment concerning janitor supplies at the Day Star School. He stated that Mr. Hick was expected to provide brooms and soap for cleaning purposes out of the amount granted monthly for lunch purposes.

Ostreider, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nRe your letter #1346-300-IIA July 12, 1948\nFishing Lake Day School\n\nOn sheet #3 Schools, Estimates 1948-49, will be found items for attention to school, digging basement, labour cement work, painting of school and residence, totalling $2500.00. Attached hereto is form #7 listing materials and labour to build a 6' X 22' extension to the present building, enlarge the school room by removing the cloak room partitions, insulating the building, digging basement, construction of a cement basement, removing and rebuilding chimney, and moving the building onto the new basement.\n\nMr. R.L. Brooks of Wadena has offered to supply all labour in this connection including shavings for insulation at a cost of $2200.00, it being understood that if the walls of the building have not been constructed with headers the cost of insulation will be $90.00 less than the price quoted on Form #7, namely $220.00.\n\nMr. Ed Ward of Wadena offered to do this work less the moving of the building on to the new site for the sum of $2700.00. An offer was also made by Mr. F.A. Holmman, Wadena, to move the building from the present site onto the basement for the sum of $300.00.\n\nThe offer submitted by R.L. Brooks is reasonable and I would recommend that favourable consideration be given to this offer.\n\nAlso attached hereto is Form #7 listing the materials and labour required for exterior and interior decorating of the school house, teacher's residence, storehouse, and outside toilets. The labour includes two coats of outside painting, tightening all nails, and minor repair work, also two coats of paint to the interior of the teacherage and school amounting to $709.50. Mr. Gordon W. Russell, Wadena has offered to do this work for the sum of $300.00, spray and brush to be used. Messrs. Fred H. and Max Olson have offered to do it for the sum of $325.00, all work to be done by brush. It is not considered advisable to do a paint job on the school house until it has been enlarged and moved onto the basement. Due to the moving of the building it might result in damage to the plastered ceiling and inside walls and could result in making an unnecessary expenditure.\n\nI would recommend that the school be moved this year if at all possible even though it may result in having the class rooms closed for the month of September. It is estimated that about seven weeks will be required to move the school and put it in shape for use.\n\nIn the event this work is done a furnace will be required which will mean an added expenditure of approximately $370.00\n\nI recommend that consideration be given to have the painting done by brush. I understand that brush work is proving more satisfactory than spray work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Simpson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6283, file 606-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Superintendent S.H. Simpson, of the Touchwood Agency, and Requisition Form 37 for digging a new basement, concrete work on the same, moving the present classroom building on to the basement, enlarging the same, and insulation of the whole, also construction of a new chimney for the Fishing Lake Indian Day School, at a total cost of $3,108.59, the work to be performed, and the material supplied, by Mr. R.L. Brooks, of Wadena, Saskatchewan.\n\nIt will be noted that a furnace will also be necessary. Mr. Simpson has not enclosed a requisition for the furnace, but has given the cost thereof as $370.00. I am asking him to forward the requisition direct to the Department for the furnace. This will make a total cost of $3,473.59 without painting. On reference to the Touchwood Agency Estimates for the current fiscal year it will be noted that there is a total of $2,975.00 in the Estimates, as originally submitted, for this work, including painting inside and out of the school and residence. The moving and reconstruction necessary for the Fishing Lake Day School is much more important at the present time than the painting, and I would recommend that Mr. Simpson be instructed to proceed at once with the work outlined to be performed by Mr. R.L. Brooks, of Wadena, in order to have the school ready for occupation as near as possible to the 1st of September.\n\nI would also recommend that he be given authority to make immediate purchase of the furnace as soon as that requisition is forwarded to Ottawa by him.\n\nIt has been so difficult to get any work of this kind performed that I am anxious that we do not miss the opportunity to get this particular job done this year. If funds are available for painting in addition to the construction work in connection with this building, further requisitions will be submitted.\n\nJ.P.B.

The material for each building was put on a separate requisition and a separate covering letter written with each requisition, but they should all be considered as one unit as these buildings are all on the same yard at Fishing Lake Indian Day School.

It is a matter of such importance that I would ask you to bring it before the Minister of Indian Affairs at the earliest possible opportunity, and also to see that the matter is not dropped after it has been opened up.\n\nMy work and the work of my missionaries among our Indians gives us opportunity of learning their state, their needs, their desires, in a way that you will rarely learn from your Indian agents and Instructors. I beg therefore, to press upon your Department the pressing need of day schools as follows: (among others perhaps not mentioned) I am sure the Indian Department knows of the non-existence of such schools and of the desire of the Indians to have them, and perhaps the I.D. has been considering the matter. But I would press for the building and maintaining of these schools almost immediately.\n\n(1) The Indians are retrograding and suffering for the lack (2) It does not seem in accordance with \"Treaty\" to leave them without (3) They desire and ask for them. I cannot be sure of correct names, but I think what I write is sufficient to point them out correctly.\n\n1.- Frog Lake, Nos. 121 and 122, but especially Ooncepowhao (121) We have worked here for years but there has been no school. They sent a few children to Onion Lake boarding school. They will no longer do so as they want the day school system. I have sent a Cree teacher there, Ch. Quinaly, an intelligent, educated man (half breed I think)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 607-1, part 1)\nto open school as best he can in his own house, or in the Indian houses. I have to build a house for him. This is not fair to the Church funds which are not meant for schools. I beg to apply (1) for his salary, (2) for purchase of the residence for him, (3) for a school to be built for him (4) for an improved day school to be maintained.\n\nN.B., I would recommend the closing of Onion Lake School, as Boarding school and opening it as improved day school.\n\n2.- Island Lake Band. Nos. 161 and 161A.\n\nWe visit them and hold service there. They belong to our church more than to any other. They come in at times to Onion Lake Church. They should have a school and we are prepared to undertake it on the usual terms.\n\n3.- Thunderchild Band. South from Bright Sand Lake\n\nIt is really a shame that the I.D. has (I believe) given them no school or teacher since they were moved to this location. My Missionary visits them, but only too rarely, since they were moved so far away from his other bands. They should have a good improved day school. The Church of England should be intrusted with its management.\n\n4.- Nut Lake Band, No. 90.\n\nNothing in this lane has ever been done for them. Settlers are now closing in round them, and they need and desire a day school. This ought to be given them without delay. The Church of England is will to try to manage it for the I.D. if the funds are forthcoming. I believe I could get an experienced man and wife (teacher and farm instructors, etc. on U.S.A. Indian reserves) if house and decent salary is forthcoming.\n\n5.- Kinistino Band.\n5.- Kinistino Band, No. 91. Nothing has ever been done by Church or State for this band. They are heathen still. I understand they now desire the school, etc., which formerly they refused. The I.D. ought to give them one.\n\n6.- Stanley Falls\n7.- Pelican Narrows\n\nI have already written for these, if not to you, then to Duncan Scott, Esq., Superintendent of Indian Education. They should have each, a day school for the little ones. They would form capital feeders for the Lac la Ronge and the Pas (when we get it) Boarding Schools.\n\nI should be glad to learn what the I.D. will do and what I, or my missionaries, can do to hasten matters.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully\n\nSgd. J.A. Newnham\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, August 26, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Lordship's communication of the 4th instant regarding the establishment of a school at Frog Lake I beg to say that it is noted that you have sent an a teacher.\n\nIn this connection I would draw Your Lordship's attention to the fact that there are only on these reserves, according to the last census, twelve children of school age, hence the probability of conducting a successful day school must be very small. However, if the man Your Lordship has sent in reports that he has a building in which he can conduct a school, the Department will be prepared to allow a reasonable salary if any success attends the venture. In the meantime the Indian Agent is being communicated with. I shall be pleased to hear further from Your Lordship in regard to this matter when you have had communication with Mr. Quimby.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform the Department that the C. of E. Mission of this place has engaged one, Charles Quinney, to reside on Frog Lake reserve for missionary work among the Indians there.\n\nI must explain that Charles Quinney was formerly a member of Sweetgrass band, attached to Seaskaskootch band 119. The man and his children were discharged from treaty in 1911; his wife is still in treaty and draws on the original ticket, No.16.\n\nA two roomed pole-and-mud shack has been put up this fall; so far only one room is habitable. It is intended to hold school in this house, in fact three children are already enrolled and have attended. I called there on Monday the 10th. instant, but found only Mrs. Quinney and the children at home.\n\nOn my return to Onion Lake I called on Mr. Matheson, principal of the C. of E. Boarding School here, to find out about Charles Quinney's position, and understood from him that it was solely his own (Mr. Matheson's) undertaking.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Hobbs\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 3, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo reporting that Mr. Charles Quinney, who has been appointed for missionary work among the Indians on the Frog Lake Reserve, intends to hold a school in his dwelling house.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Quinney has received no authority from the Department to engage in school work on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Gibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou may remember that a long time ago I applied for a grant from the I.D. for a teacher at Frog Lake. I think the reply was that though the I.D. was not prepared to start in the usual way, that if I would go ahead and put a teacher there, the I.D. would be ready to receive a report of the work done, and then to consider the matter of payment. I beg to report briefly what has been done. Mr. Charles Quinney began teaching school about the first of July last. He had to build his own house and then gather the children together and start teaching with such little outfit as we were able to give him. I give you the following notes from a report I have received from our clergyman there.\n\n(1) We have built two shacks each 16x16.\n(2) There are sixteen children of school age on the reserve.\n(3) The attendance was small because most of the children are barely of school age and are scattered over the reserve. The few that go have attended regularly and made good progress.\n(4) Inspector Chisholm visited the teacher, but not during school hours, looked at the work on the slates, and expressed satisfaction with what he saw. He promised to recommend the I.D. to help in the work.\n(5) If the I.D. takes up the work regularly, it would be advisable by next winter to have arrangements made for driving the children to school.\n(6) The Indians desire a school on the reserve as they do not wish to send their children to the boarding schools at Onion Lake.\n\nCharles Quinney has received from us about $250 for the twelve months work. It is not sufficient. He has had to scrape along in the best way he could, and we have helped him in other little ways. Besides that there is the money that we have spent on the two shacks for his house and the school. I am not sure what this amounts to, but my point is this, that we have done this work for the I.D. in order to show them that the work was worth while and possible. We cannot afford to do this and I think that the I.D. should repay us our outlay on salary and houses, and make definite arrangements to pay the teacher direct from this out. I think that if you write to Mr. Sibbald, your agent there, he will endorse what I have said. There are some Roman Catholics there, and the new chief is one, and they may make a move to have the school entrusted to them, but we are the first in the field, we have begun the education of the children, and I think we have the majority of the Indians. These things ought to be in our favour. Will you do what you can in this matter? First to repay us what we are out of pocket and cannot afford to donate, and second to have the school put on the usual footing, that is to build and equip and to furnish the salary. Whatever school material there is now, either the teacher or the Church provided at their own\nexpense. There should be a proper schoolhouse, also a house for the teacher, with at least two rooms for his family and another room for the mid-day meal. I do not ask an expensive building, only sufficient to carry on the work.\n\nIf this request and report is not sufficiently definite, will you tell me just what you want, and will you communicate with Mr. Sibbald?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. A. Newham\n\nBishop.\n\nSaskatchewan\nExtract.\n\nReport of Inspector W.J. Chisholm on the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nFrog Lake Reserve.\n\nDay School required.\n\n17. There appears to be a demand here for a fully equipped and up-to-date day school, as few of the children belonging to the band are at present being educated.\n\nCharles Quinney, who for some years conducted the Indian Day school on the reserve at Cumberland, has recently built a small schoolhouse and dwelling combined on this reserve with the assistance and under the pay, apparently, of Rev. J.R. Matheson, C. of E. missionary at Onion Lake. At the time of my visit but three children besides his own had attended but he thought there was a prospect of a larger attendance when spring opened. His school, however, under present conditions will not engage the interest of the Indians to any great extent.\nOttawa, July 10, 1914.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the establishment of a school on the Frog Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will be submitted to the Deputy Superintendent General on his return from the west.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His Lordship states that a school has been in operation since the first of July, 1913, under Mr. Charles Quinney and that the church has gone to the expense of putting up buildings and has assumed the cost of the teacher's salary.\n\nThe Department would like you to report on the situation there, stating the number of children of school age on the reserve and the prospect of having a sufficient number in attendance to justify the Department in assuming the cost of maintaining a school there. The Department would like to have this report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibblad, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan wrote to the Department during your absence in the west in reference to the establishment of a day school at Frog Lake. His Lordship stated that a school had been in operation since the first of July, 1913, under Mr. Charles Quinney and that the church had gone to some expense in connection with the buildings and had assumed the cost of the teacher's salary.\n\nMr. Agent Sibbald has been asked for a report as to the number of children of school age on the reserve and the possibility of having a sufficient number in attendance to justify the Department in carrying on the school, but no reply has been received from him as yet.\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Inspector Chisholm's report on the Frog Lake Agency has come hand, in which he says that there appears to be a demand here for a fully equipped and up-to-date school, as few of the children belonging to the band are at present being educated. He refers to the school\nschool being conducted by Mr. Quinney and says that, under present conditions, his school will not engage the interest of the Indians to any great extent.\n\nThe Bishop was informed that the matter would be submitted to you on your return to Ottawa. I think that more information should be had and I would suggest that Mr. Sibbald be again written to for a report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Inspector Ghisholm in his report on the Onion Lake Agency states that there appears to be a demand for a fully equipped and up-to-date school on this reserve and the Department would like to have a full report from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letters No.443013 respectively dated July 10th. and Sept. 14th. last, with regard to the prospect of establishing a day school on the Frog Lake reserve.\n\nDuring one of my very recent visits to the Frog Lake reserve, I made a list of the children of school age. There are 9 boys and 10 girls, of whom 1 boy and 3 girls are enrolled as pupils at the C. of R. Boarding School, and 2 girls at the R. C. Boarding School; both at Onion Lake.\n\nWith regard to the school buildings referred to in your letter of July 10th., I beg to say that they consist of one two-roomed shack that was put up by Chas. Quinney at a cost of about $22.00 and the value of his labour for one month. The school opened in September 1913 and was kept open until Christmas; after that it was open irregularly on account of sickness on the reserve.\n\nThe building is not in a convenient place on the reserve to secure a good attendance, but the teacher, Chas. Quinney, has now hired a house from one of the Indians in which to live and hold school. This house is situated more conveniently and it remains to be seen how it will succeed when school is re-opened. It has not been open since June.\n\nThe families are very much scattered on this reserve and it is impossible to find a site that would be convenient for all. Before deciding anything I would recommend waiting until it is seen how the present arrangement succeeds.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\nW.

Requisitions for the salaries of teachers of day schools should be made out, in duplicate, on the forms provided for that purpose, a supply of which is being sent you herewith. The return for the September quarter from this school, together with a requisition for salary should be forwarded as soon as possible in order that the amount due Mr. Quinney for his services can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Stewart\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI would plead for what seems to me only justice & honesty to a very deserving servant as follows, & I would ask you to do your best to get the J.D. to make whatever liberal allowance they can.\n\nYou will remember that Charles Lucieney taught school at Frog Lake near Qu'Appelle Lake for a year or more partly at our expense partly at his own. Then the J.D. recognized the value of his work, & the need of a school there, & granted him a small salary ($300, I think). I understand (it may have been my mistake) that the J.D. also considered the need of a school-building, & would take it up with the Agent at Qu'Appelle Lake. However, this is what I learn now.\n\nIn July 1913, he built two shacks at his own expense, one to live in, & the other for a class-room. In spring of 1914 he rented a house that was more central for the children, paying the rent out of his meagre salary. He also added a lean-to to the house, & has taught there ever since. He has been out of pocket for (1) two shacks (2) a lean-to & (3) rent.\n\nThe Indians were so pleased with the progress of their children that they agreed to take out logs for a school, & the Chief &\ncouncil gave a site for it as for teacher's house. Mr. Sibbald, the agent, promised to write to the Dept. to ask what help would be given towards the building. Nothing has been heard from him about it. Lumley started to build a house for himself on the given site with the help of the Indians, but the Agent said he could not do so without the permission of the Dept., so he stopped, discouraged.\n\nNow here is a case where Teacher, pupils, & Indians are all willing & eager to do their best & more than their share. The work has been commenced. The teacher is studying with the utmost desire to become more proficient. The school & the house are both needed by August. I would ask (1) that a generous recompense be paid to Lumley for the use of his buildings for two years past; (2) that the grant of the site by Chief & Council be approved; (3) that the willingness of the people be met half-way by a suitable grant towards the expense of building a school or a small residence, & that Mr. Sibbald be instructed to pay Mr. Lumley for the past, & to meet the Indians' desire, & to help in the building without delay.\n\nWith best regards to yourself,\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\nJ. A. Saskatchewan\nBishop\n\nP.S. I believe I never let you know that I agreed to your shortening of the name of the Pas school to \"Mackay Indian Boarding School.\" Forgive me, & please let that name be entered on your official records.\nJuly 19th, 1915.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham -\n\nI have your communication of the 10th instant, in reference to the Frog Lake School. I find upon an examination of the returns that the enrolment and attendance have been very small during the first three quarters that the school was in operation. The return for the June quarter is not yet to hand, but I regret very much to state that unless there is a decided improvement the Department would not be justified in incurring the expenditure necessary to erect a new building. It is our wish to deal fairly with Mr. Quinney, and the Department will pay the rent for the building which he has been using, and the agent will be instructed to submit a voucher.\n\nWith regard to payment for the buildings he erected in the first place, unless they can be used for school purposes, the Department could not purchase them. I understand that there was but a very small\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nsmall sum of cash paid by Mr. Quinney in connection with the construction of these buildings. I shall, however, have further enquiries made.\n\nI may state that Mr. Sibbald reported to the Department regarding a new school, but his letter was inadvertently overlooked. The Agent is now being written for a further report in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CROMBIE ON THE FROG LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nAge of pupils is from 7 to 10 years.\n\nRegularity of attendance\u2014not at all satisfactory.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nWhile a desire is shown by the Indians on this reserve for the establishment of a day school, yet owing to the scattered situation of their dwellings, the question as to whether a good attendance will be got without establishing transport is doubtful.\n\nReport dated\u2014March 6th, 1916.\n**REPORT of Provisions used at Frog Lake Day School on Frog Lake Reserve, for Month ended June 30th 1917**\n\n| Item     | On hand 1st of June | Received during Month | Used during Month | On hand at end of Month | Remarks |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------|\n| FLOUR    |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BACON    | 34 8c               |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BEEF     |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| TEA      | 3 11 8c             |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| RICE     |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| SOAP     |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| SUGAR    |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| SALT     |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| POTATOES |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BISCUITS | 36                  |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| BEANS    |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| OATMEAL  |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n| PEAS     |                     |                       |                  |                         |         |\n\nCertified Correct,\n\nChas.

He also states that he visited the school on the 21st ultimo and that only one pupil was present. He says that the parents are away to get work among the settlers and have taken their families with them.\n\nI may say that the highest enrolment at this school since it was opened in September, 1914, has been ten, the highest average five, and the mean average only 4.3.\n\nIn view of the poor attendance at this school the Department does not consider that it would be justified in keeping it open after the end of the current quarter.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 607-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 15, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Frog Lake Day School for the month of September last, in which you state that you visited this school on the 11th, after school hours, and that an examination of the register showed an average of 3.6 since the re-opening of the school on August 30th, and when you visited it again on the 21st ultimo only one pupil was there, I beg to say that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan is being informed that, in view of the poor attendance at this school, the Department does not consider that it would be justified in keeping it open after the end of the current quarter. His Lordship has been asked to inform Mr. Quinney, the teacher, that his services will not be required after the 31st of December, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 15th inst. No. 443013/1 informing me that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan was being informed that the Department does not feel justified in keeping the Frog Lake school open in view of the poor attendance recorded.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I regret very much that the Department desires to close this school. I hope that my reference in any respect to only one being present on Oct 21st has not led the Department to its decision.\n\nI would explain that at the time mentioned nearly all the families were absent from the reserve. I was on my return journey from the north and on my way going north on the 11th I had spoken to the Indians about the good wages to be earned among the settlers and with the thirsting spirits moving about the country and found on my return that a number of them had moved out to look for work on my advice and had taken their families with them. It is true the attendance is poor and it is only recently I have spoken with the...\nIndians and with the teacher about it. The general impression is that if a building could be built in a more central position there would be better attendance. There are several children at the north end of the lake that would attend if the school was nearer them and it was suggested that I would try to get a building more convenient. The Indians know had a building in their mind which it was probable I could get a house belonging to Joseph Delorme which he has not been living in for some months. However at the time did not encourage the idea telling them that I expected that when the war was over and times grew better the Department would consider the advisability of building a proper school which would be placed in the most advantageous position. I did not at the time however anticipate that the Department proposed closing the school. The teacher said if he could still have the use of the house that he is now living in which costs the Dept $14.50 per month, that he would be willing to travel between the two places morning and evening distances of about 14 miles if the Joseph Delorme house could be purchased. I don't know if he is going to live in it this winter but if he is not I think the house could be rented at about $5.00 per month.\nOutside Mr. Chattingup duties as a school teacher he interests himself in many ways in the welfare of the Indians. He attends their meetings and gives them good advice; the Indians in return respect him & have come to look to him for advice. He is at times of considerable help to me and if he is moved I would miss him very much. One thing in particular I would mention about him he was helpful in stopping the Indians from having a third dance last June which they were very persistent in trying to hold. Should the Department entertain the idea of trying how the school would succeed by holding it in Delore house I would suggest doing so rather than recommencing the closing of the school altogether.\n\nI hope the Department will accept this letter in the spirit in which it is meant & reconsider its decision in reference to the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

You may make arrangements for securing Joseph Delver's house, to which you refer, for school purposes and the Department will allow him $5.00 a month rent for this building while it is used for this purpose.\n\nI may inform you, however, that unless there is a decided improvement in the attendance at this school during the remainder of the school year the Department will be forced to close it.\n\nBishop Newnham is being advised of the Department's decision in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW.

Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI received your letter lately (of Oct. 16th., No. 445013/1) from your department, saying that in consequence of the lack of pupils the Frog Lake School would be closed after Dec. 31st. I was much distressed as I knew that the teacher was doing faithful work, & it is the only Day School in that large Indian district, while the Onion Lake Boarding School is already as full as the I.D. grant allows.\n\nI have just received a letter from Rev. E. Ahenakew, my missionary there, lamenting the proposal to close the school. He says that Mr. Sibbald, Indian Agent strongly recommends that it be kept open because (1) It is doing good work, (2) the teacher, Charles Quinney has a good influence on the Indians. Mr. Sibbald says that the fault of the lack of attendance in summer is largely his own, that he advised the Indians to go across the river & help the farmers with the harvest. They will be more at the Reserve now. I hope therefore that you will reconsider the closing of the school, & be guided by Mr. Sibbald's recommendation to keep it open.\n\nI beg to remain yours faithfully,\n\nJ.A.

Quinney, the Tiny Lake Indian school teacher, and would like to know if there is a chance of getting money from him through you. Mr. Quinney has owed me an account for some time, but since Aug. 1st has not paid any on it. I have sent him several drafts, but in vain. I thought you might be able to hold back part of his salary until it was all paid. His account with me is $177.12.\n\nPlease let me have a reply on this by return mail, and if this is not the place to write to, could you advise me better?\n\nThanking you in advance, I am\n\nYours Respt,\n\nJohn Adams\nPost master and Gen. Merchant\nat Hempsburg Alta.\nOttawa, March 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you request that the Department retain an amount from the salary due Charles Quinney, teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School, to pay the amount of his indebtedness to yourself.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no authority to collect the money due you.

During the past three years he has also received bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum.\n\nPrevious to teaching in this school, Mr. Quinney taught five or six years in Indian Schools.\n\nHe has no professional qualifications, having only passed the high school entrance for the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThere is an enrollment of 23 pupils, with an average attendance of only seven.\n\nThe late Inspector Crombie, who made the last inspection of this school, remarks regarding the work \"he appears only to be able to get his pupils to a certain point, which does not extend beyond elementary subjects. The discipline is good\". The pupils are mostly in the first and second standard.\n\nMr. Quinney is an Indian, and received his education in Emmanuel College, Prince Albert, which was one of our boarding schools.\n\nExcept for the bonus, Mr. Quinney has had no increase in salary since he began work at this school, and in view of his long service, which meets the requirements at this school, we might allow him an increase of $100.00 from the first of the present fiscal year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Do you think it wise to keep a place of this description open? It seems to me to be rather an expensive operation, and that we are obtaining little or no result for the expenditure incurred.\n\nAt the time of my visit to this agency in August, 1921, I learned that the teacher, Mrs. C.

In view of the fact that the school was closed through illness, salary and bonus for the full month will be paid.\n\nWe note that Mr. Quinney is recovering, and that it is expected that he will be able to re-open the school in about two weeks from the date of your letter. He should state, when he is preparing his return for the current quarter, the dates on which the school was closed on account of his illness, and salary will be allowed him for the period the school was so closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I sincerely regret to report the death of Mr. Charles Quinney, teacher at the Indian Day School, Frog Lake reserve, from typhoid fever on Friday the 12th, instant.\n\nAs reported in my letter above quoted, Mr. Quinney appeared to be making a good recovery, but a few days ago he had a sudden relapse from which he never recovered.\n\nThe Rev. E. Ahenakew, of the Onion Lake Anglican Mission has informed me that he is taking up the matter of a successor to Mr. Quinney, as teacher, with Archdeacon McKay, and that he will later communicate with me in regard to it.\n\nMrs. Quinney, the widow, is left in very straightened circumstances and if the Department can see its way to help her by granting her a gratuity it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWe should pay as much salary as the Gen. will allow.\n\nR.J.F.\nOttawa, October 24th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department of the death, on the 12th instant, of Mr. Charles Quinney, late teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that the death of Mr. Quinney is much regretted.\n\nCheques which were drawn in his favour for the salary and bonus due for the quarter ending September 30th, last, were sent on the 12th instant. It may be that when these cheques arrive, Mrs. Quinney will be unable to have them cashed. If so, they should be returned to the Department, and new cheques will be issued in her favour. It will be necessary to give the christian name of Mrs. Quinney.\n\nWe have no funds provided from which a gratuity can be paid the widow. We will, however, continue salary and bonus until such time as the Church authorities appoint a teacher and he takes up duties, provided such appointment is made within a reasonable length of time. It will, however, not be possible to continue payment of salary to Mrs. Quinney after the teacher who is appointed takes up duties. In order to continue payment in favour of Mrs. Quinney, she will be classed as substitute teacher.\n\nWe note that the Church authorities are taking up the matter of a successor to Mr. Quinney.

RE: FROG LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nFROG LAKE: With regard to filling the place of Mr. Quinney, the Indian school teacher who died recently at Frog Lake, we have a splendid chance of a fully qualified teacher there, Mr. Alexander Peterson, and I have asked Mr. Ahenskew to send in a full statement of qualifications and character. Both seem to be what we want, and the Indian Agent decidedly approves. Of course it is the qualified teacher stipend that is needed.\n\n(Sgd.) George Exton Lloyd\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nL. Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received a letter from the Bishop in which he said, \"you will have the added responsibility of looking after the filling of day schools ......... we in the Western part of the diocese.\"\n\nActing on this I would submit, for your consideration, the appointment of Mr. Alex. Petersen of Frog Lake, to the Frog Lake Indian Day School. His qualifications will prove to be satisfactory to the Department; as, I am sure they will be to us. He has a 2nd Class Teacher's Certificate and his previous record, judged by Inspector's reports, is very good.\n\nApart from this his home is within a mile and a half of the school, and in the event of his appointment, there will be no necessity of having to worry over the housing of the teacher.\n\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nJan 14th 1924.\nI would also suggest that the dispensing of medicines be placed in his hands.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdward Atherton New...\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my letter of October 15th last, reporting the death of Mr. Charles Quinney, teacher at the Indian Day School at Frog Lake, I beg to report that Mr. Alex Peterson of Frog Lake has made application for the vacancy.\n\nOn December 18th last, accompanied by the Rev. E. Ahenakew, of the Onion Lake Anglican Mission, I called upon Mr. Peterson at his home with reference to his application. He is a young married man, about 25 years of age, and his home is situated about 17 miles from the Frog Lake Indian schoolhouse on the edge of the Frog Lake reserve. He is in possession of a second (2nd) class Teacher's certificate for Alberta, and I enclose herewith his last inspection report. With respect to salary he told us that he would be willing to accept the appointment at a rate of $800.00 per annum, plus bonus and the allowance of $50.00 made to the late teacher for dispensing simple medicines to the Indians of the Frog Lake reserve.\n\nBoth Mr. Ahenakew and myself were favourably impressed with Mr. Peterson and we left the matter for Mr. Ahenakew to write to Bishop Lloyd recommending Mr. Peterson, and to afterwards let me know the Bishop's reply, the substance of which I would transmit to the Department. However, it now appears that the responsibility of nominating teachers for Anglican Indian Schools in this diocese, has devolved upon Mr. Ahenakew, since the death of Archdeacon McKay. Mr. Ahenakew told me this yesterday and requested me to write the Department recommending Mr. Peterson, and I asked him to give me a letter to that effect. This he did and I enclose it herewith.\n\nKindly return the Report of Inspector of Schools on teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Jan. 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the application of Mr. Alex. Peterson for the position of teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School and enclosing a communication from Rev. E. Ahenakew, recommending his appointment, together with a report from the Public School Inspector as to the success which he has met in white schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Peterson, to begin duties at as early a date as possible. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $800 per annum, on a basis of ten teaching months in the year. He will also be entitled to the bonus provided by law, which during the present fiscal year is at the rate of $15 per teaching month. Besides the salary and bonus allowed as teacher, he will be granted an allowance of $50 for the dispensing of medicines to the Indians of the Frog Lake Reserve. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Peterson of his appointment and arrange with him to take up duties at the earliest convenient date. Kindly inform the Department as to whether he accepts the position and the date on which he begins duties.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of October 24th, last, salary and bonus will be continued to Mrs. Quinney, wife of the former teacher, until such time as the new incumbent begins duties. As soon as we have the information as to the date Mr. Peterson commences work, we will pay Mrs. Quinney the balance of salary and bonus due to that time. I shall be pleased if you will give Mr. Peterson every assistance you can on taking up his duties at the Frog Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nONION LAKE, SASK.\nOttawa, Jan. 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is approving of the appointment of Mr. Alex. Peterson, who holds a Second Class Teacher's Certificate for the Province of Alberta, as teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School to begin duties as soon as possible. He is being appointed to succeed Mr. Charles Quinney, who died on the 18th of October, last. The salary allowed Mr. Peterson will be at the rate of $800 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of salary and bonus will be based on ten teaching months in the year. He will also be allowed payment at the rate of $50 per annum for the dispensing of medicines to the Indians of the Frog Lake Reserve. Mr. Lang Turner, Indian Agent at Onion Lake, has been informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 24, 1924.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nMr. Agent Turner, Onion Lake, has forwarded the application of Mr. Alex. Peterson, who holds a Second Class Teacher's Certificate for the Province of Alberta, for the position as teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School. The Agent also forwarded a communication from Rev. E. Ahenakew endorsing Mr. Peterson's application. The Department has approved of his appointment, to begin duties as soon as possible. The salary allowed is at the rate of $800 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Payment of salary and bonus will be based on ten teaching months in the year. Mr. Peterson will also be allowed payment at the rate of $50 per annum for the dispensing of medicines to the Indians of the Frog Lake Reserve.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. Peterson will meet with every success in his work at Frog Lake.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMarch 14, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of January 23rd, last, No. 115-4-1, approving of the appointment of Mr. Alex Peterson as teacher at the Frog Lake Indian Day School, and to inform you that Mr. Peterson commenced duty on February 25th, the Day School being re-opened upon that date.\n\nAt the end of the current quarter the Day School return will be forwarded to the Department made up from February 25th, to March 31st; and I would ask the Department to pay Mrs. Quinney's salary and bonus up to, and including February 24th.\n\nI enclose herewith Voucher No. 213, amounting to $7.65, in favour of Mrs. Quinney, for dispensing medicines.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI was examining the file in connection with the Frog Lake Indian Day School and I find that the Inspector's report, enclosed with your 99-1 of January 14, 1924, was not returned. I am enclosing it and would be grateful if you would see that it reaches Mr. Peterson.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nKindly permit me to draw to your attention that in addition to my duties as teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School, I perform for the Indians numerous services for which I receive no remuneration. In fact my extra duties to the Indians almost equal that of a Farm Instructor. Let me mention a few things I do under direction and authority of the Indian Agent: Issuing permits, coyote bounties, orders, rations and clothing to needy Indians, garden seeds, etc. I also measure hay and otherwise help the Indians with their many problems. My wife assists sick Indians that may ask for help and also prepares the mid-day meal for the school children.\n\nFor the past four years we have\nbeen doing this work without pay and I don't think its fair, nor can it be expected, that we should continue to do so without a small remuneration.\n\nI should be very pleased to hear from you in regard to this matter and trusting that you will give it your careful consideration.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.E. Peterson\nOttawa, January 31, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant, I may say the Department is in correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Turner regarding the duties which you and your wife perform on behalf of Indians of Frog Lake and vicinity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.E. Peterson, Esq.,\nFrog Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, January 31, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith for your report and recommendation copy of a letter of the 17th instant from Mr. A.E. Peterson, teacher of the Indian School at Frog Lake, in which he requests additional remuneration for services which he and his wife render to Indians of the Frog Lake District. Kindly deal with this matter at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31 ultimo, No. 115-4-1, enclosing copy of one received from Mr. A. E. Peterson, teacher at the Indian school at Frog Lake reserve in this Agency.\n\nWhat Mr. Peterson states in his letter is quite true. There is no Farming Instructor at Frog Lake reserve, and when Mr. Peterson first started to teach the Indian School there, he commenced doing little extra jobs, in connection with the Indians, voluntarily. In the course of the four years that he has been living on the reserve this little extra work has so grown, that now the Indians of the band look upon him as one whose duty it is to attend to them. I also have become accustomed to rely upon Mr. Peterson for information in connection with the reserve, such as the reporting of cases of sick Indians, etc.\n\nMr. Peterson is a very willing man and has never made the slightest objection to doing anything that I have requested him to do. Mrs. Peterson is also very willing and at times has been a great help to the Indian women of the band. In my annual estimates for 1927/8 and 1928/9 I placed an item of $150.00 for remuneration for Mrs. Peterson's services not entirely because I considered she should be paid, but also because the fact that Mr. Peterson would look upon the granting of this to his wife, as some small recognition of his extra services.\n\nIn connection with this matter I would refer the Department to my letter of March 28th., 1927, No. 99-1, and its reply dated April 7th., No. 11-115. If the Department can see its way to either pay Mrs. Peterson the amount of $150 per annum placed in the estimates for her services, or to increase Mr. Peterson's salary by a like amount, I feel sure they would both be satisfied. Besides being an excellent teacher, Mr. Peterson is a great help to the Department in many other ways.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 16, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the request of Mr. A. E. Peterson, teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School, that an increased remuneration be allowed for the extra services being performed by Mrs. Peterson and himself.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will allow an increase in Mr. Peterson's salary as teacher from the 1st of April, next, the beginning of the next fiscal year, of $10 per teaching month. This will make the salary allowed him from that date at the rate of $105 per teaching month. This increase in salary is granted because of the special services mentioned above which he and his wife are giving. Please inform Mr. Peterson of the increase that will be allowed him from the above mentioned date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOctober 25, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nOn January 31st last the Department wrote me, enclosing copy of a letter which it had received from Mr. A. E. Peterson, teacher at the Frog Lake Indian Day School, in which he applied for an increase of salary. To this letter I replied on February 7th, and, on February 16th, the Department informed me that it had been decided to increase Mr. Peterson's salary $100 per annum.\n\nMr. Peterson is still not quite satisfied with his salary, but, I feel sure, would be if the Department could see its way to give him a further increase of $100 per annum. He is, in my opinion, the best of our Indian Day School teachers, and I would respectfully recommend that he be given the increase asked for. I should add that, besides being the school teacher, he acts as an overseer to the Frog Lake band, there being no Farming Instructor, or other official in the pay of the Department, on the Frog Lake reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 2, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 99-1 of the 25th ultimo, urging the Department to increase the salary of Mr. A. E. Peterson, teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School. In view of your report, concerning this teacher's satisfactory services, the Department has given favourable consideration. He is at present in receipt of $1050 for the 10 teaching months and an additional $50 as dispenser. Rather than increase his salary as teacher, the Department has decided to give him the maximum salary for dispensers, viz., $120 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\nFROG LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI called at this school on October 11th. There are 6 boys and 3 girls enrolled. They have the same difficulty at this school as at Cold Lake with regard to getting an attendance. Mr. A. Petersen, the teacher, appears to be bright and anxious to make his school a success, but the conditions are rather against him.\n\nI noted the school was whitewashed and the floors oiled. A stone foundation has been placed under the teacher's residence and a frame lean-to kitchen added. Provision has been made in the Estimates for finishing this residence inside and making it more comfortable.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nFROG LAKE DAY SCHOOL (C. of E.)\n\nI visited this school on March 3rd, and found 5 boys and 2 girls present out of an enrolment of 12. There are 5 pupils who attend very regularly. The school room was tidy, and the children appeared warmly clad. They are provided with a bowl of soup at mid-day with meat and rice.\n\nMr. Alex Peterson, the teacher, is well qualified, and appears to have a good influence on the reserve.\nOctober 28, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR.

Peterson, teacher of the Indian Day School at Frog Lake, Alberta, was appointed in January, 1924, at a salary of $95 per teaching month and a grant of $60 per annum as dispenser of medicines. He was nominated by Bishop Lloyd, of Prince Albert. No reference is made to the Civil Service Commission in connection with appointments at Indian day schools. At the present time, Mr. Peterson receives a salary of $1050 for the ten teaching months and $120 per annum as dispenser.

It is claimed that Mrs. Peterson prepares the mid-day meal for the pupils, and also instructs them in knitting and sewing, for which she receives no remuneration whatever, whereas it is claimed that the wives of teachers at other Day Schools are in receipt of a regular salary. Mrs. Hobert, wife of the teacher at Le Goff, is cited as an instance where $50.00 per month is paid.\n\nThe Minister would like a memorandum dealing with the duties of Mrs. Peterson, and also the duties of the wives of other teachers, who are in receipt of a regular salary or allowance.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nNovember 10, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 4th instant, regarding Mrs. Peterson, wife of the teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School, I submit the following information:\n\nMr. Peterson, teacher of the Indian Day School at Frog Lake, was appointed in January, 1924, at a salary of $95 a teaching month and a grant of $50 a year as dispenser of medicines. He was nominated by Bishop Lloyd of Prince Albert. In February, 1928, the Indian agent reported that Mrs. Peterson had been a great help to the Indian women of the Band and suggested that she be allowed remuneration for her services at the rate of $150 a year. Instead of allowing a salary to Mrs. Peterson, the Department increased Mr. Peterson's salary by $10 a teaching month and also allowed him an increase in his salary as dispenser. At the present time, Mr. Peterson is paid $105 a teaching month, plus a grant of $120 a year as dispenser. Both these are subject to a deduction of 10% during the current fiscal year. The enrolment at the Frog Lake School during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1932, was 15 and the average attendance 6.\n\nYou will note, from the above, that Mr. Peterson's salary was increased due to the work his wife was doing on the reserve. No specific duties have been assigned to her. Any services she is performing are being done without formal instructions from the Department.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Hobert were appointed at the Cold Lake School, in 1928, instructions were issued by the Department that Mrs. Hobert would not only assist in the preparation of the pupils' midday meal, instruct the girls in sewing, mending, knitting and cooking, but would also visit the Indian homes on the reserve. With reference to her, you will note that she was appointed at the same time as her husband and definite duties assigned to her. Her salary, at the present time, is $50 a teaching month, less 10% during the current fiscal year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, December 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 309-11 of the 4th ultime, forwarding the report of the Public School Inspector on his inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School. It is noted that the attendance at this school has fallen off considerably and that the daily average, during the September quarter, last, has been between 2 and 9 pupils, out of an enrolment of 13. It is further noted that the absence of the children from school is due, principally, to insufficient interest on the part of the parents, who are constantly on the move from place to place.\n\nIn view of the attendance and the lack of the parents' interest, it is considered that it would be advisable to close this school at the end of the present school year, viz.: June 30, 1933.\n\nThose children on the Frog Lake reserve who are of school age and in good health could be recruited to residential schools of the denomination to which they belong.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your opinion as to whether you concur in the closing of this school at the time mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nFROG LAKE DAY SCHOOL\n\nI visited this school on the evening of the 19th of October. The children had gone home before my arrival. I had also visited this school last March when I made a complete inspection of the school but did not submit a report at that time.\n\n- Mr. A. E. Peterson\nMr. A. E. Peterson, the Teacher, is earnest and conscientious in the discharge of his duties. He is a qualified teacher, holding a Second Class Interim Certificate for the Province of Alberta. There are fourteen pupils enrolled, five boys and nine girls. The average attendance is about 50% of the enrollment. This varies at different periods of the year, owing to the fact that the Indians follow hunting and trapping as a means of livelihood and this occupation takes them from their homes from time to time during the year for extended periods. I may say that, as this Reserve is situated about thirty miles from the Agency headquarters and there is no farming instructor in charge, Mr. Peterson is of great value to the Agent in connection with the supervision of the Reserve. He dispenses the medicines and rations to the old and sick and keeps a general oversight over the Band. He is always ready to give his time towards helping out the work on the Reserve, and this, coupled with his duties as teacher, would justify keeping the school in operation. Until these Indians settle down to farming seriously and reside more regularly on the Reserve, we cannot look for very satisfactory attendance at the school.\n\nW. Murray,\nInspector.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter No. 115-4-1, dated the 1st instant, with reference to the attendance and lack of parent's interest in the Frog Lake Indian Day School, and note that it is considered that it would be advisable to close this school at the end of the present school year, viz June 30th, 1933.\n\nI am today writing the Indian Agent asking him to have a meeting with the parents and members of the Frog Lake Band and place before them the Department's decision and give them the reason for it. I would suggest that the matter of closing the school be given further consideration and that the decision be held in abeyance until it is seen whether the efforts of the Agent will result in a satisfactory average attendance of the enrollment for the March and June quarters of 1933. My reason in suggesting this is that there is no farming instructor on this Reserve, which is situated about thirty-five miles from the Agency, and the teacher, Mr. Alex. Peterson, has been of great assistance to the Indian Agent in connection with the supervision of this Band of Indians. He has issued the rations to the old and destitute, dispensed the medicines, and kept in close touch with the activities on the Reserve, and, as I said before, has been of great assistance to the Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11 of the 6th instant, stating your views on the suggestion of the Department, that the Frog Lake Indian Day School be closed as from June 30th, next, on account of poor attendance. In this connection it is noted that you are requesting the local Indian Agent to have a meeting with the parents and members of the Band. The final decision, regarding the closing of this school on the date mentioned, will be held in abeyance until it is known whether the efforts of the Agent will improve the attendance. You might again draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, giving your opinion concerning the closing or the continuing of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM J. T. HILL, Acting Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask., His No. 99-19, dated January 30, 1933.\n\nThe Frog Lake Day School, in my opinion, should not be closed. It has an enrolment of twelve with a highly qualified, capable teacher, who, in addition to his teaching duties, does much of the work done by farm instructors elsewhere in the way of rationing the old people, distributing relief and looking after things generally. There is no farm instructor at this point and the closing of this school would deprive us of the services of the teacher, Mr. A. E. Petersen.\nOttawa, February 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the Frog Lake Indian Day School, I have to say it is noted that there is an enrolment of 12 children, with a qualified, capable teacher in charge, who, in addition to teaching duties, does much of the farm instructor's work, looks after the distribution of relief and matters generally.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department will approve of this school remaining in operation during the coming fiscal year, and provision has been made in our Estimates for salary, etc. It is hoped that there will be a regular attendance of all Indian children of school age on the reserve. Mr. Murison will be informed of the Department's approval for the continuing of this school.\n\nYou will be further advised, in a separate communication, concerning the Long Lake Indian Day School and recruiting for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, February 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to official letter dated December 10, 1932, regarding the question of closing the Frog Lake Indian Day School as from June 30th, next, I have now to inform you that a report has been received from Mr. J. T. Hill, Acting Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask. He states that there is an enrolment of 12 pupils, with a qualified, capable teacher, who, in addition to teaching duties, performs certain work as farm instructor, distributes relief and attends to other matters in connection with the reserve. He therefore recommends that the school be continued in operation. He is being informed that, in view of his recommendation, the Department will approve of the continuing of school activities there during the coming fiscal year at least, as funds have been provided in our Estimates for teacher's salary and other expenses.\n\nI may add, however, that the Department is considering the closing of the Long Lake Indian Day School, and in this connection you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Provincial School Inspector J. L. Gibault's report of an inspection which he made of the Frog Lake Indian Day School in the Onion Lake Agency on the 29th ultimo.\n\nThe report in so far as the ability of the teacher is concerned is quite satisfactory. I am quite familiar with Mr. Peterson and his attention to his duties and may say apart from the work he is performing as teacher, he is of great assistance to the Indian Agent as he issues rations and medicines to destitutes and sick on the Reserve and keeps the Agent informed regarding matters and conditions on the Reserve. This Reserve is situated thirty-five miles from the Agency headquarters and, as there is no farming instructor, Mr. Peterson performs the duties of overseer as well as those of teacher.\n\nThe attendance at this school is very irregular. This is due to the fact that a large percentage of the Indians obtain their livelihood from hunting and trapping, working out for white settlers scrubbing land, and occupations which take them away from their Reserve. As they have no facilities for leaving their children at the school, they have to take them along and consequently the attendance at the school suffers. Until such time as these Indians take up farming and stock raising seriously as a source of livelihood, it cannot be expected that the attendance at the day school will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 2, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11 of the 25th ultimo, enclosing the Provincial School Inspector's report on his recent inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School in the Onion Lake Agency. It is noted that on the day of the Inspector's visit only one pupil was present.\n\nIn view of the irregular attendance of the Indian children and the lack of interest on the part of the parents, it is considered that, unless there is a decided improvement in the attendance after the holidays, it would be a waste of money to continue this school in operation. The children would be better off if placed in a residential school. You might discuss this matter with Mr. Agent Hill and advise later whether you would recommend that the school be continued in operation or not.\n\nI have noted the satisfactory services which Mr. Peterson, the teacher, is performing, both in his work in the classroom and in the assistance he gives to the Indian Agent in the issuing of medicines and rations to destitutes and sick on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. W. MURISON, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES, DATED AUGUST 1st, 1936, REGARDING VISIT OF INSPECTOR J. L. GIBAULT TO THE FROG LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL ON MAY 18th, 1936.\n\nOriginal on No. 115-4-6.\n\nA perusal of this report does not disclose a very satisfactory condition of affairs and I am so informing the Indian Agent. Insofar as the usefulness of this school is concerned, it would appear to me that the Indians do not appreciate having a school on their Reserve as shown by the attendance. It only serves as an excuse to keep them from sending their children to the residential schools. We have two residential schools at Onion Lake, thirty-five miles distant from the Reserve, and in my opinion it would be more in the interest of the children if this school were closed and the children compelled to attend the residential schools. The chief reason for carrying on this school in the past has been that the teacher, Mr. A. E. Peterson, has been of material assistance to the Indian Agent in supervising the Indians and acting as dispenser of medicines and rations to them. There is no farming instructor on the Reserve. In my opinion it would be much better to appoint a farming instructor rather than carry on under present conditions.\nOttawa, August 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Inspector Gibault's report regarding his inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School on May 14th, last.\n\nThe Inspector was not very well satisfied with the work that is being done.\n\nThe Department would appreciate if you would give this school your special attention during the coming academic year and encourage the teacher to put forth a better effort. Unless decided progress is shown before the end of June next, it will be necessary to consider closing the school and dispensing with Mr. Peterson's services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-4-1, of the 13th instant, with reference to Inspector Gibault's report on the Frog Lake Indian Day School. The Department's comment has been fully noted.\n\nMr. Peterson, the teacher, and I have been doing all we can to make the school justify its existence but have only partially succeeded. In order to get a better attendance we have been using moral suasion with the parents and in some instances compulsion, but we find it difficult to compete with our Residential Schools where they have so much more to offer. Twenty-four children from this reserve are in residence at the Onion Lake Boarding School - Four at the C. of E., and twenty at the R. C., while the enrolment at the Day School on the reserve is but twelve. The children in the Residential Schools are properly clothed and well nourished and do not have to expose themselves in severe weather to get to their class rooms, whereas the average child attending the Day School is insufficiently clad, is exposed to all kinds of weather getting to and from school, which in many instances is a considerable distance, and gets one mid-day meal for five months only. The Indians have a decided preference for the Day School, and I like it because I think it serves their requirements better than any other, but, in my opinion, it will never be the success it should be unless put on a better and more generous basis. I would respectfully recommend that the mid-day meal be made continuous throughout the teaching year, and that each pupil enrolled be given a complete outfit of suitable clothing, consisting of a tweed suit, overcoat, cap, mitts, boots or mocassins, two pairs of socks or stockings, and two shirts and two suits of underwear. In addition, the matter of transportation to and from school for the winter months should be considered. We have four Indian Day Schools in the Agency with a total enrolment of seventy, distributed as follows: Frog Lake 12, Long Lake 18, Island Lake 14, and Waskesiu's 26. The probable cost of clothing would depend largely on the quality, but a per capita allowance of approximately $15.00 should procure a suitable equipment. The cost of the mid-day meal for an additional five months would just be double the amount expended for that purpose at present, and transportation for the four winter months would be approximately $10.00 per month for each school.\n\nThe drafting of children for the Residential Schools\nSchools from reserves where there are Day Schools should cease excepting under special circumstances, where a child is orphaned or living too remote from a Day School to attend regularly.\n\nI fully realize that if these recommendations are put into effect they will result in a substantial increase in the cost of operating Indian Day Schools, but I feel sure that the results will justify the expenditure, and the total cost of educating a child in the Day School would still be considerably less than one half the amount required for maintenance in the Residential School, and it is my considered opinion that the ex-pupil from a good Day School is just as well or perhaps better equipped to take up his position in the reserve as his brother from the Residential School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the Frog Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIf clothing was furnished to all pupils of Indian day schools in the manner you suggest it is doubtful if $15 a year would be sufficient. At any rate, if such action was favourable considered, it would be a matter of relief and not an expenditure from the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nIt is also doubtful if transportation could be arranged at $10 a month. In some other places where transportation has been provided the cost has been much higher. In many cases it has been found difficult to secure the children, as those residing at some distance from the school did not arise early enough in the morning to permit the driver to reach the school for nine o'clock.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that Indian parents residing on a reserve where a day school is located, and who are in a position to support their children, should not be allowed to send their children to a residential school. This is a matter, however, that would have to be decided by yourself in co-operation with the principals of the residential schools who recruit on those reserves where Indian day schools are located.

However, the Department has been assured from time to time that Mr. Peterson, the teacher, is rendering valuable service on the reserve, apart from his teaching duties. It is noted also that he is a dispenser of medicine to the Indians. Insofar as his actual teaching ability is concerned the reports appear to be uniformly good.\n\nIf you are convinced that a married man can be secured for this school, whose services would increase the actual attendance and contribute to the welfare of the Indian population on the reserve, I can see no reason why you should not discuss the matter personally with the Anglican Bishop responsible for the nomination of the teacher. Mr. Peterson, who is a married man, was appointed to this position by Bishop Lloyd, who was then Bishop of Prince -\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nPrince Albert, in the year 1924. It is just possible that Mr. Peterson could be transferred to another reserve, where the teaching duties would occupy all of his time.\n\nApart from anything the Agent may recommend, I should like to have an expression of opinion from you, after you have had an interview with the Bishop, with respect to:\n\n(a) Closing this school and transferring the pupils now in attendance to residential schools, or,\n\n(b) changing the teacher and putting in a man better trained and equipped to give instruction to the Indians in farming, etc., or,\n\n(c) a whole-hearted attempt to increase the attendance under the present teacher.\n\nIt is not necessary that you should interview the Bishop immediately, but I would like to have a recommendation from you prior to the close of the present academic year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFrog Lake, Alta\nJan. 15, 1940\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nRegina.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nAt a Convention of the Independent Political Association of Alexandra held at Marwayne I was nominated a candidate to contest the next Provincial Election. I accepted this nomination somewhat reluctantly, knowing that it would interfere with my duties here on the Reserve, and that I would probably be forced to resign.\n\nI never sought this nomination nor did any campaigning on my behalf; but the majority of the 63 delegates present decided it was up to me to stand and having been a resident of this district for 28 years and interested in the welfare and good government of this province I could not very well refuse.\n\nThe Association I now represent is comprised of the Liberal and Conservative parties and others interested in the defeat of the Social Credit Govt. I feel that with an Independent Govt. in power at Edmonton much more assistance and cooperation could be given the Federal Govt. in the prosecution of the war and other matters than is possible under the present regime.\n\nThe Provincial Election will no doubt\nheld this spring or early summer, and it will then be necessary for me to give my whole time to the campaign and would need leave of absence from my duties. The wife will of course be home to carry on with the Homemakers' Club etc but would necessitate another teacher taking my place in the school.\n\nI have talked this matter over with Dr. Hill and he suggests that possibly I could engage a teacher to act for me while I take away. Should I be defeated in the election my wish is of course to continue here as I have no other home or job to go to. If successful other arrangements would have to be made.\n\nI am leaving this matter entirely up to you Mr. Robertson to decide if you wish that I resign I will of course have to do so.\n\nTrusting to hear from you soon on this matter and in the meantime I am carrying on as usual.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.E. Peterson\n\nP.S. If this request for leave of absence is granted I would like it to start April 1st. A.E.P.\nRegina, January 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Frog Lake School, Onion Lake Agency.\n\nI am attaching a letter from Mr. A. E. Peterson, Teacher at the above referred to school. You will note from this letter that Mr. Peterson has accepted nomination to contest that seat in the next Provincial election; that his nomination would not interfere with his work before the first of April, at which time he would like to get leave of absence and engage another teacher to take his place; that should he be defeated, he would like to return to the school and carry on, but if elected would resign.\n\nAs you are aware, we have no Farming Instructor or other representative on the Frog Lake Reserve with the exception of the School Teacher. Up until last spring I was very much dissatisfied with conditions on that Reserve. The school attendance was very poor and practically nothing was being done in the way of gardening or agriculture. Last spring I took this matter up with the Agent and Mr. Peterson and got Mr. Peterson to start a Community Garden and do some outside work in encouraging the Indians to do a little more in agriculture, also got Mrs. Peterson to start a Homemakers' Club.\n\nThe Community Garden went over very well but was not located as well as it might have been and the results were not what we expected. They have, however, another piece of land prepared for next season. The Homemakers' Club has gone over well. The women are taking a great interest and the Indians have put up a building for the use of the Club. The Agent, Dr. Hill, advises that the school attendance has also improved. They have now an enrolment of 23 and there were...........\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nthere were 17 present at his last visit. He also states that the children are all outfitted with good suits and dresses made by the Homemakers' Club and that Mrs. Peterson is doing excellent work.\n\nThis is a case where we have a Reserve with some of the best agricultural land in the Agency; where we have Indians who are doing much less in agriculture than they were a number of years ago. The Indians themselves express the desire to take up agriculture, but the amount of agriculture being done at the present time would not warrant the appointment of a Farming Instructor. It is a case where I am satisfied a Teacher in the dual position of Teacher and Overseer could carry on educational work and at the same time, within the next two or three years, get the Indians started in agriculture sufficiently to warrant the employment of an Instructor, and it is the only way that I can see in which we can get these people started.\n\nI think I am safe in saying that this last year, through Mr. Peterson's outside work and the Homemakers' Club, we have done more to bring these people along than had been done in the previous five years. It is unfortunate that Peterson is asking leave on the 1st of April, as that means he would be away at the very time he is most needed to carry on the outside work, Community Gardening, etc. While I feel that the interests of both the Indians and the Department demand, in a case of this kind, that the Teacher act in a dual capacity, and under those conditions I would hesitate to recommend that Mr. Peterson be given leave, in view of the intimation contained in one of your recent letters that the Department objects to our Teachers being used for anything but classroom work, I am of the opinion that his wish could be granted, as no doubt he could secure a teacher who would carry on the classroom work efficiently during his absence, and the Community Garden and Homemakers' work could be abandoned, as would in any case have to be done if our teachers are to be used exclusively for classroom work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

E. Peterson, teacher at the above noted school, enclosed therewith. May I refer you to departmental letter dated January 16, 1939, and particularly to clauses (a), (b), and (c) in the last paragraph of that communication. There is nothing on file here to indicate that the Department has received at any time a reply to that letter.\n\nSection 55 of the Civil Service Act reads as follows:\n\n\"No deputy head, officer, clerk or employee in the civil service shall be debarred from voting at any Dominion or provincial election if, under the law governing the said election, he has the right to vote; but no such deputy head, officer, clerk or employee shall engage in partisan work in connection with any such election, or contribute, receive or in any way deal with any money for any party funds.\n\n\"Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be dismissed from the civil service. 1918, c 12, s. 32.\"\n\nIn view of this statutory provision, Civil Servants are prohibited from taking an active part in political campaigns or in the promotion of political organizations. It would appear, therefore, that when Mr. Peterson is officially nominated as candidate for the Provincial Legislature he will be subject to dismissal by this Department. I should state perhaps quite frankly that the officials here have never had before them a case exactly similar to the one presented to us in your letter. It might be argued that distinction should be drawn between Provincial and Dominion politics. I am personally of the opinion, however, that Mr. Peterson by becoming a candidate, regardless of whether he was elected or defeated, would place himself in a very unenviable position. This branch, as you know, works in very close cooperation -\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nco-operation with the provincial departments of Education. Provincial public school inspectors inspect all Indian schools in the Dominion, with the exception of Indian schools in the provinces of British Columbia and New Brunswick. The Premier of the province of Alberta is also Minister of Education and the school inspectors work under his direction. I need not pursue this course of reasoning; you can readily reach your own conclusions. Mr. Peterson, in my humble judgment, should either continue as teacher at the Frog Lake school or resign almost at once. Any recommendation from you, after you have discussed the matter with the church authorities, in respect to the man that should take his place, will be acceptable to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Roey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nJanuary 30th, 1940\n\nI am writing to inform you that Mr. Peter Smith, teaching School on the Frog Lake Reserve, has been elected to the position of Secretary for his constituency on an independent ticket in opposition to the government he is working for.

Consequently, you will realize that no exception could be made in the case of the Frog Lake School, and the same conditions prevail at all other Indian day schools. Therefore the school will be in operation only from October 1, 1940, to June 30, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. A. E.

Racette, following his inspection of the FROG LAKE Indian Day School, dated June 25, 1943.\n\nIn the absence of Mr. Hunt, who has been bedridden for the last month, Mrs. Hunt is replacing him and will do so until the end of this term. My inspection was also made difficult by the non-attendance of so many pupils who are reported to be helping their parents. Under the circumstances, I have examined the written work of these six pupils and have observed a few lessons in reading, oral language and number work. It is my intention to visit this school again next October.\n\nMy examination of the school register reveals the fact that during the first Quarter of this year only six pupils out of 28 enrolled attended 50% of the days the school operated and about ten reached this percentage during the quarter expiring in March. As a result of this poor attendance and the lack of suitable classroom material the progress of these Indian children is very slow. They speak in mere whispers, are too often daydreaming. I consider that until authorities have adopted a special definite curriculum for the Indian schools, have equipped the classrooms with necessary primary material and above all have enforced compulsory attendance, the results will remain negligible in academic accomplishments. Mrs. Hunt reports that the pupils have cp-operated lately in the making of a garden. The girls also take sewing lessons with the adults.\nOttawa, July 14, 1943.\n\nMr. Donald H. Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nI have recently received the report of Inspector Racette regarding his inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School on June 25th. Apparently, Mr. Hunt was still absent from the school, although I was under the impression, from your letter of May 17, that he would resume duties about May 24. Please let me know his present condition and advise if he will be able to re-open the school on September first.\n\nIn reporting on the school, the Inspector writes in part as follows:\n\n\"My examination of the school register reveals the fact that during the first quarter of this year only 8 pupils out of 28 enrolled attended 50% of the days the school operated and about 10 reached this percentage during the quarter ending March 31.\"\n\nThis attendance is very unsatisfactory and suggests that it might be as well to close the school. I would appreciate receiving your comments immediately and if you consider the school should remain open, you should state what steps will be taken to secure a larger and more regular attendance.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON FROG LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nI wish to inform you that while on the Frog Lake Reserve the week before last I visited Mr. and Mrs. O.R. Hunt and had quite a chat with them. Mr. Hunt is the teacher of the Day School on this Reserve and Mrs. Hunt does a great deal to assist him.\n\nThis couple, I believe, are doing splendid work on this reservation. Mr. Hunt, as you know, has been ill lately but he was progressing favourably at the time of my visit so I think he will be in shape to open the school on September 1st. However, Dr. Miller of Elk Point was going to Frog Lake to examine him again the week following my visit.\n\nMid-Day Meal\n\nI was advised by Mr. Hunt that there are from fifteen to twenty-two children attending this school and at the present time they are receiving only $36.00 a year to supply the mid-day meal for these children. He further informed me they often have to take food from their own supply to feed the children. I asked him how much money he required and he stated $10.00 a month. This would be about right. However, we compromised and I said for the present I would recommend $75.00 for the school year; therefore I would ask that this amount be available for the school.\n\nGardens\n\nAs you are probably aware, this band of Indians are very backward and they are still more or less in the primitive state. Mr. and Mrs. Hunt are the first people to come to Frog Lake who are really interested in the work and doing their best not only in the way of teaching but on the reserve in general where they more or less act as farming instructors. There are eighteen gardens on the reserve this year and this is entirely due to their efforts. There is also a community garden at the school which belongs to the Indian women who are members of the Homemakers' Club there. During my visit they were canning the vegetables. I noted in my general report on this Agency that some of the women who would not help with the garden in the Spring were now anxious to get in on the vegetables. Probably next Spring they will show more interest in the Homemakers' club garden.\n\nHomemakers' Club \u2014 They have a good Homemakers' club....\nThey have a good Homemakers' Club on this reserve and a great deal of the military clothing we send them is made into clothing for the children at the school, etc. Personally I cannot speak too highly of the work Mr. and Mrs. Hunt are doing. Besides this, they are good Canadians raised in the Melfort district where their people farm. Mr. Hunt is thirty-seven years of age and Mrs. Hunt is probably around thirty-five. They have four children of their own who attend a white school just outside of the reserve. Mr. and Mrs. Hunt like their work and are very much interested in it. These are the kind of people we want to encourage and make it worth their while to stay in this work.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Hunt asked for a cow and if the cow is supplied they will use the milk for the children attending the school and give whatever is over to anyone who is sick on the reserve. You, of course, will realize that just at the present time cows are cows and we will probably have to pay $125.00 for one. Then, of course, there is the feed for the winter. Mr. Hunt has a stable so there will be no extra expense for this and the cow will cost around $150.00.\n\nThe well at the school needs cleaning out but this will not be a costly job. A tank is required and also some boards for earstroughing but I have asked the Agent to send in a requisition for this so our Branch will receive that later.\n\nAs I mentioned above in this report, Mr. and Mrs. Hunt are doing splendid work but if we are going to keep them at Frog Lake we must encourage them and should the former teacher, Mr. Peterson, who I presume is away on military leave although I have no record to this effect here, want to get back into the Department after the War I do not think he should be sent back to Frog Lake. I am just giving you this as a hint.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 115-4-1, of August 2nd., past, with reference to the Frog Lake Indian Day School.\n\nOn the 28th., of September, I visited this school and found Mr O.R. Hunt teaching. He had resumed duty on Monday the 27th., Mrs Hunt had re-opened the school on September 1st., and substituted for her husband until the 27th.,\n\nThere were 18 on the roll and five present at the time of my visit, but the absence of several families away threshing accounted for the low attendance. Every effort will be made to get these children into school as soon as possible, but the Indian always seems to have to take his family with him when he leaves the reserve to work at the harvest.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nOnion Lake Agency, May 31st to June 6th.\n\nREPORT ON ONION LAKE INDIAN AGENCY:\nFROG LAKE RESERVE\n\nMr. Lockhart, the Farm Instructor, at Onion Lake, gives this reserve supervision once a month and is assisted by O.H. Hunt, the Day School teacher. Mr. Hunt encourages the Indian gardeners and report on the care of the bulls and other livestock. The Agent and Farm Instructor gave Mr. Hunt a great deal of credit for the work being accomplished.\n\nJ.E. Morris,\nWelfare Division\nRegina, September 14th, 1944.\n\nINSPECTOR'S REPORT ON ONION LAKE INDIAN AGENCY\n\nFrog Lake;\n\nFrom Onion Lake I went to Frog Lake. As you know, there is not very much farming on this reservation, only 77 acres seeded to wheat and 9 acres to gardens. The teacher and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. O.R. Hunt, have a splendid community garden with all kinds of vegetables and potatoes. This is looked after by the Indian women and Mr. and Mrs. Hunt deserve a great deal of credit for the effort they have put forth. Mrs. Hunt also carries on a Homemakers' Club and she has the Indians canning vegetables, putting down fruit, making over discharged military clothing, etc. that we furnish to them. In all this lady is carrying on mighty fine work amongst the Indian women.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING MARCH, 1945, ON ONION LAKE AGENCY\n\nEducation:\n\nI visited the Onion Lake R.C., Indian Residential School on January 25, February 27 and March 27, Frog Lake Indian Day School on January 12 and March 9, and Long Lake Day School on March 7. The building to be used as a class room for the proposed Day School on Onion Lake Reserve, as being repaired and will be in readiness for school to open May 15th or when the teacher gets here. The C.E. Residential School Farm will be operated by P. Waskawitch, an Indian, this year, who will sow all tillable land to barley and keep the fences in repair. This is considered the best program possible to control the weeds this year. The whole of the cultivated land must be summer fallowed next year. The work this summer will be done with a tractor as P. Waskawitch has just recently acquired one.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING JUNE 30TH, 1945, ON ONION LAKE AGENCY\n\nEducation - Schools: I visited the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School three times during the quarter and Frog Lake and Long Lake Indian Day Schools twice each in May and June. The proposed Onion Lake C.E. Indian Day School did not open in May as originally intended. It will open September 1st with Mr. John Jeffries as teacher.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nGeneral Administration\n\nIn the Union Lake Agency there has been no clerk during the quarter with the exception of Mr. H.C. Hamer for a few days when transferred from the Duck Lake Agency, shortly thereafter being transferred to the Lesser Slave Lake Agency. Mr. F.W. Hunt, the day school teacher at Frog Lake, assisted the Agent with the annuity payments. The vacancy of Clerk is about to be filled by a returned soldier who has the necessary qualifications. Mr. A. Lockhart, Farming Instructor, Onion Lake Reserve, was absent from duty for a considerable time with a broken wrist and is still not able to do any heavy work. The fracture was badly set and he will have to undergo further treatment.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, February 19, 1946.\n\nMr. D. H. Cameron, Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nRe: Frog Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI am in receipt of the January report of school attendance at this school and it is noted that for the month, out of an enrolment of 22, only 9 were present for more than 9 days. Six children enrolled did not attend at all; the others were present for less than 6 days.\n\nIn practically all cases the reason for absence is given as illness. Do you consider that this is a bona fide excuse? Certainly, no effective work could have been done at this school during the month with such irregular attendance. I would appreciate having your views in the matter.\n\nUnder separate cover a letter will probably be written to you concerning the action you have taken in regard to Family Allowances.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOnion Lake, Sask.,\nJanuary 2, 1946.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nEducation:\n\nThe Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School and two Indian Day Schools (Frog Lake and Long Lake) opened in September. The Onion Lake C.E. Day School opened October 1st and the Big Island Lake Day School opened October 29th, Mr. J.H. Lirette having been re-appointed teacher. The attendance at our Day Schools has improved due to payment of Family Allowances, but we need more teachers of the right type. Mr. O.R. Hunt, teacher, Frog Lake Day School, is doing good work.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI submit the following report on the affairs of this Agency, for the quarter ending June 30th, 1946.\n\nEducation: I visited the Onion Lake Residential School regularly during the quarter. This is a good school and well conducted. There are four Indian Day Schools in this Agency\u2014Onion Lake C.E., Frog Lake C.E., Long Lake R.C., and Big Lake Island R.C. I visited the Onion Lake and Frog Lake Schools every month. Long Lake School was visited in May and in June. Big Island Lake is more remote. However, I visited this school April 9th, May 9th and May 17th. The opening of the \"Ministikwan Indian Day School\" is under consideration by the Department, and, provided a good teacher is secured, this should be an improvement over present conditions on that Reserve.\n\nDonald H.

He states that there is an enrolment of 12 pupils, with a qualified, capable teacher, who, in addition to teaching duties, performs certain work as farm instructor, distributes relief and attends to other matters in connection with the reserve. He therefore recommends that the school be continued in operation. He is being informed that, in view of his recommendation, the Department will approve of the continuing of school activities there during the coming fiscal year at least, as funds have been provided in our Estimates for teacher's salary and other expenses.\n\nI may add, however, that the Department is considering the closing of the Long Lake Indian Day School, and in this connection you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Kerney as teacher.\n\nYou are aware that this school is being held in a house belonging to one of the Indians and that the intention is not to build a school-house until it is seen how the undertaking, in its present form, succeeds.\n\nIt was a cold windy day when I called at the school, there were only two children present besides two of the teacher's own children. The only school material in the place was a few broken desks and a primus that was scarcely kept the stove almost went up, there was also a small blackboard that would serve the purpose fairly well but there was no chalks. I told Mr. Kerney to send me a requisition for such things as he required and I hope enclosed the list received from him.\n\nI would recommend that they be authorized to purchase such of these articles as the Department is not in the habit of sending by express or otherwise, with the exception of the blackboards, desks &c., as there are some old desks at the C.E. Boarding school here which I think can be made good enough to serve the purpose at Roy Lake, I do not think it would be advisable to buy new desks until it is decided to\nbuild a regular school house, the draft I can supply from agency stock. With regard to teachers I would ask that enough be sent for at least 10 pupils.\n\nThe reason of these only being two little children at the school on the occasion of my visit was the cold weather. This was the number there on the roll, two of these two boys did come from the school and in order to help as much as possible the teacher has been helping them with his own family giving them board and lodging from Monday morning until Friday evening and he knows of two children more that could attend on same conditions. The teacher asked that he may be allowed some flour, bacon and tea for these children and he will be quite willing to keep. I told him that no doubt that could be arranged. I would therefore ask to be authorized to allow him 30 lbs. flour & 1 lb. bacon & 1 lb. tea per head per month. This arrangement would suit the conditions and secure a more regular attendance. The engaging an Indians to sign round and gather the children to the school and take them home again.\n\nI enclose the teacher's return for the past quarter in which he was teaching in the present house, hence the reason for the days missed and days absent do not give the total of the number of school days.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nW. Sibbald\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may have the old desks at the Onion Lake (C.E.) Boarding School referred to in your letter removed to Frog Lake and you may supply the soap from the agency stock.

This leanto serves the purpose just at present, but, as Stanley will require it next fall, a temporary building could be put up in the meantime, out of the logs the Indians are providing. There are only eight children on the roll and the attendance has not been...\nbeen very regular, so that I do not think that there is yet sufficient encouragement to induce the Department to incur the expense of establishing an improved Day School. However; the encouragement is certainly sufficient to warrant a continuation of the present system, and I would like to know if the Department would be willing to defray the expense of completing a log building, i.e. roof, floor, windows, doors, etc., if the Indians put up the walls voluntarily. I estimate that the cost of completing the building would be about $250.00.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Gibbald\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 19th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nReferring to your communication of March 25th, last, which was inadvertently overlooked, regarding the school at Frog Lake, I beg to say that the Department has had a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, asking that Mr. Charles Quinney be reimbursed for the sums expended by him in the erection of the buildings first occupied for school purposes; secondly, for the lean-to erected by him in connection with the house that he rented; and, thirdly, payment of the rent.\n\nThe Department is disposed to pay the rent on the building, if moderate, and I have to ask you to be good enough to submit vouchers covering the time that it has been in use certified if they meet with your approval. You will also be good enough to advise the Department of the approximate cost of the original buildings and the lean-to in cash to Mr. Quinney.\n\nThe school returns as they have come to hand are hardly such as to justify the expenditure that would be involved in the erection of a new building. The\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nUnion Lake, Sask.\nThe Department would like to have a further report from you dealing with the probable success of the school.

The main part of the house the living family occupy as dwelling house, the lean-to is the school room, both serve the purpose very well considering the outlay. Under these circumstances I have included in the voucher for the year's rent of the house the $9.00 estimated cost of six days labour and use of team.\nMoving and renting the land to\nfull particulars are given in\nletter No. 79 for $34.25 which ac-\ncompanies this letter.\n\nWith regard to the cost of the\noriginal buildings I give them to\nyou in the form of a second letter\nNo. 78 amounting to $335.25.

The interior could be made more attractive if plaster were repaired and painted.\n\nIf a school garden could be supplied the pupils could be taught the principals of agriculture more easily.\nOttawa, April 3rd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe report of the Public School Inspector who visited the Frog Lake Indian Day School last fall has just been received. In his report he draws attention to the condition of the closet, and also recommends that the plaster be repaired and the interior painted in order to make the classroom more attractive.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to have the closet put in good repair and thoroughly cleaned. Any repairs required to the plaster of the school room should also be attended to, and the interior either painted or kilnsmoked. No undue expenditure should be incurred in having this work carried out. If the materials were supplied, it might be possible that the teacher would arrange to have the work performed. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that a small school garden should be conducted at the school, in order that the pupils would be taught the principles of agriculture. I shall be pleased if you will furnish a report regarding the suggestion of the Inspector, stating what would be required to put a small plot of ground in condition for gardening purposes, the seeds that would be required, and whether the teacher would undertake the giving of the necessary instruction to the pupils, and the oversight of the work, and the cost involved.\n\nYour early reply will be appreciated, in order that, if it is decided to authorize the work, gardening operations can be commenced as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 3rd instant, Nos. 115-3-5 and 115-4-5 in connection with the reports of the Public School Inspector on the Indians' Day Schools at Cold Lake and Frog Lake, respectively.\n\nI have just returned from visiting the outlying reserves and whilst at the above mentioned reserves attended to the matters contained in your letters. At Frog Lake Day School I arranged with the teacher, Mr. Chas. Quinney, to have the walls of the interior of the schoolhouse whitewashed, and the doors and windows, etc., painted; and also to put the closet in good repair and condition. It will be necessary to pull down the present closet and build another, using as much as possible of the material of the old one. Mr. Quinney will do the work.\n\nWith respect to the school gardens recommended by the Inspector. As these schools are a considerable distance from the Agency and difficult to communicate with; and as, also, no time should be lost if school gardens are to be put in this year with any hope of success; I have arranged that plots be ploughed and harrowed at each school, and have promised to supply the teachers with the necessary vegetable seeds. The teachers at each place are not only willing to give the pupils the necessary instruction, but are enthusiastic about the project.\n\nFeeling that the Department would like the Indian Day School at Long Lake also to have a little school garden, I arranged to have a plot prepared there, also. The work of putting the ground in condition for gardening can be done at very little expense, and the seeds will cost about $5.00 each for Frog Lake and Long Lake, and for Cold Lake $7.00. At Frog Lake and Long Lake a garden can be made within the present school enclosure, but at Cold Lake it will be necessary to build a fence which will cost, approximately, $30.00.\n\nI estimate that gardens can be made ready and seeded at each school at the following cost:\n\n| Location   | Ploughing, harrowing & raking | Seeds |\n|------------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Frog Lake  | $4.00                         | $5.00 |\n| Long Lake  | $4.00                         | $5.00 |\n| Cold Lake  | $8.00                         | $7.00 |\n\nAbout one-quarter acre gardens would be made at Frog Lake and Long Lake, and half an acre at Cold Lake.\n\nTrusting the Department will approve of my action and authorize the expenditure for this purpose:\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 607-5, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, reporting on your recent visit to the Frog Lake, Long Lake and Cold Lake Indian Day Schools, and informing the Department of the action taken by you in having gardens conducted at each of these schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the instructions which you gave to have the necessary ploughing and harrowing done at each of these schools and to have the teachers supplied with vegetable seeds. It is noted that about one quarter acre will be placed in garden at Frog Lake and Long Lake and one half acre at Cold Lake. You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, for each of these schools, separately, covering the cost of the ploughing, harrowing and seeds.\n\nIt is noted that you have authorized fencing at Cold Lake. Accounts should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred for this purpose, also covering any material supplied the teacher at Frog Lake for painting and whitewashing the interior of the school and for putting the closet in good repair and condition. We hope that the teachers and pupils will meet with success in their gardening operations during the coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

He also recommends that an additional number of desks be supplied, as the ones at present in use are in poor condition, and that a teacher's desk and chair be supplied.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report regarding the water supply, and whether you would recommend that a well be dug. If so, you should state how the work should be carried out, and the approximate cost of the same, and, if possible, state the depth required in order to obtain a good supply of water.\n\nRegarding the desks, please state the kind at present in the school, whether double or single, and the name of the manufacturer. If you recommend that new desks be supplied, you should state the size and number of each size required, also whether you would advise that a teacher's desk and chair be purchased.

Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 14, 1924\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 212, amounting to $25.95 in favour of Marshall Bros., Frog Lake, Alberta, for Axes, water pail, kettles, etc.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated .\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Voucher No. 212, amounting to $15.95, for supplies for the Frog Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn explanation of an item of $2.50 which appears in this voucher for a 10 lb. pail of lard, I would state that this was furnished by the new teacher to be used with biscuits for the children's midday meal, whilst he was waiting for supplies to be sent him from Onion Lake.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of October 19 last, No. 115-4-5, and to inform the Department that the matters referred to therein would have been dealt with long ago but for the illness and death of the late teacher at the Frog Lake Indian Day School, and the consequent closing of that school until quite recently.\n\nThe seating and desk equipment at this school is very poor. There are four very old double desks, of what make I cannot ascertain, but they are somewhat similar to the \"Preston\" desks; they were discarded by the Onion Lake (C/E) Residential School two years ago; and two tables and four forms all about six feet long. These comprise the total seating and desk equipment. I would recommend that this school be supplied with six new double desks, three medium and three large size. If these are supplied and the four old ones are painted (this I have asked the teacher and he has consented to do) this school will have ample desk accommodation.\n\nWith respect to the water supply. This is taken from a body of water close to the school, which can only be described as a large slough. I would ask for authority to have a well dug and cribbed, and feel sure that a plentiful supply of water can be secured at a depth of not more than 20 feet. The cost would be, approximately, as follows:\n\n| Description                        | Cost   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|\n| Labour, digging well, making cribbing and installing pump | $30.00 |\n| Lumber for cribbing                | $10.00 |\n| Pump and piping                    | $35.00 |\n\nTotal $75.00\n\nThis work cannot be done for probably two months, owing to the ground being frozen. In the meantime I would ask for authority to purchase a 4 gallon stone water filter for both Frog Lake and Long Lake Indian Day schools. These can be purchased from \"Christie's\" at Battleford, Sask., or the Western School Supply Co., Regina, Sask., at $16.50 each. The supply and use of a filter would, I believe, eliminate a lot of the danger to the pupils from drinking impure water.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, regarding the seating equipment and the well required at the Frog Lake Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the desks, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of 6 double school desks of the sizes required. It will be necessary for you to obtain competitive prices, and you should ask for quotations from the following firms, in addition to any others you may wish, viz:\n\nWestern School Supply Co., Regina, Sask.,\n1402 Rose St.,\nChristie School Supply Co., Brandon, Man.,\nE. N. Moyer Co. Ltd., Edmonton, Alta.,\nWestern Seating Co., Winnipeg, Man.,\n179 Bannatyne Ave., E.\n\nYou should request the above firms to quote a price F.O.B. the nearest railway station to the school, and you should place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price. Accounts, in duplicate, should be obtained from the firm supplying the desks, which you should certify and send to the Department for payment. The old desks in the school should be painted. It is noted that the teacher has consented to do this work.\n\nRegarding the water supply, I beg to say that you may arrange, when conditions permit, to have a well dug and cribbed. It is hoped that the cost of this work will not exceed your estimate of approximately $75 for the labour and material required. You should arrange to have the work done at the lowest possible cost, having in view the obtaining of a good and regular supply of water.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a gallon stone water filter for both the Frog Lake and Long Lake Indian Day Schools. You should obtain competitive prices for the delivery of the filters from the same firms and at the same time as you are asking for quotations for the desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

E. Peterson, the attendance at the school has improved, the methods of Mr. Peterson having resulted in interesting his pupils, an evidence of the success which can be achieved by the use of proper methods.\n\nThe Inspector refers to the necessity of painting, both the exterior and interior of the building, and providing for better lighting. I note that the Agent made provision for painting in his estimates, and I am communicating with him to ascertain if the amount which he asked for will be sufficient, and asking him to offer his suggestions in regard to securing better lighting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 309-11 of the 10th instant, enclosing the report of the Provincial School Inspector on his inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to note that there is a marked improvement at this school, both in attendance and in the results achieved in the classroom under the charge of the new teacher, Mr. A. E. Peterson.\n\nRegarding the painting of the interior and exterior of the building and providing for better lighting, I have to say that we will await the report which you have requested the agent to furnish, relative to the cost of the painting and his suggestions in regard to securing better lighting. As soon as this information is received, consideration will be given to having the painting, etc., authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that the Rev. E. Ahenakew, Church of England Missionary at this Agency, came to see me this morning with reference to the Frog Lake Indian Day School, which is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nI should explain that a new log church is being erected by Mr. Ahenakew on the Frog Lake Indian reserve, and is nearly completed. The object of Mr. Ahenakew's visit to me was to point out that the building now used as a Day School at Frog Lake is not large enough to accommodate all the pupils now attending and to offer the use of the new church for that purpose.\n\nThe size of the present school building is about 18'x18'. The size of the new church is about 20'x24'. This latter, however, can easily be enlarged by lengthening the building with logs to 32'x24'. This could be done for about $100.00, which amount I placed in estimates to paint and repair the present schoolhouse; this amount could be diverted to the new project. In addition to this it would be necessary to build two outhouses at a cost of about $15.00 each, and also to dig and drive a well, which could be done at a cost of about $40.00. We have a pump and piping on hand which was purchased for the present school but not yet installed; this could be used for the new well if necessary.\n\nIf the present good attendance at the Day School continues it will be necessary to provide more accommodation. The average for last quarter was 15.19, and on the occasion of one of my visits to the school 22 pupils were present.\n\nI feel that the history of the attendance at this school during the past few years has not been such as to justify me in recommending a change to larger quarters with any great degree of enthusiasm, but as the change would not cause the Department any great expense, and as also I believe the site of the new church to be a better one for the school children than the present one, I would recommend that the offer of Rev. E. Ahenakew be accepted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 29, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the request made by the Anglican Missionary on the Frog Lake Reserve, to utilize for school purposes the new log church building which is being erected, by building an addition. In reply I have to say that the Department does not feel disposed to carry out this arrangement. We cannot undertake to incur any expenditure on a building which is not the property of the Government. If the present good attendance is maintained during the coming school year, the question of erecting a suitable building for school purposes will receive consideration.\n\nRegarding the painting of the interior and exterior of the present school building, I may say that the Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of this school, drew attention to the need of having this painting done and to the need of providing better lighting. Mr. Commissioner Graham stated that he had requested you to report relative to the cost of the painting and to furnish a recommendation in regard to securing better light. You should furnish this information to the Commissioner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir:\n\nFurther with reference to the Provincial School Inspector's report on the Frog Lake Indian Day School, and Department letter #115-4-5 of the 16th instant, I beg to state that the Indian Agent, Mr. Lang Turner, informs me that the cost of painting the interior and exterior of the school will be about $70.00.\n\nHe states also that the addition of two full size extra windows and the making of the necessary openings would cost approximately $25.00.\n\nHe points out also the desirability of providing a new platform at the entrance to the school, which can be satisfactorily done at an expenditure of $30.00. I would recommend therefore that authority be granted to proceed with these repairs and changes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nActing Asst.

The last quarter shows an average attendance of 15.19.\n\nMr. Turner informs me that the missionary Mr. Ahenakew, is erecting a church on this reserve and has offered to use it as a school. The church that is being erected is 20' x 24'. He is willing however, to extend this building to 32'x24' if he can get a grant of $100 from the Department. In looking over the estimates it is noted that $100.00 was asked for for repairs to the school, and it seems to me that a grant of $100.00 to Mr. Ahenakew to apply on his combination church and school would be much better than to spend this amount on the present school building.\n\nIf this authority is granted a further amount of $30 will be needed for closets, and $40 for the cribbing of a well. It is pointed out that they have a good pump.\n\nI would be glad to have your authority to act in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 607-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Voucher No. 136, amounting to $195.85 in my favour, for cash expended on addition and repairs to the Anglican church building on the Frog Lake reserve, to make it suitable for use as an Indian Day School; and to offer the following explanations.\n\nOn October 22nd, I accompanied the Rev. E. Ahenakew, Indian Missionary, to the Frog Lake reserve, taking with me Mr. E. Rotherham, a handy man of this district, who was to work as carpenter and to supervise the alterations to the church building. Mr. Ahenakew stayed with Mr. Rotherham for ten days and worked at the building himself; he also hired some Indians to work at it, paying them from funds which he had received from the church authorities for that purpose. Mr. Ahenakew then left this Agency to visit Battleford reserves, but before leaving he handed over to me the balance of the money he had on hand to be expended on the building, which amounted to $25.85. This amount, together with that of a countable cheque No. 3735 for $170.00, a total of $195.85, is accounted for in the attached voucher. These added amounts proved insufficient to complete the work and Voucher No. 137 for $20.00, in favour of Mr. A. Peterson, the school teacher, is also enclosed.\n\nThe building has been converted into a fine roomy school and is now being used as such. I visited this building on November 28th, and although 20 pupils were then present the schoolroom could hold many more. The present floor space is 20 by 30 feet. It will be necessary to purchase blinds for the windows; these, however, are inexpensive and will be purchased by me on my next visit to Lloydminster, our nearest town.\n\nIn perusing the Voucher it will be noticed that some of the items in Rahall, Bros. account are provisions. These were purchased by Rev. E. Ahenakew for Indians employed at work on the school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nDecember 13, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd instant, inclosing voucher No. 196 amounting to $195.85, accounting for money advanced to you to provide accommodation for a day school on Frog Lake Reserve, I beg to state that the Department has decided to raise its contribution to the amount of the voucher and a cheque for $25.85 is being sent you on condition that the money is spent in the purchase of blinds for the windows and other necessary improvements in connection with the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 607-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Frog Lake School, May 7, 1925.\n\nThe local church, property of the Church of England, is used as a school. This building is larger and much better lighted than that previously used. Four windows east and two west supply light. The ventilation is good. The building will need extra repairs to make it suitable for winter use.\n\nThe well is in need of attention.\n\nThe general tone of this school has been raised appreciably. A garden is being prepared which will give the teacher some opportunity of teaching agriculture in a practical way. If possible extra teaching along the lines of manual arts for boys and household science for girls should be provided.\n\nA house some ten yards from the school could after considerable repair be taken over by the teacher as a residence from which point the work of the school could be better supervised and the services of Mrs. Peterson could be enlisted in the teaching of the elements of domestic science and of sewing to the girls attending. The preparation of the lunch could then also be prepared outside of the school room an obvious drawback at present.\n\nInspector Crispie\nOttawa, June 15th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nPublic School Inspector Crispo, in a report on his inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School, draws attention to the condition of the well, which he states is in need of attention. He also states that there is a house some 10 yards from the school which could, after considerable repair, be used by the teacher as a residence, from which point the work of the school could be better supervised, and the services of the teacher's wife enlisted in the teaching of domestic science and sewing to the girls, and for the preparation of the midday lunch.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange to have any repairs required to the well carried out, also to have your views as to whether you would recommend that the repairs suggested by the Inspector be made to the house referred to, and, if so, the approximate cost of having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nD. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your #115-4-5 with reference to the condition of Frog Lake Day School, I am advised that this building is a log one with a shingle roof and requires the following repairs:\n\nThe roof and gable ends should be ceiled in and six storm windows and one storm door furnished. The approximate cost of the material and labour will be $90.00.\n\nThe well at the school is close to a slough and the water tastes of it and a new well should be dug at a probable cost of about $20.00.\n\nWith regard to the house which it is suggested should be used by the teacher, it appears that this was purchased this spring by the teacher, Mr. A.G. Peterson, for the reason that he lives four miles from the school and last winter found it a difficult matter to have the school warm enough by the time the children arrived. It was moved and taken down to the school, and walls and rafters erected at Mr. Peterson's expense. This involved an outlay of $95.00. To complete it and make it\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nmake it habitable an expenditure of about $180.00 would be required, and if the Department will agree to purchase the cottage and make it habitable the total cost would be about $275.00.\n\nI understand that the teacher's wife would be quite willing to teach the children domestic science and sewing and prepare the mid-day meal.\n\nI will await the sanction of the Department before any further steps are taken to repair the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nE. X.\n\nOttawa, July 20, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A of the 9th instant, with reference to improvements at the Frog Lake Indian Day School. In reply, you are authorized to seal the roof and gable ends, supply six storm windows and one storm door and dig a new well, at a total cost of approximately $110. Please bear in mind the regulations relating to purchasing and the engagement of labour.\n\nThat part of your letter referring to the teacher's residence is receiving attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Since my last visit a teacher's residence has been built in close proximity to the school and this increases his efficiency as before this building was provided the teacher had to drive several miles morning and evening to and from the school. There were present 5 girls and 2 boys out of an enrolment of 20 pupils. The attendance at this school is rather intermittent owing to the parents living a nomadic life through hunting, trapping and working out for settlers being their chief source of livelihood. The pupils in attendance were clean, and well dressed.\n\nThe school is a log building with a small chancel at one end, and is used for Church purposes on Sundays. The walls are whitewashed and the V. joint ceiling is painted. A mid-day meal is served to the children in the school room. It would be much better and more conducive to tidiness in the school if a small dining room were attached to the building for this purpose.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nThe teacher, Mr.A.Peterson\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 607-5, part 1)\nThe teacher, Mr. Alex Peterson, holds a Second Class Teacher's Certificate for the Province of Alberta. He is a bright young man and in my opinion is a capable teacher. His wife keeps a clean and tidy house which is a good example to the Indians on the reserve.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Onion Lake Agency which was made by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nThe small school at Frog Lake seems to be doing excellent work under Mr. Peterson.\n\nW.

The Inspector also states that by furnishing the proper supplies, sewing could be taught with benefit.\n\nYou may arrange to purchase and supply the stove pipe and towelling, also a small supply of material to be used by the teacher in the teaching of sewing to the girls.\n\nIf you can arrange to have an inexpensive cupboard built locally, of a type that would be suitable for the storing of the supplies for the midday meal, you may purchase the material and arrange for the labour in having the cupboard built. No unnecessary expense should be incurred for this purpose.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that a flag and some playground equipment be supplied.

She also recommends that some towelling, tooth brushes and soap be supplied.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a covered water container with faucet, and, if drinking cups are required, you may supply 6 graniteware cups. The water container, while serviceable for the purpose, should be as inexpensive as possible.\n\nRelative to the towelling, I would refer you to official letter of November 17th, last, in which you were authorized to purchase 6 yards.

A flag was also sent by the Department and given to the school.\n\nWith respect to the cupboard for the storing of supplies for the midday meal, I arranged with a handy man on the reserve to make a suitable cupboard, but he has neglected to do so, and I have now arranged with the teacher, Mr. A. Peterson, to do this work in his spare time, and feel sure that he will make a suitable cupboard. I have ordered a water container, drinking cups and toilet soap from the Western School Supply Co. Ltd., of Regina. Regarding tooth brushes, about 18 are actually required, but I would ask to be supplied with six dozens, to enable me to replenish the used ones from time to time.\n\nWith respect to playground equipment, I would suggest that I may be authorized to fence in a small plot of land around the schoolhouse as a playground and to erect a suitable swing for the girls, double, with cement foundation, and a seesaw for the boys. The boys should also be furnished with a football. The approximate cost of this would be,\n\n| Item     | Cost   |\n|----------|--------|\n| Fencing  | $50.00 |\n| Swings   | $35.00 |\n| Seesaw   | $20.00 |\n| Football | $7.00  |\n\n$112.00\n\nI would be glad to have the authority of the Department to incur this expenditure.\n\nWhilst on the subject of the Frog Lake Day School, I would respectfully draw the attention of the Department to the fact that this is the only Day School in this Agency, where the wife of the teacher does not receive any remuneration for teaching sewing to the girls, and preparing the midday meal. Mrs. Peterson, the wife of the Frog Lake teacher does this work unpaid, but she should receive some small return for her services.

You should endeavour to have this work done at the lowest possible cost, and, when completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRelative to the granting of remuneration to Mrs. Peterson for her services in teaching sewing and preparing the midday meal, I beg to say that you will be further advised in a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mayar Co., Ltd., Saskatoon, Sask., for 6 # Double desks for use at the Frog Lake Indian Day School, Onion Lake Agency. Tenders were not called as this was the only near source of supply.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-4-5 dated September 12th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nFROG LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on March the 13th and found 5 boys and 3 girls present, out of an enrollment of 13. This is quite discouraging and I spoke strongly to the parents on the matter, pointing out to them that if they were interested in keeping their school open they would have to see that the children attended regularly, or they might lose their school. This apparently had some effect for the time being, as it was noted that there were ten children at school the following morning before I left.\n\nThe school building is built with log walls and shingle roof, the chinks being plastered with mud. The building is white-washed outside and kalsomined inside. The mud shells off and it is hard to keep it looking decent. I found the school clean. There is no mid-day meal provided. The children receive two biscuits each per day. The parents put up a strong plea that a bowl of soup be provided for their children. They are very poor and I am sure that the children come to school hungry very often. The teacher informs me that the Agent has, at times, sent out a small quantity of beef and when he has been able to provide soup the attendance has shown a noticeable improvement. The teacher has a small garden and should be provided the means of fencing it. I brought several matters, of minor repairs required, to the attention of the Agent who will be able to have them carried out without incurring any expense.\n\nMr. A. E. Peterson, the teacher, appears to be quite capable and a man of good common sense. His presence on the reserve has a good influence and he is of\nconsiderable assistance to the Agent in keeping him conversant with conditions.\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector of Agency\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Onion Lake Agency. The report is very complete and the Inspector has gone into matters very thoroughly.\n\nThe attendance at the Frog Lake Day School has not been good. This school also should be plastered with lime and sand during the coming summer. You will note that there is not much of a midday meal being provided here and I think we might meet the request of the parents and see that a certain amount of meat, etc., is provided so that the children could have a bowl of soup at midday, especially during the winter months, and for the year round we might send a supply of Dri-milk to this school. Dri-Milk is very palatable and just as good as the other milk and the cost would be very small.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 20th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your No. 309-11 of the 10th instant, relative to Mr. Inspector Murison's report on his visit to the Frog Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say, with reference to the midday meal supplied the pupils, that you may arrange to purchase and forward the quantity of Dri-Milk considered necessary. A reasonable quantity of meat, etc., may be supplied, in order that the children can have a bowl of soup at midday during the winter months. You may arrange with Mr. Agent Turner to see that a small quantity of meat suitable for the making of soup is supplied the teacher from time to time, and he should forward accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Fair building, rather draughty and in need of repair for winter use. The walls need cleaning and floor should be oiled.

This might provide vegetables for school lunch.\n\nPlace is needed for lunch equipment.\nOttawa, October 22, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School, states that the building, while in fair condition, is rather draughty and in need of repair for winter use. He also states that the walls should be cleaned and the floor oiled.\n\nPlease arrange to have any repairs required carried out in order to place this building in as comfortable a condition as possible for the coming winter. You may also arrange to have the walls cleaned and the floor oiled. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in having this work done.\n\nThe Inspector further states that sewing and knitting could be taught if materials were supplied. If you will have the teacher prepare and forward, through your office, a requisition for the materials required for the purpose, consideration will then be given to authorizing the supplying of same. You should give this matter your early attention.\n\nThe Inspector also remarks that a place is needed for the equipment used in serving the midday lunch. It is thought that the teacher could arrange for a proper place in which to store the equipment used in the serving of the lunch, and you should draw this matter to his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Peterson, the teacher, a list of sewing and knitting materials required to enable sewing and knitting to be taught the pupils at that school.\n\nThe yarn and knitting needles can be supplied from our storehouse, a sufficient quantity of flannellette, serge and galatea can be purchased locally at a cost of approximately $15.00. The weaving mats, sewing cards and silkeine I would ask the Department to kindly mail me, as these supplies cannot be procured locally. The average attendance at this school is about nine daily.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a list of materials required by the teacher of the Frog Lake Indian Day School for the teaching of sewing and knitting to the pupils. We note that you can supply the yarn and knitting needles for the pupils from the store house, and you may do so.\n\nYou may purchase and have delivered a quantity of flannellets, serge and galatea, not exceeding approximately $15 in cost. Please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWe are placing an order here with the Government Stationery Office to send to your address a number of weaving mats, sewing cards and silkens.\n\nIt is noted you have arranged to carry out the repairs required to place the school building in a comfortable condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI visited the Frog Lake Day School on the afternoon of the 13th of October. There are 17 enrolled at this school, 10 boys and 7 girls; of these 7 boys and 6 girls were present. The attendance at this school has been better since my last visit, but there is still a great deal of room for improvement.\n\nSince my last visit the teacher has been supplied with Drimilk during the summer months. He states that the children are not very partial to it, but they like it when boiled with rice and they have been giving it to them in this manner. This will be substituted on November 1st and during the winter months with a warm bowl of soup and tea. There is no doubt that the providing of this inexpensive meal is a great boon to the children.\n\nThe children are required to clean themselves up when they come to the school and they had adequate clothing for the season.\n\nI reported on the condition of the school building last year. The conditions are practically the same only the school does not present so good an appearance as in the winter time as the rains had washed the mud off in streaks. Both the teacher's residence and the school are log buildings and are plastered with mud. It is hard to keep the buildings in repair and I would suggest that a small addition to the house be allowed for a summer kitchen and storage. The total cost of these repairs should not exceed $150.00.\n\nThe teacher has a small garden which was fairly good this year.\n\nMr. A. E. Peterson is still holding the position of teacher. He appears to be a man of good common sense and has practical experience, apart from his teaching ability, in western farming. His presence on the reserve has a good influence, but his authority over the Indians is, of course, very limited.\n\nW. Murison, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCommissioners Office, Regina, Sask.\nNov. 29th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe teacher's residence at Frog Lake might be improved but it seems to me that nothing much can be done to make it more habitable.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, in a report on his recent inspection of the Frog Lake Indian Day School, states as follows regarding the condition of the school building and teacher's residence:\n\n\"I reported on the condition of the school building last year. The conditions are practically the same only the school does not present so good an appearance as in the winter time as the rains had washed the mud off in streaks. Both the teacher's residence and the school are log buildings and are plastered with mud. It is hard to keep the buildings in repair and I would suggest that a small addition to the house be allowed for a summer kitchen and storage. The total cost of these repairs should not exceed $150.\"\n\nIt is, no doubt, too late this season to undertake the erection of a small addition and to carry out the other recommendations of the Inspector. You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, giving full information as to the work you would recommend be performed and particulars as to the erection of a small addition to the house to be used as a summer kitchen and for storage purposes. An estimate of the cost of any work recommended by you should also be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn my Estimates for 1929-30 I have placed an item of $260.00 for the purpose of erecting a small building at the Frog Lake Indian Day School, where the children's lunches could be cooked and eaten. It has since occurred to me that if we removed the old Indian Day School, situated about two miles from the present one, it would be very suitable for this purpose. It is in very fair condition, is a one and one-half story lumber building, 20 x 18 feet in size.\n\nThis building can be removed and placed at the present Day School site for, I believe, an amount not exceeding $100.00, but should be done this winter, on sleighs. Then, next spring, it could be made fit for use at very little additional expense. I would ask the Department's consideration of this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department approves of the moving of the old Indian day school building to the present location of the Frog Lake Indian Day School. It is noted that you can have this building moved and placed on the present site for an amount not exceeding $100. Next spring you should report regarding what additional expense it will be necessary to incur to put it in good shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

This school has never had an adequate water supply, although several shallow wells have been dug there. I believe that the cost of a well for this school would be, approximately, the same as that for the Long Lake School.\nOttawa, May 8th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of boring a well for the use of the Long Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the well boring outfit mentioned by you to bore a well at this school. We note that the approximate cost, including cribbing, will be approximately $225, depending on the depth to which the well will have to be bored. You may also arrange for the purchase and installation of a pump of a suitable type, if same is required, and you should see that the well is satisfactorily completed in all respects and that there is an ample supply of water for school use.\n\nRelative to the boring of a well by the same outfit, and at the same cost, at the Frog Lake Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department will also approve of your arranging to have a well bored at this school. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to expend any larger amount in having the work done at this school than at the Long Lake School. You may also arrange for the purchase and installation of a pump, if same is required.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of having the wells satisfactorily completed at both the above schools in your hands to have the work carried out at the least possible expense, and after these wells have been bored, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is possible that his successor in the Bishopric may move to build a new church, in which case the building might not be available for school purposes.\n\nI have reported to the Bishop the result of our conference yesterday.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will keep in mind the advisability of erecting a suitable classroom in the near future and have already directed that a note be taken for our next Estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

You might advise the Department as to the necessity for the above work at each of these schools.\n\nYou may arrange to purchase and supply screen windows and doors for the Frog Lake School. It is noted that you estimate the cost to be $21.50.\n\nRegarding the supplying of a water filter for the Ministikwan Day School, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of same at a cost not to exceed your estimate of $15.\n\nAfter the above purchases have been made, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\n\nT. R. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nI visited this school on the 30th of April, and found 8 pupils present out of an enrolment of 13. The average attendance for the month was 8. It appears that 6 of the pupils are fairly regular in their attendance, but the attendance of the balance is very irregular owing to their parents leaving the reserve frequently. The children who are attending regularly are making good progress.\n\nThe school is a log building, and appears to be fairly comfortable; I found both the classroom and the pupils clean. They have a teeter and a football for recreations. A mid-day meal is given to the children. I noted an improvement in the teacher's residence; the downstairs part of which has been lined with plaster board and painted. The upstairs has not been completed as there was not sufficient funds available.\n\nMr. A. E. Peterson, the teacher, is well qualified for his position. He also supervises the Indians on the reserve, and keeps the Agent informed regarding their activities. He is a very useful man, and a good influence on the reserve.\nThe Indian Agency\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nIn Account With\nA. F.

The material, yarn, flannelette, denim and dress goods (cotton flannel) is to be made into garments for the school children by members of the Homemakers' Clubs, in conjunction with the vocational training classes of the schools.\n\nNone of the parents concerned are able to provide this extra clothing for their children, and I would earnestly request that the material be supplied if at all possible. It was allowed last year and I trust will be again as the result will be better attendance and better health.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDonald H.

The matter of eavestroughing also came up and I asked Mr. Cameron, the Agent, to look into this and let me have a report on the cost of this.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Cameron stating that we can get a good 15 barrel capacity tank made out of wood for $25.00 including the cost of labour, delivered. In connection with the eavestroughing we can buy enough lumber up there to make troughs that will go around the house and the cost of the lumber and the labour would be $10.00.\n\nI would therefore ask for authority to spend $35.00 as follows: $25.00 for the tank and $10.00 for the eavestroughing.\n\nM.

If you agree, I will write to the bishop concerned advising him of our plans and that we will no longer require his church for school purposes after 1950. Apparently, the attendance at this school is very poor, and Major Clark suggests that some of these pupils who failed to attend regularly and punctually might well be sent to residential school.\n\nYou can advise Mr. Taylor to make local purchase of the following janitor's supplies:\n\n- 12 bars lifebuoy soap,\n- 1 case paper towels,\n- 1 case toilet tissue,\n- 12 boxes Kleenex,\n- also 4 soft balls,\n- 2 soft ball bats\n- 1 football.\n\nBernard F.

As the season will evidently be late by the time the supplementary estimates are brought down in the house, I would appreciate your comment on the following proposals:\n\n1. That funds be transferred from other projects to enable the erection of the new schools required at Frog Lake and Long Lake.\n\n2. That these schools be erected in accordance with plan 888 and that they be advertised jointly so that contractors can bid on both projects. We have found elsewhere that we were able to receive tenders much lower than when we only advertised one project.\n\n3. That the site of the Frog Lake school should be on the property previously viewed by Mr. Clark and Mr. Taylor.\n\n4. That the Long Lake school site be carefully investigated. The present school does not seem to serve more than half the available pupils and there is some difficulty due to the water.\nWould it be possible to have a map made of the Reserve indicating the number of children of school age so that we can select a proper site for the school based on present and future needs.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter directly to Mr. Taylor so that you will be able to contact him directly concerning the points raised in this letter. If you can have an army message sent to me by August 12th, we can arrange to advertise for tenders.\n\nBernard F.

The previous wells have been dug by hand and I feel that a good well could be obtained with the use of a boring machine. Major Clark was supplied with the facts and recommended that two wells be bored (one for the school and one for the present residence) and then should one well give out without notice, the other would be available. I do not believe that these wells will have to be over 25 feet in depth and should not cost any more than the one at Goodfish Lake and the one at Long Lake, however, I intend to make enquiries on prices of cribbing, either steel or cement, in place of the usual spruce cribbing as this may eliminate our trouble in the sand.\n\nI would therefore request that an advance of $250.00 for labour and authority to voucher for materials for cribbing. I will submit a further report in the near future regarding the prices on cribbing.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\n\nc.c. G.H. Gooderham, Reg.

Original on File No 108.270-9\n\nWe have applied to Mr R.S. McKenzie through our Instructor that we wished to have our school re-opened on this Reserve but he told him that this school was closed for ever we humbly beg the government to re-open our School as soon as possible as we consider we have a right to have a school when we want it according to our Treaty.\n\nSgd James Smith - Chief\nand several other members of B\nOffice of the Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nMistawasis P.O.\nJune 17th, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the petition of the Indians of James Smith's reserve, accompanying your letter of the 5th of May, No. 33/9, I beg to say regarding the request that the Day School on that reserve be re-opened that on enquiry I found there are 18 children of school age within a radius of two miles from the school, and a few more at a greater distance. This would in my opinion quite warrant the re-opening of the school if it were not for the fact that the parents of 12 of these children are much devoted to hunting and are consequently absent with their families from the reserve for usually about 3 months beginning with October.\n\nOn examining the School Register for some years previous to the closing of the school, I found that the attendance had once been quite satisfactory, but that it had fallen off steadily for about two years before the closing.\n\nHere as everywhere else it requires the utmost diligence on the part of the teacher.\nteacher and the other officials to whose duties this matter pertains to maintain an attendance sufficiently large and regular to insure useful work; and I am of the impression that notwithstanding the hunting habits of the Indians the day school here could be kept open profitably provided the right kind of teacher could be secured. The Indians seem to recognize that if the school is re-opened a responsibility rests upon them to take the full benefit of the school by sending their children regularly. When speaking with them on the subject I emphasized this point, intimating that if it were reopened it would only be as a further trial which could not be continued long unless it proved satisfactory.\n\nThe building is still in tolerably good repair, and much of the necessary school material remains on hand.\n\nThe efforts that have hitherto been put forth to induce these Indians to send their children to the Boarding and Industrial Schools have been attended with little success, and I think it is in the interest of Indian education that another attempt be made to establish a successful Day School on this reserve.\n\nI have the honour &c.\n\nW.J. Chisholm\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nWinnipeg,\n\nMan.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose a copy of a report received from Mr. Inspector Chisholm relating to the last paragraph of a petition from the John Smith's Reserve Indians transmitted to me in Department's letter, No.108,270-9, of the 25th. of April last, and to say that there being a sum in the Estimates for the school of the above named reserve, I have authorized the reopening of the school and requested Archdeacon J.A.Mackay to submit the name of a suitable teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to my letter of even number of the 28th ultimo and to say that owing to a clerical error the John Smith School was mentioned instead of James Smith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nCommissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to my predecessor's letter of the 28th June of even number, I beg to state that the re-opening of the school on James Smith's Reserve was postponed owing to the schoolhouse being used as a Government storehouse, and also that it required repairs before it could be occupied as a schoolhouse, the cost of which was estimated by Mr. Agent McKenzie at from $100.00 and $110.00. As there were no funds available for the purpose the matter was left in abeyance and the Agent instructed to place the amount in his estimates for 1899-1900 as well as a sum for the erection of a new storehouse.\n\nMr. T.O. Davis, M.P., is now pressing the reopening of the school and states that Mr. Donald McDonald was recommended by Archdeacon J.A. MacKay for the position of teacher and has been waiting since July last. Mr. Davis estimates that the really necessary repairs required before the school could be opened would not cost more than $25.00 and for that sum Mr. McDonald is prepared to undertake the work. I have therefore authorized Mr. Agent McKenzie to accept the offer of Mr. McDonald and have the school opened without further delay.\n\nMr. Davis informs me that there will be no difficulty about storing the supplies as there is a building close at hand.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nhand that could be obtained for the purpose, and that as the Church Authorities were notified in July last that the school would be opened they do not understand the delay.\n\nI trust that my action in the matter will meet with your approval. In a recent letter received from the Minister he expresses a wish that Mr. Davis' recommendations should receive consideration and in this matter I fully concur in the action he suggests.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nThe Secretary,\n\nNotifying the Commis' action & directing that the school on James Wright Reserve, Derek Lake Agency, should be approved.\n\nAt the rate of $350 per annum has not been drawn upon; if necessary I suppose the cost of $25 for repairs to the school house can be paid out of the money provided for salary.\n\nH. C. Ross,\n29 Dec. 1876.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo relative to the re-opening of the school on James Smith's Reserve; and in reply I beg to say that your action in authorizing Mr Agent McKenzie to accept the offer of Mr McDonald, the new teacher, to repair the building for the sum of $25, is approved of, and it is hoped that the school will be opened without further delay.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI feel very thankful to the Dept. for having re-opened our school. I have used my influence persuading my people to make their children attend school. The Reserve being so large some people live too far away from the present school house consequently all the children of school age cannot attend, therefore I would like to see a boarding house attached to the school for the children who live too far away or an establishment built which would be available for training some of the boys & girls in useful trades. I hope you will not ignore this request.\n\n(Sgd) James Smith, Chief\n\nIndian Affairs.

The officer above referred to in closing his report writes as follows: \"The parents of the James Smith's reserve desire to have their children learn to read and write, but the way this desire is met is a shame and a disgrace to be connected with it.\"\n\nIt is quite evident that the existing condition at this school must not be allowed to continue. The Department for its part is prepared to pay a better salary, if your Church succeeds in securing the services of someone who will raise the standard of the school. It is possible to obtain one with proper qualifications, and the Department would like you to take immediate steps to meet this situation.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe foregoing remarks are equally applicable to the school on the John Smith's reserve, which has already been the subject of correspondence with you, and the Department trusts that in each of these cases you will be able to provide teachers who will take advantage of the opportunities which evidently exist to make on these reserves schools which will be a credit to the Church and the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nM.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 12, 1909.\n\nRev.

It is of course absurd to expect that really qualified teachers can be had at the present scale of salary, even when supplemented, as it is in almost every case in this Reserve, by \u00a3100 per annum from the Church. Mr. Lefler, whose work appears to have been satisfactory to the Department, is a clergyman and was in receipt of the same amount from the Church as he received from the Department. The present arrangement is only temporary and\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is at present finishing his course at the training college here. However, as a clergyman, it is not likely that he can combine very long the duties of teacher with that of missionary, and it will be well to make definite arrangements for a permanent improvement in the school work. The conditions are not so favorable for a good day school at James Smith's as they are at John Smith's Reserve, but, with a competent teacher, things might be much better than they are at present.\n\nYours,\n\nJohn Mackay\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 30, 1909.\n\nVery Rev.

MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nBattleford, Sask.\nMay 27th 1909\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 118083/1 of the 16th inst., regarding the appointment of a teacher for the James Smith day school, I have been given to understand by the Bishop of Saskatchewan that he has recommended Miss Hall for the post temporarily, with the expectation of being able to find a satisfactory permanent teacher to take up the work after the end of June quarter.\n\nYours, Sir,\nJones the district\nJ.H. MacKay\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nDear Sir,\n\nI desire to lay before you a proposal concerning the Indian Day School at James Smith's Reserve, Fort Albert, Sask. You are aware that I have received word from your Dept. some months ago that the general run of our teachers at that school had not been satisfactory, that I nominated for appointment, for the spring months, Miss Treill, till I had time to select a qualified teacher.\n\nYou are also aware doubtless that that Reserve is on the list I sent the Dept. of places where you might try the improved Day School. I do not now think it would be well to institute just yet the improved school there in its highest & most impressive shape, as there may not be sufficient children. But I do feel that you might well take a step towards that end, by offering an increased salary, & giving a better grade of teaching, the mid-day meal, perhaps the garden & lessons in gardening, of which the new scheme spoke. It is perfectly plain that neither you nor I can expect to get a teacher worth...\nMy proposal is this, I will send Edward Ahenakew there as teacher if the Dep't will give him $500, or at least $400 per ann., the Church to make up the balance of his salary. I think the Dep't should give the $500, or $400 and rations, as the Church is giving him a house, a good one, just built, in which we have spent much money ($600 or more).\n\nMr. Edward Ahenakew is known to the Dep't; he has always had a good report. He has not indeed taken a Normal School Course, but he passed the examination of the Province in 2nd Class Certificate well, and since that time he has taken two years in Wycliffe College, Toronto, & a partial course at the University. His character & diligence are excellent. It is very difficult to procure certificated teachers, & I may say that Archdeacon M'Kay strongly commends this scheme.\n\nI propose that he should commence on July 1st. That Miss Smith may have ample notice, as well as Mr. Ahenakew, that I may make my own work fit in with this, I should be glad of an early answer.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.M. Saskatchewan\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, June 5, 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 21st ult. in reference to the Indian day school on John Smith's reserve, proposing to send Mr. Edward Ahenakew there as teacher, if the Department will pay him at least $400.00 per annum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the information regarding Mr. Ahenakew in the Department would not justify it in paying him at this rate, as the report received while he was in charge of this school in 1906 does not show that he would be fitted to conduct the school in a manner to entitle him to any advance over the rate of pay allowed teachers of Indian schools of the ordinary type, even with the training he has had since the report was made. The report referred to above reflected in no way upon Mr. Ahenakew's character but called attention to the careless way in which the school was conducted, and, for this reason the Department considers that it would be\n\nRight Rev. J.A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nbe preferable to obtain the services of a white teacher, and if you can secure one it will be willing to pay a fair salary. In the meantime the school might be left in charge of Miss Traill.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nJune 15th 1909.\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of June 5th 1909 No. 118088/1 re. Mr. E. Ahenakew and La Corne School. I beg leave to say that I feel sure it was his cousin Alexander Ahenakew that took that school in 1906 a very different sort of man. Mr. Edward Ahenakew is very careful and conscientious, and has always received a good report from the Inspector. I believe you would find him satisfactory, and superior in many ways to a white teacher. It will be much more satisfactory to us if he be allowed to take the school for a year on trial on the slightly increased salary that I asked for in my last letter.\n\nAn early answer will oblige as the half year is about ended.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, 24th June, 1908.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in further reference to the proposal to send Mr. Edward Ahenakew to the John Smith's Reserve in charge of the day school there, at a salary of $400.00 per year, and in reply beg to state that in view of your assurance that he will prove satisfactory, the Department will consent to his being given a trial, his retention of the position to be dependent on reports received in regard to his management of the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 29th., 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nReferring to my letters of the 6th and 8th of June, I find that through inadvertence the North Portia La Crosse School was called John Smith's. Of course it should have been James Smith's Reserve. I trust no confusion has arisen on account of this error.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter No. 118088/1 of the 5th inst., addressed to the Bishop of Saskatchewan, and also referring to previous communications with regard to the Sunday School on James Smith's Reserve (not James Smith) I beg to say that Mr. Edward Ahenakew who has been recommended by the Bishop for this school is not the teacher who had charge of the school in 1906. Mr. Edward Ahenakew holds a second class teacher's certificate, and since writing for this certificate, has had two years' training at Bishop's College, Toronto, besides a term in the training college here.\n\nHe has been teaching at Sturgeon Lake (William Smith's) at intervals during the last two years, and I am not aware that there are adverse reports of his work there, although the Surgeon\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nLake School does not offer much opportunity for a teacher to show his capabilities. With this explanation in mind, the Department will consider favorably the Bishop's proposition to appoint Mr. Armstrong to the charge of the school with a salary at the rate of $400 per annum.\n\nFailing this, as the Department so far has not been able to favour the establishment of an improved day school on James Smith's Reserve, would the Department undertake to make all the arrangements both for teacher and accommodation? This is suggested, not from any lack of appreciation of the privilege allowed by the Department to the Church, or recommending teachers to church schools, but from a sincere desire to see the day school a success, and the hope that the Department, with its wider opportunities, may be able to find a man capable of making the work a success. We are of course entitled to assume that the Department is not likely to appoint anyone to the post whose character...\nrature or teaching would be prejudicial to the missionary work of the Church.\n\nShould the Department see fit only to act on the above suggestion, would Mr. Edward Aten-\n\nwhere he allowed in the meantime to carry on the day school as it is, until the Department has made arrangements for the opening of an improved day school?\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obediently,\n\nJ.A. MacKay\nOttawa, July 10, 1909.\n\nVery Rev. Sirs,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ult. in further reference to the appointment of a teacher for the James Smith school, and in reply I beg to say that on the 24th ult. His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan was advised that Mr. Edward Ahenskew might be appointed to the position at a salary of $400.00 per annum, his retention to be dependent upon reports received in regard to the management of the school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J.A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, July 26, 1909.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the appointment of a teacher for the James Smith's school I beg to say that since you were written to on the 10th inst., an application has been received from Miss Anna A. Hawley, who is at present engaged at the Lethbridge hospital, for a position as teacher in an Indian school.\n\nShe is a duly qualified teacher and a trained nurse and has expressed her desire to engage in Indian school work. Miss Hawley is an Anglican and has excellent testimonials and references and the Department is anxious to avail itself of her services.\n\nAs you are already aware the Department is not favourably impressed with Mr. Edward Ahenakew, and, although it has agreed to his appointment as teacher of this school, it would much prefer that the position should be given to Miss Hawley, as, from a late report, the Indians of this reserve are in need of a teacher who has had nursing experience and would undertake the work in a missionary spirit.\n\nRight Rev. J.A. Newnham, D.D.,\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nThe Department does not think it would be well to lose the opportunity of securing the services of Miss Rawley, and it would like to know if you could not make some other arrangements for Ahenakew.\n\nIf Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Mc Dougall cannot take up the work on John Smith's reserve until a suitable house is provided, could not Ahenakew be sent there temporarily? It has been suggested that the James Smith's reserve would be the most suitable location for Mr. and Mrs. Mc Dougall. If you concur in this, Miss Rawley might be given the John Smith's school and Ahenakew could take temporary charge of the James Smith's school, until suitable buildings are erected and other provision made.\n\nThere is now at Fort a la Corne a really model day school, in charge of Mrs. Gedfrey, and if the other two schools were placed in charge of competent teachers, with the additional qualifications of trained nurses, excellent results would no doubt follow.\n\nThe Department would like an early reply, as Miss Rawley is anxious to know whether her services will be utilized.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nAugust 6th 1909.\n\nMiss Anna A Hawley.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th of July addressed to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan. I am instructed to say that His Lordship is pleased to fall in with your wishes and to allow Miss Anna A Hawley to take charge of the School on James Smith's Reserve at Fort \u00e0 la Corne. Mr. Edward Ahenakew will do Mission work on the same reserve and also at Big Heads, at the expense of the Diocese, and will occupy the parsonage at James Smith's.\n\nThe Rev. and Mrs Macdougall are in need of a house on John Smith's Reserve, where they are to take charge of a School.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nJames Taylor\nSecretary.\nMontreal Lake.\n\nAug. 7th 1909.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI need only write a few lines. I left instructions with Rev. Jas. Taylor, the Secretary of Synod, to answer your letter about La Corne School, Miss Hawley for teacher, and Edward Ahenakew.\n\nHe was to say that I was willing to comply with your desire to engage Miss Hawley for the school, and would find other work for Ahenakew. I wish to comply with the Department, but I would only remind you that the responsibility therefore is yours. I do not see how a single lady, however accomplished, is going to do all that was promised by the Department to improve Day-Schools. She may be a trained nurse and an accomplished teacher, but she cannot be expected to fill both places, and to teach the girls little household duties, and to cook the mid-day meal, and superintend the School garden. The programme you laid down was a man and his wife for the school, and a nurse to visit the homes, and look after the hygiene of the Indians. I cannot move Ahenakew from La Corne, as you suggest as we need him to visit the Indians, hold their services of worship, and generally act as their Missionary. But we take him on our pay roll entirely, and leave the school to your Department. It is an\nextra expense to us, but at least you cannot say that we have not complied with your wishes. I hope that your plan will prove a success, and that later you will add to the La Corne staff, so that your promised programme may be fulfilled. The house is ours, and will be needed by Ahenakew, so the Department has to provide a house for Miss Hawley. I trust you will soon be able to provide a house for the Macdougalls at John Smith's Reserve. The Indians are expecting him, the teacher is under notice to leave, and Mr. Macdougall is naturally very unsettled in his present parish, and would like to know what he is to do.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan.\n\nI have told Ahenakew of your wishes. I don't know when you wish the change made. He will stay on till relieved, but should have notice.\nThe Salt Hospital\nLethbridge - Alberta\n\nJune 29th 1946\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir -\n\nI should like to take up work amongst the Indians and am writing to ask if there is the possibility of a vacancy for a nurse in this part of the country.\nI am a Canadian from the Province of Quebec - a graduate of the City Hospital Training School for Nurses, Montreal, Class 1904.\n\nShortly after graduation was called to the Memorial Hospital, in the same city, as night Superintendent, and later Assistant Superintendent of Nurses.\n\nI resigned this position, returned to Canada to take a post-graduate course in district nursing.\n\nI came first - and for eighteen months was head nurse at the hospital in Yorkton, Sask., and recently came to Alberta, and accepted a position on the staff of the Gaet Hospital.\n\nHave you any hospitals on the reserve in this part of the country? What salary does a nurse receive?\n\nAny information regarding this work would be most gratefully received.\n\nBelieve me, very truly yours,\n\nAnna A. Harvey.\nOttawa, 21st July, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant in further reference to your application for employment under this Department as teacher in an Indian school. In reply I beg to say that the Department is making enquiries with a view to availing itself of your services, and as soon as it is definitely decided where you could be placed you will be further advised. The Department is contemplating the establishing of a new day school in the Province of Saskatchewan near the main line of the C.P.R., and trusts to be able to give you full particulars early next month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Anna A.

Kindly let me know if all is satisfactory.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery truly Yours,\n\nAnna O. Hawley\nOttawa, August 30, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you were advised by wire of today's date, the Department has appointed Miss Anna A. Hawley as Nurse and teacher on the James Smith reserve, to take charge of the James Smith school. She is a trained nurse and duly qualified teacher, and the Bishop of Saskatchewan has agreed to her appointment, and Assiniboine will have nothing to do with the school, his duties being confined to missionary work on the reserve. However, as he is to remain there, he will require the house, which is the property of the Church.\n\nThe Department has agreed to provide accommodation for Miss Hawley and when it made this offer it expected to have the use of the house. As this is not available, the Department would like you to report as to what accommodation can be provided. If a suitable boarding place can be had, this will answer; if not, other provision will have to be made. In the meantime temporary arrangements for Miss Hawley's accommodation should be made. Miss Hawley has been\n\nJ.A.

Macarthur,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nMiss Hawley appointed nurse and teacher James Smiths.\n\nLetter following.\n\nJ.D. McLean.\n\nOttawa, August 30, 1909.\n\nMiss Anna A. Hawley,\nThe Hospital,\nMaple Creek, Sask.\n\nProceed to Duck Lake. Call on Indian Agent Macarthur. Await instructions.\n\nJ.D. McLean.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of August 30th.\n\nI have the honour to report that Miss A.A. Hawley arrived here on the 3rd instant. On the 4th I left with her for the James Smiths Reserve, arriving there on the 6th. I found the north school closed, the teacher, Mr. Ahenakew, having taken his holidays. He was expected some time this week, so I arranged that Farmer McCleay would explain the situation to him upon his return. I made a temporary arrangement with Farmer McCleay to board Miss Hawley for twenty dollars per month. This is a little high, but as Mr. McCleay explained, his wife has three young children, so he could only keep Miss Hawley by engaging a servant, and that being the case, he could not be expected to do it for much less.\n\nMiss Hawley is very much at sea over her work. The farmhouse is a mile from the school and she could not see that she could do very much nursing and teach the school. I advised her to spend the few days before school opens in visiting the parents and in getting acquainted with the situation.\n\nWe called upon Mrs. Gedfrey on the way down. We were not in time to visit the school, but we met half a dozen girls going home. Miss Hawley was more than pleased with their appearance and the bright, cheerful\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ncheerful way in which they answered when spoken to.\n\nTo show the value of such women on a reserve, I take the liberty of mentioning an incident told by Mrs Godfrey to Miss Hawley, on the latter inquiring about the work. \"Oh, she said, it is all kinds.\" For instance, just the other day, word was brought me that a newborn babe was all the time crying, the mother's milk not having come. What have you been feeding it? Beef tea. Well I explained that that would kill the child. I gave them sugar and told them to just let it have sugar and water, it would require nothing else until its mother's milk would come. I sent a little diluted castoria to relieve the child's bowels. Next morning they were back again, the child was still crying. I went to see what was the matter and found that instead of following my instructions, they were feeding the child on undiluted cow's milk. The child was bloated. I gave it the castoria and a warm bath, and before leaving, a sleeping powder. Baby woke alright in the morning, the mother's milk having come, the child is now doing splendid.\"\n\nThis story needs no comment; just a life saved in the ordinary routine of daily life.\n\nBefore leaving, I told Miss Hawley to just think of her position as being cast on the reserve with her qualifications of teacher and nurse, study up the situation and then report if she could do all the work, or how much of it.\n\nThe mission house is occupied by Mr. Ahenakew. It is within 400 or 500 yards of the school. Miss Hawley thought that if it could be arranged, it would be well for her to occupy the house, and board Mr. Ahenakew, as of course, a servant would be required in connection with the mid-day meals. In this connection, on my return here, I met on the train, Ven. Archdeacon J.A. McKay and spoke to him of Miss Hawley's desire to get\nget the mission house, and if necessary, to board the missionary. Mr. McKay thought the proposal a good one and upon the Bishop's return will bring the proposal before him.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nBishopsthope,\nPrince Albert, Sask.,\nSept/23, 1909.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI asked you to notify me if you decided to send the lady teacher to La Corne instead of E. Ahenakew. I have heard nothing from you, but I hear that without waiting for the end of the quarter and without answering my letter, you have placed her there. I cheerfully submitted to your wish in the matter, against my judgement and only asked for an answer; and it seems strange that I did not get that answer.\n\nI remain, Yours faithfully,\n\nJ.A.Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, October 4, 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd ult., which deals with the appointment of Miss Hawley as teacher of the James Smith Indian day school I beg to say that the Department did not understand from your letter of the 7th August, last, that you wished to be advised of the intention of the Department to send Miss Hawley to take charge of this school, as in a communication from the Rev. James Taylor, Secretary of your diocese, dated the 6th of that month, he stated that he was instructed by Your Lordship to say that you were pleased to fall in with the Department's wishes and allow Miss Anna A. Hawley to take charge of this school.\n\nThe Department did not think that any further notice was necessary but regrets that any misunderstanding should have occurred.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\nyour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 605-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 11th May,\n\nNo. 25334/I, and subsequent letters, I have the honour to report that I visited the Lacerte north school on the 11th instant. During the past six years I have made many visits to this school, but my last one was the only really pleasant visit made during the whole period. The attendance, thirteen, was below the average, as all Indians who can move are away hunting rats, but every boy and girl in school was interested in the work. Miss Hawley has gained their entire confidence and she has wakened them up and made them as sharp and prompt as white children. They may have been able to read before, but I never heard them, they may have been able to do sums on black board but I never saw them, they may have been able to draw, but I never saw any of their work. (I enclose a few drawings taken from Miss Hawley's desk) They I am sure, could not knit; now all the girls have learned to knit. I sent, in October, 6 pounds of yarn to the school; this has all been used up in making hoods and mitts. Miss Hawley would like very much if she could be supplied with 6 pounds more to make comforters for the girls and scarfs for the boys. From the excellent use made of what has been supplied, I trust her request will be granted.\n\nAs you are aware, at this season of the year the Indians\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndians all go away hunting, and most of them take their families with them. This year five of Miss Hawley's girls, the eldest being fifteen, arranged that instead of going to the hunt with their parents they would all live in one house and attend school. A striking tribute to the teacher's worth.\n\nNow to turn to Nurse Hawley: I have to report that from the 6th to the end of September she treated 17 dispensary patients, made 8 visits on calls to homes, and 5 casual visits. In October she treated 40 dispensary patients and made 15 visits. Up to the 11th November she treated 11 dispensary patients and made 18 visits. Miss Hawley is a splendid woman, has good health, is thoroughly in love with her work, and without doubt if she remains on the Reserve, the infant mortality will from now on show a decrease. The Department has been most fortunate in securing her services, and she will prove a great blessing to both old and young on the reserve.\n\nFinding things in the above condition, I incurred some expense without authority, but as I felt that the Department would expect me to keep the work going on I acted on my own judgment. You are aware that the children of the LaCerne south school have had a mid-day meal for the past five months, and as I understood the intention was to give the north school the same treatment, I arranged for it to begin at once. We have no suitable building near the school that could be used as a kitchen, but I remembered that the Department, some years ago, sent a good sized tent to the Duck Lake Boarding school and which I knew was not in use. Miss Hawley agreed with me in thinking that it would do for the winter. I have secured the tent and shipped\nshipped it to La Corne, and Farmer McCloy will see to its being put up and a floor put in. The next most important outlay was for a range, as when the Indians return I expect the average attendance at the school will be between 25 and 30, the ordinary cook stove would be too small. I also purchased the required pots, pans, etc. I further arranged, subject to your approval, with Mr. Ahenakew to drive the children to and from school at a cost of 75 cents for each trip. He will have to drive three miles in one direction and one mile in another, so that if it is to be done at all it could not be done for less. I tried to find an Indian who has a team that could do the work and also chop the wood, light the fires and sweep out the school, but none suitable could be got. I instructed Farmer McCloy to have wood hauled and chopped, the fires lit and the school swept. Returning to Nurse Hawley, Farmer McCloy drew my attention to the dispensary patients, who were all treated in his kitchen. Mr. McCloy was very reasonable. He thoroughly appreciates Miss Hawley's services, but his children are very young, a number of the patients are very scrupulous and while he could not very well see what could be done, he was uneasy. Nurse Hawley also spoke to me on the subject; she did not like it and it was not the right thing. We have a leg building used as a ration house which can be spared and fitted up as a dispensary at a cost of from 30 to 50 dollars and I gave instructions to Farmer McCloy to have this done.\n\nThere is one other matter that I wish to bring before you. You have promised to give Mrs. Gedfrey means to furnish a Christmas tree for her school. I would point out that it is no fault of the children of the north school if they have gained no medals or prizes, but I\nI am sure both they and their parents would feel hurt if the Department gave a Christmas tree to one school and not to the other. I estimate the expense of a Christmas tree for this school at $20.00.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nsir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, reporting very fully on the work being done at the North Portage la Corne school, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is exceedingly gratified to learn of the much improved conditions at this reserve.\n\nYou may provide Miss Hawley with the additional six pounds of yarn which she needs to continue the making of comforters and scarfs for the children, and your action in incurring some small expenditure in connection with the supplying of a mid-day meal and bringing the tent from the Duck Lake Boarding School to be used as a kitchen is approved, as is also the arrangement for bringing the children to school and for lighting the fires, etc.\n\nIn view of the good work being done by Miss Hawley in the dispensing of medicine the Department approves of the action taken in fitting up the log building previously used as a ration house for a dispensary.\n\nYou may also expend the sum mentioned in the providing of a suitable Christmas tree for the children of this school.\n\nSome few days ago Mr. Inspector Chisholm was authorized to have a sketch for an approved teacher's dwelling, with a pupils' kitchen and dining-room attached, prepared in Prince Albert, and he was instructed to communicate\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nwith you as soon as this sketch was completed with a view to having the dining-room erected at the James Smith's school this season; however, if it is found that the tent gives satisfaction it may be well not to undertake any action but complete the buildings at the one time. The Department would be glad to hear from you at a later date in reference to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a most commendatory report from Mr. Agent Macarthur on the work being performed by you in the James Smith's School and on that portion of the reserve connected with it.\n\nThe Department desires to express its most hearty appreciation of your efforts for the advancement of the children and the improvement of the home conditions on the reserve, especially in connection with your work as nurse.\n\nThe action taken by Mr. Macarthur in providing you with a dispensary and making temporary arrangements for a dining-room, etc., have been approved, and he has been authorized to provide the necessary material for a Christmas tree for the pupils.\n\nThe accommodation which the Department has been able up to the present to provide is only temporary, and it hopes next year to be able to give you proper equipment to carry on your work to the best advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

It will, however, be necessary to provide dining-room accommodation, but this can be arranged for so that the building will form an annex to a residence, if erected at a later date. Miss Hawley is doing such excellent work on this reserve that the Department does not contemplate replacing her by a married man unless found necessary to do so. The question of accommodation must, however, be considered and the Department is very anxious to know whether Mr. Tenant will be able to board Miss Hawley.\n\nProvision for dining-rooms at the two schools on this reserve will be considered as soon as the plans, which are now in Mr. Chisholm's hands, are completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When last at the reserve I had a conversation with Miss Hawley upon the subject and I suggested that if Mr. Tennant could not board her, we might rearrange the dispensary so that, at little expense, the ground floor could be turned into a livingroom and a bedroom, while the upstairs part could be used as a dispensary. This change could be made at a cost, I estimate, of from $50.00 to $75.00, and Miss Hawley thought it would do very well. However, it will be much better if Mr. Tennant can board her as she has sufficient work to attend to without having to give any of her time to housekeeping.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, and in reply I beg to say that it is considered preferable that Miss Hawley should board with Mr. Tennant, so that her work in the school-room and on the reserve may not be interfered with by attention to household duties, which would be necessary in the event of arrangements being made for her to board herself.\n\nYour suggestion in regard to fitting up the ground floor of the dispensary for a living room will be kept in mind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\n\nJ.

Apart from this I feel that it would be a saving to the Department in doctors' fees.\n\nAt the present time when a patient is really ill the best I can do (with my school work) is to make one visit per day unless the home happens to be near. In the majority of cases treatment is not intelligently carried out by the Indians, and they not understanding the probable consequences, advice is often not regarded seriously. The absence of every facility in their homes, and the lack of proper diet during illness, together with the too small houses, do not tend to the best results for labor expended.\n\nUnder these circumstances there are times when I do not feel justified in assuming the entire responsibility, whereas if things were so arranged that I could watch the progress, and note the response to treatment rightly administered, it would relieve the nurse of much anxiety, lessen expenses of the medical man, and result in more satisfaction to all concerned.\n\nFortunately, the results thus far have been in a large measure successful, and I believe the confidence of the Indians is being steadily gained, as the enclosed report will show. At first my patients consisted wholly of women and children, but the present report includes ten men.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Anna A. Hawley.\nOttawa, 13th April, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Nurse Hawley's letter of 31st ultimo, addressed to you, copy of which has come to hand, in which she points out the necessity for some hospital accommodation, for at least two beds for sick Indians; I beg to say that you may take steps to provide same by the purchase of a suitable Hospital Tent, beds etc.\n\nIf you are unable to get a suitable Hospital Tent at Prince Albert at a reasonable price it should be ordered from Messrs. Bromley and Hague Ltd., of Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McKean\n\nSecretary.\n\nJas. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nExtract from return of the James Smith school for the quarter ending March 31, 1910.\n\nSatisfactory progress has been made by the majority of the pupils. The attendance for January and February was good average 231/6 and 19 1/5 respectively. An epidemic of colds, coughs and \"la Grippe\" together with the spring hunting trips considerably lowered the average for March.\n\nThe children are members of the \"Legion of the West\" and contribute from time to time letters to the children's page of the Winnipeg Free Press. A year's subscription to the Weekly Edition of this paper has been donated to the school. We are hoping in the near future to have a small circulating library composed of brightly colored picture books with easy reading.\n\nFriday afternoon of each week is devoted to knitting, crocheting, etc.\n\nA Boys' Club has been organized with a charter membership of nine. Its object is to promote good habits among young Indian lads. Talks on various subjects followed by a social hour are given monthly by the teacher.\n\nThe catechist who is about to leave the Mission spent an afternoon at the school and gave an interesting talk to the children commending them for the good work they are doing. The children took advantage of the opportunity to present him with a handsomely bound organ edition of \"The Book of Common Praise\" as a slight token of their affection. A little Indian lad (No. 4, Alfred Head, aged 14) made the presentation in a manner which would have done credit to any English boy.\n\nIndian Affairs.

During the six years that the LaCorne south school has been in operation, the past average attendance for this quarter was 9\u00bd, and that too with Mrs. Godfrey as teacher, this quarter it is 15.

I reached the Reserve yesterday (Friday) and found the Indians telling...\nme about the people \"very much sick.\"\nSo I was out the next beating\npath again before getting my\nhat off. I have had a very delight-\nful holiday\u2014nearly all of which\nwas spent in Wikwemikong\u2014\nThe people were good to me\n\"medicine woman\" I brought\nhome presents for the little In-\ndian Church and the addresses of\ngirls who hope to eventually\ntake up Indian work.\nI am looking forward with\ninterest to your coming visit.\nAs I have so many things\nto discuss with you\u2014\nI feel however that I must talk about the great and you will think perjucial subject of salary. I am bringing this subject up for this reason. I was interviewed regarding the possibility of accepting a hospital position as Superintendent and my arrival in Winnipeg a letter informed me that the position would be vacant at the end of October. I firmly declined to discuss the matter until I had communicated with you.\nfrom the Indian Department. I have received every consideration, and the assurance of interest and sympathy in the work I am trying to do.\n\nIf the work on the northern portion of James Smith's Reserve has been successful during the past year, I feel it is largely owing to the fact, wisdom, advice and encouragement of the Indian Agent. Therefore, I should prefer to remain with the Indian Department, under\nThe officials who have shown so much consideration in the past and have held out promising things for the future. I am glad they have wrapped up in a dinner month thoroughly enjoying it.\n\nHowever there is another side to the question. It is necessary that I should pitch my tent and \"sow the seed\" in that field which gives me larger reliance for future expenses.\n\nDoes the Department see its way clearly to increase my salary? And what is the best it can do for me?\nMany thanks for school supplies which have reached me. Both schools will be open on Monday. Hospital beds are filled with sick children.\n\nBelieve me very truly Yours,\n\nAnna O. Hawley\nFort la Corne,\nSaskatchewan\n\nSeptember 17th 1910\n\nMy dear Mr. MacArthur\u2014\n\nAs time goes on, I am more seriously considering the principal vacancy\u2014and unless the stipend is increased, I see no way clearly to increase my salary $200\u2014If I did it would be to my personal benefit\u2014to make the change. I see before me a beautiful nurses' home, well furnished with every modern convenience\u2014a well equipped hospital\u2014a private residence for assistant\u2014two maid servants and a man servant\u2014the chic car service into the city\u2014telephone connection\u2014no school work\u2014and a better salary than I have received here during the past year\u2014\nTo remain on James Smith's Reserve means another year with no place to call my home. I have a little room which is hardly habitable during the cold weather, and worse still during the warmer months\u2014a continual grind day by day in the schoolroom\u2014and the medical care of practically the entire reserve\u2014a band of Indians which is exceptionally weak physically.\n\nI felt greatly encouraged by the thought of an assistant, but\u2014she is neither a fully qualified teacher nor a graduate nurse, the bright of the battle must still be faced by me\u2014and I cannot do things in a half-hearted manner\u2014straight forward honest work, a determined effort to do my best, an earnest desire to make the Indians a little better off, a little happier because...\nHas sent to him among them - to do my best for them the sickness and the health - the school and out of school is the recipe for the real happiness I have experienced during the past three months on James Smith's Reserve.\n\nAs the principal vacancy will occur at an early date I feel sure you will let me hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nIn the meantime,\n\nBelieve me very truly yours,\n\nAnna Asworth Hawley\nFort \u00e0 la Corne\nSaskatchewan\nSeptember 19th 1910\n\nMy dear Mr. MacArthur,\n\nTo-day I have been looking up the records for my end of the Reserve, and I find that Dr. Hayolle has been called by me to this Reserve but twice during the past six months.\n\nThe records also show that during the past twelve months only two deaths have occurred on the northern portion of this Reserve among the 200 Indians\u2014one died of hemorrhage of the lungs\u2014the direct result of not acting upon advice given the other tubercular patient meningitis which always proves fatal\u2014two babies died away on a hunting expedition\u2014they were never under my care.\nDuring my months' holiday, the work was undertaken by the Missionary's wife (an experienced nurse) assisted by the family instructors. Mrs. White death\u2014and Mr. Visits from the doctor is the months record.\n\nSincerely this should dispel any doubt regarding the wisdom of placing a graduate nurse among this band of Indians. Against it is more satisfactory to the Indians than frequent visits from a doctor. I might also add it is a benefit to the Department financially.\n\nTaking all this into consideration, I do not feel I asked too much in my recent letter.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAnna Asquith\n\nHawley\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nI have the honour to enclose correspondence received by me from both Mrs. Godfrey and Miss Hawley. Regarding Miss Hawley, I do not know what to say. Her work on the reserve, so far, both as to school and nursing, has been exceptionally good, but I can gather from her correspondence and her conversation that she aims at nothing short of an hospital for the reserve with Miss Hawley as matron, a qualified nurse as assistant and relief from school work. I would be very sorry to see her leave the work, but I have never felt that she was a stayer, though in this I may be wrong.\n\nAfter another year would be soon enough to go farther in the work, other than erecting the necessary buildings.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5, 1910.\n\nJ. Macarthur,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDepartment wishes to retain Miss Hawley's services and will pay at the rate of five hundred for school and two hundred for hospital work. Notify her at once. Writing.\n\nJ. B. McLean,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 6, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to confirm the following telegram sent you yesterday:\u2014 \"Department wishes to retain Miss Hawley's services and will pay at the rate of five hundred for school and two hundred for hospital work. Notify her at once. Writing.\"\n\nIn view of the excellent work being performed by Miss Hawley both in the school-room and on the reserve at this point the Department feels justified in granting her the salary asked, viz.\u2014 $700.00 per annum from the 1st of October.\n\nAs the Department is now bearing the whole of the expense of the management of this and the South Portage la Corne school they are to be known in future as non-denominational schools and under the immediate control of the Department. As the Church has withdrawn its contributions to these schools it cannot in future be accorded any voice in their management.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. Referring to your telegram of 5th instant, which I received at Kinistino, I have the honour to inform you that I have arranged with Miss Hawley to remain on the James Smith's Reserve as teacher and nurse. Owing to the conditions on this reserve, the subject was surrounded with difficulties, and I acted to the best of my judgment. Miss Hawley is much more interested in nursing than she is in teaching, yet she is an exceptionally good teacher. The hospital work on this reserve is important, and Miss Hawley, as nurse, has done a great deal of good work, but I consider it necessary that one of the two works should receive from Miss Hawley, not her undivided, but her first attention, and of the two, under present conditions, I consider that you would wish the school work to receive that attention. I have therefore impressed upon Miss Hawley the absolute necessity of continuing her school work on the lines of the past year and, if possible, to still further increase the attendance.\n\nYour telegram authorized me to offer Miss Hawley $500.00 for school and $200.00 for hospital work. You\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nYou of course remembered that the Department was paying $240.00 for her board, and that with the increase, the total would be $940.00. I took the liberty of changing this to a payment of $700.00 per annum with one ration of beef or bacon, flour, tea, rice and oatmeal; also coal oil. This is not very much of an advance over the amount paid last year.\n\nA difficulty during the past year was help. I have arranged with Miss Hawley that a white girl, Miss Seymour, will be employed as assistant at $10.00 a month. Miss Seymour will cook the mid-day meal for the children, and the morning and evening meal for herself and Miss Hawley, leaving the latter, before and after school hours, free to attend to her patients. The tent is being used for a dining-room and unless circumstances arise during the winter, requiring further accommodation, I would not advise the purchase of another tent.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nReferring to my letter of 13th inst., No. 112, since my return here it has occurred to me that the Department may object to my arrangement of giving Miss Hawley rations. If so, the difficulty could, I think, be got over by paying her a sum in lieu of rations. I figure that at the retail price of the rations mentioned, the equivalent would be $100.00 per annum.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCause of death\nSpinal meningitis\nTuberculosis\n\nCalls for doctor\n\nNo house visitations 55\nNo dispensary calls 135\n\nNote: This list includes one hospital patient and eighteen dispensary calls from Southern portion of James Smith's Reserve.\n\nAll is respectfully submitted.\n\nAnna Asenath Hawley\n(Nurse and Teacher)\nFort-\u00e0-la-Corne\nSaskatchewan\nSeptember 30th 1910\n\nMr MacArthur\nIndian Agent\nSuck Lake\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to report the following work done as Nurse on James Smith's Reserve for the months of July and September.

Miss Hawley evidently thinks that these patients should have gone to Mrs. Godfrey. I think she should be made to understand that she is expected to render her services to any of the Indians of the James Smith's Reserve who may require same, as Mrs. Godfrey, though a smart woman, has had neither the training nor the experience that Miss Hawley has.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 24, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing Miss Hawley's report as nurse for the months of July and September.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not gather from the foot note made by Miss Hawley that she is opposed to treating patients from the southern portion of the reserve, but, should this be her attitude, I may say that the Department agrees with you that she should be required to render her services to any Indians on the reserve who may require the same. No doubt you will be able to arrange this matter satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nJ. Macarthur, M.O.,\nIndian Agent,\nTuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, October 26, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant in which you state that you have arranged with Miss Hawley to continue her work on the James Smiths reserve at a salary of $700.00 for teaching and field matron work with one ration of beef or bacon, flour, tea, rice, oatmeal and coal oil, and further that you have arranged with Miss Hawley that a white girl, Miss Seymour, will be employed as assistant at $10.00 per month to prepare the meals including that for the children at mid-day.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action and considers it more advisable to grant Miss Hawley a ration than to pay the equivalent in cash mentioned by you, viz.- $100.00 per annum. It is understood that the Department will be at no additional expense other than the salary for the services of the assistant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

SMITH RESERVE\n\nAny one who had chanced to pass the Mission School House at Fort-a-la-Corne (North) on Saturday last would have seen a band of more than a hundred Indians including a merry group of children dressed in their best with happy expectant faces. Was it not the day of the Fair? The First Annual Children's Fair in connection with the Mission School and a gala day it was.\n\nIn the spring the ground had been prepared and seeds sown water from the sloughs had been carried in buckets and kettles by the embryo agriculturists when rain did not favor the tiny plots. Saturday was harvest day. The exhibits were arranged on a long table and were admired by the many spectators.\n\nTo the children there never had been such good potatoes and corn such big turnips and onions grown before. The preserved berries and chocolate cakes were much in evidence as were the dormice which form part of the curriculum at this school and the results would have satisfied the taste of an epicurean. Vase after vase of flowers were there too, as the best arranged would gain a prize. A table of articles made in wool was much admired, socks mittens, hoods, mufflers, wristlets in all the colors of the rainbow.\n\nSome of the articles were very dainty amongst them being a child's hood and booties crocheted in pale blue Berlin decorated with satin ribbon. A rich dark red muffler with black border and a pale pink scarf.\n\nRev. Edward Ahnakeew, Chief James Head and Pat Britton kindly acted as judges.\n\nThe presence for a short time of Mr. MacArthur, Indian Agent was much appreciated and his evident interest in the Indian children's efforts should be a stimulus to greater things in the future.\n\nThe Union Jack floated over the Central tent in which Indian girls presided at a well arranged tea table prettily decorated with parsley and served tea to all visitors.\n\nMiss Turner kindly favored us with several selections on the \"phonograph\" which were greatly appreciated. An interesting programme of sports followed after which \"Fair Canada\" was rendered by the children.\n\nThree hearty cheers were given for the Department of Indian Affairs and for all those who had contributed towards making it possible to hold the First Annual Children's Fair on Jas. Smith's Reserve.\n\nAfter singing the National Anthem the Redmen returned to their homes, with visions of another Fair day in their mind's eye.\n\nThe following is the list of prize winners.\n\nPotatoes.\u2014Elias Head, Eli Okakeek, MacDonald Moosoomakamia, Henry Seymour, MacDonald Moosoomakamia, Eli Okakeek.\n\nCarrots.\u2014MacDonald Moosoomakamia, Elias Head, Elsie Constant.\n\nCorn.\u2014MacDonald Moosoomakamia, Elias Head, Albert MacLean Henry Seymour.\n\nPreserves.\u2014Sarah Okakeek, Elizabeth Okakeek, Elizabeth Constant.\n\nCake.\u2014Sarah Okakeek, Elsie Constant.\n\nBouquet.\u2014Elsie Constant, Elizabeth Okakeek, Sarah Okakeek.\n\nPenmanship\u2014Sarah Okakeek, Elsie Constant, Elizabeth Okakeek.\n\nMittens.\u2014Sarah Okakeek, Elizabeth Okakeek, Carline Brittain.\n\nHood.\u2014Sarah Okakeek, Eli Okakeek.\n\nEliza Head.\n\nMuffler.\u2014Sarah Okakeek, Elizabeth Okakeek Eliza Head.\n\nMittens.\u2014Sarah Okakeek, Elizabeth Okakeek.\n\nSocks.\u2014Sarah Okakeek.\n\nSpecial Prizes.

Hawley, Quebec.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nNov. 22, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo. 130\n\nWith reference to my letter of October No. 112, and yours of 26th, No. 118088/1, I have the honour to inform you that Miss Hawley began living in the dispensary building and boarding herself on the 16th inst. and the new arrangement should begin from the date.\n\nI purchased for her use, and also for the hospital work, a small cook stove at a cost of $15.00, but she complains that it does not give sufficient heat to warm the building, and asks that she be supplied with a heater which would cost about $10.00. There was a large cylinder stove in the building; which she had removed on the ground that it takes up too much room. In this I did not agree with her as I thought that it could be used for the winter.\n\nThe arrangement with Miss Seymour fell through, and no other girl can be got in the neighborhood.\n\nI cannot see that Miss Hawley can for any length of time continue the present arrangement, viz., setting up in a cold house in the morning and cooking her own breakfast; walking three-quarters of a mile to school and, at 4 p.m.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nat 4 p.m. returning again to a cold house and cooking her supper; after which she is liable to be called out again return to a cold house. Indeed, on my last visit it occurred to me that she was getting discouraged. Farmer Tennant and his wife do not want her back again; and, anyway, Farmer Tennant is leaving at the end of December.\n\nI advised Miss Hawley to try, in the meantime, to get the older school girls to stay with her week about. At the New Year we may get a new Farmer with whom she might be able to make her own arrangement for board.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 2, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in purchasing a small cooking stove for Miss Hawley's use. As it would appear from your letter that the present arrangement may not last for any length of time it is not advisable at the present time to purchase a heater and the cylinder stove to which you refer might be again placed in position. When a new Turner is appointed it may, as you say, be possible for Miss Hawley to make arrangements for board and lodging with him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTuck Lake, Sask.\nFort-a-la-Corre\nSaskatchewan\n\nTo the Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge the receipt of the Annual Report on Indian Education for which accept my thanks.\n\nI am especially pleased to know that the Department appreciates my efforts in the\nnorthern portion of James Smith Reserve. To me the work is intensely interesting\u2014and the cooperation of the parents shown in several instances most encouraging.\n\nI have a good helper in the Chief who sets a high value on the advantages to be derived from education. Since my arrival fifteen months ago his daughter has never been allowed to leave the Reserve nor absent herself from school save in case of illness.\n\nThat the work is being followed by the interest and sympathy\nof the Department is a wonderful stimulus to go bravely on endeavoring to overcome the many obstacles which present themselves from time to time under present conditions.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery truly yours,\nAnna A.

HAWLEY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON THE JAMES SMITH'S DAY SCHOOL\n\nThe temporary hospital which was in operation five months did satisfactory work and was a real blessing. It is to be hoped the Department may see its way to continue this very necessary branch of work. Its absence has been keenly felt on several occasions during the past few months. It is almost useless to try to do anything for a really ill patient in a living room with from six to eight people all sleeping upon the floor and no ventilation. I believe a nurse's full time could be spent by careful supervision of the homes and people on the reserve. The presence of a graduate nurse on the northern portion of James Smith's reserve with 200 Indians, has necessitated calling in a doctor but once in case of illness and once for a fractured femur during the past 10\u00bd months.\nThe Reserve\nFort \u00e0 la Corne\nPrairietown\nMay 18th 1911\n\nDuncan Scott Esq.\nSuperintendent Indian Education\nTerrace\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen the Report of the\nSchool Board Office for the\nyear ending March 31st 1911\nreaches you, the statistics\ndealing with James Smith's\nReserve, Fort \u00e0 la Corne\n(North) may be somewhat\ndisappointing when compared with the previous\nyear\u2014beg to send you a\nletter of explanation.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthat you may know that it is the result of conditions over which I, as teacher and nurse, had no control and not due to any in-\ndifference.\n\nPersonally speaking and with full knowledge of all the facts, I consider the year just closed more suc-\ncessful than the preceding one.\n\nThe winter of 1909-10 was an exceptionally mild one for pleasurable and brought unusually high prices. It was not necessary for the Indians to go far from home nor to take prolonged trips.\n\nThe school reaped the benefit. The winter of 1910-11 was one of the most severe in\nThe history of many years\u2014her had scarce land extremely cheap.\n\nSeveral families went north in the fall and remained throughout the winter taking with them eight children of school age\u2014two girls left school to be married two children aged 6 and 8 are physically unfit\u2014one boy by reason of a locomotive disease I asked to remain at home. The boy was sent to Shellfort Hospital\u2014an Indian was away buying his wife met with an accident\u2014which necessitated being in bed six weeks. One pupil had to remain at home during this period. The non-attendance of these 15 pupils lowered...\nThe average, but I fail to see wherein I am responsible.\n\nMany of the children have been most devoted, and faithful, and have endured many hardships in order to attend school.\n\nThe driving system in force here necessitates the children walking home every other night, and the area to be covered in the morning is so large that some children have to leave their homes before 8 o'clock\u2014dark, cold, wintry mornings. This is no trivial matter for children\u2014and often they have given up their breakfast rather than miss the bus.\n\nA family of four girls\nwas sent to live at the Chief's whilst the father was at the hunt.\n\nAt the noon hour these girls had to care for several head of stock, milk, and work two miles every second night\u2014carrying the pail of milk\u2014a little girl of five came to school with tears stained face because her mother would not allow her to miss school and accompany her on a visiting trip.\n\nThe children have not been allowed to attend the Indian dances as formerly as the parents realize it is unfitting them for school work\u2014yesterday I reported to an Indian that his boy of five had played truant. Today I saw this\nboy coming to school\u2014his father,\nwith a switch, bringing\nup the rear\u2014\n\nAll this goes to show that\nthe fever has commenced\nto work among the Indians\non this Reserve\u2014\n\nand interest is being\nshown in the school\u2014though\nthe face value of\nthe statistics without an\nexplanation might lead\none to think differently.\n\nI shall take great pleas-\nure in submitting some of\nthe papers of the session\u2014\nal vaccination which\nwill be held next month\u2014\n\nMedical work\u2014(200 Indians)\nfor the year ending March\n31st/911 I am responsible\nfor calling the doctor for medical work twice surgical (fractured femur) once.\n\nI did send in a fourth call twice to a fractured humerus but did not reach the doctor. He was already on the Reserve having been called by the preacher at the South end.\n\nThe sickness of the calls have not been fatal. The physique of the Indians in any case in which I am not perfectly sure of my treatment, I give the patient the benefit of the doubt\u2014no patient died under my care (with the exception of one sudden death) without having had the advice.\nof a doctor.\n\nThe death rate is very high\u2014\nI must admit\u2014\nThe majority of these patients\ncould not have recovered\nunder any conditions\u2014\nwith proper care, their lives might\nhave been prolonged\u2014\nThe minority under ideal\nconditions had a possibility of recovering\u2014\n\nTwo died after a lingering illness\nof consumption\u2014\nTwo died in the north\u2014\nTwo returned from the north\nin a critical condition and\ndied shortly after reaching\nthe Reserve\u2014\nOne after a prolonged illness\nof heart trouble\u2014\nOne baby of malnutrition\u2014\nOne baby suddenly (convulsions)\nThe parents of one baby (pneumonia) preferred Indian medicine\u2014the child died. One baby\u2014double pneumonia. One\u2014a most loathsome condition from suppurating glands (Hibiscus). Two (in my family) were a mystery to both doctor and nurse. One\u2014spinal meningitis.\n\nTwelve out of the fifteen patients mentioned died during the months of January, February and March.\n\nThere is an enormous amount of work to be done in the medical line on this reserve\u2014the people with few exceptions seem to\nbe saturated with disease. When it is remembered that the house visitations are all supposed to be made after school hours, and on foot\u2014which necessitates many miles of walking\u2014one can easily understand how utterly impossible it is to make too many calls as one could wish\u2014and the visits are necessarily hurried.\n\nI find no pleasure in reporting a low average in school attendance, nor a high death rate\u2014if it were in my power to remedy the condition I certainly should do so\u2014\n\nThis letter is being written as a result of receiving\nA letter from Mr. MacArthur, Indian Agent, Duck Lake\u2014The tone of the said letter unfavorably criticises the results of both school and medical work on this Reserve.\n\nI have done my duty in both\u2014and the course of my convictions prompts me to write\u2014\n\nIf in the opinion of the Department\u2014I have been remiss in my duties\u2014I am willing to find in my resignation as soon as another opening presents itself.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nAnna Aswath Harvey\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nApril 26th, 1911\n\nDear Miss Hawley,\n\nI have received your letter of the 22nd instant. Regarding your request for the use of a horse to make your visits to the sick on the reserve, I have to say that as the supplying you with a horse would also mean the purchase of a rig, and someone to look after the animal, it would be necessary for me to first receive authority from the Department. You are, no doubt, aware that the Department follows very closely the work of all its outside officials, and that your request would be considered on its merits. And I fancy that the answer would be, that while your work shows very well on paper, the actual results are not conclusive. It would be found that during the year closing 31st March last, the doctor had been called in oftener than during the previous year; that the death rate has been over 65 per thousand, as against 41 the previous year; that the average school attendance for the six months ending March 31st was 12, as against 18 for the same six months the year before. I observe that in your quarterly return for March quarter you attribute the decrease in the attendance to the children being off the reserve with their parents. On this point, I am rather surprised that you should have been misinformed, as the only child of school age who was away, was Pat Brittain's boy. Honestly, I am deeply disappointed with the school attendance. At Inspection I was also very much put out. To be\n\nMiss Anna A. Hawley,\n\nJames Smith's Reserve,\n\nFort La Corne, Sask.\nsure the older girls showed up very well along some lines; the younger children did not seem to know anything, except the names of the twelve Apostles. Well Bible knowledge is all very well in its place but the Department is running this school not in the interests of any church, but with the one and sole aim of giving the Indian children an education. If Bible studies have to be taken up I am sure the Reverend Mr. Tomlin would devote one hour each week as is done in the other day schools of the province to that work. What is required of you is to teach your children to read, write and count.\n\nReturning again to the horse question I may remind you that some months ago, you and I had a talk on your work. I then told you that your first and most important work was teaching; that any spare time from that could be given to nursing. You are paid on a basis of $500 a year for teaching and $200 for nursing, which shows that the Department, at present considers the one of more importance than the other. Now, until the Department can see its way to change things, you should strictly follow the rule laid down, and get and keep the school in first class shape.\n\nI know that your own humane instincts will not allow you to forget the suffering, but in the position you are now placed, the school, during its hours, requires your undivided attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Macarthur,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state that I received from Miss Hawley an open letter addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education, and marked \"Personal\", which I am forwarding today. This letter Miss Hawley wrote as a defense or reply to one which I wrote her on April 26th last. As it will enable you to better understand the matter I enclose a copy of my letter to her. I may further add that while I never failed to report to the Department any advance or improvement made by Miss Hawley in the work on her Reserve, it will be remembered that I doubted her staying qualities as teacher. One thing that is to be admired in her is the steadfast determination to leave no stone unturned that would help her to be relieved from teaching and instead get a hospital opened and she appointed Matron.\n\nMiss Hawley is a smart woman but I am afraid she is a fraud. Her reports on visiting the sick etc. I cannot myself, say whether they are true or untrue, but I have every reason to believe that to a large extent she draws on her imagination. My letter to her was written in her own interests as well as that of the Department. I have done everything in my power to assist Miss Hawley and make her school a success. It must not be understood that the Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nschool to-day has drifted back to the old Indian day school, far from it, my complaint being that she has allowed it to fall back from her first year. Now that Miss Hawley has thrown down the gauntlet I think it only fair that I enclose extracts from a letter written to me on May 7th by Farmer McCloy.\n\n\"Miss Hawley called in Dr. Hawke to see the Mclean baby, she wanted me to get another Doctor and she said that she was sure that Dr. Hawke would not operate on the child but would make the trip out and drive back without doing anything or that if he did operate that he would do it in such a way that it was immaterial to him whether the child died or not. I told her to send for him and that if he didn't do the work he certainly would hear about it. Amongst other things she mentioned that on one occasion when he was here she asked him to go and see a sick person and that he refused to go saying that even to save the patient's life he wouldn't go and that if she wanted him to send for him in a few days. One can hardly blame the Indians for asking for his dismissal. They believe have sent in another petition asking for his discharge. This time it was sent to the Honorable Walter Scott.\n\nWell Dr. Hawke arrived the day after Miss Hawley sent for him reaching here just before she started for school, he sat in his rig and talked to her until almost eleven o'clock. Then I went over to see what was the trouble but he didn't say.\n\nThings here medically are in a nice fix the darnest swindle all through, it makes one sick. I know that regarding Miss Hawley I spoke rather strongly to the Inspector but I thought that it was the only way to make him see that there was two sides to the question. She has plenty of ability and nerve and can pull the wool so completely over\n\nSecretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\n\"the eyes of people who only see her once in a while\n\"that it almost makes one take desperate steps to\n\"try and have some inside light thrown on the scene.\"\n\nThe pathetic condition of health, as drawn by\nMiss Hawley, appeals to one's imagination. The truth\nis that there has always been a high rate of mortality\namongst this Reserve but there is nothing in the\ncondition, nor does Miss Hawley show that there is\nwarranting the outlay that would be required to\nestablish a hospital. If Miss Hawley would do\nher work with the same interest and good judgment\nthat Mrs. Godfrey always showed the situation\nwould be adequately met.\n\nI have the Honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 7th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st. of May with reference to the services of Miss Hawley on James Smith's Reserve. The open letter addressed by her to the Superintendent of Indian Education, to which you refer, was not enclosed but a copy had been received by that officer and had been attached to the file.\n\nIt is the wish of the Department that Miss Hawley should pay her first attention to the school and the educational work on the Reserve, and that she should not undertake too great a responsibility or too onerous a task in ministering to the needs of all sick Indians on the Reserve, as the Department has engaged a medical attendant to take part of that responsibility. It is believed that Miss Hawley can continue to do good work on the Reserve and that any change, when it is so difficult to get persons qualified to undertake such services at remote points, would not be in the interests of the work. I have, therefore, to request that you will continue to advise and support Miss Hawley and endeavor to increase her usefulness and allay the state of irritation that seems to be present on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 18th, addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education. Due consideration has been given to the contents of this letter and I have to inform you that the Department does not wish to have you resign your post. At the same time I must say that it is desired that you will pay full attention to the educational needs of the Indians and endeavor to develop the school work. Do not take too great a responsibility on your shoulders with reference to the medical attendance on the Reserve, but do all that you can, consistent with your first duty to the school, to relieve suffering.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Anna A. Hawley,\nTeacher,\nFort a la Corne, Sask.\nOttawa, June 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Inspector Chisholm's report upon the Fort a la Corne North day school.\n\nMr. Chisholm states that the results of the efforts to improve the attendance by conveying the children to and from school were not by any means satisfactory. This would appear to be largely due to the fact that you had not properly supervised the work of the Indian who was employed to convey the children to and from the school. Mr. Chisholm further states that there has been indifference both on the part of the teacher and yourself regarding the school work on this portion of the reserve and that too much responsibility with a lack of oversight and direction has been placed upon the teacher.\n\nThere is evidently room for improvement in the work at this school and I have to ask you to make every effort to see that the best results possible under the circumstances are obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. MacArthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nWe have just re-produced a letter from a resident of the James Smith Indian Reserve. It was refused publication by the Kinistino Rep., but as the parties in question hold public offices, we take Mr. Godfrey's word for it that it is in the public interest. It is illegal to assume the title of \"Doctor\" in this province without holding a licence, even where the party using the title has that right elsewhere.\n\nTo the Editor of the Rep:\n\"The man who works the hardest may not draw the biggest pay.\nThe one with deepest knowledge may not have the most to say.\nBut the man who is most modest gets the last seat in the rear.\nAnd the one who blows his bugle is the one whom people hear.\"\n\nSir:\n\nThe above quotation, which appeared in your issue of Nov. 23, gives me an opening to write upon a subject, which has been in my mind for some time, viz.\u2014the fallaciousness of title of \"The Medicine Woman\" assumed by your continual correspondent from Fort a la Corne.\n\nThe Bluebook of 1911, which has just been issued gives TWO names who are classed as Teacher and Matron in James Smiths' Reserve, and while no report is made of the success, or otherwise of the nursing part of the duties of \"the Medicine Woman\" at the north school, special mention is made of the successful nursing work done by the Teacher and Matron at the south school.\n\n\"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"\n\nIt is always considered good breeding to leave others the awarding of praise for work done. In this case however, your correspondent claims a title to which she has not the prior right, and which she should have left to others to confer.\n\nSome four years ago the teacher at the south school was appointed as Dispenser of Medicine. Before that time, and long before the arrival of \"The Medicine Woman\" this teacher answered the call to sicknesses to all parts of the Reserve, both Fort a la Corne and Big Head's Indians, without remuneration or any tooting of the horn. She left this for officials to do, and the result was the appointing of a female teacher at the north school who also had qualifications as a nurse.\n\nThis was a tribute to the work done by the teacher at the south school.\n\nI have never heard any Indian call either of the matrons \"The Medicine Woman\" either in Cree or English.\n\nAnyone not in the know would naturally think it was a title conferred by the Indians, but no sir, it has only been assumed by \"The Medicine Woman\" who is continually \"blowing her own bugle.\"\n\nI am,\n\n\"The man who gets the last seat in the rear\"\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nDec. 8.

Godfrey, Fort a la Corne\nThe Reserve\nFort \u00e0 la Corne\nSaskatchewan\n\nJanuary 1st 1912\n\nTo the Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nWinnipeg\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received a marked copy of the Melrose journal under date December 22nd 1911.\n\nI am taking the liberty of enclosing a clipping from said journal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Hawley\nOttawa, January 11, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a copy of a communication addressed by you to the Melvort Journal, dated December 8th, last, in reference to the work of the teachers and field matrons on the James Smith Reserve.\n\nIt is considered by the Department that the tone of this letter evidences a most objectionable spirit, and it has had the effect of shaking the confidence of the Department in your judgment.\n\nHad you been an employee of the Department at the time the letter was written most serious notice must of necessity have been taken of it, as the public expression of the personal feelings of employees in respect to Departmental work could not be tolerated. In view of the fact that at a not distant date you contemplated taking up work as a teacher on one of the reserves you should have refrained from any criticism or one engaged in a position similar to the one you are to occupy. The effect has been, not to detract from the recognized meritorious work of the teacher of the Upper Fort a la Corne School; but on the contrary, as mentioned above, to cause the Department to have serious misgivings as to your fitness for a position in the public service.\n\nIt is with feelings of regret that the Department feels called upon to write a letter in this strain, but in justice to Miss Hawley, to whom your remarks are directed, demands it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Godfrey, Esq.,\nPort a la Corne, Sask.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 11, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant enclosing a copy of a communication addressed to the Melfort Journal by Mr. William Godfrey of Fort a la Corne.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a communication sent today to Mr. Godfrey and it is considered that so far as you are concerned it is not necessary to make any further remarks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Anna A.

It is suggested that the school should be closed for the usual summer vacation during the months of May and June and it will not then be necessary to obtain a substitute.

In order to avoid the possibility of an error, the letter from the Department was forwarded to the Indian Agent. From him I received instructions that $20.00 in cash prizes would be forthcoming from the Department. This sum was augmented by private contributions and I ordered the prize list printed. I have recently learned that\nthe application went no further than the Affairs office until acted upon by Inspector.\n\nThis holds\u2014\n\nI very much regret if the plans of the Department have been interfered with in regard to this matter\u2014but I, on my part, accurately followed the instructions of the Department\u2014 I beg to acknowledge the cheque of $20. Both teachers and pupils return hearty thanks. Ideal weather greeted us on Saturday, and the exhibition was a great success from every point\u2014More than 200\nIndians were present and all seemed to enter most heartily into the spirit of the day. Each successive year the entries are more numerous and exhibits of a higher order. It is pleasing to note the pride which the children take in manufacturing articles of a practical nature for themselves and also for little boys who have no sisters\u2014and whose mothers do not understand\u2014surely the most essential part of the education of a human being is to learn to do things for himself\u2014very truly Yours Anna A.

This school has a large attendance and the work is pretty heavy and it may be that Miss Hawley cannot give as much attention to the field matron work as some of the Indians would like.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI attach herewith a communication which reached me this morning from Farmer McCloy of the James Smith's Reserve, respecting the schools on that reserve.\n\nIn submitting same, I would comment on the fact, that at the North end the Department have a suitable house for a married man, while the accommodation at the south end is not so satisfactory.\n\nAt the same time, as the Farmer says the people at the South end are a long way from the farm house, & it appears that in the past they have generally looked upon the teacher at that point as some one to go to should any difficulties or troubles occur, and having a man there in charge of the school there is a great help to the Agent & farmer. The best farming land is at the south end of this reserve.\n\nWith regards the remarks respecting the crusher, I would call the attention to the fact that at this reserve there are five Bulls for which the Department in the past have provided chopped feed, hauling same from Kinistino. With a crusher in the hands of the Farmer, this haulage & chop could be saved, being of benefit to the band & the Department also. Under these circumstances, now that they have the steam power, this, I think is a matter for consideration, & I would be glad if you could look into same, & see what can be done.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that I think that the school should be opened as soon as possible and so far from this end that they really belong to another reserve. They are right ten miles from the farm house in case of sickness they are in a difficult position having no one to take care of them.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that you use your influence to have this school opened. That Mr. Hawley be transferred from the North school to the South. This school requires a married man. This will be looked after by Mr. Hawley always complaining about the house and school being cold but I know that these houses are both warm and intelligently fitted. The Indians here also wish to have a male teacher as they say that the children are not controlled at all at school now. There are other reasons that you are aware of that would make a change advantageous in the interest of the work.\n\nMr. Hawley himself I think would relish a change.\n\nThe chief asked me to write you in purchasing a grain cracker for this reserve. He would like if you could in some way manage to get one.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM -\n\nMr. Pedley:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to letter of February 16th with enclosure from Farmer McCloy, of James Smith's Reserve.\n\nThe farmer recommends the opening of the school at the South end and that Miss Hawley be transferred to that point and appoint a male teacher for the North school. As we have received no notification from Miss Hawley that she desires the change, I would not recommend it.\n\nI think, however, that we should open the South end school and transfer Mr. Gentleman, at present a clerk at the Duck Lake Agency, to this point. He would be willing, I have no doubt, to work here with his wife on the same terms as when they were previously employed.\n\nChief Accountant.\nSir,\n\nI have to enclose a communication received from Miss Hawley of the James Smith's reserve, with reference to a meeting in Prince Albert, also to state that this leave for a few days has been granted, subject to the Department's approval.

He should be a qualified bookkeeper and typewriter; otherwise he will be unable to perform the work satisfactorily, as the cash transactions are numerous and there are many accounts in the Ledger.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nOttawa, 18th March, 1913.\nWill you please have the necessary action taken to have Mr. Gentleman, now employed as Clerk at the Duck Lake Indian agency, transferred as teacher for the South school, James Smith's reserve.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, May 12, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nArrangements have been made for the reappointment as clerk at the Duck Lake Agency of the former clerk, Mr. Campbell, and for the transfer of Mr. Gentleman to one of the schools in the agency.\n\nIt was first proposed to send Mr. Gentleman to the South Port a la Corne School, but since this was noted the Department understands that Rev. Mr. McDougall is leaving John Smith's. This would be a much better location for Mr. Gentleman, as there is a commodious dwelling house, whereas at the South Port a la Corne School he would for a time at least have to live in very uncomfortable quarters. Mr. Gentleman will not, however, leave the agency for some days after Mr. Campbell arrives and is given such information as will enable him to become familiar with current work and take it over intelligently.\n\nYou will be good enough to arrange for the carriage of Mr. Gentleman's goods to the railway station and also from the terminus of his railroad journey to the reserve in each case by the agency teams to avoid incurring any unnecessary expenditure.\n\nIf Mr. Gentleman goes to John Smith's reserve he will be paid the same salary as Mr. McDougall, viz.-$600.00 per annum and his wife will be allowed $300.00 per\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nper annum, provided she continues the field matron work as at present being performed by Mrs. McDougall.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Gentleman. The Department trusts that a satisfactory transfer can be arranged at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst.

It is always an inspiration and encouragement to know that the work on the outskirts as it were, is being closely followed by those at the \"hub\" - of Affairs.\n\nI hope to write you later at some length, this is only a note to tell you that under present conditions, I am very unhappy in this Agency.\n\nI could write at some length upon this subject, but perhaps it would be unbecoming for me in a subordinate position to criticise an official. At the same time I do feel that the Department demands justice shown to its employees.\n\nI have now given nearly four years of continuous service to the Department. I have given the best that in me lies, to the work, and have remained in it, though during this time, five calls have come in to go elsewhere. This is sufficient to justify my statement that I'm really interested in Indian Work. The story of my four years here, is one of advancement.\n\nTo give you an idea of the attitude of Mr. Agent Schmidt I am enclosing a letter with a copy of my reply.\n\nI wish to make the following comments.\n\nI. Mr. McCloy, did not send any letter to the Agent that I had been purchasing supplies for the Constants.\n\nII. No account has been \"cut out\" At the Hudson's Bay Co's Store, and the officer at the Post does not know what the Agent means.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\nI would have forwarded this letter sooner but I wished to give the Agent the opportunity of either an explanation or an apology.\n\nThe matter was brought before him on the occasion of his last visit - he was unable to give an explanation and seemingly flew angry.\n\nThe only purchase that I have made during the past year at the Hudson's Bay Co's Store was some mustard and some thin cloth with which to use; this was made for a critically ill boy, McDonald Moostosokamasis, and I consider it came under the head of my duties.\n\nOur supplies had not come and it was a case of emergency. I am no irresponsible child, and I feel that the Department expects its employees to have intelligence enough to act wisely in emergencies. However, Mr. Schmidt's letter could not possibly refer to this purchase.\n\nHis letter to me wounded me more deeply from the fact, that Mr. McCloy has treated me in a most discourteous manner, ever since my arrival here. This, I might say was owing to an oversight of the then Agent - but this is a long story -\n\nHas the Department any position to offer me, in some other than the Duck Lake Agency?-\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully Yours,\n\nAnna Aeenath Frewley.\n\nHarley\nFort a la Corne\nSaskatchewan,\nMarch 21st, 1923.\n\nC.

As I know neither of them personally, I preferred that they should apply to you, & submit their certificates or references & their qualifications to you. If you see fit to accept them on your part, I can say that I am satisfied on my part\u2014you can consider this as a nomination.\n\nI hope this method will satisfy you. It is calculated to save time & prevent the schools being unduly closed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(missionary to the Indians) speaks very highly of their zeal, energy & skill in training the children both in books & in outdoor work, etc., as well as of their character.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Leonard Lowe, 208 Bloor St., New Beach, Toronto.\n\nThey are acquainted (and indeed connected by marriage) with Rev. W. Toulmin, Min. at La Come, who speaks for their application.\n\nThey are quite new to Canada, only lately from England, so know nothing of ways & requirements\u2014they would, perhaps, be strong enough for Mrs. Smith's, but might do for Smith & Come (Big Heads) if you are prepared to re-open that school, as I hope. That is near enough for Mr. Toulmin to advise them how to get into the ways of the Country, the methods of the I.D. I don't know them, but Mr. Toulmin speaks for them.\n\nNativity married\u2014No children\u2014Mr. Lowe is 26 years old, has had good in the school & Grammar School education, says he can procure certificates from England, if necessary.\n\nShould be glad to hear from you in a little time if these persons apply, & if you appoint them, so that I shall have to search elsewhere. I have no one in sight at present.\n\nNow, I want doing another application before you, privately for Little Pines, if you can have school & residence ready in the near future; viz.\u2014\nThe Sec. Dept. of Ind. Affairs\n\n3. Rev. D. H. Bishop, spouse for Little Pries.\n\nI have heard indirectly that he has applied to you; but that may not be correct. He is evidently fitted as a teacher, as he has been a schoolmaster (successfully so) all his life till he came to Canada. She is a most capable mother, housekeeper, etc., & would have an excellent influence, besides having had experience in nursing & domestic medicine, having brought up a large family. The drawback\u2014on their side, not ours\u2014is a family of children, but they are willing to accommodate themselves to conditions, if only the house is sufficient to barely contain them, & the salary is sufficient to maintain them. I can recommend them heartily, both as to capabilities, energy, & character. Of course they know absolutely no Cree language. Little Pries has a number of children, & needs some encouragement & extra effort. For this appointment there is necessary (1) the completion of the new residence with accommodation (even though barely so) for parents & 3 or 4 children, (2) a proper School & Equipment & (3) a \"living wage\" salary. To such a couple as the Bishop's I think you should offer the same as to Mr. Smith's (Mr. & Mrs. Gentleman) or at least $800 or $900 between husband & wife.

They desire to return to the work.\n\nI should think they would do well and be able to take up the full work of Teacher, matron and medical adviser for women and children etc.. Their clergyman in U.S.A. (missionary to the Indians) speaks very highly of their zeal, energy and skill in training the children both in books and outdoor work, etc., as well as of their character.\nSir\u2014\n\nI have the honour to inquire whether a teacher has been appointed to succeed Miss Hawley, who is leaving at the end of this month.\n\nWhen visiting the school on James Smith's Reserve on 15th instant, I asked Miss Hawley if she knew if an appointment had been made. She replied that she did not know.\n\nIt would be a great set back to the pupils of this school who have been in regular attendance, to have the school closed now; therefore I would ask that the appointment of a teacher be made in time to assume charge on November 1st.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the James Smith Day School for the month of October, 1913. Original on File 118088-7.\n\nThe interest in this school taken by the parents is poor. The teacher complains that the parents bring their children away with them on their hunting or root digging trips. It seems that the Indians have some grievances against Miss Hawley through the field matron work, which it is impossible for her to do properly. That is visit their homes, which are scattered between school hours. Therefore the reason why they do not send their children regularly. Miss Hawley is leaving at the end of this month and I would suggest that the person who takes her place as teacher, be not field matron also, as to do either properly the other must suffer. The education of the children must be looked after with preference to the field matron work, the latter work will not give good results unless the field matron devotes her whole time to it, and then it will be an uphill work, as the Indians have very little faith in it if any.\n\n(Sgd.)

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOn the Indian Reserve at Fort la Corne there has labored for four long years one Anna Asenath Hawley, a Canadian woman of great personal culture. The Medicine Woman, as she is called, has been engaged in the work of promoting the physical, mental and moral betterment of the brown folk at the Reserve, for Miss Hawley has not confined her activities to nursing; though as a trained nurse, she is specially versed in the care of the sick. Through all these years, she has often times experienced discouragement, black loneliness, and recurrent disappointment, but always she has had to face the unutterable silence which must be endured by those whose work amongst the silent Indians takes them \"far\u2014too far\u2014from the maddening crowd.\"\n\nAnd after four years of it, when one wrote asking for a column or so from the gifted pen of this woman of pars, back came exultant reply, \"Yes, indeed, my dear friend, there is a story to tell, a story that will make you laugh till you come to the end. There may be tears in your eyes will fill with tears, for you will realize that the writer's ability to laugh has been hampered, and that you go on you will laugh, for she has been greatly favored.\n\nWHERE TO FIND LOST MOUNTAIN.\n\nRead then, Miss Hawley's \"Tips from an Indian Reserve,\" which she has written specially for The Canadian Magazine.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the teacher with a broad smile, \"the little Indians do get things mixed up, I'm afraid. For instance, the Department of Indian Affairs had sent us a beautiful map of the Western Provinces, and we were endeavoring to make good use of it.\n\n\"The map was forwarded to our community, and before long a lot of the little boys kids and maidens, the Southern part of Saskatchewan is drained by the Souris and Qu'Appelle Rivers, which are branches of the Missouri River. Now, children,\" said the teacher, \"we must learn one new lake in Saskatchewan, let it be 'Last Mountain,' as she pointed it out on the map.\n\n\"Then came to their aid the dainty, childish eyes, to write the name of the new lake as nearly as possible in their note books.\n\n\"Miss Hawley,\" said a favorite pretty card, \"Do you all know what Last Mountain is the same as?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied the teacher, \"Last Mountain is the same as.\"\n\n\"Last Mountain is an Assiniboine!\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the Medicine Woman, \"I shall have to call the Department doctor to make sure.\"\n\nRobert, the medicine man, knew the Chief's holy, yellow as gold with jaundice, Agnes, an ex-pupil, feeling that life is not worth the living with that quinine, nose throat; Maggie, languishing with dysentery, and Jack, a case of double pneumonia; that hemianopia is surely losing the sight of her eye under the care of Medicine Woman's treatment; and now poor Maggie, nearsighted, down flat upon his back with another attack of muscular rheumatism.\n\n\"And as the maxim\u2014'Kill two birds with one stone' sounds wise and economical. Thus the doctor to save his work before the \"Booth mission please,\" his sees the daily cry among the little Indians. This will be an excellent opportunity to get rid of these troublesome pests.\n\nA writer once said: Disappointment in politics is painful, disappointment in life is worse, our hearts often ache when we think that it could be avoided. He must have had a conscience!\n\nIt was plain sailing to transfer the little Indians from the school room to the children's dining hall. WAS THAT A STORM THAT SHAKES THE STORY.\n\nLittle Maggie was the first victim, meekly and quietly she walked into the dispensary, though her big brown eyes were full of illimitable tears.\n\nA sudden rush of tenderness filled the heart of the nurse. \"Oh Doctor Blank,\" she pleaded, \"let me stay here, I am very weak, very weak, very weak.\"\n\nBack came the unhesitating reply: \"You bet it hurts!\"\n\nInto the dining hall went the penetrating fumes. It was Maggie who gave the alarm. Had he not once been a patient in Medicine Woman's hands? Undergoing certain tests, he was ordered to report himself at the Reserve. \"The doctor, he put me to sleep, then he cut my sickness, that's a secret perfume, who I don't know, but I happened to smell it, and thought, as he drew in a deep breath to make sure.\n\nNow for the second child. The waiting room was empty. Flying moonlight moonlight was just disappearing round the corner of the house.\n\n\"Sydney, come here,\" says the nurse in sternest tones.\n\nA bitter cry pierced the air. Not a cry of anger or of sadness, but a pleading cry for mercy.\n\nWhere is the man or woman, doctor or nurse, who could take advantage of the helplessness of a lad of eight years old representing one of the family, a little lad who was content to remain behind at school whilst his family went north to the hunt?\n\n\"Sydney, you go free now,\" says Moon-up-as-kwao would run away (in order to escape those shining forges).\n\nThose eighteen index fingers went into many mouths, and eighteen little Indians explained \"No sick me.\" And happiness came back to us all again.\n\n\"I'm glad he's out,\" said Maggie, as she raised her head from the floor. \"But time will tell. Maybe they may be all right in theory, but do they always work out satisfactorily?\n\nAn employee of a survey party met with a painful accident in the vicinity of the Reserve and came to the dispensary for treatment.\n\n\"I don't know how you can stand this here Injun blood,\" said he. \"You may be O.K. in theory, but when a fellow comes down to the real thing, ain't the common all smashed to smithereens?\"\n\nThis is a question which is often asked me, though perhaps in different language.\n\nWell, it all depends upon the individual's temperament. If one is inclined to be pessimistic, there is no good, nothing is all bad; everything is so-so.\n\nIf one is inclined to be optimistic, there is surely room enough and plenty of room even on an Indian Reserve, to see the dark clouds and the long, hard, rough trail. One can easily open the door of his heart to the guests disappointment, failure, and sorrow. They are ever lurking at the gate. Yet, on the other hand, if one is inclined to be optimistic, there is surely every opportunity on an Indian Reserve to see the blue sky and sunshine smiling. For people generally find what they look for.\n\nThis earth is crammed with Heaven.\n\nAnd every common bush afire with God.\n\nAnd this is the wonder that will be shown to us.\n\nAgain, we should never forgetful of the sublime privilege of being called on active duty in the service of the King of kings. How high and great this privilege! And He is ever with us, all-present, caring for our needs, watching over our welfare, our sorrows are sad and lonely, yet, pitying us in His great compassion when our hearts are troubled. He notes our every want, watches our footsteps, and follows with His approving eye, and ever waits to follow Him.\n\nOh, are there not moments when we feel like Peter when the boat was filled with fishes? Are we not often filled with a deep sense of our own unworthiness, and of God's great power and love?\n\nGo labour on\u2014spend and be spent.\n\nTie joy to the Father's will;\n\nIt is well that this work is done,\n\nShould not the servant tread it still?\n\nGo labour on\u2014Tie not for nought.\n\nThe earthly loss is heavenly gain;\n\nMen heed thee, love thee, praise thee;\n\nThe Master prays, \"Thy will be done.\"\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that Mr. and Mrs. H.V.

Original on 118058/7\n\nWith regard to the feasibility of moving the present building at the north school to a more suitable location. It will be noted from photographs submitted with my report of August 28th that these buildings are of a permanent nature. It would not be feasible to move these buildings without taking them apart, as, owing to the nature of the roads and the fact that much chopping would require to be done to take them through the poplars and bush, the expense would not be justifiable. These buildings are lathed and plastered inside and by stripping them much material on the inner walls would be wasted and the shingles could not be used again. These buildings might bring more by being sold to some outside settler and moved off the reserve by him.\n\nX X X\n\nWith reference to the north school upon this reserve. I find that since the re-opening there are only eight pupils enrolled, which would appear to represent about 75% of the children residing in the vicinity of the school. The reason given for the small number enrolled is that some of the children have gone with their parents hunting, as also have some of those who are enrolled.\n\nThe attendance at this school since the 1st October is as follows:-\n| Aggregate Attendance | Average Attendance |\n|----------------------|--------------------|\n| 1st week in October - 5 days | 21 | 4.20 |\n| 2nd \" \" \" - 5 days | 12 | 2.40 |\n| October 15th to 18th - 4 \" | 15 | 3.75 |\n| \" 19th \" \" | 1 | 1.00 |\n\nI would respectfully recommend that Agent Schmidt be advised to have this school closed.\nFort ala Corne Sask. Oct 22 1917\n\nMy Duncan Deptt\nDept Indian Affairs.\nOttawa\nCan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould it be possible for myself and wife to obtain a transfer to another position in the Indian School work, and if so what steps would be necessary to secure same?\n\nMy wife has been Field Matron and teacher at Fort ala Corne Day School since November 11-1913. Our relations with Indian agent and the Department have been very satisfactory on our part.\n\nOur reasons for wishing a transfer are:- Owing to migration of many families from this part of Reserve to south end of same to open up new farms and the fact that those remaining are mainly hunting Indians who take their children away with them, the attendance has decreased until we feel that our usefulness here is about over. It is possible that a new teacher and matron could build up the work here for a time where we are unable to influence them longer.\n\nMrs Shaw is finding her work here to be too heavy especially during the winter months. Her health will not permit her to continue.\nmaking the cold winter drives that she is compelled to do in the work here. Between five and six hundred visits a year in camp besides her duties in school is too heavy work for her. We feel that a position in a milder climate would be better for her.\n\nIf it is possible to give us work in some other locality it would be much appreciated. Would prefer some place on coast in British Columbia but would accept any position you have where we have work together.\n\nWe should be sorry inclined to quit the Indian School service and trust that some place will be open for us. I have informed our Agent Curt Schmidt of our wishing a transfer and trust that he will furnish any data that you may not have regarding us and our work.\n\nI am yours sincerely,\n\nHenry W Shaw,\nFort alw Corne\nSask.\nOttawa, October 3rd, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer Your Lordship to official letter of the 26th instant approving of the appointment of Miss Martha Coburn as teacher of the Sturgeon Lake School.\n\nSince this letter was written it has been decided to close the North School on the James Smith Reserve, which is under the charge of Mr. Henry W. Shaw, owing to the small attendance on account of the migration of many of the families to the south end of the reserve, and it is thought that Mr. Shaw and his wife, who has been acting as field matron, might be transferred to Sturgeon Lake.\n\nA few days ago Archdeacon MacKay wrote to the Department suggesting that, as it has been decided to close the Pas Hospital, a nurse be sent to the MacKay Boarding School. This suggestion was approved of and, if Mr. and Mrs. Shaw are transferred to Sturgeon Lake, Miss Swift, who is acting as field matron there at present, might be sent to the MacKay Boarding School as nurse.\n\nKindly advise the Department as soon as possible as to whether these arrangements meet with Your Lordship's approval.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to that portion of Mr. Inspector Crombie's report on the day schools on the James Smiths Reserve which deals with the North School I beg to say that, in view of the fact that the Indians are moving from the neighbourhood of the school to the southern portion of the reserve and the consequent falling off of the attendance, I think that Mr. Crombie's suggestion that the school be closed should be acted on.\n\nA letter has just come in from Mr. Shaw, the teacher of this school, asking for a transfer for himself and his wife, who is acting as field matron on the reserve, to some other locality, as he considers their usefulness is gone as far as the work at this end of the reserve is concerned, owing to the migration of the Indians mentioned in Mr. Crombie's report.\n\nMr. Crombie suggested that Mr. Shaw and his wife be transferred to Sturgeon Lake, if the James Smiths North School is closed. It is a pity that this suggestion was not made sooner, as Miss Martha Coburn was appointed to the Sturgeon\nSturgeon Lake School on the 26th ultimo on the recommendation of Bishop Newnham. She is young and inexperienced and Mr. Shaw would be much better for the position.\n\nMiss Swift, the present field matron on the Sturgeon Lake Reserve, might be appointed to the position of nurse at The Pas Boarding School. Archdeacon MacKay has been authorized to obtain a nurse for the school and, if arrangements could be made to send the Shaws to Sturgeon Lake, Miss Swift could be transferred to The Pas.\n\nActing on Mr. Inspector Crombie's report, Bishop Newnham was written to on the 30th ultimo and informed of the Department's decision to close the North School on the James Smiths Reserve and it was suggested that Mr. and Mrs. Shaw might be transferred to Sturgeon Lake. His Lordship was also informed that, if this transfer were carried out, Miss Swift could be sent to the MacKay Boarding School and he was asked to advise the Department as soon as possible whether this arrangement would meet with his approval.\n\nI have delayed answering Mr. Shaw's letter until a reply is received from Bishop Newnham.\n\nIn the event of the closing of the North school I do not see that anything could be done with the buildings at present. According to Mr. Crombie it would be next to impossible\nimpossible to move them to another locality on the reserve and, as we have no funds available for rebuilding on the South end of the Reserve, it would be better to defer going to any expense on the buildings there until the Indians are permanently settled, as it may be possible to secure a site which would be more convenient for all the Indians on the reserve.\n\nShould the Shaws leave, the question of the appointment of a matron to succeed Mrs. Shaw at the North end could stand over for the present.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to File No. 16505/7 re day schools on James Smith's Reserve, Fort la Corne, Sask.\n\nI have today written a letter in reply to Department letter of 18th September in reference to schools on this reserve. After perusal of the file I have no doubt that you will agree with me that the north school should be closed at once.\n\nI understand Bishop Newnham is finding it difficult to secure Teachers for Day Schools where vacancies occur. Sturgeon Lake Day School is a case in point. The trouble at Sturgeon Lake is that on this Reserve Miss Swift, a maiden lady, acts as Matron and the Bishop apparently wants to get a married man as Teacher whose wife would act as Matron. Mr. Shaw, James Smith's Reserve, is well spoken of by Mr. Agent Schmidt as a teacher although I have not had an opportunity of judging in the matter, as my visits to the reserve were made at a time when the schools were not in session. Would it not be well in this case to have Mr. and Mrs. Shaw transferred to Sturgeon Lake Reserve as Teacher and Matron and Miss Swift transferred from Sturgeon Lake to James Smith's Reserve as Matron. Miss Swift, who is handicapped in her work through deafness, has had considerable experience in nursing and understands the use of drugs and for this reason her services are of value.\nIt has been suggested by Mr. Grain, in his letter to the Department dated Octr 15th., that Miss Swift be transferred to Carlton headquarters to act as Matron there.\n\nInasmuch as it is evident it will not be possible to get a Doctor for Carlton Agency at the present time, this is worthy of consideration.\n\nI do not know what correspondence has taken place with the Presbyterian Mission Board re getting a Teacher for Mistawasis Day School (who would also act as Missionary), but it is necessary that the school be reopened as soon as possible.\n\nNow that Mr Gentleman, Teacher and Overseer at John Smiths Reserve, does not appear to be getting along well with the Indians of that Reserve, you might consider it advisable to move him to Sturgeon Lake and have Mr Shaw Teacher at James Smiths, moved to John Smiths Reserve. Gentleman of course would not be anxious to move from John Smiths reserve as his earnings would be less by $200 the salary he is paid as Overseer.\n\nNo doubt Bishop Newnham is having correspondence with you re Teachers and Matrons and it is possible he may have some better suggestions to make.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, November 6, 1917.\n\n505785\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Inspector Crombie's private letter to you of the 23rd ultimo I beg to say that I have dealt with the closing of the north school on the James Smiths Reserve and the transfer of Mr. and Mrs. Shaw on No. 1 of the James Smiths School file, also with the transfer of Miss Swift from Sturgeon Lake to the MacKay Boarding School.\n\nShould Archdeacon MacKay have secured a nurse for the MacKay Boarding School, Miss Swift could be transferred to the northern portion of the James Smiths Reserve, if it is considered necessary to have two matrons on the reserve.\n\nMr. Crombie states that Dr. Grain, in a letter to the Department of the 15th of October, last, suggested the transfer of Miss Swift to the Carlton headquarters to act as matron there. This would leave three propositions for the disposal of Miss Swift.\n\nThe Department has had correspondence with Dr. Edmison in regard to obtaining a teacher for the Mistawasis School.\nSchool to replace the Rev. Mr. Smith and, although he was asked as far back as the 20th of July to nominate a teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays, he has not done so yet. In September he wrote to the Department saying that, from all he could learn, he thinks there would be as much justification for his asking for the removal of the Indian Agent as for the Department asking for the removal of Mr. and Mrs. Smith.\n\nOn the 17th of October he again wrote the Department stating that he had referred the matter of the appointment of a teacher for this school to the Prince Albert Presbytery, which would meet on the 18th of that month, after which they would have a finding. He asked to have a definite understanding in regard to the salary that would be paid at Mistawasis. In reply to this letter he was informed on the 19th ultimo that the Department would be prepared to allow a salary of $600.00 to $750.00 per annum, according to qualifications and experience, for a teacher for this school. Nothing has been heard from him since then.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Gentleman, the Department has decided to leave him at John Smiths for the present.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn the matter of the Fort a la Corne north Day School that has been closed now for 16 months.\n\nIs it the intention of the Department to re-open the School? It was closed for non-attendance or rather too small attendance.\n\nI did not think at the time that the School should have been closed, with a little firmness on the part of the Department and teacher the required average, if there is any required by the Department, could have been obtained as is the case in the Public Schools of the Province.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) R. McLennan,\nMissionary in Charge.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter received from Agent Schmidt, Duck Lake Agency, together with copy of a letter received by him from Rev. R. McLennan of Fort a la Corne, relative to the Day School on the north end of James Smith's Reserve, which has been closed for some time.\n\nSo far as I can learn there does not appear to have been much cooperation between Mr. McLennan and the School teacher while the School was open and I understand this School was closed by reason of insufficient attendance of pupils.\n\nWhile Mr. Schmidt in his letter states, \"There are several children living in the vicinity of the School who could attend\", there is every reason to believe that there are not a sufficient number living close enough to warrant the re-opening of this School, many of the families having moved further south on the reserve to farming locations. This being so, I do not consider the Department would be justified in re-opening the School. It seems to me most unfortunate that the Schools on this Reserve were not more centrally located and something will have to be done regarding the School at the south end of James Smith's Reserve as well.\n\nOn this matter I reported on Oct. 17th, 1918, but I have not been advised as to any action having been taken by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This school will have to carry on for a time until all the Indians who are likely to move to the southern part of the reserve get located, after which it might be possible to select a suitable and central location for the erection of a new building which might be found to be sufficient to serve the educational requirements of the whole reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the re-opening of the North Fort a la Corne Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to the small number of Indian children, the Department feels that it would not be justified in re-opening this school.\n\nThe question of re-opening the South Fort a la Corne School is receiving the consideration of Mr. Commissioner Graham, to whom this matter has been referred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. McNamara,\nThe Church Mission,\nFort a la Corne, Sask.\nDuck Lake Agency,\nAugust 25th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that in accordance with instructions contained in your letter dated the 7th inst. No.305-14 with which you enclosed a copy of a letter to you from Mr. Scott regarding the question of re-opening the South Fort la Corne Day school. I went fully into the matter when at that point on the 23rd instant.\n\nThe removal of the buildings from the North to the South end of the Reserve would not appear to be practicable owing to the nature of the country between the two points, which is comprised of slightly rolling ridges between which are sloughs or pot holes. The ridges especially towards the north end of the reserve are covered with a fairly heavy growth of poplar through which a road would have to be cut for the passage of the buildings.\n\nExperienced men would have to be engaged to carry out the work and this would entail considerable expense. It does not appear to me that the situation would be met on this reserve by re-opening only one of the schools. The following are my reasons for arriving at this opinion.\n\nThe north school is located near the north east line and the south school near the south west line of the reserve. The distance between the schools being approximately nine miles. The homes of the Indians are scattered over the whole of the area between and on each side. I find that there are 14 children of school age within a three mile radius of the north school and 16 children within the same radius of the south school. There are six children of school age residing at a greater distance than three miles from either of these schools.\n\nThe largest centres of the population on this reserve are at the north and south ends and the schools are at present located as fairly as possible in order to provide for the best possible attendance at each. Judging from past experience there is no guarantee that either of these schools will have a satisfactory attendance until it is made compulsory and the Act is enforced.\n\nThe dwelling house at the south school is a log building 16'x 18' with a small kitchen attached. It is old and the foundation logs are rotten. It has one room upstairs and one on the ground floor. Lighting is provided by one window on each side. It would have to be replaced before the school is re-opened.\n\nThe school room is built with logs the walls have been willowed and plastered. The plaster has been knocked off for about two feet from the bottom and the logs are rotted. Repairs are out of the question as there is no solid material to nail to. It is heated with a box stove and the floors must be cold in winter. Water is obtained at a depth of 40 feet but I am told that it is very alkaline. This is a condition which prevails over the whole south end of the reserve and the adjacent country. Soft water storage facilities would appear advisable as a help in this connection.\n\nW.M.Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nThe old well is out of business and a new one will have to be dug.\n\nI may say in conclusion that the Rev'd Canon McLellan called upon me and we had a talk on the school question. He stated that in his opinion a good average attendance could be obtained at both schools and that he did not favour the re-opening of one of the schools more than the other. It appears to be his desire to have educational facilities provided for the children of this band.\n\nHe suggested that instead of putting up new buildings at the south end of the reserve that the money be used in enlarging the north school so as to provide residential accommodation for the children. This of course would mean a boarding school which no doubt would meet the situation if the Department favored the plan.\n\nI trust that the foregoing report contains the information which you require.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) W. MURISON.\n\nInspector.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 3rd ult. No.109-4-1 informing me that you had received communication from the Reverend R. McLennan, urging the re-opening of the South Fort a la Corne School, and my letter of the 13th July, 1919 in which I said that I would look into the matter of removing the school from the North end of the Reserve to the South end. I instructed Mr. Inspector MacIsaac to go to this Reserve and make a report as to the feasibility of moving this building. A copy of Mr. MacIsaac's report is attached herewith. You will notice that he is of the opinion that it would not be practicable to move the building, owing to the nature of the country between the two points. He goes on to say that it does not appear to him that the situation would be met by re-opening the South school as there are practically as many children around the North school, and I would gather from his letter that the children are not such great distances from the North school but what they could attend. Certainly they would have to go equally as long a distance if a new school were built on the South and it seems to me that the proper thing to do is to authorize the opening of the North school, which would take care of at least half the children on the Reserve and later when this school proves to be a success we might consider the matter of using the house residence, which is situated along side of the school, as a home to accommodate six or eight children from the district surrounding the South school. This could be done by putting a married couple with an assistant in charge, one of the couple to act as a teacher. I am certainly opposed to re-building at the South end or at any other point on this reserve and there is no doubt in my mind that the existing school buildings on the South are unfit for habitation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDiocese of Saskatchewan\n\n161 Twentieth St. W.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nSeptember 1st, 1920.\n\nJ.

Deputy and Sec'y.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Indian School at Ft a la Corne.\n\nI beg to inquire whether any decision has been reached in reference to the provision of educational facilities for the children on Smith's Reserve, concerning which you wrote to the Bishop of Saskatchewan on April 15th, 1920, No. 25334/1. I am seeking suitable teachers for the various Indian Schools now vacant which are under the auspices of the Bishop of Saskatchewan and trust that it may be possible to place these teachers and fill any vacancies as we secure them. Owing to the greatly increased rates of stipend in the public schools it is increasingly difficult to obtain teachers for Indian Schools and it is important that when we receive suitable applications for this work we should be able to place them. We have been appealed to by the Indians of Fort a la Corne to send them a teacher. I shall be glad of some definite word with regard to the vacancy on this Reserve and especially whether, in the event of qualified workers being secured you would be prepared to receive a nomination and make an appointment. Would you also inform me as to what your Department requires for this Reserve.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nBishop's Commissary.\nOttawa, September 10, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant enclosing a copy of Mr. Inspector Murison's report regarding the question of re-opening a day school on the James Smiths Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the Inspector's report and your recommendation, also on the earnest solicitation of the Anglican Church authorities, the Department will authorize the re-opening of the school on the north end of the reserve known as the James Smiths Day School. It is noted by the Inspector's report that it will not be feasible to remove the buildings from the north to the south end of the reserve and that there are fourteen children within the three mile radius of the north school. The continuation of this school will, however, depend upon the attendance.\n\nAs the school buildings on the south end of the reserve are unfit for school purposes, the Department has no intention at the present time of having them placed in condition and re-opening the school.\n\nRev. Archdeacon Dewdney, Prince Albert, requests definite word with regard to the re-opening of a school on the James Smiths Reserve and states that the church authorities will be prepared to nominate a teacher. He is being informed of the Department's decision to reopen the school on the north end of the reserve and also that as the attendance at this school will likely be small, the salary allowed for a teacher having the necessary qualifications will be at the rate of $750.00 per annum together with the bonus additional. He is also being informed that the school will be discontinued if the attendance does not warrant its being continued. You will be informed at a later date as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by the church authorities.\n\nYour suggestion that, if later on this school at the north end proves to be a success, the nurse's residence, which is situated alongside the school, be fitted up as a home to accommodate six or eight of the children from the district around the south end is being left for further consideration.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will instruct the Agent at Duck Lake to see that the school building at the north end is placed in good condition and also if any supplies are required that he will inform the Department, in order that, when a teacher is secured, there will be no delay in starting work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 10, 1920.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the last instant regarding the re-opening of a school on the James Smith's Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a report has been received regarding the condition of the school buildings at both the north and south ends of the reserve and also as to the probable attendance. The buildings at the south end are unfit to be used for school purposes, while those at the north end are in good condition. Mr. Inspector Murison states that there are fourteen children of school age within the three mile radius of the north school.\n\nThe Department has decided, on the recommendation of the Inspector and Mr. Commissioner Graham, to authorize the re-opening of the school on the north end of the reserve, known as the James Smith's Indian Day School. I shall therefore, be pleased if the church authorities will nominate a suitable teacher for this school to begin duties as soon as possible. A single teacher, male or female, having the necessary qualifications will be required. As the attendance will likely be small, the Department can only pay a salary at the rate of $750.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. I shall be pleased if you will forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated for this position. I may also say that the continuation of this school will depend entirely upon the attendance maintained. If at any time the attendance decreases to such an extent that the Department would not be warranted in continuing the expense involved, the school will be closed.\n\nAt the present time the services of a field matron will not be required.\n\nThe Agent will be instructed to inform the Department as to what is required to have the school at the north end of the reserve made ready for re-opening when a teacher is secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon A. D. Dewdney, B.A.,\n151 Twentieth St., W.,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 109-4-1 of the 10th inst. in regard to the re-opening of the day school on the North end of the James Smith Reserve. I have advised Mr. Agent Schmidt of the Department's decision to re-open this school and directed him to see that any minor repairs that are required are attended to. I have also informed him that when the teacher arrives he should at once consult with him as to what supplies may be needed and to forward a list to the Department, as I do not think a list of such supplies can be furnished by the Agent until he has consulted with the teacher. I have also informed him under what conditions the school will remain open and have directed him to report to me from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSept 15th 1920\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of Aug 27th\nNo 109-4-1.\n\nI feel sorry that the Department does not\nfeel justified in reopening the North Portage la\nCorne School. In the Department we do feel\njustified if the Treaty rights of the Indians were\nconsidered but as a correspondent to the\nSaskatoon Star said, the Government prefers to\nconsider the Treaty only as a scrap of paper.\nI suppose as your answer is final I\nshall have to try and find some other ways\nand means.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. M. Stewart\nOttawa, September 27, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant regarding the re-opening of the day school on the north end of the James Smith's Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Commissioner Graham has furnished a report concerning this matter, in which he recommended that the school be re-opened, and he has been asked to communicate with the Church authorities and request them to nominate a suitable teacher, to begin duties as soon as possible. He states that he has advised Mr. Agent Schmidt to see that any minor repairs that are required are attended to. As the attendance will likely be small, there being only fourteen children living within a three mile radius of the school, the continuation of the school will depend upon how the attendance keeps up.\n\nIt is hoped that a teacher will be secured at an early date, in order that there will be no delay in starting the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. McKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. McLennan,\nThe Church Mission,\nFort a la Corne, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have just returned from hospital and have resumed charge of the correspondence with the Department. I am glad to learn that you are prepared to reopen the day school in north end of James Smith's Reserve, St. Anne's, and I note the rate of salary mentioned by Mr. A. F. MacKenzie, 10th Sept.\n\nI have only one name before me, I am not sure of him. But I have delay, I am writing to you at once to see if Mr. J. D. objects to any of the items I now put in his qualifications.\n\nMr. R. B. F. Taylor, taught for 14 months in S.D. day school, the Big Indian Reserve; owing to ecclesiastical or religious disagreements with the Chief of Staff Authorities he resigned. He speaks very highly of a Hindu; I think it is a leg not an arm. He is something of an accountant, & has a general education. I understand that he had previously taught (Saskatchewan) schools \"in permit\" & has no Normal Certificate. His ecclesiastical employers approve, though they differed from him only in points of doctrine & ecclesiastical grounds, speak well of his character.\n\nVerry Poor Copy\nof his having been fairly successful as a teacher.\n\nShe anxious to continue in work of that kind among Indians & I am quite prepared to give him a trial. He is, I think, unmarried, which is what was required by the L.D., in Mr. MacKenzie's letter, 109-6-1 of 10th Sept., which see.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Taylor meanwhile, to find out if he is still open to this offer. If you encourage me to do so, I will make him the offer.\n\nI also want teachers elsewhere; but as yet have not been able to secure any applications.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. N. R.

As you are aware, the continuation of this school will depend upon how the attendance keeps up and the success met with in the work. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $750.00 per annum, together with the bonus additional at the rate of $150.00 per annum for the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nI shall be pleased if Your Lordship will instruct Mr. Taylor to begin duties as soon as possible, and he should communicate with Mr. Agent Schmidt and inform him as to the date he will be able to begin duties, in order that the Agent can inform the Indian parents.

Canon McLenman has consented to act in my stead and I trust that this arrangement will be satisfactory to you. If convenient I would like to leave the Reserve on January 24th (Monday) and I will return to my duties on February 7th.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of an acceptance of this letter,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nyour obedient servant.\n\n(Sgd) R.B.Fielden-Taylor B.A.\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. R.B.F.

B. F. Taylor, teacher of the James Smiths Indian Day School, in which he requests that he be allowed two weeks leave of absence from his duties for the purpose of consulting a specialist.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of leave of absence for the purpose stated by the teacher being granted. It is noted that he has arranged with Rev. Canon McLennan to act as substitute during his absence. Salary will be allowed Mr. Taylor for the above period, but on the understanding that he will settle for any amount that may be due the substitute. You will be good enough to inform Mr. Taylor accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.

Taylor.\nFort a la Corne, Sask.\n4 - 5 - 21\n\nC.P. Schmidt Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI ask you to give the following your consideration.\n\nOwing to the fact that I have taken my recent loss so much to heart, I find it necessary to either resign my work here or else receive a transfer for some other reserve.\n\nIt seems to me that wherever I go, my wife to be follows me, try my hardest I cannot get her out of my mind. I am very desirous of doing my duty to you and the Indian Department, but find it too much under the conditions. If I was away from these surroundings on which I had built such great hopes all would be well, but as long as I am here I can do nothing, although I am trying my hardest to fight my sorrow.\n\nIf you do not see fit to use your influence to secure me a transfer, I must ask you to accept my resignation the same to take effect June 30th.\n\nI do this with great regret because to a large extent I have become very infatuated with the work here, but I fail to see any possible way out of it.\n\nI understand that Mr. Lowe would be willing to be transferred here, and I would be quite willing to go to that point, and would ask you to give the matter your consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) R.B.F. Taylor.\nTeacher & Dispenser.\nFort a la Corne. Sask.\n16 - 3 - 21\n\nC.P. Schmidt Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nDUCK LAKE. Sask.\n\nSir:\n\nI regret to have to inform you that the young lady to whom I was betrothed passed away last Saturday, this undoubtedly has changed my plans for the future, but I have decided to go over to the teacher's house to reside, the same to take effect next Tuesday.\n\nI believe that you understand my feelings, I have suffered some hard losses during the past four years, and for my own good and benefit I prefer to be alone.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would look into the wood matter for me, and see as to whether I can have my wood found me, and owing to the fact that I would like to get away for a short while to try and forget I have decided to absent myself from the reserve during Easter week.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir.\nyour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) R.B.F. Taylor.\nTeacher.\nI have the honour to forward herewith for your perusal copies of communications received from Mr. R.B.F. Taylor, teacher at the Fort \u00e0 la Corne North Day School on the James Smith Reserve.\n\nMr. Taylor is a widower with no family. Having lost a leg, which he claims cannot be replaced by an artificial limb, he has to use crutches. He is very nervous and not physically strong. I consider, and have brought the fact to his attention, that it is most unwise for him to live alone as he is doing at present, having left the Farm Instructor's house where he was boarding to live in the teacher's house. He cannot remain alone during the winter months, and I am not prepared to recommend employing someone to live with him; I have told him so but he does not seem to give the matter serious thought. From personal observation I find this man to be very unsettled as to his future actions, and he changes his mind frequently.\n\nImmediately on assuming his duties as teacher on this reserve last winter Mr. Taylor adopted an aggressive attitude, and displayed an inclination to meddle with matters entirely outside his province. Later he unfortunately closed off somewhat with the parents of some of his pupils, and when I investigated the matter he made some talk of resigning his position. While he may have the ability to teach satisfactorily, I find him very slack in handling his own end of the work, that is in making his reports and returns. In checking up his Quarterly Return for March 1921, a period that included 18 school days in the month of March, I found that the school had been open for 13 days only in that month. The month of April disclosed the fact that the school had been closed 3 days when it should have been open. On taking the matter up with Mr. Taylor, the explanations furnished were not very satisfactory, and it also involves the trouble of making readjustments in a subsequent return.\n\nThe question of an exchange of transfers between himself and Mr. Lowe of the John Smiths Day School is entirely out of the question. Mr. Lowe is settled in his position and is doing good work at his school, and, as far as I am aware, has no desire for an exchange.\n\nTaking all circumstances into consideration I beg to suggest that the Department accept Mr. Taylor's resignation, nevertheless I would prefer that the Department take what action in the matter they see fit.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, June 7th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing copies of communications which you received from Mr. R. B. F. Taylor, teacher at the Fort a la Corne Indian Day School on the James Smith Reserve.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department cannot approve of his request for an exchange of transfers between himself and Mr. Lowe of the John Smith's Day School. If Mr. Taylor is not satisfied with his present position, he should forward his resignation in due time, in order that the services of his successor can be obtained to take charge when the school re-opens after the summer holidays. You should ascertain from him, definitely, whether he intends to remain for another term or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. Paul Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDear Mr. Godfrey,\n\nVery many thanks for your kind reply to my former letter.\n\nI trust the enclosed copy of a poem composed by Mr. Godfrey, which I have culled from the Melfort Journal of June 1st will be of interest to you, & also plead pardon for me in again addressing you.\n\nIn a letter recently received from the Rev. Canon McLennan of the Fort a la Corne Mission, was contained the news that the Dept. of Indian Affairs was purposing the building of a new school & residence on the James Smith Reserve to serve in lieu of the two schools which have hitherto done duty there.\n\nUpon receipt of this information Mr. Godfrey wrote to the Bishop of Saskatchewan for fuller information, at the same time offering his services as Teacher.\n\nUpon receipt of his Lordship's reply Mr. Godfrey wrote an application for the position of Teacher at the North School and has sent this application to his Lordship to be endorsed and forwarded by him to the proper authorities.\n\nWe are given to understand that Mr. Taylor (who is at present teaching at Fort a la Corne) is asking for a transfer.\n\nMy\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy connection with this matter, in the event of Mr. Godfrey being appointed by the local service commissioners, will be exactly the same as before my appointment to the Sturgeon Lake Day School, i.e., holding up the rough end of the work, and doing, in an unofficial manner, whatever is required to ensure the success of my work, both in the interest of the Indian and the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOstensibly I shall resume farming, for neither of us care for or are happy in city life, & the call to the Indian work has been too clear to resist, although apparently all we can do is to offer, & leave it with higher powers to say if our services are desired.\n\nThanking you for your kind wishes, believe me to be\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nW. Godfrey\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. In the event of Mr. Godfrey being reappointed, I wonder if my term of service with the Dept. of Interior from the 1st Sept. 1914 could be credited to his service thus giving him a continuity since 1913 with a credit of seniority? I know it would be asking the local service commissioners to establish a precedent, but the circumstance is an unusual one.\nOTTAWA, June 22nd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant regarding the application made by Mrs. Godfrey for the position as teacher of the North School on the James Smith Reserve.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the present teacher, Mr. R. B. F. Taylor, has expressed dissatisfaction with the work and intimated to the Agent that it was his intention to resign at the end of the present school year. The Department has no further information as to whether he has decided to give up his duties at this school or not. If he remains, there is no vacancy for a teacher on either the James or John Smith Reserves. It might be well for you to consult Mr. C. Paul Schmidt, Indian Agent, Duck Lake, who may be able to give you further particulars as to whether there will be any vacancies or not.\n\nIt is not the intention of the Department during the present year to erect a new school and teacher's residence on the James Smith Reserve to serve in lieu of the two schools which have hitherto done duty there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lord Bishop\nof Saskatchewan.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nHearing that the position of School Teacher at the Indian School at Fort a la Corne, James Smith's Reserve, is to become vacant at the end of August next, I beg to offer my services to fill the vacancy beginning on September 1st.\n\nAs you are aware, I have had considerable experience in Indian teaching, having taught school on the above Reserve (at the South Fort a la Corne school) from 1903-1912, the success of which may be verified by the records of the Indian Blue Books of those years.\n\nI may perhaps add that, although I opened that new school with children who had never been in a school before, yet, when I left, that school was the proud possessor of two diplomas, and one silver medal (each suitably framed by the Dept of Indian Affairs) which my scholars had won in competition at the Winnipeg Industrial Exhibition.\n\nIndeed, without any undue egotism on my part, I think I may venture to say, that it was partly due to the success of my teaching, and to the suggestions which I put to the Indian Dept., through correspondence, at its request, as to the means to be employed for the further improvement of Indian schools, that the \"New Improved Way Schools\" became an accomplished fact.\n\nThis said correspondence will be on file in the records of the Indian Dept., and all I have above stated may be corroborated by Duncan C. Scott Esq., Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, who visited my school in 1910.\n\nIn 1912, my work at South Fort a la Corne terminated but was continued at Sturgeon Lake Indian Reserve, in conjunction with my husband; the latter as school\nteaching, and myself as matron. This position was held till June 1914, when, at my doctor's order, I was obliged to relinquish the work on account of the break-down of my health.\n\nPerfect restoration has followed my long rest, during the whole of which period I have ever had the longing to return to the Indian work, and have continuously kept in touch with my old scholars by correspondence.\n\nI hold an English 2nd Class Teacher's Certificate having been fully trained in the Old Country, my marks falling only a very few short of entitling me to a First Class; indeed, of the number of teachers who wrote with me, I stood the highest in that class, at that Branch.\n\nThe following Certificates are also held by me:\n\n1. First Class (Elementary) Singing\n2. First Class (Advanced) Singing\n3. Elementary Freehand Drawing\n4. Advanced Freehand Drawing\n5. Perspective Drawing\n6. Physiology\n7. Nursing Diploma from the \"Chautauqua School of Nursing,\" New York.\n\nHoping that these facts may be deemed sufficient to entitle me to resume my work among the Indians, and that my application may be favourably received,\n\nNote. I cordially recommend Mrs Ada A. Godfrey. Her appointment will be perfectly satisfactory to me. Her character & her abilities have been proved in past experience.\n\nI beg to remain Yours obediently\n\n(Mrs Wm.) Ada A. Godfrey\n\nJ.S. Kunkler, Bishop of Saskatchewan\nMay I say the following before you, ask you the kind enough to put the matter before the proper officials?\n\nMr. A.B. Fielden Taylor has sent me his resignation as teacher in the day school on James Smith Reserve, Fort \u00e0 la Corne, Sask. I understand that he has also tendered his resignation to the S.D., to take effect when the school closes for the summer.\n\nI have accepted his resignation, but have told him that I can hardly recommend him for another Indian school. He has a first rate education (Oxford Univ.) & is of a good moral character. But he is in weak health, a partial cripple, & I am informed that those things, & his excitable nervous state, & perhaps his high education, unfit him for such work; for he is too irritable & impatient with his pupils.\n\nMrs. Godfrey, formerly one of your teachers there, & at Sturgeon Lake Reserve, desires intensely to get back into this work, & has applied to me to forward her wishes.\n\n$50 Taylor present teacher $750 balance $150 = $900\nI receive her application, she submitted it to the Civil Service Commission, with my note at the end.\n\nIf, as I think, the position is vacant, so if she gets the appointment; I think the pupils will benefit.\n\nI have every respect for her character, & the sincerity of her desire to do good work. I think a study of the records of her past work will bear me out.\n\nPerhaps her qualifications as set forth in her application along with her past record will satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners. In case it may have any good effect, I may add that she is the wife of a returned soldier - the mother of a returned soldier. I should be glad to hear what the decision is; but also, if not asking too much, I request that the J.D. may notify her of his appointment, the salary, & the requirements, & correspond with her on the matter. I shall be much away, & I leave finally permanently about Sept 15th.\n\nHer address is Wm. Wm Godfrey, 862 Fifth Ave. N.W., Morse Law, Sask.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours Cordially,\n\nJ. H. Newhouse\nArchivist of Saskatchewan\nOTTAWA, June 24th, 1921.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 18th instant, enclosing an application from Mrs. Ada A. Godfrey for the position as teacher in the James Smith's (North) Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications and experience which she possesses.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the present teacher, Mr. R. B. F. Taylor, forwarded his resignation to the Indian Agent which he later withdrew. The Agent has been requested to ascertain definitely from Mr. Taylor whether he intends to resign or not. In the event of a vacancy occurring, the Department will be pleased to appoint Mrs. Godfrey at the same salary and bonus as is at present being paid Mr. Taylor.\n\nI might add that a communication was received from Mr. Godfrey regarding the matter, and he was instructed to communicate with the Indian Agent.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Taylor is dissatisfied with the work, and the Agent is being informed, in the event of his resignation, that Mrs. Godfrey is to receive the appointment.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. J. A. Newnham,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOTTAWA, June 24th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to official letter of June 7th regarding the resignation of Mr. R. B. F. Taylor, teacher of the James Smith's (North) Indian Day School, I beg to say that a communication has been received from His Lordship The Bishop of Saskatchewan enclosing an application from Mrs. Ada A. Godfrey for the position as teacher in this school, to begin duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays.\n\nHis Lordship is being informed that in the event of Mr. Taylor resigning, the Department will be pleased to accept the services of Mrs. Godfrey at the same salary and bonus as is being paid Mr. Taylor.\n\nA communication was also received from Mr. Godfrey in the matter, and he was requested to communicate with you.\n\nThe Department has no definite knowledge as to whether Mr. Taylor is resigning or not, but considers that it would be in the best interest of the work if he did, in which event Mrs. Godfrey is to receive the appointment as his successor. Mrs. Godfrey's address is, #662 - 5th Ave., N.W., Moose Jaw, Sask., and I will be pleased if you will, in the event of Mr. Taylor giving up duties, inform her of her appointment to succeed him, and arrange with her to take up duties when the school reopens after the summer holidays.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department as to the outcome regarding the securing of a teacher for this school for the next school year.\n\nI might state that Mrs. Godfrey was formerly employed as teacher for several years at Fort a la Corne (South) Indian Day School, and gave good satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If the Bishop desires Mrs. Godfrey to take charge after the holidays he will no doubt inform Mr. Taylor accordingly, and instruct him that his services are not required. If, however, the Bishop consents to Mr. Taylor remaining, the Department will carry out his wishes regarding the appointment of a teacher for this school.

Fielden Taylor\n\nTeacher or Watchman\nDear sir-\n\nI was called to Fort ala Corne reserve yesterday to visit some sick Indians and while there was asked to see Mr Taylor, the schoolteacher.\n\nMr Taylor should be in a hospital, at least for a time, so as to be under observation. He is getting extremely thin and debilitated and needs official care. I am strongly suspicious that his condition may be due to drug addiction and should be where he can be watched.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that serious charges of dishonesty are laid against him. He appears to be using his position to obtain credit and loans, which to all appearances will not be met. The last time he was in Melfort he came to me and borrowed $10.00 on the story that he came here intending to return the same day, but the Indian who was with him would not go back until the next day, so he was put to the unexpected expense of stopping at the hotel overnight.\n\nAt that time I was under the impression that his story that he was a returned soldier and wounded while in the Army was O.K., but it seems information has been sought in Australia from Army Office and at present no trace can be found that he is on the pension list, which he certainly would be if he lost his leg in service. His conduct certainly needs looking into as well as his health.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd. M.D. Baker.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that on the 12th inst., a telephone message was received at this office from The Secretary Municipality of Kinistino, Sask., stating that Mr. R.E.F. Taylor, teacher at the Fort a la Corne, North Day School on James Smith's Reserve had been brought to Kinistino and it was feared was out of his mind, and asking what should be done with him and who should pay the expenses.\n\nMr. Ewing, Clerk at the Agency here, who answered the phone in my absence, stated that he replied to take him to a hospital and that the matter of payment would be taken up later.\n\nYesterday I received from Dr. M.D. Baker of Melfort \"Medical Attendant to James Smith's Band\" a letter, a copy of which is attached hereto. This letter which is not dated, must have been written and mailed not later than the evening of the 11th, in order to reach here on the 13th. After receiving this letter I phoned Dr. Baker who told me that Mr. Taylor had been brought to The Melfort Hospital and was there under his care, that he was very weak, temperature below normal, recognized him, the Doctor, and knew what was going on, but that he would have to be kept in the Hospital under observation for a certain time.\n\nI asked Dr. Baker if he had any objections to my forwarding a copy of his letter to the Dept., to which he replied \"you may do as you please about it\". As regards charges of dishonesty etc., referred to in the Doctor's letter, while I have heard rumors of same, these have not been brought to my attention \"Officially\" and I have not given same any special attention. I understand that Mr. Taylor is hard up financially, that he has no money, and the matter of paying the Dr. and Hospital is one which will no doubt be brought to The Department's attention in the very near future.\n\nI am today forwarding, enclosed herewith, his Quarterly School Return for the quarter ending Dec. 31st last, on which you will notice, written in red ink in the remarks column, that he requests that his salary and bonus cheques be sent direct, care Merchants Bank of Canada, Kinistino, Sask. From reports, I hear that he has promissory notes to meet at the Bank. If this is the case and his Salary and Bonus cheques are applied thereon, there will be nothing left to pay the Dr. and Hospital.\nI suggest that Mr. Taylor's Military service record be looked into with a view of ascertaining whether he did serve during the late war with the Australian Army, which he claims he did.\n\nI am leaving for Melfort by Monday's train to see Mr. Taylor.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, January 23rd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a copy of a communication from Dr. M. D. Baker reporting on the condition of health of Mr. R. B. F. Taylor, teacher of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne (North) Indian day school, on the James Smith reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, in view of the doctor's report as to the condition of health of Mr. Taylor, and the reasons therefor, it is considered that he is no longer a suitable teacher for this school, and his services are therefore dispensed with.\n\nYou should take this matter up with the Anglican church authorities, under whose auspices the school is conducted, and request that the services of another teacher be secured as soon as possible. The December quarter return, which has just been received, shows an enrolment of 23 pupils with an average attendance of 16. In view of this enrolment, the Department is of the opinion that it would be advisable to have this school continued in the interests of the children. It is hoped that the church authorities will be able to nominate a suitable teacher to succeed Mr. Taylor at an early date. The salary allowed will be the same as was paid Mr. Taylor.\n\nIt is noted on the return that Mr. Taylor requested that his salary and bonus cheques be sent in care of the Merchants Bank of Canada, Kinistino, Sask., but as you state he will have hospital charges to pay, his cheques are being sent direct to you. You should have him endorse these cheques, and arrange to settle his indebtedness as far as possible.\n\nAs soon as the church authorities have nominated a teacher you should forward particulars regarding the name, qualifications and experience of the person so nominated.\n\nYou should inform Mr. Taylor that his services are not further required, and also get in immediate touch with the church authorities with a view to obtaining another teacher. (Signed)\n\nYour prompt attention to this matter is desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nFurther to my No.610-120 of the 14th inst.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that on Monday the 16th inst., I went to Melfort to see Mr. R.B.F. Taylor whom I found in the Municipal Hospital there.\n\nMr. Taylor recognized me, but I did not converse with him as he did not seem to care to talk and said he was suffering from pains around his heart.\n\nDr. Baker, who is attending him, could not say definitely what is ailing him, but seems satisfied that it is not drugs. As it is Mr. Taylor is very weak and it will be some time before he can get around.\n\nWhen I next visit James Smith's Reserve I will ask the Rev. Canon R. McLennan, Missionary on the reserve to take charge of the school for the time being.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, January 28th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, which would cross our letter to you of the same date, regarding the condition of health of Mr. R. B. F. Taylor, teacher of the Fort a la Corne (North) Indian Day School on the James Smith reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you have taken up with Rev. Canon McLennan, Missionary on the reserve, the question of taking charge of this school for the time being. Your action is along the lines of the Department's letter of the 23rd, above mentioned.\n\nIt is hoped that temporary arrangements can be made to continue the work until the matter of obtaining a regular qualified teacher is settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am sorry to be under the necessity of informing you that I have received complaints regarding Mr. J. F. Taylor, teacher of the day school on Fort a la Corne Reserve. I have written to Canon McLennan, our missionary on that Reserve, and he too corroborates the statements that I have received regarding Mr. Taylor's unsuitability, both physically and otherwise. I have not heard directly from your agent in charge of the Reserve, but I understand that he too does not consider Mr. Taylor a suitable man for the post.\n\nI am aware, of course, that he was recommended by Bishop Macdonald, late of this Diocese, but possibly the Bishop's information\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nmay not have been very thorough. From\ninformation that has come to me, I\nregret to say, that I do not think any good\nobject can be gained by allowing Mr Taylor\nto have charge of the Fort a la Cane & In-\ndian Day School any longer.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obediently,\nJ.A. MacKay\nOttawa, February 4, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 28th ultimo, referring to Mr. R. B. F. Taylor, Teacher of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne (North) Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that information has come to the Department during the past month, that makes it imperative that we secure the services of another teacher for this flourishing cause on the James Smith reserve. To this end our Agent, Mr. C. P. Schmidt, of Duck Lake, Sask., got in touch with Rev. Canon R. McLennan, the Anglican Missionary on the reserve. As soon as you are successful in nominating a teacher for this Indian school, the Department would be grateful for the name of the person selected and some information concerning qualifications, etc. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $750, plus whatever bonus is allowed by law. At present the bonus paid to Indian day school teachers amounts to $150.00 per annum. If you would communicate direct with Mr. Agent Schmidt, as soon as you have arranged for a successor to Mr. Taylor, the Department would be grateful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. Mackay,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nFurther to your No. 6109-4-1 of the 23rd and 28th ultimo and my Nos. 610 and 624-120 of the 14th and 23rd of the same month, re Mr. R.B. Fielden Taylor, teacher of the Fort a la Corne, North Day School on James Smith's Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that when on the said reserve last week, I made arrangements with Rev. Canon McLennan, Missionary on the reserve to take charge of the school for the time being, which he agreed to do. The School will be reopened on Tuesday the 14th inst.\n\nOn my return home from the reserve on the 11th inst., I met The Venerable Arch-deacon McKay, administrator of The Diocese of Sask., Church of England, and informed him that Mr. Taylor's services had been dispensed with. \"The Arch-Deacon told me he had written the Department asking that this be done. I asked him to nominate another teacher, a married man, as soon as possible.\n\nI recommend and ask the Department that only a married man be engaged, the husband to teach school and the wife to be engaged as Field Matron for the reserve. A good Field Matron could find lots to do and could do lots of good on the reserve.\n\nWith reference to the balance paid to each of your letter of the 23rd, re Mr. Taylor's salary and Bonus cheques, I am returning these to the Department here-with, I find Mr. Taylor is indebted in so many places that it would not be an easy matter to satisfy all his creditors. The following debts have been brought to my attention.\n\n| Merchants Bank, Kinistino | Note $400.00 |\n|---------------------------|--------------|\n| W.J. McNeil               | Store Acct. 139.40 |\n| Leslie Lowe               | Loan 30.00 |\n| Canon McLennan            | Fort a la Corne, Loan ? |\n| H.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs it is I do not care to become mixed up in his personal affairs.\n\nI have informed Mr. Taylor that his services are no longer required.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, February 22nd, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing cheques Nos. 3460 for $187.50 and 3227 for $45.00, being salary and bonus due to Mr. R. B. Fielden-Taylor as teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School for the quarter ending January 31st, last. The statement of Mr. Taylor's indebtedness, which has been brought to your attention, is noted.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not responsible in any manner for the settlement of any indebtedness due by Mr. Taylor, and is, therefore, returning the cheques herewith. You will be good enough to send these cheques to Mr. Taylor, as the Department desires to settle with him for the amount due for his services. He should endeavour to settle with his creditors, as the Department cannot undertake the responsibility in this connection. It might be well to obtain a receipt from Mr. Taylor for these two cheques.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged with Rev. Canon McLennan to take charge of the school until such time as a qualified teacher can be secured. Your recommendation that a married man be engaged as teacher, the husband to teach and the wife to be engaged as field matron for the reserve, is noted. The Department has already taken this matter up with Venerable Archdeacon J. A. MacKay, Administrator of the Diocese of Saskatchewan, and we are awaiting the name of the teacher appointed by him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

For a while - being a widower - I stayed with the Farm Instructor; but we had not much in harmony and therefore I moved my belongings over to the Teacher's residence.\n\nBeing incapacitated by the loss of a limb, I lost an Indian boy in to stay with me and everything went well until the early part of this year when I was taken sick and had to be removed to the hospital where I was for seven weeks. Just previous to leaving that institution, the Indian Agent - C. P. Schmidt - called on me and told me that I would not be required further on the James Smith Reserve, and I am writing to ask you whether I am not entitled to a month's notice or a month's salary. Just previous to my sickness I was played right out, principally because I was caring for the children, as well as looking after the physical welfare of the Indians which at that time was heavy, and in the hospital I was unconscious for three weeks.\n\nNow I am stranded, I have no work in sight and my sickness has thrown very heavy on my purse. I would, therefore, appreciate it if you would consider this letter for all its weight, and if possible send me a cheque direct. It would further be appreciated if you would let me know the reason for my discharge.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Fielden Taylor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

L. Lowe, Teacher of the school on the John Smith's Reserve, requests to be transferred to the school on the James Smith's Reserve, and stating the reasons for desiring this exchange.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that there would be a difficulty in making this exchange. Mrs. Lowe is Field Matron, and her position has been established by the Civil Service Commission. If this transfer were made and her services retained, it would be necessary to have the position of Field Matron for the James Smith's Reserve established by the Civil Service Commission. The Department has not considered the appointment of a field matron for this last named reserve.\n\nThe salary allowed Mr. Goodman is at the rate of $750 per annum plus bonus; the salary paid Mr. Lowe is $600 per annum plus bonus and Mrs. Lowe, as Field Matron, $480 plus bonus.\n\nIn view of the above, the Department does not consider it advisable at the present time to arrange an exchange in positions between Mr. Goodman and Mr. Lowe, without some stronger reason being given therefor than has been up to this time set forth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In many cases the parents are illiterate, are indifferent regarding educational matters, and do not see to it that their children attend school regularly, and leave home early enough that they may arrive at school on time. Also, in many cases the child rules the home, and any excuse advanced by the child for not going to school is accepted by the parents. Others take their families along when they leave the reserve to go hunting, trapping, digging Sandroot, or pick berries. We have succeeded in some cases to have them leave their children with relatives or neighbors, but when the child begins to cry, or runs after their parents at the time of their leaving they nine times out of ten give in to the child and take him along.\n\nI have, on every occasion possible, spoken to the parents individually, and to the band in meeting, on the necessity of sending their children to school regularly. Rev. R. McNamara, missionary on the reserve, is doing likewise. The Indians, while seeming to approve of what we tell them, will give the matter attention for a few days, but soon forget and the same condition again prevails.\n\nThe warning that the children will have to be sent to Boarding schools if they do not attend the Day schools regularly, is no longer effective as they would be willing to send them away.\n\nThe appointment of a Truah officer might help matters, but this would necessitate an outsider, as I doubt if any member of the band would have the required authority to enforce the law. If a member of The Royal Canadian Mounted Police could be got to patrol the reserve about once a month, I believe it would help the attendance considerably.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It appears that no attention has been paid to his warnings or threats that the children would be removed to a residential school if they would not attend the day school. A portion of his letter is as follows:\n\n\"The appointment of a truant officer might help matters, but this would necessitate an outsider, as I doubt if any member of the band would have the required authority to enforce the law. If a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police could be got to patrol the reserve about once a month, I believe it would help the attendance considerably.\"\n\nWould it be possible to arrange for the patrol of this reserve at intervals, as I think your officers would have a more salutary effect than a truant officer appointed by this Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCol.

(School attendance)\n\nActing on instructions received from the Office Commanding of \"F\" Division on December 5th last, I left Prince Albert on the afternoon of the same date with orders to report to Mr. Goodman at Fort-\u00e0-la-Come.\n\nOn the morning of the 7th last, I visited the school on the reserve during the school hours and noticed that the attendance was better than what it was on my previous patrol to the reserve. Mr. Goodman informed me that the children were attending better at the present time than they had been doing before my previous patrol, also that they were coming to school on time now, whereas before some of them were always about two hours late in getting to school.\n\nOn my previous patrol to the reserve, Mr. Goodman informed me that one of the boys Simon Brittain son of Andrew Brittain was not attending school and had not been doing so for some time as his grandparents Samuel Smith had the boy away hunting with him, and had just returned to the reserve so I called on the grandparents and told them that the boy would have to attend school. In my visit to the reserve on the 7th last, Mr. Goodman informed me that this boy had not attended school since the last patrol, as the grandparents had taken him away hunting with them again shortly after I had left the reserve the last time. I visited some of the reserve Indians on the reserve on this patrol and made inquiries concerning the whereabouts of this boy and his grandparents and was informed that they were still away hunting. Mr. Jo-don the farm instructor on the reserve informed me that this boy's father was away hunting since last spring up in the Isle-\u00e0-Cross district, and that before he left the reserve he left the boy with Pota-Husetase so that the boy could attend school, but shortly after the father left the grandparents claimed the boy stating that before the mother died she had given her charge of the boy. She also informed that lately she stated that she would take the boy away hunting with them where ever she liked. It appears that the only way to get this boy to attend school would be to put him in one of the boarding schools.\n\nThere is a lot of children of school age living at the south end of the reserve that can't attend school on account of being too away from the school at the north end of the reserve, and the school at the south end has been closed for some time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames McNeil, Constable\n\nIndian Affairs.

The constable also states it would appear that the only way to get this boy to attend school would be to put him in one of the boarding schools. I have to request that you will arrange as soon as possible to have this boy placed in a residential school of the faith to which he belongs. You should have an application prepared on the form for that purpose and signed by the father or the person responsible for his care. If the father or other interested party refuses to sign the application, you may take the necessary steps, under the Indian Act, to have the boy placed in a residential school.\n\nI shall be pleased to be advised at a later date as to the action taken in his case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There was also two absences cases & upon investigating these, I found that one of them was a case of toothache & in the other case I found that the father of the child, Jacob Twiet, was contemplating making a trip down the river picking roots & was taking the child with him, but after a little persuasion, I managed to get him to make arrangements with a neighbour to look after his child until he returned, & the girl again attend school that afternoon.\n\nMr. Goodman strongly advised that a patrol be made before the latter part of August, before the school opened after the holidays, as there would be several children of school age by that time & the parents would not likely send them to school unless they saw that the police patrol was on the job.\n\nIn conclusion, I beg to state I found that I otherwise found everything on the reserve in good shape, no cases of drunkenness, etc. to investigate.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nR.C.M.Police,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nForwarded for his information.\nAnother patrol will be made to this Reserve about the time suggested by the teacher.\nCopy sent to Indian Agent Schmidt of Duck Lake.\n\nF.J.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nOttawa, January 30, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your No. 309-9 of the 22nd instant, which relates to the education of the children on the James Smith Reserve. You will remember that it is your intention to discuss with Mr. Inspector Morrison the advisability of moving the Fort a la Corne North day school ten miles to the south of the reserve, where there are a large number of our wards of school age.\n\nFrom reports on file, it appears that there are 26 children of school age living within two miles of the site of the old Fort a la Corne South school. In addition to these, there are 3 children six years of age and 24 still younger in the same area. These facts have been taken from a comprehensive report of Mr. Indian Agent Schmidt dated May 22, 1923. The local Church of England missionary and His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan have on several occasions urged the re-opening of the Fort a la Corne South Indian day school. R.C.M.P. officers who have patrolled the reserve have also drawn our attention to the number of children at the south end.\n\nThere are no suitable buildings available, with the exception of the stable; so the provision of a classroom and a teacher's residence would have to be made. In addition, a well is required.\n\nSome time ago the question of moving the Fort a la Corne North school buildings to the south of the reserve was discussed. After serious consideration, it was decided not to proceed with this undertaking. Today the problem is unchanged, as there has been in the North school an enrolment of 15 during the present academic year. The average attendance was never higher than 12 for any one quarter, but the teacher, Mr. Goodman, who is apparently doing good work, reports that eight additional children will be ready for school this coming summer. However, if the reserve is to be reduced in the immediate future by selling a portion of it, this scheme of moving the buildings might be considered, if the north part of the reserve is to be relinquished.\n\nPlease keep these facts in mind during your deliberations, and when you are discussing the question with Mr. Murison, make a recommendation to the Department. At the present writing, there is in the draft of the Estimates for Indian Education 1925-26 an item of $4,000 to build a combined school and teacher's residence at Fort a la Corne South.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

All the children from the James Smith Band, who were in the MacKay Boarding School, were removed to the Elkhorn Boarding School with neither the consent nor knowledge of the parents.\n\n2. The Elkhorn School is too far from Fort a la Corne for visiting children in case of sickness or for holiday travel. The expense being too great.\n\n3. The children have been in ill health since going there & there has been one death & several others are on the sick list.\n\n4. In the event of it being necessary for children from this band to attend a Boarding School, we would wish them to attend a school within the Diocese of Saskatchewan.\n\n5. The Elkhorn Boarding School was misrepresented to the Indians of this band by Mr Ely, the Principal, who gave us to understand that it was an Industrial School.\n\nOn behalf of The James Smith Band,\n\nSigned, [Signature]\nChief James Head\n\nWitness, [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter to you with regard to the depletion of the Day School on Fort la Corne Reserve:\n\nI send you enclosed two statements, the one being the Petition from the Chief and band on the occasion of my visit to the reserve recently for Confirmation, and also the statement of the Teacher of the Day school who put this statement in writing at my request.\n\nThe children of this band have been taken out of the Diocese systematically, those who were at the McKay Boarding school were taken to Elkhorn, as the chief says without their knowledge, and some of them only knew about the removal after the death of one child.\n\nThe others were taken from the Day school with the consent of the chief on the statement that they would be much better off at Elkhorn as it was to be an \"Industrial\" school. Now they know it was not.\n\nI may say that I am very much annoyed at this \"Brigand\" way of dealing with these children. This man Ely, from another diocese and another province, comes into one of our Missions and is told by a Roman Catholic Agent that he is free to do as he likes and take and leave what he pleases. Without any reference to Bishop, Missionary, or teacher these children are taken by misrepresentation to the Indians to a distant school.\n\nThe Agent silences the teacher by the statement that the Church hires him but he the agent fires him and at 24 hours notice too.\n\nThe teacher thinks his school has been purposely depleted in order to give colour of excuse for \"firing\" him. Those he has left are so diseased that during the cold weather they cannot attend school.\nThis man Elys statement that he acted with the authority of \"The House of Bishops\" and of Commissioner Graham, I can of course deal with in another way. He is a clergyman and is subject to the canonical jurisdiction of his Bishop but that is quite aside from this \"pirate\" way of destroying the Day schools in order to fill the Residence schools.\n\nThe school at Mistawasis has been depleted in the same way and it is quite evident to us on the ground that it is part of a systematic attack to extinguish the Day schools in favour of the Residence schools.\n\nThis matter has already come before the Executive Committee of the Diocese and without a single voice in opposition a strong resolution was passed against the action of the M.S.C.C. Committee in Winnipeg in allowing or encouraging these things on the part of their agents.\n\nThat of course must be taken up through Church channels, but the killing of the Day Schools is a serious question for the Department as well, and as such this case is reported to you as a test case representing what we in this diocese consider a vicious tendency behind it viz the draining and then the suppression of the Day Schools on the reserves.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Ely of Elk Horn & the Indian Agent C. P. Schmidt of Duck Lake. They inspected the school & Mr. Ely selected 7 (seven) of my most promising pupils & informed me that he was taking them away to the Reopened Industrial School at Elk Horn. I was not consulted neither was I given the slightest consideration. He informed me that he had his authority from The House of Bishops, which is the reason for my not having written you at the time, & from Commissioner Graham, Regina. Agent C. P. Schmidt informed him in front of me; that he had a free hand to do as he pleased. He had some of the children undress, so that he could examine their condition, & those that were too repulsively diseased he told me I could keep. At this date I had 15 children on the school roll, & the school was being regularly attended. The average attendance for the quarter being 12.25 as my reports will show.\n\nNow, at the time of Mr. Ely's visit, there were at the South End of this Reserve, which is another school district, the school being closed as the buildings have been condemned by the Indian Department, & which is eight or more miles from this school, not less than 40 Indian children of school age, who had absolutely no opportunity of going to school. For reasons best known to himself, he did not take them; they are still running wild & neglected; while my school was robbed of half its pupils.\n\nPrevious to Mr. Ely's visit, Agent C. P. Schmidt removed from my school 4 of my pupils & took them to the Gordon Boarding School.\n\nSince I came here I have done my best to make this school a success & at one time I had 19 pupils attending; but it has never been given a fair trial or chance, as it has been systematically emptied.\n\nThe above is a true & faithful statement & I am prepared to take oath on it.\n\nI remain, My Lord,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nErnest B. Goodman\n(Teacher).\nThe following children were taken from the Fort a la Corne, North Bay School, James Smith Reserve, to the Boarding School at Elkhorn:\n\n- Frederick Head\n- Frank McLean\n- Ida Head\n- Nancy Constant\n- Evelyn Constant\n- Eliza Constant\n- Myrtle McLean\n\n& the following to the Gordon Boarding School:\n\n- Mary Burns\n- Riley Burns\n- John Fox Daniels\n- William Brittain\n\nSigned, Ernest B. Goodman\n(Teacher)\nOttawa, March 12, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant, relative to recruiting the pupils of the Fort a la Corne North Indian Day School for residential schools. At the outset, I wish to assure you that the Department's aim is to maintain whatever schools, both day and residential, are found to be necessary for the training of the youth of our wards. Your Lordship may assure Mr. Goodman, the teacher, that there is no intention of depleting his school and then dispensing with his services. You may also inform the Indians of the James Smith band that the Elkhorn Indian Residential School is an industrial school and that the children are given an education along both vocational and academic lines. The Department has discontinued the use of the words \"Boarding\" and \"Industrial\", but if the old classification still obtained, the Elkhorn school would rank as an industrial one.\n\nWith reference to the general question raised by Your Lordship, I wish to refer you to official letters 160-2 of November 8th and January 9th, last.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

They will both do well in the Day school work but are not suited for a residential staff.\n\nI will send forward a statement of Mrs Bird's qualifications as soon as I receive them, but I know she has the Normal School certificates from Saskatoon Normal School and is thoroughly qualified.

His Lordship informs me that this transfer is at the request of Mr. Goodman. I may add, for your information, that the work on the Sandy Lake Reserve is an important activity, for, in addition to the day school, there is a cottage hospital.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I believe it better to have Mr. Bird appointed as teacher and Mrs. Bird as field matron; but it is understood that Mrs. Bird, who is fully qualified for classroom activity, will take charge there and that she and her husband will divide the field work. Salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month and $480 per annum will be allowed for these two positions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E.

She interviewed the Education authority at Regina, on this matter two years ago. Mrs. Bird has St. John's Home nursing, and has taken St. John's First Aid, but never took her examination, she also holds Drill, drawing, and Voice culture certificates.\n\nDr. Norquay at Battleford was well satisfied with her work amongst the people at Red Pheasant and Stoney Reserves, and I am sure would be willing to give a recommendation if required.\n\nMrs. Bird is willing to take the teaching and matron work, while I look after the Mission work, though I would prefer to take the school, and she help if necessary, as I feel that I have no right to expect her to take what I feel would be the Lion's share.\n\nWould you kindly forward any information with regard to the Mission.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signature) E.

Miss Upsdell is now Mrs Bird.\nInspection of the Pas Indian Boarding School.\n\nFebruary 26th, 1915.\n\nMiss K.S.S. Upsdell, teacher of the Junior room had present 21 girls and 28 boys; a total of 49, all in the First Standard. All the pupils in this room are being grounded in the sounds of the letters and can read small words on the blackboard. The Senior part of the room read sentences well on the blackboard. All this reading and spelling is before recess. After recess this teacher, for one hour takes both rooms in one classroom and teaches the children figures, the making of them, and also the doing of several sums on the blackboard. In Standard I, are all the grades, from knowing absolutely nothing to reading fairly well.\n\nMiss Upsdell is qualified by two years at Goldsmith's Training College, University of London. Had four years of pupil teaching. Has special distinction on teaching and needlework. Has been teaching for five years in England and twelve months at Coblentz, Sask. and at Le Pas School for two months, has no normal training. Has a certificate from the Froebel Institute in London, England, Elementary and Part One of Higher.\n\nInspection of the Pas Indian Boarding School.\n\nJuly 6th, 1915.\n\nJunior Room. Miss K.S.S. Upsdell, teacher. Present at inspection 26 girls and 14 boys. All in the first Standard. All the children are making good progress in reading, writing and Arithmetic. They can all write from dictation and a number can recite from their lesson book. They also sing nicely a large number of pieces. I consider that Miss Upsdell has done a remarkable work in connection with the junior room at this school and very great progress can be noticed since my last visit.\n\nCertified correct.\n\nS.J.

General\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nEnclosed please find statement of the qualifications of Mrs. Bird, formally Miss Upstell.\n\nI have seen each of the certificates and have returned them to the owner. As you see, Mrs. Bird has the full English Training College and only needs one other inspector's report to have that confirmed as a first class. So far she has not been able to get this because she has been for so many years in the Indian work. Possibly now the Public School inspectors are inspecting the Indian Schools, she may be able to get this.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGES/NH\nOttawa, July 30th, 1927.\n\nRight Rev.

E.V. Bird to the position of teacher of the Fort a la Corne North Day School, and that Mrs Bird was receiving the appointment of Field Matron on the reserve.\n\nI have the honour to report that while on James Smith's reserve on the 28th ultimo, I visited the school and met Rev Mr. & Mrs Bird.\n\nWhen I arrived there at about three O'clock, P.M., I found Mr Bird engaged in repairing the fence around the buildings. Mrs Bird was in the classroom teaching. In conversation with them they informed me that Mrs Bird was a qualified teacher for the Province, and that she was the one who was to teach the school, that Rev. Mr. Bird who is doing Missionary work on the reserve was assisting her with her duties of Field Matron, and that should any cases of sickness arise which demanded her personal and immediate attention during class room hours, Mr Bird would take charge of the school during her absence. I replied that this did not agree with Departmental letter referred to above, which I had with me and showed them.\n\nRev. Mr Bird then informed me that he had a letter, which I understood was sent him through his Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan's office at Prince Albert, which stated that the arrangement mentioned above was satisfactory and could be carried out.\n\nAt my request he offered to show me the letter, and while looking for same remembered that it had been returned to the Bishop's office.\n\nMrs Bird informed me that Mr. J.F.

In reply I beg to say that the Department considered it was better to have Mr. Bird appointed as teacher and Mrs. Bird as field matron, on the understanding, however, that Mrs. Bird, who is fully qualified for classroom activity, would take charge there and that she and her husband would divide the field work. When informing you of their appointment in our letter of July 27th, last, it is regretted that the duties each was to perform were not stated.

A. Bird\n\nTeacher or Field Matron\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\n\nREGINA, SASK. July 30th, 1928\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that when on the James Smith's Reserve, in the Duck Lake Agency, I visited the North Day School and noted its condition. There were no pupils present, as the holiday season is now on. There are some minor repairs and decorating to be done on the buildings, but these are being arranged for by Agent Schmidt, who has the necessary authority. I found the grounds in a very creditable condition - clean and tidy. There is a large garden in connection with this school, which I found was being well cared for. The garden stuff is well advanced and gives promise of yielding a good crop of roots and vegetables. These are used during the winter months in connection with a midday lunch supplied to the children.\n\nMrs. E.V. Bird has been appointed Teacher and Field Matron. Her husband is the Anglican Missionary for the reserve and surrounding district. I was under the impression that Mr. Bird was the Teacher, and his wife the Field Matron, but I find this is not in accordance with their appointment, and Mrs. Bird will certainly have her hands full in performing the duties of a Teacher and a Field Matron on this large reserve, and there may be times when one branch of her duties will not receive the attention it should. The Agent was under the impression that Mr. Bird was the Teacher, but this is not stated in his letter of appointment.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency, which were visited and inspected by Mr. Murison during the month of July.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding Mr. & Mrs. Bird. I would judge from the Inspector's report that Mr. Bird is not teaching, nor is he taking any active part on the reserve, other than the work of a Missionary, and I do not know whether he is in the employ of the Department in any capacity or not. I hardly think he could be drawing a salary for acting as a Missionary on the reserve. My reason for making these remarks is that the Inspector states that the work of teaching and attending to the duties of Field Matron falls on Mrs. Bird, and from this I would gather that Mr. Bird is not doing any Departmental work at all.\n\nWith regard to the South Day School, it might be advisable to install a small pipeless furnace in the Teacher's residence, as the house appears to be very small. I could have this installed at a small cost; I cannot give you the exact figure, but it would be around $200.00. If you will give me the necessary authority I will have the Agent proceed with the work. I would also recommend that I be authorized to have a furnace installed in the school, as you will note what the Inspector says regarding the unsatisfactory heating arrangements.\n\n-You will-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nYou will note that Mr. Waite and his wife are doing good work on the John Smiths Reserve, the former as Teacher, and the latter as Field Matron. The soft water tank in their residence should be replaced without delay, and a small sidewalk should be built at the school. The cost of these items will be kept down if the authority is given to provide them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

According to the records Mrs. Bird is not the teacher of this school; Mr. Bird is the teacher, and he, apparently, is devoting his whole time to missionary work amongst the Indians and also in the surrounding district, and it was for this reason the Inspector thought it necessary to bring the matter before the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 305-11 of the 23rd instant, with reference to the services of Mr. and Mrs. Bird at the James Smith Indian Day School. When these workers were appointed, it was clearly pointed out to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan that Mrs. Bird was to supervise the classroom activity of her husband. The pupils of the school will benefit by having Mrs. Bird in the classroom as much as possible; but it is understood that when a woman's services are needed in connection with the field duties, Mr. Bird will carry on the classroom activity.\n\nIf, at any time, you or the inspectors find that either the field work or the teaching is suffering from lack of attention, I should be grateful if you would let me know.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 28, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. PRATT,\n\nPursuant to your telephone inquiry, I have to state that on September 1, 1927, Mr. E. V. Bird was appointed teacher of the Fort a la Corne North Indian Day School at a salary of $600 for the academic year. Mrs. Bird was appointed field matron at a salary of $450 per annum. She possesses better teacher's qualifications than her husband and she directs his classroom activity. The field duties are divided between them. This arrangement was made to allow Mrs. Bird considerable time in the classroom.\n\nI may say that this arrangement is similar to that made in 1920, when Mr. and Mrs. Bird were appointed as teacher and field matron, respectively, at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. Their services were very satisfactory up to the time of their resignation after three years on our staff. In 1923, Mr. Bird was appointed principal of the MacKay Indian Residential School at The Pas. He filled this position with only indifferent success, and last year, when he and his wife offered themselves for day school activity again, the Department was glad to approve of their appointment to Fort a la Corne.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 109-4-1 dated August 28th last, with reference to the services of Mr. and Mrs. Bird at the James Smith Indian Day School, I note that when these workers were appointed it was pointed out to His Lordship, the Bishop of Saskatchewan, that Mrs. Bird was to supervise the classroom activity of her husband. This evidently was not passed on by His Lordship to Mr. and Mrs. Bird as the Inspector has pointed out that Mrs. Bird is performing the whole duties of a teacher and that of Field Matron as well, while Mr. Bird is devoting his whole time to missionary work, mostly outside of the reserve, and drawing a salary from the Government as a teacher.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter you state:-\n\n\"If, at any time, you or the inspectors find that either the field work or the teaching is suffering from lack of attention, I should be grateful if you would let me know.\"\n\nThis is exactly what I have done. The Inspector, in his report, points out that Mrs. Bird has the full responsibility of the teaching, and it is his opinion that one branch of the work must suffer. Therefore these people should be put right as regards their appointment as evidently Mr. Bird has not been correctly informed regarding his position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 13, 1928.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to the activity of the Rev. and Mrs. Bird at the Fort a la Corne North Indian Day School. It is reported that Mr. Bird is devoting his whole time to missionary work, mostly outside of the reserve; and this Department fears that Mrs. Bird will not be able to do full justice to the classroom and to the field matron's position, unless she is given material assistance by her husband. You will remember that, while Mr. Bird was appointed teacher, it was understood his wife, who is well qualified, would take charge of the classroom activity and that she and her husband would divide the field work. When she is occupied with field matron's duties, Mr. Bird should be in the classroom; but it is understood that his activity there will be supervised by his wife. I should be grateful if Your Lordship would inform these workers definitely concerning the Department's intention and wishes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. E. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, October 13, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 305-11 of the 6th instant, with reference to the duties of Rev. and Mrs. Bird at the Fort a la Corne North Indian Day School. I have written to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, pointing out that Mr. Bird has certain definite duties; and I am hopeful that the work will not suffer in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Bird, teacher at the Fort-a-la-Cerne North day school, on James Smith's Reserve and Field Matron for the whole reserve.\n\nAs will be seen this letter addressed to me on July 14th last was received here on the 25th idem but was mislaid and not again seen until a few days ago, hence the reason for the delay in forwarding same which I very much regret.\n\nMrs Bird is a capable teacher and I understand the Inspector of Provincial Schools who examines her work has reported on same very favourably.\n\nIf Mrs Bird devoted her whole time to teaching I would be pleased to recommend an increase of salary, but holding as she does the dual position of teacher at the North end school and Field Matron for the whole reserve (North and South ends) I find that she has too much to do.\n\nRev Mr Bird helps her as much as he can and is a willing worker, but having to substitute for her in both positions is not in my opinion in the best interests of the work.\n\nI consider there is sufficient and plenty of work for a Field Matron on the reserve without having to teach school and it seems to me that the Rev. Mr. Bird is capable of taking full charge of the class room and leave Mrs Bird's time entirely to her field Matron's work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Schmidt\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 16, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 3418-115 of the 9th instant, with reference to the services of the Rev. and Mrs. Bird at the Fort a la Corne North Indian Day School. Please inform these workers that if Mr. Bird would spent practically full time in the classroom - releasing his wife largely for the field matron's duties, the Department would be able to consider a small increase in a few months. Of course, this increase will be allowed only if you are able to report favourably regarding the work that is being done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nFORT A LA CORNE NORTH DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe work here is carried on by Mrs. Bird who, I understand, is qualified as a teacher. Mrs. Bird is also paid as Field Matron, which work cannot help but conflict with her duties as teacher, with the result, as I pointed out to Mrs. Bird, that some of the work suffers. There is no reason why Mr. Bird could not carry on the classroom work and allow Mrs. Bird to be free in order to do the Field Matron's work, and as this is a large reserve, I believe her time could be entirely taken up and we would perhaps see better results.\n\nThe roll calls for 21 pupils, 12 girls and 9 boys. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade I - 8\n\" II - 6\n\" III - 3\n\" IV - 4\n\nThe children\nFORT A LA CORNE NORTH DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe children are improving, but progress is slow. Mrs. Bird puts plenty of vim in her work and one would almost expect better results. However, the children are somewhat irregular in attendance and this no doubt retards progress.\n\nThe children were fairly well clothed, but were not tidy; in fact, I took occasion to point out that many of the children had not even combed their hair. I further noticed that the children sat down to the noon-day meal without washing, although they are provided with wash basins and towels. I had Mrs. Bird send them out to wash. She explained that the children always washed, but had just taken advantage on account of visitors.\n\nThe seats are of the old double type. Mrs. Bird remarked that as she had been unable to secure new seats through the Agent and Inspectors, she had written direct, and I understand new seats are being provided. These should be securely put together and fastened to slats on arrival, as otherwise, they will be knocked about and broken.\n\nThe outside windows were on, but the screens were still lying about outside. Mrs. Bird said they had been left out in order that they might be painted. This was no doubt true, but undoubtedly they had been neglected, and I found two or three broken.\n\nThe school and residence have both been painted this year, and the work is well done.\n\nI was not altogether impressed with the work and conditions about the school, but we can hardly\nFORT A LA CORNE NORTH DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D)\n\nexpect a woman to act as teacher and Field Matron and find both positions satisfactorily filled. Mrs. Bird is a good worker and capable of filling either position, but not both, and it would appear that the only satisfactory arrangement would be for Mr. Bird to assume the duties of teacher and leave Mrs. Bird free to prepare the noon-day meal and attend to the Field Matron duties on the reserve.\n\nI would not wish to convey that the classroom work is greatly suffering, but I do believe the field work is, and I cannot see where the Department are receiving value for the salary paid as Field Matron, which is $480.00 per year. I was informed by a number of the Indian women that Mrs. Bird had not been in their homes for several months.\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Hamilton during the month of November.\n\nI hardly think the Department should be called upon to supply new single seats at the Fort a la Corne Day School when we have perfectly good double desks. Is it the policy of the Department to abandon the double seats in these junior schools and replace them with single seats? You will note that the Inspector was not impressed with the conditions existing at this school. He refers to Mrs. Bird acting as Field Matron as well as Teacher. This, of course, is an impossible situation, and I brought it to the attention of the Department before. It seems to me unfair to the teacher and the Indians to allow this situation to exist. Mr. Bird is employed as teacher and he should carry out his duties, and in the capacity of Field Matron Mrs. Bird will find plenty of work to occupy all her time.\n\nThe children at the Moose Woods School are not doing very well. They are only in the three lower grades and this school has been open for years.\n\nThe report on the Duck Lake Boarding School shows that everything is in good shape. We have always had a good report on this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 20, 1929.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to the services of the Reverend and Mrs. Bird at the Fort a la Corne North Indian Day School. A recent report indicates that Mrs. Bird is not giving sufficient time to the duties of field matron. Will Your Lordship please give instructions that Mr. Bird is to take practically all of the classroom duties, thus releasing Mrs. Bird's time and energy for field work. The Department Inspector reports in part as follows: \"The only satisfactory arrangement would be for Mr. Bird to assume the duties of teacher and leave Mrs. Bird free to prepare the noonday meal and attend to the field matron duties on the reserve. I do not wish to convey that the classroom work is greatly suffering, but I do believe the field work is, and I cannot see where the Department is receiving value for the salary paid to the field matron.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nMy dear Sir:\n\nYour letter of December 20th reached me yesterday, and in reply may I say that I have sent your letter on to Mr. Bird at Fort a la Corne and have asked for his comments on the recommendation made.\n\nI may say that the Rev. Mr. Bird came in to attend a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Diocese the other day, and made a very full statement, the result of which left the impression on most of our minds, that there would be no real solution in that reserve until Mrs. Bertrige from Fort a la Corne is moved to some other reserve.\n\nThere is no very great objection to Mrs. Bertrige herself, she is a good teacher in her school. The trouble seems to lie with her husband, who in conjunction with a Roman Catholic Agent can make lots of trouble for the Clergyman. I think the real trouble lies between the Agent who is a K.C. and the Clergyman who is a K.K. and if that is the real source of the trouble then we shall certainly stand up for the Clergyman as against a K.C. Agent.\n\nI have, however, asked Archdeacon Paul to go fully into the matter on the ground, and to give me a full report as to exactly where the trouble really lies. I am sure I can get a trustworthy report from him.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nGEL/IM\nOn the day I visited this school, May 16th, the teacher, Mr. Bird, had gone to Prince Albert with three Indian children to meet the Principal of the Onion Lake Indian Boarding School. Mrs. Bird accompanied him, consequently the classroom was closed. My impressions were that in cases of necessity where Mr. Bird could not be in the classroom, his place was to have been filled by Mrs. Bird. Apparently such is not the case. The yards were neat, and the buildings presented a good appearance.\nRegina, Sask., June 12th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection made by Mr. Hamilton of the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nJames Smith's Day School\n\nThere is a satisfactory enrolment here.

Schmidt asked if he could use the School for paying Treaty in. I refused on the grounds that as I had spent a lot of time in beautifying the School grounds, and using a lawn mower & keeping the grass like a lawn, that if the whole Reserve came on the grounds, with their dogs, horses, and children, they would leave everything in a mess, & also the people would be spitting all over the place.\n\nI might add there is a Treaty Hall on the Treaty grounds, & also a Farm Instructor's Office, & pointed out that if there had been no other place to pay in, it would have been a different matter.\n\nAgain the seats in the School are not made to stand the weight of adults.\n\nWould you kindly let me know\nif I am justified in refusing, & thus protecting the School Property; for if I had not any say in the matter, I feel the Agent would not have made the request - but made a demand.\n\nI would appreciate your advice in the matter; the Agent has said nothing more in regard to the matter, but there may be a possibility of him forcing my hand, unless I have any advice in the matter.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher.\n\nP.S.\nI note I omitted to mention the conditions the Indians would be in, after such a gathering, as the majority appear to have little respect for Property.\nOttawa, May 12, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the use of the James Smith Indian Day School for paying treaty.

As you know there has been Smallpox quarantine on the Reserve which lifted only on January 9th. I find that Mr. Bird was a pupil teacher in England for two years and has taught in Indian schools for nearly 18 years and that the Inspectors report regarding Mr. Bird's work in the school was satisfactory. In addition Mrs. Bird has her First Class Saskatchewan Teachers Certificate. During the Smallpox trouble I am told that Mr. and Mrs. Bird were indefatigable in their attentions and that the matter was carefully handled.\n\nFor my part I appreciate all that your department is doing for the Indians and for some years I have known of your keen personal interest in the welfare of the Indians. I wish to do everything I can which will advance the work.\n\nMay I ask that you would look over the matter again.

Scott.\n\nChg. Dept. I.A.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your #II-I dated the 16th ultimo which was received here on the 21st inst., informing me that funds would not be available for payment of salaries of the Field Matrons in this Agency during the Fiscal Year 1932-3 and to inform Mrs. E.V. Bird and Mrs. G.J. Waite that they should not remain on duty after March 31st in the expectation that their positions will be restored in the next fiscal year.\n\nOn the day I received your letter March 21st, I immediately wrote Mrs. Bird and Mrs. Waite giving the full text of the Departmental letter and ending with the following paragraph \"Please let me know at your earliest convenience your intention with respect to the last paragraph of the above letter re carrying on your duties.\"\n\nI am now in receipt of a communication from Mrs. Bird which reads:\n\nC.P. Schmidt\nFort-a-la-Corne, Mar 28th 1932\nIndian Agent\n\nDear Sir:\u2014 With reference to yours re the Indian Departments inability to continue the position of the Field Matrons, I beg to state that I shall not continue the duties after April 1st. I would like to know if the \"help\" provided for attending to the children's meals and cleaning of the children's dining room will be continued. The dining room is scrubbed twice a week. I presume as a months notice was given to Field Matron with regard to cessing duties, that a months salary is given.\n\nSigned K.S.S. Bird.\n\nOn the 7th instant when at James Smith's place Mrs. Bird who told me she had ceased work on the 1st April and wanted to know what I intended doing with the medical supplies \"drugs\" she had on hand. Mr. Pollock being with me at the time I asked her to make a list of what she had and give them all to me so I could take them over to the Home Farm Office where Dr. R.C. Merifield's the Medical Attendant. When I saw Dr. Merifield with Mr. Pollock and told him there were the drugs, he said that was all right, that he himself would get along all right.\n\nAs regards the last paragraph of your letter re months salary in lieu of months notice she replied and I replied that the Department would stand by its point and would act accordingly.\n\nI am also in receipt of a communication from Mrs. Waite which reads:\n\nC.P. Schmidt\nIndian Agent\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nC.P. Schmidt  \nIndian Agent  \nDear Sirs - Be yours of Mar 21st\n\nAs long as I have to live on an Indian Reserve I will do what I can for the Indians on that Reserve, but to carry on the duties of Field Matron as I have done for over five years, that is, to give them at least two thirds of my time, would be impossible without payment. I think before I submit myself your letter needs a little more explanation. If I promise to carry on, will all the work of the midday meal be my duty without assistance? If I do not promise to carry on, whose duty will it be to give out medicines? During my time here as Field Matron I have paid for my housework and washing to be done, so as to be able to carry out the duties of the position as well as possible. I must now either do this work myself, or find other ways and means of raising money to pay for it, therefore I could not, as before stated give the Indians two thirds of my time. I am not refusing to carry on, I only wish to be plainly understood that if I carry on I should consider myself a free agent, not bound to write reports or ask permission to leave the reserve whenever I wished to do so. It is not likely that the Indian Dept would expect this, considering the position of Field Matron is dispensed with, and they have no further claim on my time. I have never received any complaints from anyone else in the Dept so consider my work has been satisfactory, reports never adequately explain all that is done for the Indians. I have trusted to results to show this, also to a letter I once read from the Dept that they did not wish a lot of detail. I think this matter i.e., that I no longer hold the position of Field Matron, should be plainly stated to the Chief so that he can notify the whole Band of the step the Department has taken.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nSigned, E.Waite Field Matron.\n\nI have not seen Mrs Waite since receiving her letter. Re giving out Medicines - There is no Farming Instructor on this Reserve. The Medical Attendant Dr.A.Montreuil lives at Prince Albert 18 miles distant, his engagement calls for a monthly visit to the reserve, Indians call at his office quite frequently and he often times sends them back to the reserve with a note (prescription) for their medicines. Rev Mr Waite the Teacher of the Day School on the reserve is allowed $6.00 per month by the Department for issuing rations and clothing to the destitute and sick Indians. There are eight names on the destitute list at present. Note:- In the Auditor General's Report for the year 1928-9 Rev Mr Waite is referred to as \"Dispenser\", in 1929-30 as \"Issuer\".\n\nAs regards the writing of monthly reports and asking permission to leave the reserve, I presume these will not be required in future.\n\nRe the last paragraph of Mrs Waite's letter she refers therein to Chief Robert Bear of John Smith's Band who I have been told, had passed the remark that Mrs Waite was paid to attend to the Indians.\n\nRe both Mrs Bird and Mrs Waite's query re \"Help\" for attending to the children's meals and cleaning of the children's dining room. The Field Matron on James Smith's and John Smith's reserves were allowed assistance to prepare and serve the warm midday meal to all pupils of the day school. Fifty cents was allowed for each day the school was open. This assistance was granted to allow more freedom of time to the Matrons to do their field work or attend to cases which might come to them at their homes during the hours of the preparation of the midday meal.\n\nThe Teachers of the other two day schools of this Agency, Mrs.E.M.Siddons at the Fort-a-la-Corne South Day School on James Smith's Reserve and Miss.H.J.Hare at Moose Woods Sioux Reserve, serve a warm midday meal to the pupils. They are not allowed...\nThe assistance mentioned herein, not being Field Matrons, the older girls attending school assist with the work but are not paid.\n\nAt the three schools where there is a children's dining room, the scrubbing of the floors and the class room floors is done by Indian women who are paid by the Department.\n\nThe point may be raised that Mrs Siddons and Miss Hare are the Teachers and are therefore on duty every school day while in the case of Mrs Bird and Mrs White they are the Teachers wives and not being Field Matrons are free Agents. While not directly stated, the question who is to prepare the midday meal seems to be asked. If paid assistance is granted these two schools will not other Teachers ask for same also. I consider all should be treated alike. I have had no complaints from the schools where paid assistance is not given. I strongly recommend that we continue serving the warm midday meal at all schools of this Agency.\n\nWhen on James Smith's Reserve last week Rev Mr E.V.Bird the Teacher, asked me why the difference in the teachers salaries; $800 at the North End School and $950 at the South End School. I replied I understood the Department engaged the teachers recommended by the Church authorities but did not know who fixed the amount of the salary. He then added I thought it might be higher at the South end because there was no assistance given the teacher for preparing the midday meal.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.P.Schmidt\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopy for Superintendent of Indian Education.\nOttawa, April 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, in regard to dispensing with the services of the field matrons in the Duck Lake Agency as at March 31st, last, and requesting to be advised as to the arrangements that should be made for continuing the preparing and serving of the midday lunch to the pupils at the James Smith and John Smith Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department desires that the serving of the midday lunch to the pupils be carried out and will continue payments to the Indian women at the rate of 50 cents per day for the actual number of days they perform this service. It is considered that these Indian women should be able, with any assistance the wives of the teachers desire to give, together with the help of the older girls, to prepare and serve the meal without difficulty. The Department can allow no payment to the wives of the teachers for this service. You will be good enough to inform the parties interested accordingly.\n\nYou should continue to forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, for the amount due the Indian women in the preparing of the meal and also for any expenses in scrubbing and cleaning.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding the other matters referred to in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. G. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nApril 23, 1932.\n\nMemorandum - Concerning the Services of the Rev. E. V. Bird,\nAt present Teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School.\n\nRev. Mr. Bird was first employed by the Department at the Red Pheasant Indian Day School. He served there for 3 years, 1920-23, with considerable success. He applied for the principalship of the MacKay Indian Residential School and was given a fair trial there, somewhat against the advice of departmental officers. He was relieved of his duties in 1927, and Bishop Lloyd, when nominating him for the James Smith Indian Day School, stated that he had not been a success in the residential institution \"as expected\" (109-4-1). The appointment, of course, had been made by the M. S. C. O. The trouble which led to his removal from the MacKay School was in connection with corporal punishment. Both the Church and the Department investigated, and the Church, on its own initiative, relieved him of his post. (128-1-1).\n\nFrom 1927, Mr. and Mrs. Bird were at the James Smith Indian Day School (Fort \u00e0 la Corne North). In October, 1930, the Church notified the Department that Mrs. Burbridge, teacher of the south end of the reserve, was leaving. A month later, Mrs. Burbridge put up a fight against her retirement and complained of the activities of the Rev. Mr. Bird. (109-9-1). Mr. Bird retaliated in January, 1931, by interesting the Honourable Mr. Weir in his behalf. Further, Mrs. Bird wrote the Superintendent General, complaining of Indian Agent Schmidt (D. M.'s Private File 329) and she wrote the Department, protesting about the procedure in calling the medical officer to the reserve (9-109). In February, the Chief of the Band and the President of the Canadian Legion at Kinistino protested concerning Mrs. Burbridge's dismissal and complained about Mr. Bird. In March, Archdeacon Paul investigated conditions and found the reserve rather divided in its allegiance between the two workers (109-9-1). Mrs. Burbridge left in April, 1931.\n\nIn October, 1931, the Superintendent General asked the Department to remove Mr. Bird from the James Smith Indian Day School and arrangements have been made for him to leave in June, 1932. Bishop Hallam has had an interview with the Superintendent General and it was agreed that he would be transferred to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\nStewart Valley, Saskatchewan,\nMay 23, 1932.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand that there is an opening for a teacher for the Indian School at Forte \u00e0 La Corne. I submit my application for your approval.\n\nI have my Grade Eleven Diploma and nine subjects of Grade Twelve. I attended the Moose Jaw Normal School, and received my Second Class Certificate. I have no experience.\n\nI am a Protestant. I will be twenty-one this year. I am experienced in cooking and would be able to prepare hot dinners for the children.\n\nFor references I recommend Mr. G.A. Brown, Principal of the Moose Jaw Normal School, and Mr. W.A. Beatty, Principal of the Swift Current Collegiate, Swift Current, Saskatchewan.\n\nI visited an Indian School at Forte \u00e0 La Corne, and I am acquainted...\nwith the methods used in teaching the children.\n\nI would be satisfied with the set salary of seven hundred and twenty dollars.\n\nIf I am accepted I shall do my very best.\n\nYours truly,\n\nViolet Catherine Stewart.\nOttawa, May 31, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, applying for the position as teacher at the Fort a la Corne North Indian Day School for the coming school year, and stating the qualifications and experience which you possess.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department looks to His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, under whose auspices the school is conducted, for the nomination of a teacher for this school. I would suggest that you forward your application, with full particulars as to qualifications, etc., to Right Rev. W. T. Hallam, D.D., Bishop of Saskatchewan, Bishopsthorpe, Prince Albert, Sask. I may add that His Lordship was requested to nominate a teacher for this school in time to begin duties at the beginning of the coming school year, or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Violet C. Stewart,\nStewart Valley,\nSask.\nOttawa, July 13th, 1932.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nI desire to refer you to your telegram of February 25th and official telegram of March 2nd, last, in connection with the services of Reverend Mr. Bird as teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School.\n\nIt was understood at that time that Rev. Mr. Bird would relinquish his duties on the James Smith Reserve on June 30th, last, and would be transferred to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nPlease advise if those interested have been notified and, at the same time, I would appreciate your submitting your nomination of a teacher for the James Smith Indian Day School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRt. Rev. W. T. Hallam, D. D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nPRINCE ALBERT.\n\nAugust 1/32\n\nMy dear Mr. MacKenzie:\n\nReferring to your letter of July 18th re James Smith Indian Day School, some weeks ago I forwarded my nomination of Mrs. Amy McFarlane as teacher for this school to the late Mr. Russell Perrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, with references from the physician and the chairman at Onion Lake Day School where she has been teaching for a year and a half. Mrs. McFarlane is a widow who has a grown-up daughter living with her, who has been a great help to her. Mrs. McFarlane has a First Class Professional Certificate of Manitoba and has an excellent record as a teacher. I recommend her with confidence. A missionary is to be appointed to the Reserve Church so Mrs. McFarlane will be dependent on your salary which I hope will be generous.\n\nRev. E.V. Bird who was formerly teacher at this school prefers to seek some other work than that of teaching if he can possibly find it, so in due time I shall submit another nomination for the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI was grieved to read of the sudden passing of Mr. Perrier. He will be much missed in the affairs of the schools and I am sure you will miss him in the office.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 5, 1932.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 1st instant, regarding the nomination of Mrs. Amy MacFarlane as teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School which you forwarded the late Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we have been unable to find your letter among Mr. Ferrier's papers. However, in December, 1930, Archdeacon Paul nominated Mrs. MacFarlane as teacher of the Fort \u00e0 la Corne South School, and enclosed a communication from the Principal of the Provincial Normal School in Winnipeg stating her qualifications. These are satisfactory, and the Department will approve of Mrs. MacFarlane as teacher of the James Smith School, to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, on September 1st, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10 percent for the current fiscal year. This is the same salary as was allowed the teacher at this school previous to the appointment of the Rev. Mr. Bird. It is noted that a missionary is to be appointed to this reserve, and that Mrs. MacFarlane will, therefore, be able to devote her entire services to the school activity.\n\nI shall be pleased if Your Lordship will inform Mrs. MacFarlane of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties on the date above mentioned. Mr. Agent Schmidt, Duck Lake, is being informed of her appointment and requested to give her every assistance he can in her work and in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children. It is hoped that she will meet with every success.\n\nWith reference to a teacher for the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School, it is noted that you will submit a nomination in due time.\n\nYour Lordship's kindly reference to the late Mr. Ferrier is appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRt. Rev. W. T. Hallam, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsporche,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6284, file 608-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has nominated the services of Mrs. Amy MacFarlane as teacher of the James Smith Indian Day School to succeed Rev. R. V. Bird. Mrs. MacFarlane has a second class professional certificate for the Province of Manitoba and has had previous teaching experience. The Department is approving of her appointment, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10 percent for the current fiscal year. She is to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, on September 1st, next. I have to request that you will give Mrs. MacFarlane every assistance you can in the work and also in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nFort-a-la-Corne North Day School\n\nThis school is situated at the North end of the James Smith's Reserve. I visited it in the forenoon of March 10th.\n\nThe day was cold and a strong wind was blowing. I arrived at the school at 9:30 a.m. and found it warm and comfortable. There were 9 boys and 5 girls present out of an enrollment of 17. The ages of the children ranged from six to thirteen years. The different classes were examined in reading and they spoke in an audible voice and I considered the reading good. The children in the primary class were questioned regarding daily life and appeared quite bright. They answered questions without hesitation. The average attendance for the week of my visit was 14.\n\nThe children's hands and faces were clean and their clothing, although not new, was clean and I considered they were warmly clad.\n\nThe teacher, Mrs. McFarlane, I would judge, is well qualified to teach Indian children. Her manner is kindly and I am of the opinion that she is really interested in the children and sympathetic towards them. I may say that I had previously come in contact with Mrs. McFarlane at Onion Lake where she taught a white school, which the children of Departmental employees attended. She was highly spoken of there and her departure from the school to take up Indian work was a matter of deep regret in that community.\n\nMrs. McFarlane informs me that she is making preparation to plant a large garden and hopes to grow sufficient roots and vegetables to enable her to supplement the warm drink which has been allowed by the Department.\n\nI found the school clean, but it is in need of redecoration. The cross light spoken of by Inspector Piercy, I am of the opinion, can be eliminated to a large extent, if not altogether, by providing dark blinds for the windows in the end of the classroom. I found the school clean and tidy. It is heated by a furnace. The radiation provided in connection with this furnace is different from any I have seen. The teacher informs me that...\ninforms me that she had difficulty at first in operating it and wrote to the Manufacturers, asking for instructions and since receiving full instructions from them she has had no difficulty in keeping the school warm. At the time of Inspector Piercy's visit she said she was having difficulty and on really cold windy days the school was not comfortable, but that condition has now been overcome.\n\nI was very pleased indeed with conditions as I found them at this school. I would however be very reluctant to have anything I have said construed as a criticism of Inspector Piercy's report and will give him credit for reporting conditions as he found them, but I would say that conditions today I feel would not justify such severe criticism as he made. A very great change must have taken place in as much as I found things quite satisfactory. Here, as at other Reserves where day schools are in operation, the attendance is effected at times by cold weather, sickness, and in a few instances by the indifference of parents. The Indians have been well warned that a punctual and regular attendance is essential if the school is to be kept in operation for their benefit.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report on the affairs of this agency for the month of June 1933.\n\nEDUCATION SCHOOLS\n\nOn John Smith's and James Smith's reserves a number of the Indians expressed the desire to send their children to the residential schools at Onion Lake, Gordons and File Hills. I enquired why they did not continue sending them to the day schools on the reserve, in most cases the reply was, \"We are poor (hardup) and cannot clothe our children properly, during the winter months,\" some said they had a hard time providing sufficient food for their families.\n\nC. P. Schmidt.\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to our discussion pertaining to the Day Schools on the James Smith's Reserve near Fort \u00e0 la Cerne, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThe teachers of these two schools, namely Mrs Amy McFarlane and Mrs E.M. Siddons are both getting on in years, and are not suited for this work.\n\nI agree with you that we should employ married couples who are Social Service workers as teachers in these schools.\n\nMr. Jones the Farming Instructor on this Reserve has informed me that a great deal of his time is taken up in being called upon by the present teachers as they have no man to do odd repair jobs. He states that he can hardly refuse all the requests as they are in many instances unfitted for work of this nature. He has a large Reserve to supervise, and he or no other Farming Instructor should have to be called upon to act as handy man or chore boy to the teachers of Day Schools.\n\nI strongly recommend that a change be made here as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDexter T. Robertson,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. S. H. Simpson, Agent at Duck Lake, with reference to the Day School Teachers on the James Smith's Reserve.\n\nI fully agree with Mr. Simpson that the services of these teachers be dispensed with at the end of June next.\n\nMy recommendations in connection with this reserve are that the North Day School be closed for the present; that a married, male, teacher be appointed for the South School capable of doing social service work; and that a van be operated to bring the children to school from the North. The Farming Instructor is situated at the North end of the Reserve and with a good male teacher at the South end, the Reserve would be well supervised. It is a large Reserve, as you know. At a later date, the question might be gone into of establishing a manual training department in the North School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJune 36 - 15 8\nSept 36 - 13 5\nOct 36 - 13 8\nMar 37 - 12 7\n\n[Handwritten]\naged 58\n\n[Handwritten]\nin actual service\nOttawa, May 15th, 1937.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Saskatchewan, forwarded a letter from the Indian Agent at Duck Lake with reference to the James Smith's and Fort-a-la-Corne South Indian Day Schools.\n\nAs you are aware, Mrs. Amy McFarlane is the present teacher at James Smith's School, while Mrs. E. M. Siddons is in charge of the Fort-a-la-Corne South School.\n\nOur Agent and Inspector point out that both these ladies are advancing in years and, as a result, are not capable of handling their schools in the manner which the Department has a right to expect. I feel you will agree with me that, when there are so many qualified teachers available, we should, in the interests of our wards, secure the best possible teaching services. This is especially true at the present time when we are endeavouring to bring our course of study more in conformity with the actual needs of the children.\n\nThe Department would, therefore, appreciate your advising Mrs. McFarlane and Mrs. Siddons that their services will not be required after the end of the current academic year, namely, June 30th, next.\n\nFor the\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul, M.A., LL.D.,\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nCopies of this letter sent to Inspector Thos. Robertson & Indian Agent Simpson.\nFor the Fort-a-la-Corne South School, we would like to secure a married man but a female teacher will be satisfactory for the James Smith's School. Both teachers should be fully qualified and should understand that, in addition to teaching the academic subjects, the Department expects that some vocational training be given both boys and girls, as well as a reasonable amount of community service for the older Indians. Our idea in the latter regard is to bring the older Indians into closer relationship with the school activity.\n\nIn nominating teachers for the two schools mentioned, you should select two or three for each school and have them interview Indian Agent Simpson, who is fully conversant with local conditions on each reserve and is in a good position to decide which teacher nominated by you is best qualified for the respective schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. R. J. Paul, M.A., LL.D.,\nArchdeacon of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing copy of a communication received from Indian Agent Simpson with reference to the teachers at the James Smith's and Fort-a-la-Corne South Indian Day Schools.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon Paul is being written and requested to nominate a married man for the Fort-a-la-Corne South School and a female teacher for the James Smith's School. It is felt inadvisable to close the James Smith's School this year. Our experience in driving pupils a considerable distance has shown that this becomes an expensive procedure and that the results are by no means satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Madam,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to your dismissal as teacher of the James Smith's Indian Day School.\n\nI regret that it is not possible to make any change in the decision that has already been reached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

McFarlane,\nJames Smith's Indian Day School,\nFort-a-la-Corne, Sask.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the James Smith's Indian Day School, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received today from Mrs. Amy M. McFarlane.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hesey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc. 1.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 11th, instance, enclosing Mrs McFarlane's request to be retained as teacher at the Fort a la Creme North School, for another year.\n\nWhile at this Reserve last week I interviewed Mrs McFarlane, she advised that she had written to you and also to Mr. Hey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Ottawa. She also stated that her son-in-law had lost his position as teacher in the Leask Agency.\n\nThe Venerable Archdeacon Paul called to interview me last Thursday in connection with the teachers on this Reserve. He has apparently gone to considerable trouble to find suitable employees to fill the occurring vacancies there, and advised that to date he had only been successful in finding one. I requested him to let the matter stand for the time being in so far as the North School was concerned.\n\nI have no fault to find in Mrs McFarlane's school work. However I do find that she is not suitable for the class of work required on this Reserve.\n\nIn view of the unfortunate circumstances pertaining to this case, and the fact that Mrs McFarlane in my opinion has given her best while in the Service, I recommend that her request be given favourable consideration.\n\nIf the Department see fit to grant this, I would ask that it be distinctly understood that her daughter and son-in-law are not to live on the Reserve with her.\n\nMrs McFarlane's letter is herewith returned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.H.

H. Simpson, attached thereto.\n\nI may state, for your information, that on June 15th I sent forward a letter to Mrs. McFarlane, in which I stated:\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to your dismissal as teacher of the James Smith's Indian Day School. I regret that it is not possible to make any change in the decision that has already been reached.\"\n\nYou will remember that a notice of dismissal was sent to these teachers through Archdeacon Paul, in response to a request for a change of teachers on this reserve, recommended by Mr. Simpson in his letter to you of May 4th. I cannot see any valid reason why the decision already reached by the Department should be modified at this date. This attitude may seem harsh, but we must keep in mind that we are primarily responsible for the welfare of the Indian population and for the betterment of conditions on the reserve. The Indian Agent, who is familiar with local conditions, stated very definitely that these teachers are no longer rendering the service that should be rendered on the reserve and that a change is desirable. No difficulty\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nshould be experienced in obtaining fully qualified and capable teachers, in view of the hundreds of teachers that are out of employment at this time.

I have taught five years on the James Smith Reserve and two years at Onion Lake. In both places my work has been judged more than good by the Provincial Inspectors. For the five years on James Smith Mr. Percy P. D. Ministry was delighted with the progress of my pupils and has told me more than...\nOnce that the children were a credit to me and an example for many white schools.\n\nI asked the reason for my dismissal but none was given. I love the work with the Indian children and cannot feel contented to give it up. If there is no valid reason for my dismissal is it possible for me to get another day school?\n\nIs it not customary when a teacher is dismissed for us to have three months salary in addition to the dismissal? If so, please could I have it as I had nothing saved up and the notice to go came as a bolt from a clear sky.\n\nIn asking for another\nschool I would like to say I am healthy, never having lost for sickness one day in the seven years. I have eight more years before I reach the age limit.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Amy McFarlane\nOttawa, October 19, 1937.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of October 8th with reference to your services as teacher at the James Smith Indian Day School.\n\nAs the Department dispensed with your services at the end of the academic year, it is not considered that it was necessary to give you three months notice.

J.A. Creer,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I take the liberty of drawing to your attention a very unfair and unfortunate situation as regards teachers in your Indian schools in Saskatchewan. I am writing on behalf of myself and several others.\n\nWith your Dept. trying to improve the standard of teaching in Indian schools and insisting that teachers possess a Prov. Certificate, several teachers like myself have left the Provincial service to work under your Dept. But in so doing we are deprived of years of effort in preparing for self-support in our old age and that we will not be on relief or old age pensioners, in that we find that we are not able to continue under the Provincial Teachers' Superannuation, and as we are classified as Temporary employees under your department, do not come under the Civil Service Act of the Dominion.\nTaking my own case as a typical example, I have a lack. First Class Permanent Cert - and am working for my Superior First - have years of service credited towards the number required for superannuation under the last Act - since 1924, and have contributed again without a break, since 1930 to the Provincial Fund. Yet because I have moved a few miles to an Indian School, I must withdraw from the Act, and lose credit of 16 years of teaching service.\n\nWe do feel that we must possess proper back. Certs. 2 Teach the back curriculum 3 Be reported upon by Saskatchewan school Inspectors, etc., in fairness, if a teacher already under the back superannuation Act enters your Dept.'s service, it should be possible for him to continue under the Provincial superannuation scheme.\n\nCould it not be arranged for the treasury department to withhold 4% of our salary and forward to Regina? Either allowing us to contribute to the Provincial scheme, or the civil service scheme, will prevent an exodus of qualified teachers from Indian schools, back into the Provincial schools, when\nthe educational affairs of the Province\nand salaries return to somewhat nearer\nconditions of a few years ago.\nEither the Provincial or Dominion\nSuperannuation scheme, will promote\nsatisfaction and make for more permanency\namongst the qualified teachers who\nare now entering Indian school work.\nSincerely trusting something will\nbe done soon, and assuring you\nthat all the above suggestions are\nrespectfully submitted,\n\nI remain\nYour obedient servant,\nWillis A. Nickford\nOctober 17, 1938.\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nThe attached (Oct. 8) from Willis A. Richford, teacher at North Indian Day School, James Smith Reserve, Fort a la Corne, Kinistino, Sask., is referred to the department for attention.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor attention of your Branch.\nOttawa, October 19, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of October 8, addressed to the Honourable T. A. Crerar, Minister of this Department, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI may state that the desirability of establishing a superannuation fund, to which Indian day school teachers would contribute and from which they would be eligible for allowances, has been reviewed by departmental officials on a number of occasions in recent years. The obstacles, however, standing in the way of the establishment of such a fund are, in my judgment, for the time being at least, almost insurmountable.\n\nI was responsible, a few years ago, for the establishment of a superannuation fund for teachers in the province of Manitoba, and I entered this Department two years ago, hopeful that a worthwhile fund could be established here.\n\nMay I point out that approximately 50% of Indian pupils are enrolled at residential schools, operated by certain churches, in cooperation with the Department. The principals and teachers responsible for instruction in these institutions are employed, not by the Government, but by the churches. A large majority of Indian day schools are also operated by the Government, in close cooperation with the churches. The records here disclose that 50% of the Indian population in Canada belong to the Roman Catholic Church. This means that a great many of our Indian day schools, particularly in eastern Canada, are in charge of teachers -\n\nWillis A. Richford, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nJames Smith Indian Day School,\nKinistino, Sask.\nteachers who are members of religious Communities or religious Teaching Orders. These religious Orders, I understand, have made provision for the care and welfare of their members in the declining years of their lives, with the result that these Sisters would not be at all interested in a superannuation fund to which they would be compelled to contribute.\n\nYou may be interested to learn that the average period of time spent by our teachers in Indian day schools is a little less than five years. This means that a great many young unmarried women seek and secure positions as Indian day school teachers with the object of getting married in the course of a few years. These girls would hesitate to contribute to a fund such as the Civil Service Superannuation Fund, if they were informed that no contributions would be returned until they had spent at least ten years in the service of the Government.\n\nI am personally of the opinion that, in order to qualify for superannuation, Indian day and residential school teachers would have to become permanent Civil Servants as defined by the Civil Service Act. In view of all the circumstances, however, the chance of our Indian day and residential school teachers becoming permanent Civil Servants, appointed after qualifying by competitive examination, is very remote indeed.\n\nThere is a widespread feeling that Indian day school teachers are, somehow or other, discriminated against by the Government, in that the teachers do not qualify for superannuation. May I state that there are thousands of individuals in the Service of the Government, none of whom qualify under the Superannuation Act. I have in mind temporary Civil Servants employed for years either at Ottawa or in the outside service - post masters throughout the Dominion, temporary light-house keepers and a number of others. These claim - and I think rightly so - that their case should be given consideration before any attempt -\nattempt is made to review the claims of, say, residential school teachers, who are not even employed by the Government. My personal sympathies, of course, are all with the teachers, but I think you will readily appreciate the difficulties confronting the officials when the matter is referred to them for consideration.\n\nI may state, however, that the salaries paid throughout the Dominion to Indian day school teachers in recent years, when free housing accommodation is taken into account, have been almost double the salaries paid to public school teachers. I am not suggesting that the salaries paid are too high, but I do think this fact should be kept in mind, in fairness to the Dominion Government, when a superannuation scheme, or schemes, come up for consideration.\n\nIt is my hope that you may have an opportunity of discussing this matter with Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, province of Saskatchewan. Dr. Robertson is reasonably familiar with the attempts we have made to solve this problem and would, I feel sure, be glad of an opportunity to discuss the matter with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. W. A. Richford, Teacher at the North Indian Day School, James Smith's Reserve, Duck Lake Agency, has approached me with regard to an increase in salary, at least to equal that being paid at the South School.\n\nI might say that Mr. Richford holds a First Class Permanent teacher's certificate. He has been teaching at the North School since September 1st, 1938. During this time the enrollment has increased from 14 to 28, with 24 pupils frequently in regular attendance. He is active in manual training work among the pupils, also has carried this work to the younger men of the reserve, who have formed a young men's club which has become very active under his supervision.\n\nMrs. Richford has also been very active in supervising sewing, knitting, health, cleanliness, etc. She conducts at least two meetings a month, attended by the women of the reserve, and instructs them along these lines.\n\nThis school is located 24 miles from the nearest town and has twice as many pupils attending as the South school, which is 12 miles from Kinistino.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Richford are, I think, the type of teachers we require on our reserves, and I would recommend, if funds are available, that this request be granted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1944.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to Mrs. McLeod giving up duties at the James Smith Day School at the end of the current month. Her resignation is accepted and the Indian Agent will be informed accordingly.\n\nI note your suggestion that Mrs. Ahenakew be engaged on a temporary basis and, if you are unable to secure a better qualified teacher, we approve of her temporary appointment, but it should be understood that if at any time within the next few months the services of a qualified teacher become available she will be prepared to relinquish the school without objection. In any case I feel that you will agree that she should not be retained after June 30, 1946. We have been allowing the preceding teacher $85 a teaching month, but I feel that $75 a teaching month, plus bonus, should be sufficient for Mrs. Ahenakew. There will be no deduction for income tax, as she is an Indian working on a reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nRt. Rev. H.D. Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1944.\n\nMr. N.J. McLeod, Acting Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nI am advised by Bishop Martin that Mrs. Ida McLeod, teacher of the James Smith Day School, finds it necessary to give up her duties at the end of the current month. We are advising Bishop Martin that her resignation is accepted.\n\nOwing to the difficulty in obtaining a qualified teacher, we have decided to accept the Bishop's recommendation regarding the temporary employment of Mrs. L. Ahenakew. In this connection I enclose, for your information, a copy of our letter to Bishop Martin. I enclose the necessary forms which you should have Mrs. Ahenakew complete and return. It is understood that her employment will be effective from January 1, 1945.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File":
