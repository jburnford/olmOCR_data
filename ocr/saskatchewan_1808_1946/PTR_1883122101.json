The world around us is filled with cheerfulness and happiness, and we trust that the coming year will be as good as the past.\n\nAnd what can we say that is new on this time-honored Feast? Nothing, absolutely nothing. We have heard of no new developments or discoveries at this season. There is nothing new under the sun, nor ever has been, except perhaps in the hearts of men. We trust that the coming year will bring us peace and happiness, and we look forward to a better future.\n\nJ. O. DAVIS & CO.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES\n\nWe regret that Attorney General Miller of Manitoba has gone to Toronto to meet Premier Macdonald by invitation to discuss matters of importance to both provinces and parliament.
