J. Bradley.\n(Q.S. Department, Secretary.)\n\nPREPARING.\n\nWe learn from authentic sources\nthat the Government is taking every\nnecessary measure to ensure the safety, life and property of the\nsettlers against any probable In-\ndians uprising. It is reasonably to be\ninferred from announcements that are now quietly going forward that\nit is the intention of the Govern-\nment to disarm the Indians, and put them under such surveillances\nas will prevent their being able to\nreduce us to quietness. Certainly\nnothing greater ever has been done to\nforestall the inevitable than what is\nbeing done by the authorities at\npresent. It is sufficient to know that the members of the Gov-\nernment are doing all they can to\nsecure the safety of the settlers. The\nDepartment does not bind itself to\nattribute this act to any particular\ncause, but does urge everyone to do\nits part in preserving peace and\norder.\n\nCorrespondence.\n\nTo the Editor.\n\nSir -- As many who were not at\nSchool last meeting on Tuesday last,\nwere unable to procure the news-\npaper, we are induced to inform\nyou that although the society\nhave made proper arrangements\nto purchase a new member, said\nperson may be prevented.\nW.

J. Bradley.\n(Q.S. Department, Secretary.)\nTHE INCONSISTENT LEADER.\n\nIn a whole column and a half the Leader has again raised some important issues to members of the North-West Council. We extract the following from the article referred to:\n\n\"Their (the government's) unsubstantiated confidence in the Indian Commissioner over-awed in the Department of Indian affairs and then voted for a measure containing provisions that may be construed and mis-construed to weigh the meaning of a certain sentence offending the honor of every man loyal to His Majesty in any of his capacities. They expressed readiness to vote for any measure adverse to the Dominion government on a specified subject. This course they withdrew and admitted that the measure in which it was left in doubt whether they intended to pass or blame the government. They two by two by a club rule motion they unconditionally declared their confidence in the government. A few days before, by a slender minority and an ill founded clause they had said to come.\"\n\nThis is quite different from the position taken by the Leader a few weeks ago. When the Council passed the motion approving of the action of the Government in carrying out the sentence against Rich, that paper and the Conservative claimed the Government was all blame in connection with the late rebellion. In this connection the opinion of one of the members of the committee was valued. That was held by the other day Mr. W. D. Perley, M. N. W. C., was asked whether it was his intention in moving the Resolution that the Committee should consider the administration of the government all blame in connection with the late rebellion, as stated by the Leader. He replied as follows:\n\n\"At the opening of the late session of the North-West Council, the Lieutenant-Governor made an elaborate speech, in which all questions affecting the territories were dealt with, and it was the duty of the Council to make a reply to it. He was appointed on the spot to make such an address as he thought best. When the council met, Mr. Seaton, Mr. Hughes, and himself were nominated as sub-committee to consider the address. They first objected saying it was hardly fair that three new members should be required to perform what was a duty. But upon being pressed, he consented as he was determined to do something. He then asked for a representative of the people to be appointed to the committee. The Lieutenant-Governor spoke very carefully and finally closed the debate and concluded to prepare a reply that it was very soon referred to him. The Dominion government, however, ignored the members of the Council on the question affecting the habitants and Indians of the West. The Government has been so tardily dealing with these questions that they felt it necessary to give them a new life. They felt it necessary to tell the Government that they should not have been delayed in doing this and that the question, and that they should not have kept the people in an uncertain state during this critical period. The Government has been slow in dealing with the question, and that they should not have kept the people in an uncertain state during this critical period. The Government has been slow in dealing with the question, and that they should not have kept the people in an uncertain state during this critical period.\n\nSIR JOHN MACDONALD IN NEWFOUNDLAND.\n\nThe London, Edinburgh, Standard says\u2014The Transcanada Company paid a deserved tribute of respect to Sir J. Macdonald yesterday, in presence of the Governor-General. Mr. Perley went on to show that the leader of the party not only rejected the motion but also refused to consider the question of the habitants and Indians of the West. The Government has been so tardily dealing with these questions that they felt it necessary to give them a new life. They felt it necessary to tell the Government that they should not have been delayed in doing this and that the question, and that they should not have kept the people in an uncertain state during this critical period.\n\nNOTES AND COMMENTS.\n\nAcross the line they are having big times with snow blocks across the mainways, traffic being suspended for days together. On the C. P. R., in the Northwest a snow blockade is almost unknown. The report that was circulated that the Dominion Parliament would be dissolved and a general election take place was not met by the Government. The completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway will place the region when the weather is favorable, in a state of great prosperity. The Conservative party has been given representation in the Council and Senate. It is now seen, however, that the government has introduced a good effect upon the country.

They are so similar in appearance that they are often mistaken for each other. The tree whose leaf is nearly white (lycopsis) is a native of Europe, while the other is a native of Asia. When they are discarded in any way, these trees are so similar that they can be used in this country without confusion. The tree that is known as the poplar shade is a native of Asia, and has been introduced into our country by the Dutch. It is a slow growing tree, and is often planted as a shade tree. It is said to be very hardy, and will grow in almost any soil.\n\nPublic Notice.\n\nLEGISLATURE OF MANITOBA.\n\nRECENT DELAYS IN THE NOTICES FOR PRIVATE BILL.\n\n64.

Suther- land, that all present should be allowed to speak on whichever side of the question they chose, and that such a vote would assist the council in ascertaining what the sentiment of the parish is.\nSpeeches were made by Messrs.
