Bell has written a most interesting book, at this time, on our northern waters, being a report most ably drawn up, regarding the Hudson's Bay and Straits, for the Winnipeg Club of which Mr. Bell published it for them. The subject is handled in a concise and clear manner, enumerating the resources in minerals, fisheries, timber, furs, game and other products. Also copious notes on the navigation, together with historical events and meteorological and climatic data. Mr. Bell says\u2014\"It does not seem to be generally known that the provisions bodies of the British regular troops have been brought from England in sailing vessels through Hudson's Straits and Bay, landed at York Factory, and proceeded by land to Fort Garry. In 1846, 353 persons arrived at York Factory on the 7th of August, and proceeded on to Fort Garry, which they reached in thirty days time, without any casualties. Thousands have traveled by this route in perfect safety, and it speaks volumes in favor of the safe navigation of our northern waters.\"\nThe country is stated to produce wheat, red and pitch pine, black and white spruce, balsam, larch, white cedar and white birch. Which could be easily shipped by sea-going vessels as the northern waters converge to meet the head of James Bay.\nIn 1875 large deposits of rich ironstone was found on the Mattagami River, also at various times and places inexhaustible supplies of manganiferous iron ore, lead, copper, gold, silver, molybdenum and copper were also noted on the east main coast. Lignite, gypsum and petroleum bearing limestone was met with. Good building stone, clay and lime stones are on both sides of the Bay and many other minerals too numerous to mention here.\nBesides the whale, cod and salmon fisheries, the waters of Hudson Bay, and the river Mattagami, contain abundant stores of oil-fisheries and edible fish. Dr. Bell reports finding the pike, perch, herring, whitefish, trout, sea trout, sculpin and eel, bear, moose, trout in their proper waters. White porpoise abound, and the walrus and narwhal are killed in considerable numbers.\nIn conclusion Mr. Bell says\u2014\"We have here a very fine Dominion, an immense inland sea, which never freezes over, and is open for navigation for at least five or six months, if not during the whole year. This great body of salt water has everything that is a large number of stems, many of which are navigable by large river steamers for long distances inland; they are well stocked with the finest edible fish, plenty of game, plenty of fish, and plenty of timber, much of which is valuable for export. The islands of the Bay and many localities on the mainland are rich in mineral deposits, ready for immediate exploitation. Feathers are so plentiful, that at a single nest 50 eggs are killed in the autumn, as the year's supply. Vegetables are raised at all the forts in the southern part, and at some of those in the north. Horses, cattle, etc., are kept, and an abundance of food is available.\"\nAt present these harbors are frequently visited by ships, and for years sailing vessels of all descriptions from the pinnacle of twenty tons to the seventy-five gun man-of-war have been seen in these waters passing through the straits and across the Bay. Should we not, as Canadians, anxious for the full development of the great natural resources of our country, take what nature offers to us freely, and make use of her bountiful gifts?\nA NEW INDUSTRY.\nA new industry bids fair to start up in Montreal connected with the export meat trade. A number of capitalists have studied the manner in which beef specially prepared for the English market is sent from England. A few days ago twenty bullocks were slaughtered at the Dominion abattoir, and their carcasses prepared by the new process, and shipped to the old country. If this method should prove a success, it is the intention to form a company in Montreal, whence large shipments of both beef and mutton prepared fresh by the new process, will take place. Not only is Great Britain, but distant stations on the C. P. R., that Company having promised large orders for the supply of meat employed in the line of the railway, in the line of the way places, where fresh meat, and especially beef, is now difficult to procure. The process is kept a profound secret at present.\nAs a result, presumably, of agitation against perpetual imprisonments, the British Government have arranged with the Duke of Marlborough to commute for $10,000 annually to the Duke of Marlborough a pension of $4,000, which was originally granted to the victor of Waterloo, which has been paid annually to the Duke of Marlborough for 174 years. At the same time a pension of a like amount, which was granted to William Penn for services rendered, has been commuted by a payment of \u00a367,000 to the present representatives of the family.\n\nJAMES SINCLAIR\nMerchant Tailor,\nand Dealer in\nGENTS' FURNISHINGS.\nWATCHES,\nCLOCKS,\nJEWELLERY,\nSTATIONARY.\n\nR.

I am sure that every one in the same situation, thinks that if the authorities of that body instead of allowing the members of that body to be bullied by their reporters, were to turn their attention and endeavor to maintain the best possible relations existing between the Home and Foreign Mission Committees, and obtain the proper recognition of the claims of those who have valid titles to the lands sold by them, it would be much more satisfactory to the general public and more in accordance with their sense of justice.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nP. B. DOUGLAS.\nOttawa, June 3, 1884.\n\nTERRITORIAL NEWS.\n\nLOT OWNER.\n\nTo the Editor of The Times.\n\nSir,\u2014Regarding unwilling to engage in newspaper discussion, I must ask for patience to make a few remarks on an article which appeared in your paper in the last issue of your paper.\n\nI wish to state very distinctly that the Presbyterian Church at Prince Albert are not to be held responsible for a thoughtless expression, which happened to be published about Edmonton, and by so doing, has caused the most serious damage to a journal published in Montreal. The writer of that letter received nothing but condemnation from all quarters, and was living here. The Presbyterians of Prince Albert have no feelings but those of regret over such a mistake, and have been connected with the College, and still deeply regret if in any way expressing themselves, they have injured or impaired the good name of your paper.\n\nIt is very absurd for any one to express, that in any locality, whether in the Western Territories, should be equal to those of older foundation, richly endowed, and fully equipped for the work required by the supporters of that body. Continental colleges may compare favorably even with those of the Eastern provinces; but that fact, however, is certainly borne high testimony to the energy and spirit of those who brought it into existence, and who are still engaged in, within its walls, the work of higher education.\n\nIn reference to the school which the Presbyterians are now undertaking to establish in the town, I may say that I am not aware that any other school in the town could be called \"school,\" or superior to any other institution of the same kind. We expect, if successful, in a very short time, to begin the modern teaching as far as work as possible with the pupils who may come to us, and we shall feel very proud of our success. I quite evidently see that no true Presbyterian amongst us will ever fail to give expression to the views which he holds, and I am glad by the reporter, \"thinking God that we or our institutions are better than our neighbors.\"\n\nWhen the Presbyterians here afford assistance to the members of M.M.C., and do not try to force their own opinions and demands from their (local) Assembly in order to establish in the town a school which will be attended by students from throughout the district, I do not think they need be afraid that any of their fellow citizens will oppose the continuance of these efforts, as they are found in such a style in the local newspapers.\n\nP.M. MacWILLIAM.\nPrince Albert, June 10, 1884.\n\nThe statement appeared in the Presbyterian Record, and was directed against the Presbyterian Church, therefore those who are responsible for circulating it are fools and liars. It has been officially denounced by us, it would appear, and is most uncharitable. Our paragraph refers only to the Presbyterian Record, and pertains to the contents thereof, and we are assured in a number of the clubs. The above explanatory letter shows how unnecessary it was to publish the first, and we are sure that no alliance being made to our fellow citizens, or contempt was shown toward any member of the North West press, as when we will help a friendly eye.\u2014Ed.\n\nTIMBER DUES.\n\nThe following answer to a letter sent by the Hon. Lawrence Clarke, of North West Canada, regarding the granting of free passage to his wood, has been held up as an indication:\n\nTo the Hon. Lawrence Clarke, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nSir,\u2014Your letter to the Minister of Interior, dated June 6th, respecting the desirability of granting to actual settlers free permits to cut wood in the Dominion, was kindly answered by me, and the reply was duly received in this Department, but I find that by some oversight, the reply was not delivered to you. The Crown Timber Agent at Prince Albert has, nevertheless, been instructed to report on the subject for the information of the Minister.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.
