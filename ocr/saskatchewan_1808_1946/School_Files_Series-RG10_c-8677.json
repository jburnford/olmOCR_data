Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, dated August 15th, addressed to Rev. Robt. B. Cochrane, D.D., is to hand, referring to the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School, which was taught by Mrs. A. L. Fakeley, and to the fact that the school was open only twelve days during the quarter ended June 30th last.\n\nThe Department is asking for the advice of this office in regard to a suitable payment under the circumstances that the short period for which the school was taught was due, first, to the illness of the teacher, and then to the close of the school owing to an outbreak of whooping cough.\n\nWe find it difficult to advise the Department in regard to this matter, but would state that Mrs. Fakeley's salary has been paid in full by this office, and we are quite willing to leave the matter entirely to the judgment of the Department to send us whatever they think is just and fair.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They stated that it was absolutely impossible to station a teacher there, as there was no building in which he could live. The Department also understands that the school building is most unsuitable. The Church authorities urged that provision be made in our estimates for the current fiscal year for the erection of a combined school and teacher's residence.\n\nA communication from the Superintendent of Indian Education forwarded from Regina during his recent visit states as follows:\n\n\"The Rev. Ferrier of Brandon, Commissioner Graham of Regina, and myself have discussed this matter and we are of the opinion that not more than $4000 should be spent building the necessary equipment. We have agreed that it is unnecessary to build, but a small school with seating accommodation for twenty-five and residential facilities for a man and his wife and perhaps a child is quite sufficient. Nothing expensive or elaborate should be in the specifications.\"\n\nIn view of this, the Department immediately undertook the preparation of the plans for a combined school and teacher's residence, copies of which were sent you on the 27th ultimo.\n\nUntil your telegram was received, we were not aware that the Indians were putting up a school building. However, if this building is satisfactory, we will be prepared to supply any furnishings or any material required to complete the building. The question of erecting a residence can be considered separately from the school building, provided you are satisfied that the building which is nearly completed by the Indians would be satisfactory for school purposes. We have the money provided in this year's estimates, and I shall be pleased to hear from you as to whether any material or equipment is required to complete the building now in course of erection, and also whether the building of a teacher's residence should be proceeded with this year.\n\nW.

Paul Schmidt\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nXXX. That a ventilation shaft be placed in the centre of the ceiling up through the roof with a galvanized iron roof cap, and trap door at ceiling.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the 3rd of July I received your letter dated the 27th of June informing me that plans and specifications had been prepared for a combined day school and teacher's residence for White Cap Sioux Reserve, and asking me to obtain and submit to the Department, tenders for this building.\n\nIn accordance with your request I prepared notices and had them posted in Saskatoon, Regina and Dundurn. After these notices were posted I received a long distance phone from Agent Schmidt of Duck Lake, informing me that the Indians of the Reserve had undertaken to build a school on their own account and had the building nearly completed. In view of the fact that the tenders were already posted, I communicated with you by wire on the 8th instant, asking you what you wished me to do in the matter. Today is the 15th and I have had no instructions.\n\nI received this morning, the attached letter from Mr. Agent Schmidt in which he makes a request that the Department take over the school that has been nearly completed by the Indians. I question very much whether it would be a good plan to do this. I cannot act on anything that Agent Schmidt suggests until I know what the Department's attitude in the matter will be. He had no authority from me to have the building stopped, he took this upon himself.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAs no request was made by me for a school at the Moose Woods Sioux Reserve, it has just occurred to me that probably it was not intended that a school should be built there, as you refer to the White Cap Sioux near Dundurn. Is it possible that a mistake was made in Ottawa and that this school should be for the White Cap Sioux Reserve near Prince Albert, as it is near that point where I understand, a school is needed.\n\nI will be glad to have your instructions in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOffice of the Duck Lake Indian Agency,\n\nApril 17th 1923\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 800, amounting to $7.30.\n\nin favour of W.A. Wilson, Dundurn, Sask.\n\nfor supplies for Mose Woods Sioux Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 570, dated April 9th, 1923.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, giving a list of the supplies that will be required each month in the providing of a midday meal to the children of the Whitecap Sioux Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery each month of the following supplies:\n\n- Beef - 20 Lbs.\n- Oatmeal - 10 Lbs.\n- Lard - 5 #\n- Sugar - 10 #\n- Tea - 2 #\n- Soap - 5 #\n- Rice - 2 #\n- Potatoes - 1 Bu.\n- Beans - 6 #\n- Baking Powder - 1 Lb.\n\nThe quantities mentioned above should not be exceeded.\n\nWe are not prepared to furnish cocoa, corn starch, tapioca, evaporated apples or prunes.\n\nIf possible competitive prices should be obtained for the furnishing of the above supplies each month.\n\nYou may purchase a flour bin, and the cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $4.\n\nRegarding fuel for the teacher's residence, I beg to say that the Department will pay for the fuel required for the residence and for the preparation of the children's meals. You may, therefore, arrange from time to time for the purchase of the fuel required - wood or coal. Only the quantity of fuel absolutely necessary for the above purpose should be supplied. Competitive prices should be obtained, if possible, and the fuel purchased from the person quoting the lowest price.\n\nRegarding the wood for the school, it is considered that the Indians, as in the past, should continue to supply the quantity required for the school room, free of charge.\n\nRegarding the providing of more accommodation in connection with the teacher's residence, I beg to say that you should state the cost of the material in erecting an addition of, say, 12' at the back of the present teacher's residence. You should also ascertain whether the teacher will, with the help of Indian labour, undertake the erection\n\nC. Paul Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nof this addition. It is considered that the Indians should perform the work gratis under the supervision of the teacher. If the teacher and Indians will undertake the work, you should state, as requested, the approximate cost of the material required. As soon as we have this information we will be in a position to decide whether authority will be granted for the putting up of the addition or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith Voucher No.845 for $150.19, favour Miners & Ball Limited of Saskatoon for Gate, Staples, Eave Troughing, Water Tank, Garden Fencing, Well Pump, Pipes & Fixtures, Screen Doors & Windows, Cedar posts for fence corners & gate. Lumber for well cribbing and Carpenters time, supplied for the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School on Moose Woods reserve.\n\nThe wire fencing, gate, eave troughing & water tank were purchased from T.Eaton & Co., through Miners Ball Limited.\n\nThe pump was purchased from T.Eaton & Co., through Miners Ball at the request of the Overseer Chas.R.Eagle. I had not quoted prices on a pump when in Saskatoon on April 14th last, as I did not know what class of pump would be required, the well then not being dug. I have since seen the pump at the school, it is a good one, and the price complete with sand point, $21.13, is very reasonable and I am confident could not be purchased elsewhere any cheaper.\n\nThe well cribbing I ordered from Miners Ball, Ltd., who cut same in their shop ready for mailing together free of charge. I also ordered from them, to be made in their shop, two storm doors for the Teachers residence, one with a glass \"window\" panel to match the front door, this is required for lighting the room, there being only one window in the front room.\n\nThe Carpenters time, 22 hours @ 75\u00a2, includes the time & conveyance going to the reserve to do the work.\n\nI have been to the reserve and saw the work, and find same well done, and first class material used. I recommend that the voucher be paid.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.P.Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nDUNDURN MEAT MARKET\nR.

FOR FILE:\n\nPublic School Inspector Anderson reports that at the time of his visit to the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School (June 12) he found\n\n1. no screen doors,\n2. no blinds,\n3. no towels or mirror,\n4. unsatisfactory condition of the outdoor lavatories.\n\nThe Inspector reports that the stove is too small for winter purposes, and recommends a larger one with jacket. He also recommends that a kitchen be built at the back of the teacher's residence. The fencing has not been used as it is lying on the ground, and the well is only partly dug.\n\nThe Inspector expresses the opinion that the Indian agent, who lives at some distance, is not seriously concerned with improvement at this school.\nOttawa, June 28, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is in receipt of Public school Inspector Anderson's report on the White Cap Sioux Indian Day School. The Inspector reports that some of the work we have authorized has not been completed. On the day of his visit (June 12) there were no screen doors and the fence was not up. Further, the well was only partly dug. In the light of your No. 7047-115-94 of the 2nd instant, enclosing voucher No. 646, the Department is of the opinion that this work should have been completed. I shall be pleased to have a report from you in this connection.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that the windows be equipped with blinds and that a mirror be supplied, also some towels. I should be pleased if you would make arrangements for the purchase and delivery of this equipment, in time for the re-opening of the school on September first.\n\nIt is reported, also, that the outdoor closets are under one roof, with but a thin partition and with seats that are altogether too high. The Inspector recommends a second closet to be built and the present one remodelled. I shall be pleased to have your recommendation in this connection.\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the last paragraph of official communication of the 24th of April, last, (File No. 109-11-1). You were asked to estimate the cost of erecting a 12 ft. addition at the back of the present teacher's residence. It was suggested that the teacher, with the help of Indian labour, undertake the erection of this addition and that the only cost to the Department would be that of the material required. Please let us have your report concerning this matter, at the first opportunity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nMoose Woods Reserve,\nDundurn, Sask.\nJune 6th, 1923.\n\nC.P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDear sir,\n\nIn regard to the construction of an addition to the residence here, permit me to state that I do not think that the suggestion of the Department, that the work should be done by the Indians, is feasible for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing it is doubtful if the Indians can be relied upon to give sufficient attention to the work. They are kept quite busy at their own tasks and in all probability would find but little time to devote to building. In order to avoid loss of time, errors in construction, and waste of material, as well as to insure complete and permanent satisfaction, I believe that the construction should be undertaken by experienced workmen.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. G.M. Churchill.\nReference the last paragraph of your letter No. 109-11-1, dated April 24th, 1923, regarding the providing of more accommodation in connection with the teacher's residence on Moose Woods reserve.\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I have made known to Mr. Churchill, the teacher on the reserve, the department's view in the matter, and am attaching hereto a copy of his reply.\n\nI do not approve of having this work done by the Indians, none of whom are handy with tools, and defective work on the addition would spoil the looks of the building and probably require repairs to same, or patching, in a short time.\n\nI recommend that the addition be built by experienced workmen and that a thorough job be done, and would recommend that Miners & Hall Limited, who erected the cottage, be given the work as they will know without going out to see the building exactly what is to be done in order to join both buildings under one roof, and would know what to start at when they arrived at the place.\n\nThe approximate cost of the material will be $295.00, plus freighting of material to the reserve, and board of men while working.\n\nI recommend that the work be done as soon as possible and during the holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.P.

Miners & Ball Limited, the firm that built the original building, if they are willing to undertake this work on a proven cost, plus 10% basis, the work to be done to your satisfaction, and construction to be on lines similar to the existing building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.P. Schmidt Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.109-11-5, dated June 28th, re Mr Inspector Anderson's report on the Whitecap Indian Day School on Moose Woods reserve.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the well and school garden fence have been completed since the Inspector's visit.\n\nRegarding a screen door on the school house, I had not requisitioned for same as I thought that with the windows being screened sufficient ventilation could be got therefrom without opening the door, and a screen door would soon be damaged by the children going in and out and hanging same. I am ordering a screen door, also window blinds, six towels and a mirror; these will be placed before the school re-opens.\n\nRegarding the water closet, I am having the old one remodeled and a second one built by Messrs. Hall Ltd. of Saskatoon, who are erecting the addition to the teachers' house, referred to in the last paragraph of your letter. This addition has been authorized by Departmental letter No.109-11-5, dated the 5th inst.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.P.

Churchill, Teacher of the Moose Woods Reserve Day School, which reads:\n\n\"Dear Sir,- I would like to know if it would be possible to have the present school stove replaced by one of a different type, preferably a sheet steel heater, unless a regular Waterbury Heater could be installed.\n\nThe present stove is unsatisfactory with the type of wood available, is slow to heat up and radiates no heat low down where it is most needed. A sheet steel heater would quickly heat the building, would make a more economical use of the fuel and would maintain the warmth of the room on a very cold day, when the present stove is almost useless.\n\nFor the comfort of the children and to promote the efficiency of the school work a change in the heating plant is necessary.\"\n\nThe stove now in use is an ordinary cast iron box stove. The fuel, wood, supplied the school by the Indians is very small, burns quickly, and does not hold a fire in the stove any length of time.\n\nI recommend that I be authorized to purchase a sheet steel heater and have same installed in the school room in lieu of the box stove now used. The cost of a sheet iron heater will be about $20.00. If possible I will try to trade in the box stove for a heater.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.P.

This heater is to take the place of the box stove which is now in use and has proved unsatisfactory to properly heat the building. If possible, you should arrange to trade in the box stove on the price of the steel heater. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, should be forwarded.

The expense, however, should be kept down as low as possible.\n\nYou may also arrange to have any glass required replaced in the windows in the teacher's house.\n\nRelative to the stoves required at the Moose Woods Day School, you may arrange for the purchase of a suitable stove for the use of the school and a coal heater for the teacher's residence.\n\nAccounts, in duplicate, certified in the usual manner, should be forwarded covering the expenditures authorized above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMOOSE WOODS DAY SCHOOL\n\nThis school is taught by Mrs. Fakeley, who is appointed by the United Church.\n\nThere are 12 on the roll,- 8 girls and 4 boys. Seven were present on the day of inspection. However, they were all in junior grades, in fact, very few could speak English. These children appear very shy and timid and when a stranger is present, they are much worse. I believe Mrs. Fakeley is winning their confidence and in time should accomplish good work.\n\nThe children were clean and tidy, and the classroom was in splendid condition. It was re-decorated this year and is very bright and cheerful.\n\nThe heater used is absolutely worn out and is not safe. This is a practically new school and it is a pity to take such chances with an old stove.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in good repair and, I believe, quite comfortable. Here, again, a new heater is badly needed. Mrs. Fakeley requested that a coal heater be purchased, as wood is not procurable on the reserve, and that furnished is a poor grade of balm which will not hold fire. She is obliged to get up two and three times each night to re-fill the stove in order to keep the house warm. The stove is only a cheap tin stove and it is not safe to go away and leave on a fire. A stove certainly should be...\nMOOSE WOODS DAY SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nshould be provided and I believe a coal burner would be best.\n\nSigned R.G. Hamilton\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 17th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency which were inspected by Mr. Hamilton during his recent visit to that agency.\n\nThe Moose Woods Day school is a simple institution and we are not getting very far with our school work here. The children would be much better in a Boarding School. I have asked for a new heater for the classroom and also one for the teacher's residence.\n\nW. M.

The grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade I - 2\nII - 7\nIII - 3\nIV - 1\n\nThe attendance has been good, and for the month of January the average was 12.15.\n\nThe children were neatly dressed, and were clean in appearance. Their books are all neatly kept, and the work nicely set down. They speak out much better than on other occasions, and appear to take an interest in their school.\n\nMiss H. J. Hare is a capable teacher, and already these children have showed marked improvement in their manners, as well as in their school work.\n\nThe school and residence are in good repair, but both buildings are badly in need of painting. A fence would also improve the surroundings and be a protection to the buildings.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRegina, Sask., Feb. 26, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a very satisfactory report on the schools in the Duck Lake Agency, comprising three day schools and one Residential school.\n\nYou will note that at the Moose Woods Day School there is an enrolment of 13 pupils, with an average attendance of 12.15 and that the children are neatly dressed and clean in appearance. This speaks very well for the parents on this reserve, who are not under the guidance of a White Instructor, but merely under the influence of the teacher, Miss Hare, who is quite capable. The Inspector points out that the school and residence are in good repair, but that both buildings are badly in need of painting, and that a fence is also required. I would point out that $150.00 was placed in the Estimates for painting and $85.00 for a fence. I should be glad to see these items approved.\n\nW. M.

The Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding approximately $20 in the purchase of the lumber, shingles, nails, etc., required in the erection of a new toilet - the Indians to perform the labour in erecting same and digging the pit without charge. This new toilet should be built at some distance from the present one. An account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost should be forwarded in the usual manner. The old toilet should be thoroughly cleaned out and placed in a good, sanitary condition, and any repairs required may be carried out. The new toilet should be for the use of the girls and the present toilet for the boys.\n\nI have also to acknowledge receipt of a requisition from the teacher for supplies for the midday meal, etc., for the quarter ending June 30th, last.

The room is at present heated by an air tight Tin Heater which burns wood only. Miss H. Nare the Teacher states the class room becomes very cold through the night in severe weather and it takes a long time to warm it in the forenoon.\n\nIf a coal stove were installed and a slow burning fire left on at night, I believe the cold would be kept out, and the room made easy to heat next morning. The cost of a Stove, Quebec Heater #45 would be approximately $20.00 and new pipes for installing same approximately $2.00.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.P.

It is noted that the stove at present in use is wood burning, while the stove which you recommend be supplied is a coal burning one.\n\nIf a new stove of the type recommended by you is installed, it would be necessary to furnish this school with a supply of coal. You might inform the Department of the difference in cost as between wood and coal, also if you consider there would be any danger if a fire is kept in the stove in the classroom during the night. Our funds this year are extremely limited and, unless there is real necessity for a change in the stove, we would not be prepared to authorize same. You might also state the condition of the present wood burning tin heater and what disposition would be made of same if a new stove is supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Schmidt (In trust), Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nfor Due John Royal for Labour at Moose Woods School, Moose Woods Reserve, Teachers Residence.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 1031-1 dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nFebruary 1st 1932\n\nSir-\n\nReference Departmental letter #109-II-5 dated November 19th last re a coal stove heater for the Moose Woods Sioux Reserve Day School and asking me to inform the Department of the difference in cost as between wood and coal. I have the honour to state that in the past the fuel (wood) for this class-room has been supplied by the Indians gratis.\n\nThe wood used by the Indians of this reserve for heating their homes is mostly large Willow brush, which they gather around the sloughs and low lands, this they burn in Air Tight Heaters as the billet is too small to burn in an ordinary cast iron box stove.\n\nThe supply of this wood is not plentiful on the reserve, and the Indians pick the best pieces for their homes and bring the poorer pieces to the school. Those who have no children attending school are very lax about bringing their share. All seem to think they should be paid for the wood supplied.\n\nMiss H.J. Hare the present Teacher who took charge of the school in September 1930, has complained every winter about the quality and sometimes the quantity of wood supplied. I have taken this matter up with the Indians, and several times with the Overseer Chas. R. Eagle, but their promises that a good supply will be prepared at once seem to be forgotten after I leave the reserve.\n\nThere seems to be a (chilled) feeling towards the Teacher on the part of some of the Indians, the Overseer is one of them. I tried to get to the source of the trouble but found it touched, as I thought, on Missionary (Church) matters, I would not discuss it.\n\nThe cost of burning coal and wood in the class-room would be approximately:\n\nWood. 20 Cords @ $7.00 delivered in stove lengths $140.00\nCoal. 10 Tons @ $12.00 \" $120.00\n\nIf coal is used it will be necessary to erect a coal shed near the school at a cost of approximately $50.00. A suitable coal stove will cost approximately $20.00, if we continue to use wood a shed is not required.\n\nA large size Air Tight Heater suitable for the building will cost approximately $18.00. The ordinary cheap tin heater now in use is badly burnt and will not be fit for use another season.\n\nI recommend burning wood as in the past and purchasing same from the Indians. I talked the matter over with Miss Hare the Teacher when on the reserve last week, who said she would be quite satisfied providing a good supply was on hand all the time, then she would not have to send notes to the Overseer to tell him the supply was getting low.\n\nI have the honour to be\nSir\nYour obedient servant,\nC.P. Schmidt Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6295, file 625-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, regarding the change in the fuel used in the heating of the Moose Woods (Sioux Reserve) Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted you recommend that the burning of wood, as in the past, be continued and that it be purchased from the Indians, rather than the use of coal and the supplying of a stove and a coal shed.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be satisfactory, for the present at least, to continue the use of wood as fuel and will approve of paying the Indians for delivering the quantity of a good grade of wood required. Therefore, you may arrange with the Indians to deliver, cut into proper stove lengths, the quantity of wood required for the present winter's use. It is noted that the cost will be $7.00 per cord. You should arrange to have them deliver the quantity required at an early date, and, when the wood has been supplied to your satisfaction, please forward certified accounts, in duplicate, in favour of the Indians who deliver it, for the amount due them. The wood should be properly piled or stored at the school.\n\nWhen it is necessary to obtain the supply for use in the winter of 1932-33, you should make application to the Department for authority to incur the expenditure required in supplying the wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Evans' report on the Moose Woods Indian Day School.\n\nI may point out that the buildings are very badly in need of paint, as a matter of fact the paint has practically disappeared from the walls of the buildings. The interiors of both the school room and the teacher's residence are badly in need of redecorating and repairs. The buildings are located on a sand bank and it is a difficult matter to have a garden; although I feel sure that if the teacher had sufficient interest a plot of ground could be found. There is a considerable quantity of woven wire on hand which has been rolled up to provide a fence for a garden. I noted that the children were provided with a ball and a bat, but no other facilities for recreation are provided. These things can be corrected when the services of a teacher who will take an active interest in the welfare of the pupils is appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, July 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison has forwarded the report of the Provincial School Inspector on the Moose Woods Indian Day School. Mr. Murison states he was present at the time of the inspection.\n\nAs you have already been informed, a change in teacher is being made at this school for the coming academic year.\n\nMr. Murison points out that the buildings are very badly in need of paint. He states the interiors of both the classroom and the teacher's residence require redecorating and repairs. I would request that you examine this building and inform the Department what painting, renovations and repairs you would recommend be carried out, giving an estimate of the cost. Please report, also, regarding the labour. Could the work be performed satisfactorily by Indian labour, or would it be necessary to have outside help? When submitting your estimate, I shall be pleased if you will report on the cost of renovating the interior of the school and teacher's residence separately from the cost of the outside painting of the buildings. As our funds are extremely limited it may only be possible to fix up the interior. However, when your estimate is received, consideration will be given as to what work can be authorized.\n\nMr. Murison states, further, that as the buildings are located on a sand bank, it is a difficult matter to have a garden, although, if the teacher had sufficient interest, a plot of ground could be found. He states there is a considerable quantity of woven wire on hand, rolled up which would provide a fence for the garden. You should state if you would recommend that provision be made for a garden at this school. If so, the cost of any extra wire, posts, etc., and the labour in erecting same should be stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. P.

Also that the cribbing therein is rotten from the top down to a depth of 10 to 15 feet, and the pump needs replacing, as the pump head is broken, the cylinder worn out, the pipes require re threading and the rods are badly bent.\n\nTo have this well cleaned out, deepened by ten feet, rotted cribbing renewed and a new pump installed, it will cost approximately as follows:\n\nLabour cleaning well. $15.00\nDeepening well 10 ft @ $1.00 10.00\nMaterial for cribbing. 25.00\nPump for well. 30.00\n\nApproximate total cost........... $80.00\n\nIt is possible that when the work of cleaning the well is commenced it will be discovered that the cribbing at the bottom of the well has commenced to rot.

Water should be found at a depth of 30 feet, and the cost of labour, material and new pump for same would cost approximately $110.00.\n\nI recommend that authority be granted to allow an expenditure of approximately $110.00 to be used to the best advantage in procuring water for the teacher's residence and Indian Day School on this Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.H.Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nVia Inspector's Office\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSHS/CES.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., July 20th, 1927\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit attached letter from Mr. Simpson re well, Moose Woods Sioux Reserve.\n\nI would recommend that this expenditure be authorized, if funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

He seemed confident of being able to secure a good supply of water at a depth of 30 feet. I therefore engaged him and agreed to pay him at the rate of $1.50 per foot for a 24 inch hole up to 30 feet deep, providing he found a good supply of water. If not, he would be paid $.85 per foot. These prices to include the wages of his helper, the use of his machine which is operated by horse power, also the board for himself, his helper and team.\n\nOn Sept. 3rd, Mr. Jamieson advised that he had gone down to a depth of 24 feet, at which point sand and water was encountered and he was unable to go deeper as he could not drive the well cribbing through it. Also that there was only 18 inches of water in the well and it would not come in fast enough to be of any use.\n\nI was unable to visit this Reserve until yesterday, and before leaving that district I got in contact with a Mr. H. Owens, who lives adjacent to the Reserve. He submitted the following offer:\n\nSalvage the cribbing in the dry hole. Hand-dig a four foot circular hole to a depth that will give a supply of water four feet deep every three hours, install the cribbing, make the rings which are to brace the cribbing every three feet; also install the frost-lid 10 feet down and a floor in the well; cement the top of the well and install the pump.\n\nHe will charge for this work at the rate of $1.50 per foot up to 30 feet. If found necessary to go further than 30 feet he will do so without further additional charge. He guarantees to provide the labor for a completed job at a cost not exceeding $45.00. In the event of a dry hole no charge will be made.\n\nMr. Owens seemed confident he would get a water supply at 30 or 35 feet.\n\nThe sum of $110.00 has been authorized to replace the broken pump in the well now going dry, also to dig a new well. Of this the following has been expended;\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Pump and fixtures     | $20.00 |\n| Lumber and wire       | $12.00 |\n| Cement                | $1.50  |\n| Hauling material      | $4.00  |\n| 20 foot dry hole      | $85 cents |\n\nTotal: $57.90\n\nIf Mr. Owens can secure water at a depth of 30 feet a further expenditure of $45.00 for labor and approximately $35.00 for material will be required which would over-expend the $110.00 authorized by the sum of $28.00. In the event of a dry hole at 30 feet we would be within the amount authorized and would have $17.00 left to purchase more material.\nContinuing letter No. 2855-6-94\nDuck Lake, Sask., Sept. 22nd, 1937.\n\n-- to go deeper at no additional cost for labor, unless water is found, and labor then would amount to $45.00\n\nThe old well that is almost dry has been supplying the water used for watering the milk cows at the Teacherage and for household purposes. The Indians on this Reserve were also using it for their household purposes as well as drinking water for their children while at School. Unless a further supply is found at the present site other wells will have to be dug for the use of these people.\n\nI recommend that Mr. Owens offer be accepted and that I be authorized to expend $40.00 more than already authorized if found necessary to do so, in order to get a water supply.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated as Mr. Owens will not undertake this work at the price mentioned if the ground becomes frozen.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H.

On Sept. 3rd, last, he reported he could not guarantee an adequate water supply in the 24 feet deep well he had dug on account of the nature of the sand. On October 12th I then requested Mr. R.E. Creelman of Saskatoon, who has the reputation of being one of the best well men in the district, to examine the work already done and let me have his advice on the matter.\n\nHe advised that he could procure a good water supply and would guarantee being able to do so providing a certain type of sand point was installed. I then employed Mr. Creelman to complete this work, which he agreed to have completed by November 10th, last.\n\nOn October 19th Mr. Creelman cleaned out the sand in the well to a depth of 26 feet and installed a 12 foot x 10 inch galvanized pipe which he gravel-packed.\n\nOwing to not being able to procure the proper sand point locally when the work mentioned was completed Mr. Creelman moved his machinery to work in another part of the district, and was unable through an injury to his foot to return to the reserve to complete the work by the time agreed upon.\n\nIn June of this year water could not be pumped from the well as the old sand point which was temporarily installed would no longer work.\n\nAs water was badly required for the school children Teacher's residence, and the Indian families living nearby I had Mr. Creelman complete his contract.\n\nThe expenditures in this connection in 1937 are as follows:\n\n| Voucher No. | Description                  | Amount |\n|-------------|------------------------------|--------|\n| 370         | Pump                         | $19.78 |\n| 452         | K.E.

These are in connection with repairing the chimneys on the Moose Wood Indian Day School and teacher's residence, and amount to $19.04.\n\nMr. McLeod informs this office that under Departmental letter No. 109-11-15 dated April 28th last, he was given authority for interior decoration to the teacher's residence. However, when the residence was checked over and the day school as well it was found that the chimneys were in a very bad state of repair and therefore a fire hazard. Therefore before proceeding with the purchase of the material for interior decorating Mr. McLeod ordered that the chimneys be put in good state of repair and hence incurred this expenditure in place of the decorating.\n\nWe therefore trust that these will be paid accordingly and as for decorating the teacher's residence and the school a similar amount was included in the 1945-46 Estimates unless our Branch desire that this work be done this Fall and have sufficient funds to carry out this additional expenditure.\n\nThe sum of $25.00 was allotted for labour and a voucher covering this will be submitted later when the accounts are received at the Agency office.\n\nM.

This I had boarded up with Shipplap nailed to 2nd studding. The cellar is lit by a cellar sack which I had put in the foundation. I also had a small outer house (W.C.) built, the cost of the material for this and the cellar lining will be found on the statement for extra.\n\nThe labour I had done by Miners & Bell Contractors, who sent out one of their Foreman and other men for the following rates; Foreman 25\u00a2 per hour, Carpenters 75\u00a2, Carpenter's Helper 50\u00a2, Brick Layer $1.15, Painters 75\u00a2.

A long beautiful lake full of islands, the greater part within the reserve.\n\nThey had 118 of population, but the flu of 1918 swept off forty-three, so that it left a very desolate band of 70 or so. Many of the houses are still standing deserted.\n\nNow however they have a number of young children and total about 110. The reserve is completely isolated, very few people travel that way because there is nothing beyond them but one large and four or five little bands of Indians. No Bishop either Anglican or Roman had ever visited them before, and the only baptized children in the band belong to the Church of England.\n\nThe land is altogether too rough for agriculture and so they live a precarious life travelling round the settlements working during the summer months and fishing on their beautiful lake in the winter. But the provincial game laws are a great trouble to them. Their nets are small and in the winter the fish take to the deep water.\n\nI held a long meeting with the Chief and others, and they very cordially agreed to the suggestion that they should put up a log building and mud it, while we would find the windows, shingles and floor, and then ask the Indian Department to give a qualified teacher for the six winter months.\nRe Island Lake, Continued.\n\nThey seemed perfectly willing to do the work but they have absolutely no money, and nothing whatever is being done there in the way of farming instruction or uplift of any kind.\n\nI earnestly beg of you on behalf of these people, the great majority of which are utterly pagan, to give us the appointment of a six winter months' teacher for this Reserve of Island Lake.\n\nBIG ISLAND LAKE.\n\nAbout fifty miles further north after crossing the Beaver River we came to Big Island Lake. Far larger than Island Lake probably thirty to thirty-five miles long and twelve miles wide, also filled with beautiful islands.\n\nThe Chief is dead but the son of the Chief gave us the names of about 100 people all told on the Reserve at the present time. There were either sixteen or eighteen houses built but they were going to build some more this winter. Here again the impression was, totally out of the world and forgotten.\n\nThe Indian Agent had helped them with a sawmill some time ago and there was abundance of lumber to be seen but there is little or nothing in the way of agriculture. The great majority are pagan, the few baptized Christians belonging to the Church of England. The suggestion of a school some time ago met with strenuous opposition from a handful of the \"old men pagans\", but this has died down and the younger men who have families are becoming quite anxious to have a school.\n\nHere, as at Island Lake only a winter school could be operated for six months for the present at any rate because during the summer months the people clear off in all directions, presumably earning some money. They are quite willing to get out all the logs and put up a good log building if we would provide the windows, doors and they have plenty of lumber for floors etc.\n\nThey have a beautiful reserve every mile of which could be cultivated into beautiful farms, but I did not see a single place where there was any cultivation.\nRe Big Island Lake. Continued.\n\nThe younger men however, are getting very anxious at their want of progress and would gladly receive the appointment of a teacher for the six winter months. In this reserve I should expect that to be changed into a full year teacher as the Indians begin to cultivate their own reserve.\n\nHere again, I earnestly beg of you to let us do something and begin with the winter appointment of a six months teacher. In both cases it is too late to do anything this winter except get ready, but if you will promise us the appointment of two teachers for next winter, we will urge on the preparation of the two log buildings during this winter.\n\nThe other reserves in that district are not ripe for anything more than they have at the present time.\n\nWith kindest regards\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.\nSuperintendent General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have no particular object to urge, but I would like to discuss the future possibilities of -\n\nTaking the two summer teachers in Stanley and Pelican Narrows, and utilizing them as two winter teachers in Island Lake and Big Island Lake, north of Onion Lake.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) G. E. S.\n\nG. E. Saskatchewan.\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nWe have been asking repeatedly, for the last years, for a Day-School to be opened on our Big Island Lake Reserve, in the Onion Lake Agency, but so far, we have received no answer of any kind.\n\nMay I, today, in the name of my Band, renew our request for a school to be opened in the nearest future?\n\nWe want this school to be put under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, because half of our population here are Catholics, only a couple of families being Anglicans, the rest being still pagans.\n\nWe have approached Mr. Charles Hebert, actually teaching at the Cold Lake Indian school, at Legoff, and he would be willing to be transferred to our new school, provided this transfer be proposed to him under advantageous terms. We know him favorably and we expect to get along well with him.\n\nOf course the school we ask for would be a trial affair, and we would not expect your Department to go into heavy expenses for the erection of a school house and a teacher's residence. If you would apply the roofing, the flooring, the windows, nails, few rolls of building paper, ... the logs, labor, etc., could be supplied by ourselves.\n\nWe trust that you will give this, our request, your kindest attention, and that you will favor us with an early and favorable answer.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nyour most humble and obedient servant,\n\nJoseph Bighood\nChief of the Big Island Lake Reserve\nOnion Lake Agency.\n\nP.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6206, file 626-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, requesting the establishment of a day school on the Big Island Lake (Bighead) Reserve. In reply I have to state that the Department, at present, is not satisfied that a day school on your reserve could be made a success, and I regret that I cannot give you a hopeful answer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Joseph Bighead,\nc/o Rev. J. E. Pratt, C.M.I.,\nLeGoff, Alta.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1929.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant with reference to winter day schools on the Ministikwan and Bighead Indian reserves, north of Onion Lake. Rev. E. Ahemakew visited Ottawa this week and he, too, brought this question to the Department's attention.\n\nI am today writing to Mr. Indian Agent Turner informing him that the Department is favourably considering giving a trial to a school activity on the Ministikwan reserve (No. 161), which is unofficially known as Island Lake. If the Church will see that the Indians erect a log building, the Department will favourably consider finishing material, flooring, etc., provided there are no labour costs. Mr. Turner, of course, will assist your missionary or whomever you place in charge in connection with the Indian labour.\n\nAt a later date, you will be asked to name a teacher for the winter months. It is just possible that either one of the two summer teachers at Stanley or Pelican Harrows would be suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArchdeacon W.E.J. Paul, L.L.B.,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nAt the meeting I explained to the Indians the situation with respect to a Day School for their reserve; and reminded them that they had frequently petitioned the Rev. E. Ahenakew for one to be run under the auspices of the Anglican Church; and told them that I had been instructed to stop any further work on the Roman Catholic building then in course of erection; and invited them to give me their views on the subject, and I would report whatever they had to say to the Department. Eleven adult male members of the band were present. They were unanimous in stating that they had never asked either the Anglicans or the Roman Catholics for a Church; but admitted that they had asked both the Rev. E. Ahenakew, of the Anglican Church, and the Rev. Father Balter, of the Roman Catholic Church, to build an Indian Day School for them. They added that they did not care which of the two denominations built the school, so long as they had one. They also told me that the priest visited them often during the past winter and on every occasion would ask them if they wanted a school to be built by the Roman Catholics; and that they gave him no answer until late in the Spring, when they told him they would consent to one being built, and they selected the site for it. They added that nothing was ever said to them about building a church. They also asked me to request the Department not to halt the work on the present building, which, although they realized it would be used also for church services, was intended, primarily, for an Indian Day School.\n\nWhilst travelling around the reserve, and also at the Indian meeting, I took a religious census of the\nband, which is, approximately, as follows:\n\n|                | Adults | Children |\n|----------------|--------|----------|\n| Church of England | 6      | 11       |\n| Roman Catholic   | 16     | 35       |\n| Pagans           | 22     | 16       |\n\nI had heard, more than a month ago, from Father Balter, who is in charge of the R. C. Mission at Cold Lake, that the Roman Catholics intended to erect a building on the Bighead's Reserve, to be used as an Indian Day School; and that the Church Provincial, at Edmonton, was in correspondence with the Department in the matter; but, although I knew that the Rev. Father Balter was arranging with a sawyer in the vicinity of the reserve, for the purchase of lumber for this building, I did not know that building operations had actually commenced.\n\nI may add that since my return from the Bighead's reserve, I have seen the Rev. E. Ahenakew and have explained to him the situation there. He seemed to feel that the Department may think he has misrepresented conditions at the reserve, whilst visiting at the Department; but he explained this to me by telling me that he had not then heard of the large number of children which has recently been baptised into the R. C. Church. I may say that I asked the Rev. Father Balter for a list of these children, which he gave me on my return from the Bighead's reserve, and which total 34; this number corresponds very closely to my census figures, which are 35.\n\nI would ask the Department to kindly accept this letter as a report on conditions at the Bighead's reserve, with reference to the establishment of an Indian Day School to be run under the auspices of the Church of England. This report was asked for in letter dated September 19th, No. 115-2-1.\nOctober 22, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Turner:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the erection, on the Bighead Reserve, of a building to be used by the Roman Catholics for church and day school purposes. I regret that I cannot authorize its completion at the present time, as the Department is not yet satisfied that a day school can be successfully conducted at this point.\n\nYou might let me know if an undenominational day school would have any chance for success and indicate if a central site could be reached by any reasonable number of children. It is possible that the Catholic Church authorities would not be satisfied with an undenominational school. On the other hand, I doubt if the Department should consider two day schools - one for the Catholics and one for the Protestants. You might let me have a further report, indicating particularly the grouping of the permanent homes on the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF ARCHDEACON W. E. J. PAUL,\nSYNOD OFFICE, PRINCE ALBERT, SASK., DATED NOVEMBER\n4th, 1930.\n\n---\n\nI have recently returned to Saskatchewan from Ireland, and I was sorry to hear what happened out at Big Island Lake. The Indians applied to us on several occasions for a school on their Reserve, and while we were trying to work in conjunction with the Department, the Roman Catholic Church started to put up a building without authority.\n| Name                  | Count |\n|-----------------------|-------|\n| Chief Napayo          | 4     |\n| Naypaysis             | 2     |\n| Kahmispoomeepattow    | 1     |\n| Kahmuskopetkayoc      | 4     |\n| Peesemopewein         | 1     |\n| Hootches              | 2     |\n| J.

This sketch must not be taken as being very exact, but I feel sure that it is sufficiently so to give you the information you require. I have marked the houses with a X and numbered each; and have attached to the sketch a list showing corresponding numbers, with the names of the Indian occupiers. This list also shows the religion of all the children, and also the number under each denomination of school age. The approximate position of the Roman Catholic building, which was being erected, is shown by the figure A.\n\nWith regard to the establishment of an undenominational day school at this point, I feel sure that this would be quite satisfactory to the Indians, if they were left alone in the matter; but it must be remembered that the Roman Catholic Church has been doing a lot of missionary work on this reserve for the past year or so, and I feel confident that the authorities of that Church would never be satisfied with an undenominational school. On the other hand, I do not think that the Anglican Church would press its claim to also build a school, very strenuously, if you allow the Roman Catholics to complete their building; as I have had several conversations with the Rev. E. Ahenakew, Church of England Indian Missionary, on this subject; and I gathered from these conversations that he thought the Anglican Church could do nothing now but withdraw its project of building a school on the Bighead's reserve; and that he felt some degree of satisfaction in the fact that the Church was not very deeply committed in the matter.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing will be of some assistance to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., LL.D\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 30, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo, transmitting a resolution passed at the Executive Committee Meeting of the Diocese of Saskatchewan. I may say that the Department of Indian Affairs does not allow anyone to build a school on an Indian reserve without permission.\n\nWith reference to the Big Island Lake Reserve, my Deputy informs me that the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church have both requested a day school. As the Department was not at all satisfied that such could be conducted successfully, no permission was granted. In October, last, when it was learned that the Roman Catholic Church was erecting a chapel there, the Department ordered that building operations be discontinued. The Indian Agent, carrying out these instructions, visited the reserve on October 8th and found a frame building, 24 x 50, with 10 ft. walls, in course of erection. The frame was filled in with boards and the roof not commenced. Work on the building was discontinued forthwith.\n\nThe Department requires full information concerning the situation on any reserve before allowing a church to be built or before\n\nRev.

Archdeacon Paul B.A., LLB.\nSynod Office\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDear Archdeacon:\n\nIn the spring of 1929 the Indians of Big Head's Reserve (Big Island Lake), Onion Lake Agency petitioned for a C.of E. Day School. Most of them signed the petition the Chief's name leading the rest.\n\nA month or two while in Ottawa I took up the matter with Mr. Ferrier at your request. Imagine my surprise when he took a letter from a file and told me he had had it from the chief of the reserve and a priest and that they were asking for an R.C. School. I was so offended at the duplicity of the Chief that I refrained from pushing the matter for the time being at least.\n\nAfter this other petitions came to us from the fathers of the children of school age. When I was in Ottawa last September I again went in to see Mr. Ferrier about the question of having the school built. I understood Mr. Ferrier to be willing if a favorable report came from Mr. Turner, the Ind. Agent from Onion Lake.\n\nThe next thing I heard was that the R.C. Church had taken the law in their own hands and had started to build without first securing permission from the Dept. The building operations were stopped by Dr. Scott for the time being and that I believe is where the matter rests at present.\n\nMr. Turner had a meeting with the Indians and he tells me they were all willing that the R.C. building should go on and that they did not want it stopped. I have the highest opinion of Mr. Turner's integrity and would never think of questioning his word.\n\nI was at Big Head's in January and in a meeting arranged by themselves and without any influence being brought to bear on them they signed the appended paper by putting their marks opposite their names. The Chief who did not sign but was present in the meeting said that if they could not get an R.C. School, he would be glad to see an Anglican school built instead.\n\nThis is brief is the history of the matter as I know it. My personal opinion is this\u2014If the Dept. allows the R.C. building, which was started unlawfully, to be completed, then the question as to whether we are not losing out by punctiliously conforming, in all things, to the...\nregulations of the Ind.Dept., may well be raised.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nEd.

H. Wallace, Sec. Treas. of the Diocese of Saskatchewan re Big Island Lake Reserve - I was at Little Island Lake shortly before Christmas and heard while there that the Indians at Big Island Lake were still looking to the Anglican Church to start a School on their Reserve. I was unable to go on there myself, but Rev. E. Ahenakew went there in January, and as soon as the men of the place heard he had arrived they came to the house where he was, and asked to have a meeting. Thirteen men and one woman, the mother of a child, signed a paper asking that the proposed school be in connection with the Anglican Church. Mr. Ahenakew baptized a man and a child while there. Accordingly it appears that the majority of the heads of families still want an Anglican School, even though it did not appear so at the meeting held by Mr. Turner, the Indian Agent, last Fall.\n\nWe should be only too glad to do our part, if the Indian Department sees fit to give us a school on that Reserve. I enclose Rev. E. Ahenakew's report and the paper to which the people placed their marks.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J. Paul.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the present time, there are no funds for new causes, and I cannot authorize any expenditure for the purpose.

G.

This school has not been authorized by the Department, and, as there are no funds for the purpose of increasing our educational services, I regret that a salary cannot be allowed the teacher at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. G. Davies, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nMr. R. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nSince arriving in Ottawa I wrote the Minister regarding the question of taking over a school that has been established by the Roman Catholic Church in the Onion Lake Reserve, just across the border of Alberta in Saskatchewan. From the information I have and from a further talk I have had with Dr. Hill, it appears that there are 30 eligible children of school age and this school is the best day-school in the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nWhile the Minister previously intimated to me that funds were very short, I would appreciate it if you would draw to the attention of the Minister the details you have in connection with this school and the justness of the claim made that some provision should be made for its operation by the Department. Dr. Hill has told me that he would submit to you a statement as to what the cost involved would be, and I think this is considerably less than the Minister thought.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nP. G. Davies.\nOttawa, May 30, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Davies:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the Big Island Lake Indian Day School, in the Onion Lake agency. When Dr. Hill, Acting Indian Agent, was in Ottawa recently, he made representations concerning this activity, and he was requested to submit a report. It may be possible to give some assistance during the coming academic year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. G. Davies, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nI have the honour to submit the following report in reply to your letter of April 12th.\n\nOn January 10th last I visited Higham's reserve and inspected their day school. There were twenty children enrolled and fourteen in attendance. I only made slight reference to the school in my monthly report as we had on file a communication from the Department, No. 117-2-1 of November 30th, 1931, to the effect that the carrying on of a day school on this reserve was not authorized, and consequently class room material, etc., would not be supplied.\n\nThe school has been in operation since last November with an enrollment of twenty and an average attendance of fifteen, and in addition there are nine of school age who are not enrolled. Their teacher is Mrs. Hartman Martinson, who has no special qualifications. Mrs. Martinson is the daughter of Mr. Indian Agent Harris, First Nation, and received her education at that point.\n\nThe building is a frame structure 24' x 36', with 10' ceiling, gable roof, roofing paper, outside wall finished with lap siding and painted. Inside finish, building paper, unplastered. The school is facing east, with three windows on the south and two on the east.\n\nThe equipment is largely improvised, consisting of two blackboards, twelve homemade benches, old school books (second hand) slates, dishes for common use, one wash basin and water pail.\n\nIn addition there are two log buildings in the premises, viz., a three room dwelling for the teacher and a residence, five rooms, for the priest, Reverend Father Gauthier.\n\nIn my opinion a day school is very much indicated at this point, and at a meeting of these Indians I am requested to try find facilities for them the same assistance from the Department as was given to the Indians of Island Lake, a neighboring reserve, for their school.\n\nReverend Father Gauthier has been most active and has been doing good work among the Indians, and they have shown marked improvement since he has been with them. We have also heard of great assistance to us by co-operating in looking after the sick and destitute, and he informs me that Miss Jappan, who is living with the present school teacher and her husband, is a qualified school teacher, and is available to immediately replace Mrs. Martinson.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has provided a frame building 24' x 24' with 10' walls and a rubberoid cottage roof. Thirty pupils are enrolled, twenty-five of whom I am informed attend regularly. Mrs. R. Martineau, an ex-pupil of the Fort Resolution School, has been engaged as Teacher. She had Grade 8 standing at the time of her discharge from school. Father Gauthier requested me to ask the Department for recognition of his school. He is very enthusiastic and it would appear that the Indians have taken kindly to his efforts as shown by the attendance. In the event of the Department deciding to close the Cold Lake Day School and to look with favor on Father Gauthier's request, it might be advisable to engage Mr. Hebert as teacher if suitable housing accommodation could be provided for him. In any event, I can see no good in keeping the Cold Lake Day School open, as the results certainly do not justify the present outlay incurred in maintaining it.\n\nW. Marigouin,\nInspector\nI wish however to bring to your attention the fact that the Rev. Father Gauthier has had a day school in operation for some time at Joseph Bigheads which is being operated by the Church. He has provided a frame building 24' x 24' with 10' walls and a rubberoid cottage roof. Thirty pupils are enrolled; eleven boys and nineteen girls; twenty-five attending regularly. Mrs. R. Martineau, an ex-pupil of the Fort Resolution School, has been acting in the capacity of teacher. She had a Grade 8 standing at the time of her discharge.\n\nIt has occurred to me that, if the Department would give favourable consideration to recognizing this school, Mr. Hebert might take over the duties as teacher, but I question at this time of year if he could get suitable housing accommodation for himself and family. I was on the point of reporting this matter to you when I received your letter, in as much as Father Gauthier has requested me to ask the Department for certain equipment as well as recognition of his school. At the time of my visit Mr. Hebert was anticipating that the Cold Lake Day School might be closed, but of course I could not give him any information as I did not know what the attitude of the Department would be, but he stated that in the event of the school being closed he would endeavour to obtain a school elsewhere. In any event I see no need for continuing to pay for Mrs. Hebert's services. It has appeared to me that the salary paid her is out of proportion to the services rendered.\nDecember 2, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nIn 1925, the Anglican Bishop of Saskatchewan requested the establishment of a day school on the Big Island Lake (Big Head) Reserve No. 134.

In April, 1931, the Catholic Church applied for a site for a church and other buildings on the reserve, and, by P.C. 1935, of August 14, 1931, authority was given to lease 2.7 acres of land for mission purposes.

I feel that I cannot concur in the recommendations of Mr. Sutherland for two reasons -\n\n1. The urgent requirement of sparing our vote for educational purposes, and\n\n2.

Church authorities on the Big Island Lake or Big Head Reserve No. 124, I have to inform you that the Department will be unable to provide any grant towards teacher's salary or other expenses of this school. Owing to the urgent requirement of sparing our Vote for other educational purposes, it is found impossible to provide the funds necessary for salary, etc., during the present fiscal year. I would request that you inform Mr. Acting Agent Hill accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 20th, 1934.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe following is taken from a letter just received by the Minister,-\n\n\"I received a letter from Bonnyville ref. to the Indian day schools here at Legoff and Long Lake. Here at Legoff we don't intend to open the school again. At Long Lake, Rev. Father Pratt affirms that there are ten children who are of age to go to school and would go, if the school were open, and according to Rev. Father Pratt this school should be opened again, as there is no reason to keep the Frog Lake Anglican day school going with an attendance of five or six children, and keep the Long Lake Catholic day school closed.\n\nFurthermore, we ask that the Big Island Lake day school, with an attendance of 25 to 30 children be put on the same footing as the Little Island Anglican day school, where the attendance is not over 15 children.\"\n\nThe Minister would like to have a report covering this situation.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nMarch 24th, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM\u2014\n\nThe Honourable The Superintendent General,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 20th instant regarding certain day schools in the Onion Lake Agency and, as your correspondent refers to five different schools, I am reporting on each of them.\n\n(1) Cold Lake (or LeGoff) \u2014 on Reserve No. 149. This school was closed on June 30th, 1933, and the reasons for this action were contained in my memorandum to you of May 20th, 1933.\n\n(2) Long Lake \u2014 on Reserve No. 123. I reported to you regarding the closing of this school in my memorandum of May 15th, 1933.\n\n(3) Frog Lake \u2014 on Reserve No. 121. Some consideration was given to the closing of this school about a year and a half ago, but the Indian Agent reported very strongly in favour of it being continued and, therefore, no action was taken. The average attendance at this school during the past three quarters has been ten (10).\n\n(4) Big Island Lake \u2014 on Reserve No. 124. Full information regarding this school was supplied to you in my memorandum of May 20th, 1933.\n\n(5) Little Island \u2014 on Reserve No. 161. This school is known officially as the \"Ministikwan Indian Day School\". It was opened in November, 1929. The average attendance for the June, September and December quarters of 1933 was seven (7).\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 20, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has again been urged to recognize a Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Big Head reserve. We are informed that there are approximately 30 children of school age. You will remember that you reported on this activity in your letter of June 6, 1932, but the Department would appreciate having a further report from you.\n\nThe Department is informed, further, that the pagan children, as well as the children who are recognized as Catholics, will attend this school. Please let me have your views in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-2-1, of June 20th, with reference to a day school on Bighead's reserve, and in reply.\n\nI would strongly recommend that a day school be established on this reserve as there are thirty children of school age in this band who should be getting proper tuition. The Reverend Father Gauthier has been operating a school at the Mission on his own since November, 1931, but it was poorly equipped and the teacher in charge was not qualified. The Indian Residential Schools at Onion Lake are full to capacity and these children could not be accommodated here at present. The Mission building which has been used for a school house is commodious, well built, and would be suitable for the purpose, and the equipment from the Cold Lake day school, which was closed last year, is available and could be easily transferred.\n\nRegarding the denominational aspect of the school, the Bighead Indians are largely Roman Catholics and Pagans. There is the odd Anglican but they are very much in the minority. These Indians have been ministered to almost exclusively by the priest from Cold Lake since I came West in 1903. The neighboring reserve, Island Lake, has a C. of E. day school operating successfully since 1909. In my opinion the Roman Catholics have as good or even better claim to a day school at Bighead's as the C. of E. had to one at Island Lake.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nR. R. No. 1\nCaintown, Ont.,\nAug. 22, 1934\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI made application, a short time ago, for a school at St. Leon Mission, Beacon Hill, Sask., and received a reply today from Rev. Father J. Gaethle, to the effect that he was awaiting word from your Department. He stated that it was necessary to have the sanction of the Official of the Dept before accepting my application.\n\nI have a Permanent Second class Certificate (Sask. No. 278-124) also Junior Matriculation. I secured my Academic training in Ontario. I have seventeen years experience having taught fourteen years in Sask. and the remainder in Ontario. During those years I have had good success having secured excellent reports. For references I wish to mention the names of\nmy last inspector, J. R. Fraser,\nHerrobert, Sask., under whom I\ntaught eight years. Also Mr. C. W.\nDunlop, M. L. A., Minister of\nHighways, Regina, Sask.\n\nI am a married man,\nthirty-six years of age and steady.\nI travelled in the northern part of\nthis province in July, near that\ndistrict, and being much interested\nin it I prefer settling there.\n\nThe priest stated in his letter,\nthat he was certain the salary would\nnot be less than eighty dollars per\nmonth.\n\nShould my application be accepted\nI would be able able to start duties\nby Sept. 1st.\n\nI would appreciate very much\nan early reply that I may be able\nto make the necessary preparations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn Z. Leider.\nSeptember 4, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe Department has again been urged to recognize a Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Big Head Reserve, No. 124. This request is strongly endorsed by the local Indian Agent.\n\nReverend Father Gauthier, the missionary, has been conducting a school at his own expense since November, 1931. He has erected a building, of frame construction, 24 ft. by 24 ft. The Agent states this building is commodious, well built and suitable for the purpose and that the equipment from the Cold Lake Day School - or LeGoff (Reserve No. 149), is available and could be easily transferred.\n\nI recently visited this agency and am of opinion that this school should be recognized and the services of a qualified teacher engaged. There are 30 children of school age, the majority members of the Roman Catholic Church - the others being pagans. Funds to pay the teacher's salary were provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year.\n\nShould you approve of this school being officially recognized and salary provided for a teacher, I would request that you forward the name of the teacher who should be appointed. I may add that a communication has been received from John Z. Lederer, R. No. 1, Caintown, Ont., who states he made application to Reverend Father Gauthier for the position. He possesses a permanent second class certificate for the province of Saskatchewan and has had 17 years' teaching experience - 14 years in Saskatchewan and three in Ontario.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDr. McCaill,\n\nRe your memorandum of September 4th, your file No. 115-2-1, dealing with the appointment of a teacher for the Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Big Head Reserve No. 124, your memorandum was drawn to the attention of the Minister this morning, who asked me to advise you that Mr. J.F. Dion, of Gurneyville, is available as a teacher.\n\nMr. Dion was at one time engaged as a teacher in the Gurneyville Indian School. It is understood that he has the qualifications necessary for the position on the Big Head Reserve.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, Oct. 23rd, 1934.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nOn the 17th instant I advised you that Mr. J.F. Dion, of Guernseyville, was available for appointment as a teacher for the Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Big Head Reserve No. 124. You will find this memorandum on your file No. 115-2-1.\n\nThe Minister has since been informed that Mr. Dion already has a position in the Roman Catholic School at Onion Lake, and that Mrs. R. Grey, of Onoway, Alberta, is available for the school on the Big Head Reserve. Mrs. Grey holds a first class Alberta professional certificate, and has had several years' experience as a teacher.\n\nThe parties interested in the school are anxious to have it opened as early as possible.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, October 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter dated August 15th last, recommending that a day school be established on Big Head Reserve, as there are 30 children of school age who should be receiving an education.\n\nIn this connection I have to advise you that the Department will assume responsibility for the expenses in carrying on the work at this school as from January first, 1935. We will be responsible for teacher's salary, classroom equipment and reasonable expenses for fuel.\n\nIt is understood that school will be conducted in the mission house - a building of frame construction, 24 ft. x 24 ft., with 10 ft. wall. You may arrange for the transfer of desks and any equipment that would be serviceable from the Cold Lake Day School and have the Big Head classroom ready for use by the date above mentioned. Should any additional classroom equipment be required, please forward a requisition.\n\nRegarding the services of a teacher, Mrs. E. Grey, Onoway, Alberta, is available. Mrs. Grey holds a first class Alberta professional certificate and has had several years' experience as a teacher. The Department approves of her appointment as from the first of January, next, with salary at the rate of $80.00 per teaching month.\n\nPlease inform Mrs. Grey accordingly and arrange with her to take up duties on or about the date mentioned. I would request, also, that you inform Rev. Father Gauthier, the missionary. This school will be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, as it is noted you state the Indians on the reserve are largely of that faith and pagan. Please advise the Department if Mrs. Grey accepts.\n\nI would request that you advise the Department the official name which you would recommend be given this school. Should it be known as \"Big Head\" or Big Island Lake\" Day School?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOctober 26, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to my memorandum dated September 4th last, regarding the establishment of a Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Big Head Reserve, No. 124, in the Onion Lake Agency, Sask., and the appointment of a teacher, I have to say that it will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Treasury Board for the establishment of the position of teacher and the salary rating allowed as from January first, 1935 - the date from which it is intended that this Department be responsible for the future management and costs of the school. The rate of salary allowed for the position is $90.00 per teaching month (10 teaching months in the school year). Funds for the purpose are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1934-35.\n\nI would request your permission to obtain the approval of the Treasury Board.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 26, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to my memorandum dated September 4th, last, regarding the establishment of a Roman Catholic Indian Day School on the Big Head Reserve, No. 124, in the Onion Lake Agency, Sask., and the appointment of a teacher, I have to say that it will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Treasury Board for the establishment of the position of teacher and the salary rating allowed as from January first, 1935 - the date from which it is intended that this Department be responsible for the future management and costs of the school.

There are thirty Indian children in the district who should be receiving an education. It is the intention to establish a school by January 1, 1935, in a mission house already constructed on the reserve and available for the purpose and to equip it from a school on another reserve which has been closed for some time. The Teacher would be paid salary at the rate of $90.00 a month for the school year of ten teaching months. Funds are available to meet the expenditure for the current fiscal year in the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nAs the opening of the above mentioned school will necessitate the employment of a Teacher additional to the number in the teaching establishment as of July 30, 1932, the undersigned begs to submit the request to the Treasury Board for favourable consideration.\n\n(Sgd.) T. G. Murphy\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-2-1, of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the opening of an Indian Day School on Bighead's Reserve, and in reply.\n\nI have notified Mrs. E. Gray, Onoway, Alberta, to the effect that her application was acceptable to the Department and that her salary would be $90.00 per teaching month. There will be no doubt about her acceptance and she will be available to commence duties on January 1st, 1935. I will be visiting Cold Lake and Bighead's reserves this week when I will arrange for the transfer of the school equipment from Cold Lake to Bighead's and will attend to the complete outfitting of the school.\n\nI would suggest the name \"Big Island Lake\" for the new day school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 21, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI am inclosing herewith copies of two memoranda to the Treasury Board requesting authorization of two positions of Teacher, Indian School; one for the Pierreville Reserve, Quebec, and one for the Big Head Reserve, No. 124, Onion Lake Agency, Sask., and have to ask you to kindly report thereon to the Treasury Board.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWilliam Fozan, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\nExaminer's Report.\n\nIn view of the fact that the class Teacher of Indian School is exempt, the Examination Branch would recommend that the Department be authorized to select the appointees to these positions.\n\nJGH/MP\n\nExaminer.\n\nNovember 27, 1934\nIndian Affairs.\n\nCreation of two positions of Teacher, Indian Schools, exempt.\n\nThe Department reports that it is its intention to establish an additional day school in the Pierreville, Quebec Agency, and in the Onion Lake Saskatchewan Agency, and it will, therefore, be necessary to increase the staff. The Department proposes to pay the School Teacher at the Pierreville Agency $65.00 per teaching month, and at the Onion Lake Agency $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nThe Department further reports that at the Pierreville Agency the school will replace one situated some distance from the location of the proposed new school closed due to lack of attendance and that the new school will be equipped by utilizing the furnishings of the closed school. It is also reported that funds are available to meet the expenditure incurred for the current fiscal year and that the proposals have been approved by the Superintendent General.\n\nThe following tabulation depicts the educational institute set up at the two agencies affected:\n\n| Agency     | School          | Teachers | No. of Teachers | Enrolment | Average attend. |\n|------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Pierreville| St.Frances      | R.C.     | 3               | 55        | 50              |\n|            | St.Frances      | C.of England | 1             | 10(estimated) | ?               |\n| Onion Lake | Frog Lake       | 1        | 16              |           | 9               |\n|            | Ministikwan     | 1        | 10              |           | 7               |\n|            | Big Head        | 1        | 30(estimated)   |           | ?               |\n\nAverage number of pupils per school (all Indian Day Schools throughout Canada) - 21.\n\n# New school.\nThe rates of compensation it is proposed to pay are justified by the Department on the following grounds:\n\nIt was proposed to pay salary at the rate of $65 a teaching month at St. Frances Anglican Indian Day School, Pierreville: (a) Attendance at this school is small and (b) salaries of teachers in the Province of Quebec are not at as high a rate as in some other provinces. The amount mentioned is, therefore, considered adequate and compares favourably with salaries allowed at other Indian schools in the Province of Quebec.\n\nIt was proposed to pay $90 a teaching month at the Big Head Indian Day School: (a) This salary compares with the salaries allowed at other Indian schools in the Province of Saskatchewan and (b) the school is situated in an out-of-the-way place and, consequently, living expenses are higher.\n\nIt is recommended that these two additions be favourably considered in order that the educational requirements of the respective agencies may be met and that it be so reported to Treasury Board, the positions being additional to the present temporary exempt establishment.\n\nWBC/DH\n\nChief, Organization Branch.\n\n(See Examiner's Report on next page)\nExaminer's Report.\n\nIn view of the fact that the class Teacher of Indian School is exempt, the Examination Branch would recommend that the Department be authorized to select the appointees to these positions.\n\nJGR/MP\n\nNovember 27, 1934\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed to forward for your information the attached copy of an approved memorandum of the Civil Service Commission in connection with the creation of two positions of Teacher, Indian School, exempt.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nSecretary.\n\nDr. Harold W.

A requisition for school material will be forwarded as soon as Mrs. Gray (teacher) checks up what is on hand and lets us know what is required. This school has been in operation for more than a year, and has considerable material which is available. As the building in which the school is to be held belongs to the church, the question of rental was discussed. I was informed that the Provincial Father, Reverend Langlois, requested a monthly rental of $20.00, but this was not acceptable to the Department, and I quite agree that it is too high. The building is a good one and well suited for a school, but on a basis of cost, which was approximately $1,000.00, a rental of $12.50 per month should be considered ample and would be acceptable to them.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Gray, teacher of the Big Island Lake Indian Day School, retired as from June 30th, last.\n\nFather Langleois has nominated the services of Mr. J. H. Lirette, Bonnyville, Alta., for the position. He possesses a second class certificate for the provinces of Manitoba and Alberta and has had 18 years' teaching experience. The Department is approving the appointment of Mr. Lirette, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. He is to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays - on September third, next.\n\nI would request that you give Mr. Lirette every assistance you can as he takes up his work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-2-1, of the 20th instant, with reference to Big Island Lake Indian Day School.\n\nOn June 15th I visited Big Island Lake and discussed the school situation with the Reverend Father Gauthier, missionary in charge. He told me that he wanted a male teacher but at the time there was no one in sight. I suggested that Mrs. Grey be permitted to carry on after the mid-summer vacation, which would give ample time to select a suitable male successor. To this the Father agreed. I then notified Mrs. Grey in the presence of her husband that she was expected to return and teach after the holidays. To this she consented. This may have no bearing on the situation but I think the Department should know. Had I been consulted I would not have recommended Mr. J. H. Lirette as her successor. If my action has complicated matters I can only express my regrets, as I assumed that I was carrying out the Department's wishes and re-employing a very capable teacher.\n\nYour instructions re Mr. J. H. Lirette will be carried out.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

U. Langlois, O.M.I., the local Provincial, nominated the services of a new teacher for the coming school year. The Department understood that you were retiring and therefore approved the appointment of Father Langlois' nominee for the position.

I am interested in any position where I can be of some use to Indians as I am a member of the Michael Band, Winterburn Agency in Alberta. I always longed to be of good to my own nationality.\n\nYours very truly,\nMrs. Ed.

HILL, ONION LAKE, Sask., for month of December, 1935.\n\nOriginal on 75-115.\n\nGENERAL: I was very pleased with the Big Island Lake Indian Day School. On December 17th there were 18 children in attendance with an enrolment of 20. They were all physically fit, well clothed, and doing well with their studies. Mr. Lirette appears to be a very capable teacher and taking great interest in his work.\nDear Mr. Koey,\n\nI am taking once more the liberty to write to you as you are in charge of the Indian Welfare. I do not know if you are aware that our school children are fed one meal at noon but for five months only. The balance of the year they are suppose to starve. Just think of the idea. The one who made that cut on the expenses of the Diet does not deserve much credit. If just found out an easy way to chase away the Indian pupils from school. It was not like this a few years ago at Leffel, Alta where I have been teaching for a while children were fed the whole scholastic year as they should be. I think that this move has been made in order to do away with the motion which is another poor way of doing things. I have to report this to the Deputy Sup't. Level as it cannot stand like that any longer. How do you want the poor little Indian children to grow\nstrong and healthy on such a strong\nration as following and just during five\nmonths only. The 24 pupils receive altogether,\n60 lbs. of meat of the time 40 lbs. bone. Also 20 lbs.\nrice for the whole school. This is what they\nget each month during five months. Judge if this\nis enough, if it has common sense! Each\npupil receive 2 little Eskimo tea biscuits every\nday in my Indian Day School here in\nthe Onion Lake Agency. It is surprising\nto notice the big amount of money spent\non the Boarding Schools compared with our\nDay School. I do not think neither that\nthe results obtained in these big schools\nare more favorable than ours. It seems\nto me that the Day Schools have been\nneglected. I do not see why, for they\ncost enormously less to operate. Our\npupils will succeed very likely as well\nas the children of the Boarding Schools.\nOur Day School pupils should be fed every\nday at noon, at least. No one will\never think that our little Indian children\nwill bring along a lunch pail, as this\npoints to have scarcely any food for one\nor two meals a day. It will be hard for the parents even to find a pail, box or paper to put the lunch in, if they had one. Many times children have come to school in the morning without breakfast. They entirely depend on their noon lunch in order to get a good meal. I wish that you would look into this matter as soon as possible and that our pupils be fed decently during the ten months that school is in operation. As I am much interested in the attendance of our young folks I am myself from my own pocket supplying the lunch for all the school children during the balance of the five months that the Board fails to give. My wife cares kind enough to do the work \"gratis prodeo\" but we do not wish to continue this anymore without being paid for. If the children are not fed here at noon time they simply will not come to school; it will be just wasting money. I am getting fairly good attendance and\nSuccess; but it takes me lots of energy, work and money as well. It costs me pretty near $30.00 in toys, pictures, candy etc., this year in order to induce my school children to come to school so that the Dept. will not waste too much money for nothing I am doing more than my share and I wish that the Dept. will encourage me by doing likewise. You certainly know what children are! They like kind words and treatments also little rewards sometimes. Please encourage them to come to school and to study. If you go through the books you will see that the Dept. did not give the least little thing to encourage children for their little success in school since it is in operation. White pupils are not treated thus. Trustees vote few dollars every year toward their school children. I would say that our little Indians will appreciate this kindness as well as any white pupils. If that does not concern you please refer to those in charge of it.\nand suggest them to do so. To give little rewards to the Day School children in other that I wish to draw your attention to, is this: Our Day School pupils are not clothed sufficiently. It is a pity to see our poor little Indians coming to school in very severe weather being 50\u00b0 below zero, half naked in rags, badly torn shoes, shivering with cold. If this was happening in a city the Dept. of Health would not allow such things to go on. It is a case not to the credit of the Indian Dept. to let children suffer thus. Many school children did not get the best little articles of clothing during the entire year. Some are to be blamed for this condition but not you nor I.\n\nI would have lots to say also about games and how playgrounds are equipped. The only admirable little thing I had for my pupils this year was a rope cut in two pieces that the children tied to two trees in order to make a swing, but a\nfew days ago to my greatest surprise came from Ottawa a football, a bat, and 2 soft balls. You can imagine how the children were pleased to get that. I have to mention that I had myself bought a football some time ago because I knew that it had no common sense to let children hang around without any games at all.\n\nAs games play an important role in the health and welfare of children I thought of mentioning the above facts to you.\n\nI heard that you were working very hard to combat tuberculosis and other diseases. I have this to tell you on this matter, it is of utmost importance to the cause. See that the Indians are lodged properly in decent shocks or houses, fed sufficiently good wholesome food, clothed properly with comfortable clothes bearing in mind that: \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" There is no wonder at all that the Indians\nOne dying of tuberculosis. When he has that dreadful disease he is left by himself and goes all around spreading it all over the Reserve. They say he that, since they are TB, they are not allowed to stay in an hospital for treatment. So they go out back on their Reserve to distribute the microbes very freely to the poor little unfed, unloved, poorly sheltered children.\n\nDear Mister Hoey, you see that I am writing to you very freely as you suggested to do in your circular letter to the teachers. If you find this letter too strong you will excuse me, for really I am revolted sometimes to see how things go on the Reserve. I am thinking about a scheme for children leaving school a kind of following I might submit at sometime later. I expect to go east during vacation and I would greatly enjoy having a talk with you re the welfare work Indians.\n\nHoping to hear from you,\n\nI am Yours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6296, file 626-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 8, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo and to state, by way of comment, that I was somewhat disturbed to learn of the existing conditions in your district.\n\nIt has been the policy of the Department, in the past, to establish Indian day schools on reserves where home conditions were reasonably good and where an adequate food supply, sufficient to meet the needs of the children, was available. It would appear that provision has always been made, in residential schools, for orphan children and children from comparatively destitute homes. In view of the statements contained in your communication, it is just possible that we may have to seriously consider the advisability of transferring the pupils now in attendance at your school to one or more of the residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe records here indicate that you were supplied with 950 lbs. of biscuits; 300 lbs. of beef; and 100 lbs. of rice, as a food ration for the pupils in attendance at your school, to cover a five month period. We have been assured, from the Indian Agent, that the beef supplied was of standard quality, and we know that the biscuits are highly nutritious. If, as you contend, however, a number of pupils reach school without breakfast, it is too much to expect that even the noonday lunch is sufficient in itself to maintain physical fitness. I notice in the reports, also, reference to the cultivation of a school garden. Has it been possible during the present year to obtain from this garden vegetables for\n\nMr. J. H. Lirette,\nTeacher,\nBig Island Lake Indian Day School,\nBeacon Hill, Sask.\nuse in the preparation of the noon lunch?\n\nOur experience here has been that, in the majority of schools where the noon lunch is supplied, it has not been necessary to provide for this lunch during the entire 10 month period. I am inclined to think that, in most cases, the pupils welcome an opportunity to return to their home at the noon hour. However, I am not sufficiently familiar with the conditions confronting you to state at this time exactly what our policy at your school should be.\n\nI was gratified to learn that it is your intention to visit Ottawa during the holiday period. It is scarcely necessary to add that I shall be glad to meet you and discuss with you problems peculiar to your district at that time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey, Sup't. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAs it is a very long time that I did not write to you re. Indian Welfare, I thought of writing a long letter. I think that you are now in a position to tell me about your plan, for an adequate follow-up system. I have greatly that idea at heart, since it seems ridiculous to spend so much money on young Indians which is contributing to a kind of fiasco. I am a great advocate for a genuine follow-up system. Our ancient pupils of Boarding Schools here, are the worst youngsters of the Reserve. Their little knowledge of English language makes them think...\nthat they are smarter than the other Indians on the Reserve. With their little dose of instruction which they cannot employ to good advantage as they do not continue to read nor write, making them worst by giving them chance to mix up with English speaking people, to frequent all the dances in the district, to sneak after moonshine and hooch. But a word, I am on the spot here and am able to judge these young people. Not a single one got married according to the law last year. There was all of them who lived quite a time with their future wives before being married legally. I have to be cold, reprimand them scare them in order to induce them to be married correctly. At present they are neither good Indians nor they do not live like the good White men. The trouble is often living too long to learn the White People ways, they are sent back home with the old folks who are dirty, poor, sloppy.\nLazy, stubborn, being pleased with their children's education for now their children are ashamed of them, to see them so filthy and backward. These young people coming home with nothing to do and nothing to work with. Parents have no cattle, no instruments, no wells, no good horses etc., etc.\n\nThey get disgusted and pass their time not at hunting deer or fishing but hunting women, young girls, gambling, drinking etc. Now Mr. Hay, I am not exaggerating just come here on our Reserve in the month of January or February you will find out if the Government is to be proud of its alumni! If you were to see the dwellings of our Indians and their belongings and think that these people are wards of the Canadian Govt. you would be ashamed as I am ashamed myself when White People pass through the Reserve and see that state of affairs! We have the finest forest of spruce on...\nour Reserve lots going to waste by fire etc., and to see that there is not a single frame house on the entire Reserve. Somebody is to be blamed for this condition, but not myself. It is obvious that something must be done to put our Indians on their feet as self-supporting Indians instead of being liabilities. They should be assets to our country. I cannot see why this cannot be done. Indians way and sympathy seem to discourage the strongest will after a few years working for them. We are inclined to let everything go. But it should not be so. Everybody working with Indians should be convinced enough to keep to his duty and fulfill it at all cost, not to let loose the reins of these bronchos. Every strict control must be kept over them. It seems that they are left to themselves, they are not punished and they do according to their whims. I am suffering here on account of that lack of control. They build and act according\nto their will not according to common sense and to their welfare I can do practically nothing as I am not booked up in my work. Not a single Indian was called up to work for war efforts. There are about 4 able men here on the Reserve. Talk about the poor women leading a filthy and lazy life. Nothing to do but near the whole day long except to boil tea, sweat out their tin pots etc., to make a little bannock by the fire place. Some material should be sent to them along with necessary tools in order that they could knit something for the soldiers. They should be busy and make money, but it is up to the Govt. to supply them means to work and to pay them for their work. This is very important. In the Onion Lake Agency there are too many small Reserves like here, Big Rock, and Lion's Head, Long Lake and Frog Lake. These have\nno Farm Instructors and consequently somewhat neglected. Some of them should be put under some Farm Instructors and be started to improve. It is a great drawback to have so many small Reserves. As it is hard to grow them as they should but have a good strong Reserve consisting of at least two inhabitants, all if more the better it would be. In the best convenient place should be the school, church, hospital, store buildings, store, work shops for men and women, houses with gardens arranged. Each family should have about acres of private land and not too far away a big community hall for the welfare of the whole tribe. Every able man should work now and then at first time at this Community Farm. The Farm Instructor must be following up the Indians pretty near during the whole day. There should be a civil organization pretty near like in a College, chief councilors,\njury, police etc., a doubled cell prison for short infractions. I have assuming the Native School or matrons under care of competent women for the delinquent women. I cannot tell you all particulars in this letter, but any way you might get a little idea of my plan which I think will lead the Indians to be quickly self-supporting and adopt people of Canada. I am coming now back to the Board of Residential Schools for a follow-up system. So my opinion, the girls should be kept in the Boarding Schools until 18 years of age and be married then as soon as possible before they are contaminated. The young couples should be given a household outfit. A decent house, stove, utensils, etc., a good tract of land, horse harness, wagon, sheep, cows, pigs, chickens etc., etc. Food for wintering animals during winter if any. The old people must keep away from young. The overseer of the Reserve must follow them up closely and make himself obeyed.\nNow, the tools that they were taught to work with at the Boarding School should be kept in the Blacksmith's shop and Carpenter's shop on the Reserve. To have tools only at the Boarding School and nothing (as it is the law now) on the Reserve seems absurd! You see that the Federal Govt. has to put up quite a sum of money, but you know that: One cannot do something with nothing. It is amazing the amount of money spent for Indians with no good results, around here anyway.\n\nNow Mr. Henry if you need me here on this Reserve to make a trial for a follow-up system I am ready to help you, to cooperate with you and make the necessary experiments according to your dictates i.e., directions. I could be the organizer and overseer of the Reserve. If we never try something nothing would be done and large amounts of money spent needlessly. The state of affairs will remain unchanged if not bettered.\nright away as the Indian population is increasing. Indians have a right for a new deal also! Since my years here in the West, schools have been operating for the supposed benefit of our Indians. I wonder how many are in a position now to take up their hands in jobs as agents, farm instructors, teachers etc etc. These jobs should gradually shift to the Indians themselves. Well, one thing is necessary for this. There should be in each province of the West one good High School (Boarding School) to take up boys and girls from the 6th grade to the College Curriculum. For the University course they should be following up the Public University in their own Province. Everything to be paid by the Indian Affairs Branch. One of the already existing Boarding School could be altered to receive somewhere like 200 pupils. Soon you would have well educated boys & girls who would be able to take up jobs belonging to them in the Indian Affairs Branch. How do...\nThe failure of the Indian Affairs Branch in the past in legislating for the Indians has been due to the omission to include the Indians himself. The Indians is a citizen of Canada without the rights, privileges, and duties of citizenship. He is discriminated against by Civil Service rules. He cannot obtain employment in the Indian Service. He is not taught enough to care for himself. Paternalism has discouraged him. He is in general irresponsible, intelligent, and willing to participate in self-government. No race of people can exist and make progress under such low social-economic conditions. Good health is necessary if any human being hopes to function in the community. The home atmosphere must be proper. Today many Indians are suffering from starvation and disease. Housing conditions are deplorable. The death rate is high. Educational progress cannot be realized under adverse economic\nand social conditions. As a rule, seldom the Indians supply complete the 5th grade in the Elementary School. Handicrafts are neglected. Indians under proper conditions and favorable environment acts as any normal human being and with gratifying results. The problem to do is to make the Indians an intelligent citizen, law abiding and self-supporting. In regard to the Indians as he is today, the most pressing need is not that of his health which was sadly neglected, but his education which goes hardly beyond the 5th grade or taken into consideration vocational or professional training, and the lack of methods in showing him the habits of industry and economy. Like all problems it is easy to state but not so simple to provide the necessary solutions. In nearly every instance no one could for care to seek a solution. The main difficulty in the solution of the Indian question has been the failure to\nrecognize its magnitude and numerous complications. The Indian is asking what his future is to be at the hands of White men. The Indian is regarded as without ambition or initiative without any capacity or desire towards improvement; this is false! If it is necessary that this attitude of indifference on the part of the more powerful race must be changed, it must be replaced by an intense practical interest, sympathy, and co-operation between the White man and the Indian. This will afford him the opportunity and desire to better himself through a belief in his capacity of doing so. Poverty and unsatisfactory condition is the basis of Indian trouble today. The Indian did not appreciate the value of their land because of his lack of training in farming, the need for equipment, financial credit and general planning. Some Indians seem to be satisfied with their condition but they are not. He is asked to be placed with an existence in idleness and no responsibility. This attitude may be rather one of comfort.\ndiscouragement. It is a type of Oriental fatalism and passive resistance due to hopelessness of the condition.\n\nI sincerely hope that these lines will be accepted with the same spirit as they were written.\n\nYours Devotedly,\n\nJ. H. Liritte,\nTeacher of Big Island Lake Indian Day School, Big Head Reserve, Onion Lake Agency, Redcon Hill, Sask.\nOttawa, April 20, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Lirette:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 6 and have read over with a great deal of interest the information contained therein. I regret, however, that the limited time at my disposal has not enabled me to make a thorough study of the proposals you have submitted.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that a \"follow-up\" system was inaugurated by this Branch early in the year 1937. I am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter sent out to Indian agents at that time. The returns received at this date appear to be on the whole fairly satisfactory. The majority of the Indian residential school graduates appear to take good, immediately following their discharge from school. We do not appear, however, to have had a report from the Onion Lake Agency, and I am today communicating with the Indian agent in respect to this matter.\n\nThere is at this time an abundance of discarded military clothing and it is just possible that if the women on your reserve were organized they could remodel this clothing and thus make it very serviceable, not only for children, but for adults as well. Would it be possible for you to give a little direction to the organization of the women along the lines I have suggested?\n\nThere is also the matter of gardening. A supreme attempt should be put forth this year to interest our Indians in the production of foodstuffs, particularly vegetables. The Indians should look upon work of this kind as a patriotic duty, in view of the acute food shortage existing across the Dominion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. J. H. Lirette,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nBeacon Hill, Big Head Reserve, Sask.\nOttawa, April 20, 1943.\n\nMr. D. H. Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nThe teacher of the Big Island Lake Indian Day School, Mr. J. H. Lirette, in a somewhat lengthy communication received by this Branch, is of the opinion that conditions on the reserve are in no sense satisfactory.\n\nMr. Lirette complains somewhat bitterly that the residential school graduates do not accept responsibility immediately following their discharge from school. Many of these graduates, according to him, are not legally married. He complains also that a great many of the women are idle and that these women might be engaged in the repair of discarded military clothing. We have, as you are no doubt aware, an abundance of military clothing available for distribution. If you believe the women of this reserve could be organized for work of this kind, you should communicate with Mr. Christianson in respect to the matter. Women's organizations on other reserves have done exceptionally fine work in the repair of this clothing.\n\nYou will receive a circular letter in respect to the \"follow-up\" system, and it would be appreciated if you would have the forms sent forward to the agency a few years ago filled in and returned to this Branch. You might, at the same time, let us have any comments you may care to offer in respect to conditions generally on the reserve where Mr. Lirette is in charge of the day school.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBeacon Hill, Sask.\nMay 3rd, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI was surely happy to receive your letter of May 2nd. I was greatly pleased to know that you took my letter with interest. The information that I gave you were written after great reflection from my part and I really believe that if my suggestions were put into practice you would see a great change for the better in no time, even Northern Reserve (Township 63). That scheme is not a utopian but very practical. Of course it requires money. With nothing you can do nothing say the proverb. It seems that there are so many different needs for so many different Reserves that a uniform way of dealing with all cannot be kind of absurd! Many thanks for...\nhad help for many many years from Indian Affairs Branch by letting them have a farm instructor and other kinds of help that it should be our turn now to how provisions community. The Board think was formed around 25 years ago. It is about since that time that I know these Indians they were coming to L.S.F. etc. each year for their treaty when Mr. Gibbald was agent. I have been teaching at L.S.F. Indian Day School thus I met these primitive Indians. Occasionally they do not seem to have advanced at all yet if there is something I think that they are poor. They have however kindly thought to hire an instructor or somebody in overalls able to look after their interest.\n\nMy wife is very willing to help the women women in their work of mending old clothes into decent clothing. I would be grateful to you if you would send discarded military clothing. I thank you in advance for your kind cooperation.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have three\nsuccessful Clubs in the Agency, especially the one on Frog\nLake Reserve, which is conducted by Mrs Hunt, wife of the\nday school teacher.\n\nThe \"follow-up\" system forms for 1938 graduates\nwill be forwarded under separate cover at an early date.\n\nDonald H. Cameron\nIndian Agent\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that Mr. Cameron, the Indian Agent at Onion Lake, informed me the Big Island Lake Indian Day School in his Agency has never been inspected by the Public School Inspector. He has been in touch with Mr. Bowes, one of the Superintendents of Schools here in Saskatchewan and he informed Mr. Cameron he was quite willing to inspect our school at this point if we ask him to do so.\n\nI instructed Mr. Cameron to get in touch with Mr. Bowes for the purpose of having him inspect the school when he is next in that vicinity.\n\nThis is for your information.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nBeacon Hill Sask.\nNov. 28th 1943\n\nR.A. Hoey, Dept. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe Indian Department school teachers are in a precarious condition compared to the Provincial school teachers. As you are aware, the Indian school teachers are so far apart, that it is very hard for us to get together and discuss our problems. We entirely depend on conditions as at present on the sense of justice and fair play of our officials in the Indian Affairs Branch. Few Indian School Teachers tried, by correspondence to have us join the Saskatchewan Teachers Federation but were unable by themselves to bring things about to a happy conclusion. Consequently I appeal to you to take this matter up please. Would you be kind enough to let me know what you have no plans to allow your school teachers to get\na pension when they reach old age. That is certainly a lacuna that should be remedied as soon as possible. The teachers in white communities have a pension scheme; they are paying at the present time 1/3 of their salary is deducted towards their superannuation. Once, a few years ago, I remember that two teachers were working out plans to have us join the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation; but the objection was that the Federal Gov't was paying the teachers' salary. Maybe an understanding could be reached re payment to the Federation by the Federal Gov't, that would be satisfactory to all concerned. Thus we would belong to the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation, mean the teachers of Saskatchewan, and be able to get a superannuation, if the Indian Affairs Branch does not do it.\n\nI wish also the the Dept would make new regulations in order that the school teachers be considered as Civil Servants. Like we are at present, we are discriminated against other Gov't jobs within the Agency, we are on the same footing as the Indians. While the Agent, the Secretary, the Former Instructors are civil servants, we teachers are taking a back seat. We cannot be promoted to higher jobs in our Dept.\nEven our salaries are always the same, but our families are increasing! In the Province of Alberta, teachers have their salaries increased at some fixed time. Most of all the other professions are asking for higher wages. My salary being insufficient I have to recourse to living alone and still that is not quite enough to pay for the expenses of my four children who are in boarding schools.\n\nPlease think over these reflections and work out something that will be satisfactory to your teaching profession. Your teachers are very interested in the welfare of the Indians. They stand as the spearhead of the army in combating ignorance, ill-mannered children and parents, filthy, diseased and ungrateful people. We surely deserve sympathy from our Officials.\n\nYours Devotedly, in the great human cause of the Indians' Welfare.\n\nJ. F. Lorette\nTeacher of Indian Day School.\nOttawa, December 7, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 28, in which you discuss a superannuation fund that might be established for the benefit of Indian day school teachers.\n\nI may state that the desirability of establishing such a fund has been discussed by the Minister of this Department and by the officials of this Branch on a number of occasions within the last five year period. The difficulties standing in the way of the establishment of such a fund appear to be, for the time being at least, insurmountable. I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter recently sent forward by me to Mr. Jos. Trohak, of Arbury, Sask. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. I might add that in my judgment there is not even a remote possibility of the establishment of such a fund at any time during the years immediately ahead of us. I make this statement, being aware that you have four children to support. In view of this fact, it is just possible that you may desire to seek a position in one of the provincial schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. J. H. Lirette,\nTeacher,\nBig Island Lake Indian Day School,\nBeacon Hill, Sask.\nOttawa, December 7, 1943.\n\nMr. D. H. Cameron, Indian Agent, Onion Lake, Sask.\n\nI am anxious to know if you have yet secured a report on the Big Island Lake Indian Day School from the provincial inspector. If you have not received such a report, would it be possible to obtain one at any time in the immediate future? The teacher in charge of this school, Mr. J. H. Lirette, is in almost constant communication with the Department. We have received three letters from him within the last week. If a report from the provincial inspector is not available, would it be possible to secure from you an expression of opinion with respect to this teacher and his work?\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch - Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your Letter No. 115-2-1, of December 7th, with reference to having a report on the Big Island Lake Indian Day School, and in reply.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter I communicated with Mr. G. A. Gosselin, Meadow Lake, Sask., provincial school inspector, and enquired whether he had been able to inspect this school. Mr. Gosselin replied that weather permitting he would inspect the Big Island Lake School on December 21st and would forward the report immediately. To date I have not received the report.\n\nOn December 18th when visiting Bighead Reserve in connection with the fire killed timber which is being salvaged there, I asked Mr. Lirette what he had been writing to the Department about. He replied that he desired to join the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation with the object of obtaining superannuation benefits, that the Department had informed him there was no hope of superannuation for Indian Day School teachers.\n\nI might add that I have found Mr. Lirette of an excitable and somewhat erratic disposition, and always complaining about something. He is a confirmed letter writer. The school attendance is low and I do not know much about Mr. Lirette's ability as a teacher, but I think a refresher course would be indicated in his case.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Mr. Christianson's letter dated April 5, 1944.\n\nI might say the school on the Big Head Reserve has accomplished very little. When I was there last there was not an Indian on the reserve who could speak any English, therefore if we cannot get somebody else we might just as well close the school because we are only wasting money. I would like very much to have you discuss this matter with the officials of the Church and see if they could appoint someone who has some \"go\" in him because we certainly need someone like that here who can supervise the Indians.\nOttawa,\nApril 19, 1944.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nMr. J.H. Lirette was appointed teacher of the Big Island Lake School in the Onion Lake Agency on September 1, 1935. His appointment at that time was recommended by Very Reverend U. Langlois, O.M.I., who was then Provincial of the Oblate Order at Edmonton. A report recently received from Mr. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I might say the school on the Big Head Reserve has accomplished very little. When I was there last there was not an Indian on the reserve who could speak any English, therefore, if we cannot get somebody else, we might just as well close the school because we are only wasting money. I would like very much to have you discuss this matter with the officials of the Church and see if they could appoint someone who has some 'go' in him because we certainly need someone like that here who can supervise the Indians.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would make some inquiries with a view to ascertaining if the Church authorities interested would be prepared to nominate a more capable teacher for this school. I will be pleased to hear from you when you have made the inquiries mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O.

In this regard I would refer you to my letter of April 19.\n\nSubsequently we received another letter from Mr. Christianson in which he writes as follows:\n\n\"Regarding my letter of April 5th last with reference to the school teacher on the Big Island Lake Reserve I wrote to Agent Cameron at the same time, asking him what opinion he had of the teacher in question, and his reply is as follows:\n\n\"I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 309-4CM-309-4CM, of the 5th instant, the contents of which I have carefully noted.

As it is very difficult at the present time to secure any kind of teachers for our Indian schools, I hope that you will give Mr. Lirette another chance.\n\nBeside his work as teacher, I am informed that Mr. Lirette's influence over the Indians is very good and that he likes his work. Moreover it is possible that your agent may have been influenced by personal difficulties with Mr. Lirette and that his complains are not altogether well founded.\n\nIn any case, I hope that you will be good enough to reemploy Mr. Lirette and give him another year's trial.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O.

Lirette.\n\nIt has been decided to re-appoint him and his work between November and the end of June, 1946 should be carefully watched and a report submitted to us about June 1st next so a decision may be made regarding his re-employment for the academic year 1946-47.\n\nI understand he will be prepared to begin duties in the near future and I enclose the usual forms which he should complete and return.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 29th October, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant in which you state that due to the shortage of teachers, you have been requested to name Mr. J.H.

He also possesses a State Life Certificate of Columbia University.\n\nWith the above status of service it would seem that his knowledge of English is more than that possessed by the ordinary teacher; I would even say that it must be just as good as that possessed by any teacher.\n\nWe now find it so difficult to secure competent teachers for our Indian Day Schools, that the information which I am now giving you regarding Mr. Lirette will dispel any misunderstanding that may have risen concerning him in the Department, and that his reappointment next year will only be a matter of course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.C.

He was horrified that a girl should ride a bike, and said I was not to ride it on the reserve as it set a very bad example.\n\nHe wished to teach at least half an hour of catechism every day, fifteen minutes of Cree and Cree syllables, in addition to choir practise, all in school hours. I was to see that the children attended Vespers every night from seven to eight. Of course I was to be there. This was especially hard when on Saturday I would go home or to some friend's. I also was trying to take my Grade Eleven and trying not to let it interfere with my school work.\n\nHe, himself, would come over for an hour or so in the evening, to talk, but figured whoever else might come, it was wrong. He always wanted to start a credit union and a co-op store for the children. I do not believe this is the best way of teaching. He always wanted me to teach against Socialism. These Indians are a backward race and first they must know what it is before you can say it is wrong.\n\nHoping this is sufficient information for you.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. Gertrude Lepine.\nBig Island Lake Indian Day School,\nBEAON HILL, Saskatchewan,\nJune 17th, 1948.\n\nMr. Packman,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies,\nMEADOW LAKE, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Packman:\n\nDuring the past term many difficulties have arisen, as it seems the priest was allowed to enter and teach the Catholic children catechism and leaving the others with nothing to do, at any period of time suitable to him each day. He also wished to teach Cree and Cree syllables in school. High Mass was conducted at the Church every first Friday of the month, and also any other day he cared to have it. He expected the children to attend, although it was in school hours. When I was opposed to this, he began to make trouble.\n\nI was light housekeeping in the small house at the school. He was opposed to my having Protestant visitors as he claimed it was a bad example. He also did not approve of Catholic visitors. One Sunday a Catholic family came to visit and stayed to dine. He went to their home at a later date and told them they had no business bothering me. This happened in many different cases. At another time two young men were passing and stopped to say \"Hello\". As I had my supper prepared I asked them to join me. They left soon after as I went to Evening Prayer at seven, and they left before, but this, he claimed, was disrespectful behavior, in spite of the fact I had gone through school with them.\n\nHe also was opposed to theatres, playing sports in public, or dancing. I do not make a practice of going school nights, as I have my weekends.\n\nI have tried to follow the Curriculum as closely as possible but it is hard to do with these others in my path always.\n\nWith these obstacles in my way I feel I cannot complete my duties with complete satisfaction, so I am resigning.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Miss) Gertrude Alice Marie Lepine.\nNorthern Pine, Sask.,\nMay 31st, 1948.\n\nMr. H.S. Packman,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake.\n\nDear Mr. Packman:\n\nWill it be possible for you to pay a visit to this school before the closing of this term.

Gertrude Lepine.\n\nVisited Big Island Lake Day School on 11 June, 1948, and was informed by Miss Lepine of her intention to resign.\n\nI requested her to give serious consideration to the matter and to advise me her decision.\n\nSgd. H.S.P.\nNorthern Pine, Saskatchewan,\nJanuary 15th, 1948.\n\nMr. Packman,\nOnion Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Packman:\n\nFrom what information I can receive Maria Sandfly, child of George and Marie Rose Sandfly, as you wrote, must be the same as O28 Marie Anne Sandfly, who is going to school.\n\nReceived the parcel of ointments.\n\nReturning your eye chart under special cover. Thanks for the use. I will send you a list of the children with poor eyes as soon as I hear when the eye specialist comes in.\n\nI am staying at home now. I handle the medicines while I am there in the day.\n\nAs for my problems with the priest, it would be too difficult to explain in a letter. I try to do my best in teaching. He objects to me going to dances (which I go to once in a while on a Friday) to my friends and everything else that he can find fault with or imagine.\n\nHe says he'll see that I get fired. The way things stand now, I don't care, but I wanted to warn you ahead of time.\n\nI can hardly explain everything in a letter so I will leave it this way.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. Gertrude Lepine.\nMeadow Lake,\nSask.\n7 July, 48.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nI am forwarding through your office the resignation of Miss G. Lepine, School Teacher, Big Island Lake Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Lepine complained of some difficulty with regard to interference by Father Chataigner late in December, 1947, and you will note my reply to her, under date of January 2nd of this year. The subsequent correspondence in enclosed file is self-explanatory.\n\nI visited Miss Lepine on the 11th of June, and she informed me of her intention to resign at the end of the term. I asked her to give very serious consideration to the matter, before submitting her resignation.\n\nMy feeling was that the situation had deteriorated to such an extent that her resignation would be forwarded.\n\nI feel the loss of Miss Lepine's services at the Big Island Lake School, is to be regretted, but under the conditions imposed by the second Paragraph of Department Letter No. 115-2-1 (E.l), dated 17th March, was to be expected.\n\nSgd. H.S. Packman,\nActing Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nJuly 9th, 1948.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. H.S. Packman, Acting Superintendent, Meadow Lake Agency, copies of letters of Miss Gertrude Lepine, Day School Teacher, Big Island Lake Indian Day School, dated January 15th, 1948, May 31st, and June 17th, also a copy of Mr. Packman's letter to Miss Lepine dated the 2nd of January, 1948.\n\nMiss Lepine was engaged at the beginning of the past school term commencing September, 1947. She has no teaching certificate, has not completed Grade II, and, of course, has no Normal training. I visited her school, accompanied by Mr. Packman, about three months after she commenced her duties. Previous to visiting her school I was surprised to find that one so poorly qualified had been engaged, but I was also surprised when I visited the school to find that she was doing a better than average job with very backward Indian children, notwithstanding the fact that she had received no teacher training, in fact I would not hesitate to say that she was doing a remarkably good job. The children were bright and quick with their answers and were speaking English quite well after having made practically no progress whatever with the previous teacher, a Mr. Lirette.\n\nI am not urging that Miss Lepine should reconsider her resignation as I think it was a mistake to engage her in the first place knowing she had no training for the work. However, I must point out very emphatically that if and when another teacher is appointed to that school there must be a more thorough understanding between the Superintendent, the teacher, and the Missionary as to their relationship toward each other and the relationship of the work of each to the work of the other.\n\nI am sure we will never get a satisfactory teacher to remain at that school subject to continuous criticism and interference by the Missionary. While I heartily approve of the Missionary being permitted to give some religious teaching to the school children it should not be carried to a point where a considerable part of the teaching week is devoted to religious teaching.\n\nOur Indian day schools in this.......\nOur Indian day schools in this province have been severely criticised by some of the provincial authorities and I am sure that if Miss Lepine's story reached some of them the Department would be placed in a very difficult position.\n\nJ.P.B.

I had previously discussed this matter with both Father Plourde and the Reverend Father Provincial but did not have at that time the detail provided in this last letter of yours.\n\nWe could attempt to persuade Miss Lepine to remain at this school but in all probability things would be made very difficult for her. However, we are quite prepared to accept whatever recommendation you wish to make in this regard. We must remember that Miss Lepine, however, might be persuaded to spend a most unpleasant year in view of the opposition she would undoubtedly receive from the Missionary.\n\nIn view of your comments concerning this teacher's ability, we are prepared to offer her a position as teacher at the Fond du Lac Day School in the Athabasca Indian Agency. This school is in a converted Hudson's Bay Company Warehouse and I understand that Miss Lepine could probably board with the Hudson's Bay Factor there.\n\nAt the present time, the Missionary has been teaching at this school but he has assured us that he is only too willing to give up his duties as teacher whenever we can secure a lay teacher.\nMiss Lepine's salary there would be at the rate of $132.00 a teaching month. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. J.W. Stewart, Superintendent, Athabasca Indian Agency, Fort Chipewyan, Alberta so that he will be aware of our proposal to transfer Miss Lepine.\n\nI will expect to hear further from you if Miss Lepine is willing to accept this transfer.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Agency.\n\nBFN/RM.\nJuly 19, 1948.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nBig Island Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nYou will recall that I discussed with you and Reverend Father Provincial a rather strained relationship which exists between the teacher and the Missionary of the above Reserve.\n\nApparently Miss Lepine is making an honest attempt, in spite of her lack of qualifications, to do a good job as teacher at this school. In fact, we have had several comments that the pupils are making better progress under her than they were under Mr. Lirette.\n\nRecent correspondence indicates that the Missionary has been unduly critical of Miss Lepine's work in and out of the school.

Lepine. She is doing a splendid job and has the confidence of all the Indians on the Reserve. While this lady has not all the qualifications necessary to be known as a qualified teacher yet on every hand her work is so outstanding due to her natural ability that I would recommend that she be retained in this work. Previous reports have indicated that she and the missionary on this reserve are not co-operating to the fullest. For that reason she is definite in saying that she will not continue teaching in that school. My investigation to date would prove that no blame can be attached to Miss Lepine in this matter. Should she be moved, I would strongly recommend that consideration be given to her appointment in some other Indian School.\n\n(Sgd) J. A. Davis,\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopied: V.S.\nPERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL\n\nMay 27, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nBig Island Lake Indian Day School\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nI have discussed the general situation at this school with Father Flourde who has discussed it with Father Provincial. It has been decided to watch carefully how the missionary gets along with the new teacher, Miss Forcier. I would ask you to advise the local superintendent to report on any similar friction arising as happened with Miss Lepine. If such trouble arises, then it is obvious that the missionary is a most difficult man with whom to work, and the necessary action can be taken to request a transfer.\n\nAs I indicated above, we are quite prepared to accept Miss Forcier's application, and she will be classified as a Grade I teacher at a starting salary of $102.00 a teaching month. When I hear further from you, I will send her the usual official letter of appointment.\n\nFather Flourde suggested, and I agree with him, that, if possible, she should take a housekeeper to the school with her. If she has a younger sister or an aunt or cousin who could stay with her, I think it would be to the benefit of all concerned. I would like to have Mr. Kearns available for use in a very isolated school and have written to him about such a post. If Miss Forcier is available for Big Island Lake, then we will consider her application accepted.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We will be responsible for teacher's salary, classroom equipment and reasonable expenses for fuel.\n\nIt is understood that school will be conducted in the mission house - a building of frame construction, 24 ft. x 24 ft., with 10 ft. wall. You may arrange for the transfer of desks and any equipment that would be serviceable from the Cold Lake Day School and have the Big Head classroom ready for use by the date above mentioned. Should any additional classroom equipment be required, please forward a requisition.\n\nRegarding the services of a teacher, Mrs. E. Grey, Onoway, Alberta, is available. Mrs. Grey holds a first class Alberta professional certificate and has had several years' experience as a teacher. The Department approves of her appointment as from the first of January, next, with salary at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nPlease inform Mrs. Grey accordingly and arrange with her to take up duties on or about the date mentioned.

Besides, $3.50 for meat is allowed per month during the winter months. You will admit that such an allowance is rather meagre. The Missionary has heretofore borne the expenses and this seems to me unreasonable not to say unjust. The children need more dishes for their lunch (kitchen utensils) and also play games.\"\n\nIn connection with the above, our file shows that $3.50 a month was allowed last year but you have not yet applied for any authority to expend this amount during the current year. I would again point out that a request for authority to expend amounts for midday meal purposes should be forwarded to the Department early in September of each year in order that the matter may receive our consideration.\n\nPlease let me know if you consider $3.50 a month is sufficient to allow for midday meal purposes at the Big Island Lake School in view of the fact that the Department has already supplied biscuits.\n\nYou might, also, let me know what amount the missionary has expended for midday meal purposes.\n\nIf more kitchen utensils are required for serving the midday lunch, a request for the purchase of same should be forwarded to us. No such articles have previously been refused. Please give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T.

Manderson, Esq., Beacon Hill, Sask., for Beef for Big Island Lake Indian Day School, Nov. & Dec.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-5-5 dated Sept. 25, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-2-5, of the 7th ultimo, with reference to the Big Island Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI visited this school on December 17th, and the Missionary, Reverend Father Gauthier, was absent. Consequently, I did not get the information requested regarding the amount expended by him for the mid-day meals.\n\nIn reply to the second paragraph of your letter Authority was asked for on September 19th, and received on September 25th in your 115-5-5, of that date, to purchase the necessary beef for day schools. The maximum amount of beef allowed monthly, viz. 50 lbs. was provided for this school.\n\nAs stated, the mid-day meal consists of biscuits and beef in the form of a stew. This gives them a little over two ounces of beef each, in addition to soup and a full ration of biscuits. This ration has sufficed in the past and is exactly the same as our other day schools are receiving. Rice added to the soup would improve it and I estimated for rice for this purpose but did not receive it. We received 800 lbs only, for all purposes in the Agency.\n\nRe kitchen utensils. I checked these over on my last visit and found sufficient plates, cups, knives, etc., for fifteen pupils, but the attendance has increased to eighteen, with twenty enrolled. The following is requested by the teacher and I would be pleased to receive authority to purchase them:\n\n6 Plates\n6 Cups\n5 Window Shades\n1 pr. Barber's Scissors\n1 Barber's Comb and Barber's Clippers\n1 Dust Pan and 1 Water Pail\n1 Pot for boiling meat.\n\nWhen Mr. Lirette\nWhen Mr. Lirette, the teacher, started his duties I requested him to forward a complete list of what was required in this line, and the list he forwarded was incomplete. I procured what was then asked for, amounting to $12.65, on the Department's authority of August 15th. As previously stated, rice would improve the mid-day meal, and I would recommend that it be provided for the schools. Fifty pounds each was the quantity asked for.\n\nAt the conclusion of the winter months beef will not be available, and something more than dry biscuits will be required. Dried milk has been tried and the children do not like it. Whole milk is not available, and the best substitute, in my opinion, would be cocoa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 30th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, you may purchase the quantity of rice which you consider necessary for midday meal purposes at the Indian day schools in your agency. It is understood, of course, that the soup should only be served until the end of March. (See official letter of September 25th, 1935).\n\nYou may, also, purchase the following articles:\n\n- 6 plates\n- 6 cups\n- 5 window shades\n- 1 pr. barber's scissors\n- 1 barber's comb\n- 1 barber's clippers\n- 1 dust pan\n- 1 water pail\n- 1 pot\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department has not been authorizing midday meals during the fine weather and, under these circumstances, the Department is not prepared to authorize the purchase of cocoa to be used after the end of March.\n\nIf you refer to official letter of the 7th ultimo, you will note that the Department asked what amount the missionary has expended for midday meal purposes. Did you make any inquiries in this regard and, if so, what information did you receive?\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. J. T.

If conditions on this reserve are as bad as the teacher states, it may be necessary to consider placing a number of them from the poorer families in a residential school.\n\nPlease interview the teacher and let me have a complete report in connection with conditions at Big Island Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

In addition to the generous amount of meat and biscuits supplied, 100 pounds of rice was added as the teacher considered rice indispensable in making the mid-day meal. Rice is not supplied to the other day schools. The children's clothing is not good but this applies to all children attending day schools - but I think it is as good at Big Island Lake as the other day schools in the Agency.\n\nThe day schools with the assistance they are getting from the Department at present cannot successfully compete with the residential schools. I pointed this out in my letter 99-18-1, of August 28, 1936, to the Department, with some recommendations for getting the day schools on a better and more satisfactory basis, and received a reply to the effect that some action would be taken along the lines I suggested.

Long Lake and Big Island Lake schools will require 60 pounds each monthly, while 40 pounds each, monthly, will suffice for Frog lake and Island Lake schools. One thousand pounds in all will be required and should be available at approximately 7\u00a2 per pound.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ.T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following with reference to the mid-day meal supplied the children attending the four Indian day schools where there is a total enrolment of eighty.\n\nAt present it consists of beef and biscuits. Dry milk was supplied for a time and dropped, as it did not prove very satisfactory, but no substitute was provided. I would suggest that rice and cocoa be added to the present menu. These could be provided at a monthly cost of eight dollars, or an average of two dollars per school per month. The monthly requirement in rice and cocoa would be 80 and 16 pounds respectively.\n\nAnother great improvement, as I see it if funds will permit, would be to make the improved mid-day meal continuous throughout the teaching year, instead of five months as at present. A continuous, improved mid-day meal, together with the assistance given in clothing, will prove a great incentive in better attendance, and will place the day school on a basis where the residential school will not be a competitor as it is at present.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is noted that this can be done at a cost of $8.00 a month.\n\nAt the present time the Department is not in a position to authorize the serving of a mid-day meal throughout the whole year. However, this matter should be brought to our attention again next summer and further consideration will be given to your suggestion for the academic year 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Provision was made in the estimates for a mid-day meal throughout the entire school year, instead of for five or six months as in previous years. I would strongly recommend this if it can be arranged, as there is always a falling off in attendance when the serving of the meal terminates on April 1st or May 1st as previously. May and June, especially June, are very important months in the school year, as it is in June that exams are held and promotions made. You will readily understand that non-attendance at this period seriously interferes with the advancement of the pupils and the work of the teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant and to state that you are authorized to purchase the towelling and soap necessary for use at the Indian day schools of your Agency.\n\nI hesitate, at this moment, to issue authority for the purchase of supplies necessary to provide a noonday lunch at these schools. The records here indicate that biscuits have been already purchased for these schools and no doubt these biscuits have been delivered at this date.\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, is at present in the Prairie Provinces and will review with Dr. Robertson the whole question of midday lunches at Indian schools. I agree with you that these lunches have a tendency to increase the attendance at the schools, and, in addition to this, contribute substantially to the health of the pupils. The preparation and serving of the lunch, however, unless carefully supervised, can result in the loss of very valuable time and in a great waste of material. Nearly everything depends upon the honesty and conscientiousness of the teacher in charge. It must always be kept in mind that our schools are not welfare institutions but are established and maintained for the instruction of the Indians. However, I shall be glad to discuss this matter with Mr. Phelan and communicate with you later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nR. A.

Church Authorities for the two buildings then used - Teacher's House and Day School. The school (Big Island Lake Indian Day School) was closed for a year and re-opened in November, 1945. Since then, in so far as I am aware, no rent has been paid. I referred to the matter once but have had no instructions as yet. At the time of Mr. Doucette's recent visit to Onion Lake I mentioned the subject to him, perhaps he will recall.\n\nIt should be noted that since the re-opening of the School in 1945, only one building has been used for school purposes - the building formerly used as the teacher's residence. This is because the teacher, Mr. J.R. Lirette, does not require the whole building now for living purposes as he has not his family with him.\n\nMay I request early instructions in the matter.\n\nDonald H.

Pratt,\nSecretary.\n1/2 small (signature)\n1/2 large 76 pieces\n\n(Handwritten note)\n\nPlease return\nthe same\nP.P.\n\n4/11/32\nDuck Lake, Sask., November 1st, 1937\n\nSir;\n\nI beg to report that while I was visiting the Kinistino Reserve on the 29th and 30th ultimo I noticed that a coal burning furnace had been shipped by the Winnipeg Paint and Glass Co., Winnipeg, to this Reserve to be installed in the new Indian Day School which is now under construction there.\n\nThis furnace is a straight coal burner, and the fire-box therein is so small that it would be impossible to heat the building by burning wood, which should be used for this purpose as there is at present an abundant supply of both dry and green wood on the Reserve. It could be supplied by the Indians at a cost of from $1.50 to $2.50 per cord, and would be a means of them receiving a revenue therefrom.\n\nIf this furnace is installed the Indians will be deprived of this revenue and the Department will be under considerable expense for many years by burning coal, as it will have to be hauled from 18 to 24 miles from the Railway to the Reserve, and would cost from $12 to $15.00 per ton delivered.\n\nI was given to understand that the building would be ready for installation of the furnace by the 10th or 14th instant.\n\nI would recommend that a wood-burning furnace with a fire-box large enough to take a four or five foot length of wood be shipped at once, and that the furnace now at the School be returned.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nMemorandum: Mr. Miller.\n\nRe: Kinistino Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the heating system at the above school it has been brought to our attention by the Indian Agent that a straight coal burning, hot air furnace has been supplied.\n\nAs there is an abundant supply of wood on the reserve which can be supplied by the Indians, and which would be a means of providing a revenue for them, it would be desirable to replace same with a wood burning furnace.\n\nI would therefore request that a wood burning furnace, with a fire box large enough to take a three foot length of wood, be ordered and that the furnace now at the school be returned.\n\nIt is understood that the school building will be ready for the installation of this furnace by the 10th to the 14th instant.\n\nI would appreciate if you would arrange to have this change attended to.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Secretary.\nMemorandum: Mr. Mills.\n\nRe: Kinistino Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to the above school will you please notify the Architectural Division that a wood burning furnace will be required.\n\nT.R.L.M.\nSecretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. Nov. 13th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to advise that on Wednesday, Nov. 10th I visited Kinistino Reserve.\n\nThe School building is under construction. It is a nice building, well suited for the purpose.\n\nI notice, however, that the furnace supplied for this school is a coal burner. This furnace is not yet installed and I think it should be exchanged for a wood-burner. There are large quantities of wood on this reserve. The wood will be much cheaper and will also give the Indians a certain revenue through supplying it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A.

If not, I would be pleased to be advised in order that I may submit a copy of the list of equipment required.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nS.H.

From what he said I would judge that the grading of lumber differs in the West from that of the East.\n\nI am not writing this as a protest but in view of the fact that all the buying is to be done in Ottawa, it is a matter that I think should be looked into. As you are familiar with western lumber grades I am drawing it to your attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nM.

I am obliged to you for drawing this to my attention, but I would advise you, however, that this specification was provided by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, who were responsible for the receipt of the materials and it would have been their duty to refuse these if the goods supplied were not acceptable.\n\nI understand that specifications for lumber are different in each of the western provinces. However, it will not be possible for our Purchasing Division to supply specifications for lumber unless we are fully advised as to quality, etc., required. This we hold is the duty of the branch placing the requisition.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nDuck Lake, Sask., February 2nd, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Dept't's letter #109-6-1, Dec. 30/37,\nRef: My letter #3358-6-91, Jan. 8/38.\n\nI beg to advise that I am in receipt of a communication from Mr. James R.

It is estimated that a sum of $50.00 will complete this work to and after March 31st next.\n\nI would be glad if you could arrange to have this amount provided under the 1938-39 Estimates.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 25, 1938.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. McGill.\n\nRe: Kinistino Indian Day School.\n\nThe cost of building the Indian Day School on the Kinistino Indian Reserve, according to figures furnished in Mr. Wardle's memorandum of the 22nd of February, amounted to $4,961.00.\n\nThere still remains to be done the following work estimated to cost $50.00:\n\n- Staining of roof.\n- Painting the finishing coat on the outside of the building.\n- Two coat painting of the privies.\n\nThe work was carried out by day labour.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nFebruary 23, 1938.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. McGill.\n\nRe: Kinistino Indian Day School.\n\nThe cost of building the Indian Day School on the Kinistino Indian Reserve, according to figures furnished in Mr. Wardle's memorandum of the 22nd of February, amounted to $4,961.00.\n\nThere still remains to be done the following work estimated to cost $50.00,-\n\n- Staining of roof.\n- Painting the finishing coat on the outside of the building.\n- Two coat painting of the privies.\n\nThe work was carried out by day labour.\n\nM.G.\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nDuck Lake, Sask., February 21st, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to the third paragraph of Departmental letter No. 109-6-5, dated the 7th instant, pertaining to bookcases for the Kinistino Day School, I find that, upon enquiry there are no Indians on this Reserve who can build cupboards suitable for the purpose required. Mr. Gardner, the Teacher, also informs me that he has not had sufficient experience in carpentry work to undertake building a cupboard.\n\nWhile at this School on the 17th and 18th instant, I found that the following items are required in addition to the above mentioned:\n\nKitchen cupboard for dishes, cooking utensils, etc.,\nWash-Stands (2)\nDining room table,\nDining room benches.\n\nPlain lumber can be purchased and the work done at the School by a local carpenter much more cheaply than purchasing the articles ready-made.\n\nAs the cupboards will have to be built against the inside walls of the School it will be necessary that this work be done right at the School. Owing to the cost of travelling at this time of year I recommend that this work be left until the roads are passable next Spring.\n\nTemporary arrangements for a dining-room table, benches and wash-stand are made and will suit the purpose for the time being.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H.

It will, therefore, be necessary to have the work done there.\n\nI have been given to understand that Mr. Alex. Fraser, of Humboldt, who was foreman in charge of the construction of the School building there last Fall, will be returning to the reserve this Spring to complete the painting of this building. If so, he could be employed to build the cupboards, stands, table and benches while there for about $5.00 less than the price already quoted, as there is no carpenter living near the reserve an extra $5.00 has been allowed for this work to cover expenses in travelling to and from the School.\n\nForm No. 37\u00bd in Triplicate, listing the material required for this work is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H.

Gardner, teacher and acting Farm Instructor on the Kinistino Reserve, ordered 4400 trees from the Dominion Forest Nursery Station, Sutherland, Sask. for planting around the school and residence grounds.\n\nHe advises that when he ordered these, he had no idea that the shipping charges from Sutherland to McKague, Sask., would be so high, namely $6.00, and requests that the Department assist him in paying these charges.\n\nMr. Gardner has made a considerable improvement in the grounds mentioned. He and Mrs. Gardner are doing good work among the members of this Band. I would recommend that the Department pay the attached voucher No. 115, to cover the cost of the expenses involved in improving the school grounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6296, file 627-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach requisitions for food supplies for the mid-day meal, Day Schools in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nI would point out that during the past school year the Department granted the sum of $50.00 each for these schools to be expended for the purpose just mentioned. At the end of the school term the Kinistino School, which was closed this Spring owing to an epidemic of flu, only used $31.00. The Fort a la Corne South School had an unexpended balance of $4.60. The other three schools used the amounts allotted to them.\n\nI might also say that a close check is being kept on supplies provided for these meals, each school submitting a monthly report on the supplies received, used, and remaining on hand.\n\nThe supplies on these requisitions, with the exception of biscuits, have never been provided heretofore. They are to be used principally for the making of biscuits, bread and dumplings, with a view to trying to do away with the supplying of school biscuits.\n\nWith regard to the school biscuits supplied, I have discussed this matter with our teachers and agents. The general opinion seems to be that for the amount of money expended on biscuits, a more adequate meal could be supplied and a considerable saving effected. These schools are willing to try this out this season and I would recommend the request be allowed. I would also point out that it gives our teachers an opportunity to instruct the children in baking and cooking. It is, in my opinion, very important that these girls should be taught how to bake bread and that every effort should be used to get the Indians to abandon the making of bannock instead of raised bread, as not only is the raised bread preferable from the health point of view, but it would also greatly reduce the flour requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nTR/FMc\nOttawa,\nAugust 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the midday meal supplies at the day schools in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nI note that the requisitions which you forwarded requested supplies to be used in place of biscuits.\n\nIn this regard I may say that the biscuits have already been ordered and will reach the respective schools in the near future. Under these circumstances the items mentioned on the requisition forwarded with your letter of the 29th ultimo are not being ordered.\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, will be returning East about August 24 and will stop off for a day in Regina in order to meet you and at that time you might discuss with him the whole question of midday meals at the schools in Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The inside cement walls require finishing in order that they may be kept sanitary. Paint has been requisitioned for this purpose. It is considered that by using paint instead of Kalsomine it will permit keeping the walls clean by having them washed as they require it.\n\nScreen windows were not provided when the school was constructed. Materials have been listed to make the screens required.\n\nThere is no eavestroughing on this building and the rain falling from the roof is wearing away the earth adjacent to the foundation. These are required, also a water tank installed in the basement to collect the water for the use of the school children in washing themselves, also in washing the school towelling, dishes, and scrubbing of the floors.\n\nWhite labour will be required to install the eavestroughing and water tank as we have no Indians experienced in this work.\n\nI recommend that the materials listed be granted and the work done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

The well cribbing is badly rotted in places. It is not wide enough to permit the placing of a new cribbing inside to allow the well to be deepened.\n\nIt is estimated that an adequate supply of water can be procured at a depth of between 45 and 50 feet.\n\nThe cost of the lumber listed is the price being charged by small sawing mills in the district adjacent to the reserve.\n\nI recommend that a new well be provided.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

You will realize that owing to present conditions expenditures will have to be kept to a minimum.\n\nMr. S. H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nWith the above in mind it is not possible to consider expending from the appropriation for Indian education the amount that would be necessary to dig a new well on the Kinistino Reserve. In the event of this well being dug it would probably be used by Indians as well as by the teacher of the Kinistino School and under these circumstances it might be advisable for you to communicate direct with the Superintendent of Indian Agencies who may have money in his appropriation for digging the well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

H. W. McCallum\n\nWill you kindly advise this office when you are in a position to ask for tenders for the school desks and other equipment required for the new Kinistino Indian Day School.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nSecretary.\nDuck Lake, Sask., November 1st, 1937\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that while I was visiting the Kinistino Reserve on the 29th and 30th ultimo I noticed that a coal burning furnace had been shipped by the Winnipeg Paint and Glass Co., Winnipeg, to this Reserve to be installed in the new Indian Day School which is now under construction there.\n\nThis furnace is a straight coal burner, and the fire-box therein is so small that it would be impossible to heat the building by burning wood, which should be used for this purpose as there is at present an abundant supply of both dry and green wood on the Reserve. It could be supplied by the Indians at a cost of from $1.50 to $2.50 per cord, and would be a means of them receiving a revenue therefrom.\n\nIf this furnace is installed the Indians will be deprived of this revenue and the Department will be under considerable expense for many years by burning coal, as it will have to be hauled from 18 to 24 miles from the Railway to the Reserve, and would cost from $12 to $13.00 per ton delivered.\n\nI was given to understand that the building would be ready for installation of the furnace by the 10th or 14th instant.\n\nI would recommend that a wood-burning furnace with a fire-box large enough to take a four or five foot length of wood be shipped at once, and that the furnace now at the School be returned.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nMemorandum: Mr. Mills.\n\nRe: Kinistino Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to the heating system at the above school it has been brought to our attention by the Indian Agent that a straight coal burning, hot air furnace has been supplied.\n\nAs there is an abundant supply of wood on the reserve which can be supplied by the Indians, and which would be a means of providing a revenue for them, it would be desirable to replace same with a wood burning furnace.\n\nI would therefore request that a wood burning furnace, with a fire box large enough to take a three foot length of wood, be ordered and that the furnace now at the school be returned.\n\nIt is understood that the school building will be ready for the installation of this furnace by the 10th to the 14th instant.\n\nI would appreciate if you would arrange to have this change attended to.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Secretary.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Mills,\n\nRe: Kinistino Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to the above school will you please notify the Architectural Division that a wood burning furnace will be required.\n\nSecretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 13th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to advise that on Wednesday, Nov. 10th I visited Kinistino Reserve.\n\nThe School building is under construction. It is a nice building, well suited for the purpose.\n\nI notice, however, that the furnace supplied for this school is a coal burner. This furnace is not yet installed and I think it should be exchanged for a wood-burner. There are large quantities of wood on this reserve. The wood will be much cheaper and will also give the Indians a certain revenue through supplying it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A.

I am obliged to you for drawing this to my attention, but I would advise you, however, that this specification was provided by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, who were responsible for the receipt of the materials and it would have been their duty to refuse these if the goods supplied were not acceptable.\n\nI understand that specifications for lumber are different in each of the western provinces. However, it will not be possible for our Purchasing Division to supply specifications for lumber unless we are fully advised as to quality, etc., required.

Mr. Gardner, the Teacher, also informs me that he has not had sufficient experience in carpentry work to undertake building a cupboard.\n\nWhile at this School on the 17th and 18th instant, I found that the following items are required in addition to the above mentioned:\n\nKitchen cupboard for dishes, cooking utensils, etc.,\nWash-Stands (2)\nDining-room table,\nDining-room benches.\n\nPlain lumber can be purchased and the work done at the School by a local carpenter much more cheaply than purchasing the articles ready-made.\n\nAs the cupboards will have to be built against the inside walls of the School it will be necessary that this work be done right at the School. Owing to the cost of travelling at this time of year I recommend that this work be left until the roads are passable next Spring.\n\nTemporary arrangements for a dining-room table, benches and wash-stand are made and will suit the purpose for the time being.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nS.H.

Fraser of Humboldt was expected to return to the Kinistino Reserve last Spring or Summer to complete the painting of the new Day School there, and had agreed to build the necessary cupboards, wash-stands, tables and benches for this school at a cost of $13.00. Mr. B.G. Willis of Humboldt was employed to complete the painting of the school. He was unable to build the cupboards, and as Mr. Fraser was unable to come before the school opened on September 1st it was necessary to employ someone else to do the work.\n\nThe nearest point at which a carpenter could be obtained to do this work was at Star City, a distance of 22 miles from the reserve. Owing to the distance that had to be travelled I was unable to get the work done at a cost of less than $18.00.\n\nIn view of these circumstances I beg to request that the Department will favorably consider payment of the attached Voucher No. 412, amounting to $18.00, in favor of Mr. B.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6296, file 627-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach requisitions for food supplies for the mid-day meal, Day Schools in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nI would point out that during the past school year the Department granted the sum of $50.00 each for these schools to be expended for the purpose just mentioned. At the end of the school term the Kinistino School, which was closed this Spring owing to an epidemic of flu, only used $31.00. The Fort a la Corne South School had an unexpended balance of $4.60. The other three schools used the amounts allotted to them.\n\nI might also say that a close check is being kept on supplies provided for these meals, each school submitting a monthly report on the supplies received, used, and remaining on hand.\n\nThe supplies on these requisitions, with the exception of biscuits, have never been provided heretofore. They are to be used principally for the making of biscuits, bread and dumplings, with a view to trying to do away with the supplying of school biscuits.\n\nWith regard to the school biscuits supplied, I have discussed this matter with our teachers and agents. The general opinion seems to be that for the amount of money expended on biscuits, a more adequate meal could be supplied and a considerable saving effected. These schools are willing to try this out this season and I would recommend the request be allowed. I would also point out that it gives our teachers an opportunity to instruct the children in baking and cooking. It is, in my opinion, very important that these girls should be taught how to bake bread and that every effort should be used to get the Indians to abandon the making of bannock instead of raised bread, as not only is the raised bread preferable from the health point of view, but it would also greatly reduce the flour requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nTR/FM\nOttawa,\nAugust 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the midday meal supplies at the day schools in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nI note that the requisitions which you forwarded requested supplies to be used in place of biscuits.\n\nIn this regard I may say that the biscuits have already been ordered and will reach the respective schools in the near future. Under these circumstances the items mentioned on the requisition forwarded with your letter of the 29th ultimo are not being ordered.\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, will be returning East about August 24 and will stop off for a day in Regina in order to meet you and at that time you might discuss with him the whole question of midday meals at the schools in Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The inside cement walls require finishing in order that they may be kept sanitary. Paint has been requisitioned for this purpose. It is considered that by using paint instead of Kalsomine it will permit keeping the walls clean by having them washed as they require it.\n\nScreen windows were not provided when the school was constructed. Materials have been listed to make the screens required.\n\nThere is no eavestroughing on this building and the rain falling from the roof is wearing away the earth adjacent to the foundation. These are required, also a water tank installed in the basement to collect the water for the use of the school children in washing themselves, also in washing the school towels, dishes, and scrubbing of the floors.\n\nWhite labour will be required to install the eavestroughing and water tank as we have no Indians experienced in this work.\n\nI recommend that the materials listed be granted and the work done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

The well cribbing is badly rotted in places. It is not wide enough to permit the placing of a new cribbing inside to allow the well to be deepened.\n\nIt is estimated that an adequate supply of water can be procured at a depth of between 45 and 50 feet.\n\nThe cost of the lumber listed is the price being charged by small sawing mills in the district adjacent to the reserve.\n\nI recommend that a new well be provided.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

Simpson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSH/H.\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nMarch 28, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of the 19th instant with reference to certain repairs and improvements at the Kinistino Indian Day School.\n\nYou may expend an amount of $29.40 as follows:\n\n- 4 Gals. wall paint flat, white........... $2.75 $11.00\n- 2 Paint brushes 4\" .......................... 1.50 3.00\n- 8 Yds. black wire screen 34\" wide for screen windows ......................... .30 2.40\n- 100 Lin. ft. 1\" x 2\" #1 spruce for screen windows ............................. 1.00\n- Indian labour painting and making screens ........................................... 12.00\n\n$29.40\n\nOwing to lack of funds it is not possible at the present time to authorize the eavestroughing requested in your letter.\n\nI may also add that the amounts authorized in this letter plus the amounts authorized for the Fort a la Corne North and Fort a la Corne South Day Schools and for the teachers' residences at the Kinistino and John Smith's Day Schools will exhaust the amount provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 for repairs and improvements at the day schools in the Duck Lake Agency. You will realize that owing to present conditions expenditures will have to be kept to a minimum.\n\nMr. S. H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nWith the above in mind it is not possible to consider expending from the appropriation for Indian education the amount that would be necessary to dig a new well on the Kinistino Reserve. In the event of this well being dug it would probably be used by Indians as well as by the teacher of the Kinistino School and under these circumstances it might be advisable for you to communicate direct with the Superintendent of Indian Agencies who may have money in his appropriation for digging the well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Water pails on hand were rusted and leaking. The well is used for water supply for Day School, Teacher's Residence and watering Department cows, pure bred bulls and driving horses. The water was lifted from the well by a rope and pail and with livestock milling around the well conditions were not sanitary. This hazard has now been eliminated.\n\nAs no authority was given from your office for this expenditure I recommend that the account be paid.

Douglas\nOttawa, November 28, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Douglas:\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of November 15 regarding the Kinistino Indian Reserve.\n\nI shall deal with the various points raised in the order in which they appear in your letter.\n\nYou state that you are advised that the school is in a dilapidated condition and that no proper instruction is being received by the children. The records of the Department indicate that quite the contrary is the case, and that the Kinistino Indian day school is very far indeed from being neglected. As you are aware Indian schools in Saskatchewan are inspected by the Inspectors of the Province, and at this point I would like to mention that this arrangement works out admirably and is much appreciated. The last inspection of the Kinistino school reported was by Inspector L. Thorderson, and was made on July 25, 1946. The Inspector's general comment in his report is quoted as follows:\n\n\"The enrolment of 37 pupils seems to be quite good. The attendance during the winter months was very good. However, it has been very low during the month of June as most of the families are away from the reserve picking seneo roots. Four new desks have recently been received. More desks are needed to accommodate all the pupils. The library is being improved with suitable books. The school and equipment are in general quite satisfactory.\n\nThe pupils seem well nourished and well clothed.\n\nMr. Gardner is very interested in the welfare of the individual families on the reserve. Mrs. Gardner assists with work in connection with the health of the pupils and adults.\n\nCommendable progress is being made.\"\n\nThe last previous inspection of the Kinistino school reported was by Inspector F.M. Glazier, and was made on October 27, 1944. The Inspector's general comment in his report is quoted as follows:\n\n\"An enrolment of 26 seems complete. The attendance has not...\"\nbeen good during the fall term owing to a number of families being off the reserve for harvesting.\n\nThe school continues to be the centre of the community. Pupils are taught cleanliness and nutrition. A hot cooked meal is served at noon. The school is equipped with cooking utensils, stove and wash basins.\n\nEmphasis in the classroom is placed on writing and reading. Mrs. Gardner assists with the school lunch, sewing, knitting and spinning. Games are organized.\n\nThe children are well dressed and seem to be well nourished.\n\nThese reports speak for themselves and while both reports are favourable, it will be noted the latter shows a marked increase in enrolment.\n\nExamples of recent expenditures by the Department on this school are as follows:\n\n(a) On July 19, 1946, the following expenditures were authorized for repairs to this school.\n   1. Repairing the school ............... $133.60\n   2. Repairing teacher's residence ...... 79.18\n   3. Cistern for teacher's residence ... 134.75\n\n(b) On July 30, 1946, the six desks reported short by the Provincial Inspector were shipped.\n\n(c) On August 29, 1946, the usual $50.00 for mid-day meal was authorized.\n\n(d) On August 31, 1946, $27.50 was expended for veterinary services to the school cow.\n\n(e) On October 23, 1946, $139.19 was paid for 600 lbs. special vitaminized biscuits supplied for school lunches.\n\n(f) On August, 1946, usual stock of pencils, scribblers, texts, library books, and sporting supplies.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, I believe you will agree that the information given you regarding this school was decidedly wide of the mark.\n\nYou state that as a result of a crop failure this year, the members of the Band are expected to suffer real privation.\nOn this question the Indian Agent reports that while the crops on the Kinistino Reserve did not suffer from lack of moisture, the yields were reduced due to the severe frosts experienced on July 24.\n\nHe also states that the Indians of the Agency generally are in receipt of a satisfactory income and there are very few cases of hardship or want.\n\nYou may rest assured, however, that the Department will take all the necessary measures to see that there is no avoidable hardship or privation on the Kinistino or any other Indian reserve.\n\nThere seems to be some misunderstanding on the part of your correspondents concerning the amount of the funds of the Kinistino Band, which were stated to you as some $20,000. As a matter of fact, the funds of this Band are at the present time $5,263.00 in capital funds. This Trust Fund was built up mainly from the interests of certain members of the Band in sales of reserve lands held in common by various groups of Indians many years ago. It has been conserved at approximately its present figure for some 30 years. Originally the amount was much smaller. Interest on the fund is allowed by the Government at the rate of 7% and it is administered and disbursed for the benefit of the Indians under the authority of the Indian Act for relief and other appropriate items such as fencing and repairs to farm machinery. It is at any time in order for the members of the Band to hold a meeting and make requests to the Department regarding expenditure of these funds through the office of the Indian Agent and such requests always receive sympathetic consideration subject, of course, to the Department's duty as trustee to see that the funds are spent wisely and according to law.\n\nAs to the question of Chief, there is no reason why the Indians should not hold a meeting to choose a Chief according to their Band custom. The more advanced election provisions of the Indian Act have not as yet been applied to this Band. These provisions are more suited to the requirements of Indian communities larger than the Kinistino Band, which according to the census taken in 1944, has a population of only 137. These election provisions moreover, have not been applied to any extent to Indians in Western Canada as yet, although they are in general use on the Eastern Reserves. It is the intention eventually to apply them generally. This objective, however, is being approached gradually because the election provisions when applied, supersede the original customs of the Bands and in some cases conflict to a certain extent with the establishment of Chiefs and Councillors enjoyed by the Indians under their\ntreaties. Until recently there has been little demand from the Indians themselves in the Western Provinces for the introduction of the new system and even yet it is by no means established that the majority wish to change.\n\nThe whole question, however, is one that will be reviewed thoroughly in connection with the activities of the Parliamentary investigation into Indian Affairs which began at the last Session and which, it is expected, will be continued at the next Session. In the meantime the wishes and opinions of the Indians in connection with this important problem are receiving most careful consideration.\n\nIn conclusion and in reference to all the points raised, may I suggest that it is at all times in order for any of the Indians who have complaints or grievances to submit them to the Department through their Indian Agents and Inspectors.\n\nCopies of this exchange of correspondence are being forwarded to the Inspector of Indian Agencies in Saskatchewan, Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander, 414 Federal Building, Regina, for further inquiry locally, into the various subjects dealt with.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHonourable T.C. Douglas,\nPremier of Saskatchewan,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n| Description          | Quantity | Amount |\n|----------------------|----------|--------|\n| 2 gal.

In view of this they suggest that we may be interested in more suitable equipment.\n\nKindly advise me as to your wishes, and if you concur, possibly a new requisition might be submitted, and the former requisition and purchase order cancelled.\n\nEnclosure 1.\n\nW. M. Vincent,\nDept. Purchasing Agent.\nMay 3, 1949\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nPurchasing Division\nLangelin Block\nMetcalfe & Wellington Streets\nOttawa\n\nAttention: Col. E.A. Devitt\n\nGentlemen:\n\nOrder #42121\n\nThis will confirm our telephone discussion of today regarding the order as above, for one Model BT-42 long and short wave radio, mantel type battery set equipped with four miniature tubes, complete with battery pack, to be shipped to:\n\nMr. James R. Gardiner\nKinstino Indian Day School\nStar City, Sask.\n\nThis shipment was to include one Model V-84B spring wound record player for use with this battery set.\n\nWe respectfully point out that while the BT-42, or the BT-46 as we now call it, is an excellent set and is known to give very good satisfaction as a straight radio set, it does not have sufficient output to play records satisfactorily. That is, the volume when a record player is used is hardly satisfactory for use in a school room. We would however, recommend that you send to this teacher the Model BT-60 which is really high class six tube long and short wave battery mantel model. On this set we have a special cost at the moment of $44.55 - the battery pack $7.99, a total of the set complete with the pack $52.54. We believe that for the slight increase in cost that the overall use and satisfaction to the user over a period of time would more than compensate for the difference in price, and we would suggest that we might be advised that an amendment will be issued to your order to cover the shipment of the Model BT-60. We have both of these items in stock and can make immediate delivery.\n\nAssuring you of our desire to serve you at all times, we are,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nG.H.

This reserve is now being set aside. There are approximately 35 children and there has been practically no contact with Department officers or church missionaries before. He believes that an all-year school might be a success. I propose to write to Agent Weir for a full report.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6297, file 628-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n13th Nov. 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the request for a Day School made by the Indians of Chitok Lake, N.W., of Wichekan Lake, SASK.; Archdeacon Paul visited this Reserve last week, and found sixty-one people on the Reserve, thirty-five of these being children, and seventeen of the children between the ages of six and fifteen. The Indians renewed their request for a school and promised that if a school were to be built they would send the children regularly, and would not take them away on hunting expeditions while the school was in session. Mr. Indian Agent Weir has visited this Reserve recently, and is in favour of a school being erected there. I am of the opinion that the best method of civilising these primitive Indians is to start a Day School among them, and I shall be glad to nominate a teacher if the Department is willing to inaugurate a school at this point. The Reserve consists of certain sections in Townships 54 and 55, Ranges 12 and 13 West of the third Meridian.\n\nHoping that the request of these Indians may receive a favourable reply from the Department,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is stated that Archdeacon Paul, who recently visited this Reserve, found 61 people there, 35 being children and 17 of the children being between the ages of 6 and 15. He states the Indians promised, if a school were built, they would send their children regularly.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report regarding this request. You should state whether it would be necessary to erect a school building and a residence for the teacher, also if you consider, if a school were established, it would meet with success and there would be a sufficient number of children residing permanently on the Reserve to warrant the expense in carrying on school activity. Any information you can supply regarding the need of a school and the approximate cost involved in the erection of any buildings that may be required for the furnishing of same should be forwarded. If you recommend that a school be conducted at this point, you should furnish full details. Regarding the type of building you would advise be erected, your reply giving as full information as possible should reach us at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Their main livelihood is derived from hunting and trapping. In the past I have found it rather difficult to obtain much information from members of this Band though on my more recent visits they have appeared more friendly and inclined to discuss matters more freely with me. Under the present circumstances it is a difficult matter for me to say that if a day school was established it would prove a success. However, I would recommend that a school be established as we will not be able to make any progress until we commence educating Indians of this reserve.\n\nThis Band has received very little assistance from the Department in the past. If a school was established it would be necessary to erect a school, teacher's residence, stable and sink a well, the approximate cost would be $4500.00-$5000.00. The reserve is situated about 35-40 miles from a railway on the new Shellbrook-Turtleford branch of the Canadian National Railway. All lumber and material would have to be purchased at a considerable distance from the reserve which would entail considerable\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nconsiderable cost, the country is sparsely settled and roads are not of the best.\n\nOn my last visit to this reserve I endeavoured to have some of the children sent to Boarding School but the parents would not entertain the thought, it was then that they brought up the question of establishing a day school on their reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have recently returned to Saskatchewan from Ireland, and I was sorry to hear what happened at Big Island Lake. The Indians applied to us on several occasions for a school on their land, while we were trying to work in connection with the Department. The Roman Catholic Church started to put up a building without authority. The Bishop of Saskatchewan wrote to you a year ago with regard to a day school on Chibek Lake Reserve, but this school has not yet been granted. Though the Indians have asked for it several times, may I have your authority to send word to the Indians there that a\nSchool will be built for them next spring? If so, I intend to go there shortly, and know the first question they will ask will be when they will get their school, and I should like to be able to give them a favorable reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. L. J. Paul\n\n(Archdeacon - Indian work.\nDiocese Saskatchewan.)\nOttawa, November 19th, 1930.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to a day school on the Chitek Lake Reserve. I regret that the Department cannot be very hopeful concerning an establishment next year as our funds for new buildings will be extremely limited. Only the really urgent capital expense can be undertaken next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. E. J.

In 1929 the late Rev. Robert Kerr promised me that the Department would start a Day School in that Reserve when possible. The Reserve is in the Carlton Agency. Owing to conditions the Department could not make a grant towards the school, but in January 1931 we opened the school with the approval of your Department and the Indian Agent, Mr. Weir. The attendance is not yet very good, but is slowly improving, so we hope soon that there will be an attendance of from 14 to 20 children. I should be much obliged if we could have ten of the first Readers, and a set of the picture charts with...\nDiocese of Saskatchewan\n\nSYNOD OFFICE\nPRINCE ALBERT\nSASKATCHEWAN\n\nSentences to put up on the school walls.\n\nThe pictures I wish to represent an Indian family,\nespecially a boy, a girl & a dog.\n\nIf it is necessary to make a small charge, I\nwill send the money, but perhaps the Department\nwould be willing to help the school in that way.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. C. J. Paul.\n\n(McKendree)\nOttawa, November 28, 1933.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, I beg to say that the Department has not yet officially recognized the day school on the Chitek Lake Reserve. Our Regulations at the present time prevent our establishing any new schools. Under these circumstances, I regret that the articles requested by you cannot be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon W. E. J. Paul,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nRe Chitek School - Carlton Agency, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the year 1929 Anglican missionaries commenced visiting Chitek Lake Reserve and received some response from the Indians. In the time the Indians asked that a school be established on their reserve. Mr. John Weir, at that time Indian Agent, was anxious that a school be started there and asked the Church of England to cooperate. On Nov. 19, 1930, you wrote to Archdeacon Paul (No. 107-7-1) saying that you were not hopeful concerning the establishing of a school at Chitek the following year as funds for building were extremely limited. In Sept. 1931 Archdeacon Paul interviewed The Late Mr. Russell Ferrier and Mr. Williams at Ottawa concerning this project and they said that a school would be started when funds permitted. Since then owing to the depression the Department was still unable to carry on a school on that reserve but as the Indians were getting impatient and we had promised them to do our best to have a school established on the reserve, the Church of England having obtained authority from the Department, and through the interest of two Anglican individuals who made themselves responsible for the cost of the school, started a school in Jan. 1932.\nThe services of a white male teacher were secured, but since he and the Indians could not understand each other, the school was not a success to begin with. The following year a native teacher, Mr. F.J. Daniels who used to teach the Indian Department School on the Shoal Lake Reserve in the Pas Agency, was appointed instead of the previous teacher. As he could speak to the Indians in their own language they soon began to respond and to send their children to school, and the attendance has been slowly increasing since that time. The annual Holiday has usually been taken from the 3rd week in April until the end of June as the Indians were in the habit of going away for the muskrat season. For the months Sept. 1935 to March 1936 the attendance has been as follows:\n\n| Month | Attendance |\n|-------|------------|\n| Sept. 1935 | 6.6        |\n| Oct.    | 7.7        |\n| Nov.    | 11.95      |\n| Dec.    | 13.2       |\n| Jan. 1936 | 12.5       |\n| Feb.    | 7.5 (sickness and extreme cold) |\n| Mar.    | 12.5       |\n\nAverage for seven months, 9.89.\n\nThe school has now started again for this academic year and I heard recently that the Indians had returned to the reserve and were sending their children to school. I feel that the time has now come when we may fairly apply to the Department to take over this school. There is a suitable log school house with a small addition used as a storeroom and a small teachersage. If the Department does not wish to take over the buildings we shall be very glad if it would provide the salary of the teacher and also biscuits, cocoa and etc., for the children's lunch.\n\nMr. Daniels is receiving a salary of $630.00 per annum which is the same as he received from the Department when at Shoal Lake. I feel that it should not be left to individuals to carry on this work which really belongs to the Indian Department and the church is unable to pay the salary of a teacher out of its Mission Funds. I hope that you will see your way clear to grant this request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.,\nAugust 21st, 1936.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 107-7-1 of the 27th ultimo, relative to the question of the Department taking over the Day School on Chitek Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nIn my opinion I would not recommend that the Department take over the school for some time to come. It has been in operation for some years under the auspices of the Anglican Church, and I fail to see any real advancement in the pupils. Whilst the average attendance may appear to be good, I am inclined to think that the same children do not attend regularly, some are present on some days then they go off the parents and others take their place. These Indians are very backward and depend mainly upon hunting and trapping for a livelihood. I feel that the cost of operating this school would not justify the Department taking over for results to be obtained.\n\nWhen the times does come for taking over this school I certainly would recommend that only white certificated teacher be employed. It has been my experience that when other than white are employed very little is accomplished.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLeask, Sask., Feb. 12th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my report for the month of January 1937.\n\nWitchikan Lake and Pelican Lake (Chitek) are over 100 miles from Leask (agency) and as I have no representative on those reserves and it is impossible for me to give the supervision necessary. The Church of England have a teacher on Chitek Lake reserve, but this man is an Indian and not of the best type and of no example to Indians. As the Department has been considering taking over this school, I would recommend that a fully qualified white man that could teach school and look after the Indians as an overseer. These Indians are very backward as it is only the last few years settlers have been in their district, and most of them of the poor type.\n\nA good man appointed would be able to start Indians off with good gardens, improve living conditions and eventually get them started farming. I believe if a man spent half a day in the school room and the balance in outside work it would be the means of us getting results, instead as at present spending all day in the school room. If we adopted the same system at Montreal Lake, Big River schools as these are both backward bands some good would be derived from money we are at present spending.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 24th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department has noted the information contained in your January report regarding the day school on the Chitek Lake Reserve. When you next visit this reserve, you should ascertain the number of children of school age and advise if there is a building available for school purposes.\n\nYour recent report appears to indicate that you favour the Department recognizing this school. In your letter of August 21st, 1936, you recommended that no action be taken in regard to the school.\n\nWhile we would appreciate having the information requested in this letter, it will not likely be possible to consider any expenditure for a school on this reserve during the coming fiscal year as no provision was made for such expenditure in our appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. S. Davis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.\nMarch 29th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 107-7-1 of the 24th ultimo re day school on the Chitek Lake Reserve. I have to advise you that there are about sixteen children of school age. There is a log building which could be repaired and put in shape which would do for a school for sometime. There is no equipment of any nature at this point.\n\nRegarding my January report on this question I was not in favour of taking over the school if we had nothing to say in the engaging of teacher as most of the church appointees in my experience have been useless. If we have three or four to pick from and the right man is put in and do other work besides just teaching school we will be able to make a success of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nMines and Resources,\nIndian Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was wondering if you could kindly help me to get into an Indian school. I hold a second class professional\ncertificate to teach in Manitoba and Sask. I taught for thirteen years in man. I was brought up in Ireland, and am Church of England. I taught in Chitick Lake Indian School for one year under Arch. Paul\nPrince Albert Sask.\nI know in every Province they have teachers in Indian schools who are not qualified to teach, and that is why I make application; surely if there are teachers who are willing to go and teach they ought to get the preference.\nI would take any kind of work you could kindly offer me, I have been out of work for over three years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn R. Mills\nOttawa, July 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, in which you express a desire to obtain a position as teacher in one of our Indian day schools.\n\nI note your reference to the fact that we admit teachers to Indian day schools who have had no professional training and who, consequently, are not qualified to teach. This condition may have been true a few years ago, but the records here indicate that, with the exception of a few teachers in outlying districts, all of whom have given years of conscientious service to the Department, our teachers have all secured full academic and professional standing. You may be interested to learn that we have a number of university graduates with first class professional standing in charge of Indian day schools in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba this year.\n\nI regret to state that I know of no vacancy in any of our Indian day schools in the Prairie Provinces at the moment. It is just possible, however, that the church authorities, who in some cases are responsible for the nomination of teachers, have changes in mind that have not yet been reported to the Department. In view of this fact, I think you would be well advised to communicate with Archdeacon W.E.J. Paul, Synod Office, Prince Albert, Sask., and Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., 39-41 The Bible House, Alexander Avenue, Winnipeg, Man. If you do this, we shall be glad to keep your application on file, for reference, should a vacancy occur at any time in the immediate future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

This year they have proved themselves good gardeners, one or two places besides potatoes and turnips had a nice patch of cabbage and beets. The Land on this Reserve is fairly well covered with bush and could be made into small farms and gardens. The land in question is the best that I have seen in this Province.\n\nHowever, for this year getting a man for six weeks will help a lot and I will try to go to this Reserve as many times as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

They have been hunters and now find they must turn to farming. They need some assistance in the way of horses and equipment but with no Departmental representative on the reserve it would only be a waste of money to supply horses as they would not take care of them.\n\nSomething should be done to assist these people and it is my opinion that the placing of a good man and woman on the reserve, the man to act as overseer and the woman allowed a small consideration for organizing the women and girls and teach cleanliness, health, sewing, knitting etc., would be the best and most economical solution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

S. Davis, attached thereto.\n\nI may state in way of comment that the educational facilities at this reserve were discussed with me by Bishop Burd when he interviewed me a few weeks ago. The Anglican church authorities have been bearing the total cost of any educational facilities that have been provided until now and are anxious to secure from the Department a small grant to assist them. Before this grant can be made, the school district will have to be approved by Order-in-council. The whole matter is now under consideration. I am inclined to think that, if the conditions at this particular reserve were discussed with the church authorities, they would be glad to secure the services of a man and his wife - the former with agricultural experience. In the province of Manitoba the Anglican Church authorities have recently organized a committee on Indian welfare, under the chairmanship of Archbishop Harding, and the members of this committee are cooperating with us very whole-heartedly in the promotion of our rehabilitation programme in that province. It may not be at all necessary to organize such a committee in the province of Saskatchewan, but, in view of what is taking place in Manitoba,\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nI feel confident that the church authorities in Saskatchewan will be glad to cooperate with you in securing teachers suitable for the work you have in mind.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Davis Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Davis,\n\nMr. Hoey promised that the Department would help in the carrying on of the Chitek Lake Indian school, to the extent of half the teacher's salary, i.e., $315 a year.\n\nI expect therefore that school returns should be sent in quarterly, as in the case of Department schools. Would you kindly send to Mr. F.J. Daniels, Chitek P.O., the proper forms on which to send in his report, with instructions as to when and where to send them? I suppose he should send them to you, and would you send them on to Ottawa?\n\nMr. Daniels sends in monthly reports to us here, but they are not on official forms.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. E. J.

You will see from my previous letter that I agree with the recommendation of the agent, but a new school building should be erected before the Department assumes complete charge.\n\nx x x\n\nWalter Burd,\nBishop of Saskatchewan.\nCOPY for the Information of The Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nLeask, Sask.,\nFebruary 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your Letter February 20th, File 303-11A.\nChitek Lake and Lac la Ronge Schools.\n\n---\n\nChitek Lake School:\n\nThe school now operated on the Chitek Lake (Pelican Lake) Reserve is run by the Church of England, who receive a grant of assistance of $350.00 a year. They employ a half-breed as teacher, Mr. F.J. Daniels. It is not very satisfactory to have a half-breed teaching these Indians as his home conditions are very similar to the Indians. I believe that if a good teacher was employed, one who would take an interest in social service work, this Reserve would show a decided improvement.\n\nIf a school was built about 18' x 24', with a full size basement for vocational training, complete with a furnace, the cost would be about $1250.00. Most of this work could be done by the Indians by taking one of our good carpenter Indians from one of the other Reserves as foreman. Most of the lumber can be purchased in the vicinity of the Reserve from local saw mills at a very reasonable price. The walls of the school would be of log construction.\n\nA small residence for the teacher would also needed to be built. It could be of log construction about 26' x 30'. This work could also be done by the Indians. I would estimate the cost to be about $1700.00. This cost includes a full size basement and furnace.\n\nThe Indians, with the exception of the foreman, could be paid in food supplies.\n\nLac La Ronge Schools, Sucker River:\n\nThis settlement at Sucker River, about 20 miles from Lac La Ronge, is one of the most progressive in the North. I would estimate that they would have about twenty children of school age. I expect to be going to Lac La Ronge shortly and could verify this estimate.\n\nA log building.........\nA log building 18' x 26' should be sufficient. It would be impossible to have a basement owing to the rock formation of the land. Another small building 12' x 15' could be erected for vocational training. These buildings would not need to be as well finished as an outside school to be satisfactory. It would be necessary to freight in the lumber for the floor, roof and shingles, windows and hardware. It would be impossible to freight these supplies into Lac La Ronge before next winter. The cost of the two buildings would be about $1,000.00. All the work would be done by the Indians who would receive rations. An outside foreman would not be needed as these Indians are fairly good carpenters.\n\nIt would also be necessary to build a log residence about 26' x 30'. This building would need a little better finishing than the school. The estimated cost would be about $1200.00 and built by the Indians in the same manner as the school.\n\nFisher River District at Lac La Ronge is another good settlement. I have not visited this point very often owing to the expense, and therefore I am not very familiar with the amount school children. However, I will investigate the matter thoroughly this summer when I am paying Treaty at Lac La Ronge. If this point is developed it would be necessary to duplicate the building proposed for Sucker River district, and build them in the same manner.\n\nIn the case of both Sucker River and Fisher River Indians, in the winter the parents go off into other districts to their trap lines and so it would be necessary to provide rations for the children attending the schools as is the case at Stanley.\n\nThe school which is now operating for ten months in the year at Stanley has proved to be a decided success. These children are getting a far better education to fit them for their future than they every would at any boarding school. On Saturdays and after school they do a little trapping, and also help fish for the school and seem more contented.\n\nPelican Narrows, while in Saskatchewan, comes under the Pas Agency and I am not familiar with this point. Before a school is started at this point it would be as well to investigate the matter and see that you would not be confronted with religious difficulties.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) R. S.

Martin D.D.\n\nSynod Office\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letters of March 31, the first confirming the appointment of Mr. Smith Atimoyoo as teacher of the seasonal school at Pelican Narrows for the coming summer. Thank you very much.\n\nHENRY Saskatchewan.\nHP-0-9.\n\nAlso\nChitek Lake #1\n107-7\nLeask, Saskatchewan,\nJune 25, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nThe Reserve is situated near Chitek Siding\non the C.P.R. between Leeville and Meadow Lake with one\ntrain a week. We have a day School on the Reserve with\n17 children on the roll. The School buildings are owned\nby the Anglican Church and are little short of a disgrace\nto all concerned. The teacher is of Indian Blood and totally\nunsuited for the position he holds, but until new\nbuildings are built and considerable improvements effected\non the Reserve, no other type of person would live in the\nenvironment.\n\nDue to the size of Carlton Agency and the\nlocation of a number of the reserves, it is impossible\nto give reserves such as Wotchekan and Chitek Lake the\nsupervision they require. A New School and Teachers\nresidence should be built at Chitek Lake, secondly a\nnursing station must be established, to be followed by\nbuilding a number of new homes for the Indians.\n\nE.S.

Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nLeask, Sask.,  \nJan. 14th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI hereby submit my quarterly report covering the Carlton Agency for the quarter ending December 31st, 1946.\n\nEducation\n\nChitesk Lake and the Little Red River Day Schools have not opened since the Summer Holidays. The other schools were visited. Materials were obtained to make alterations to the school room at Sturgeon Lake Day School.\n\nE.S. Jones  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Nov. 27/48\n\nBishop Martin interviewed Major MacKay on November 23, 1948, and among other matters brought to the attention of the Department, their need for erection of Indian day schools at the above points.\n\nHe was advised that we had already planned the erection of these schools but had run into considerable difficulties in arranging for contractors.\n\nAt Ministikwan it is a matter for general repairs rather than for the construction of a new school. The teacher's quarters are satisfactory but the school building is not.\n\nB.F. Neary\nMay 31, 1949.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Henry D. Martin, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 23, and I am pleased to know that Mr. Umpherville will be on his way north by now. I was very sorry to hear about Mr. Heathcote but note that he will be able to take over the school in 1950.\n\nI also have Mr. Cuthand's application for the school at Chitek. We have checked over the previous inspector's reports, and I do think he should be a very satisfactory teacher at this new school. With his background of teaching experience and army experience, he should be able to do a great deal with the Indians at Chitek.\n\nI note that you are still endeavouring to secure a teacher for Pelican Narrows.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If you forward a similar request about June 1st, the desks will be ordered and be available for the academic year 1946-47.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRepairs to Buildings:\n\nThe school on the Chitek Lake Reserve is owned by the Anglican Church also the teacher's residence. The school is a log construction 20'x28' both the building and contents should definitely be replaced immediately funds are available. The teachers residence in nothing more than a shack and should be replaced also. The school at Stanley is operated for four months of the year, and the building is the property of the Department.

Axel Olsen, of Waskesiu, and Prince Albert, has advised me of his willingness to erect the school in question.\n\nMay I draw your attention to the following facts pertaining to the building of a school on this reserve. The present site of the buildings is not suitably located to serve the best interests of the Indians. If a new school is built arrangements would have to be made with the Church Authorities, since the teacher's residence is their property, to have this moved to the new location.\n\nI would be pleased to hear further from you.\n\nSgd.

Jones, of the Carlton Agency, asking him to contact local contractors in an endeavour to get someone interested in the erection of the proposed school at Chitek Lake. Enclosed is copy of his letter.\n\nMr. Jones has in mind the advisability of building the new day school about two miles from the site of the old and not on the site of the Church of England Mission.\n\nPlease advise me whether it is the intention of the Department to build the new school at the most suitable place or to comply with the wishes of the Church of England Authorities in the matter.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the proposed new school at Chitek Lake.\n\nThe Department desires this school to be as centrally located as possible and consequently we have no objection to it being erected on a new site. Are the Indians willing to donate a site for this school?\n\nThe plan which we sent to you was for a one room school with teachers living quarters included. Consequently, if this building were erected there is no necessity for applying to the church authorities for the residence formerly used by the teacher.\n\nIt is noted from Mr. Jones' letter that Mr. Axel Olsen of Waskeanu has expressed a desire to erect this building. Please obtain a quotation from him and forward it for our consideration as soon as possible.\n\nAs you know, we have to obtain an Order in Council before proceeding with the work and in order to prepare this document we require a tender from the builder.\n\nBernard F.

I have not yet received the plans from the North American Buildings, Limited, but have considered it possible that they will be suitable for the Chitek Lake Reserve where I had received and submitted a tender of about $15,000.00 for combined classroom and teacherage, which was not accepted by the Department because it was considered too high.\n\nThere are two matters in connection with the possibility of the erection of the prefabricated building at the Chitek Lake Reserve which must be considered. First, that we ordered a prefabricated house for the Farming Instructor at the Aesasekouche Reserve, or the Pelly Agency, on a good road, and quite convenient to Winnipeg by road, some time ago, and the company have been stalling us for over a month in the completion of this building after the basement was completed. They have still not started work on it and are now giving as a reason the fact that there is 13 miles of dirt road over which to haul material but Mr. Bryant informs me this is not correct and that it is all gravel road. I am inclined to believe that this company are taking on more work than they can promptly handle and we are probably going to find that if we order one of these buildings from them now it will be done some time next year. The other factor which should be considered is that if the order is placed with this company the basement and foundation should be completed at once before cold weather sets in, otherwise it cannot be done until probably next May.\n\nI would be interested to know how the completed price of the prefabricated building will compare with the quotation of about $15,000.00 received from Axel Olson and submitted to the Department. The building should be fully insulated with a full basement, and supplied with a hot air furnace of suitable capacity. It should be remembered also that Mr. Olson's quotation included two outside toilets. These are fairly substantial buildings and add considerably to the cost. The point which I wish to make in this connection is that if the classroom and teacherage and the two outside toilets had been ordered from Mr. Axel Olson...\nordered from Mr. Axel Olson at the time that the tender was submitted they would have been completed this year and I am very doubtful that they will be completed this year by dealing with the North American Buildings Limited.\n\nJ.F.B.

I was surprised and disappointed when I learned a few days ago that the house for Keeseekeose had not been delivered, and I wrote to North American Buildings, Ltd. I am inclined to think that they are short of erection foremen, and have no one to send with the house. Two of their men are, as you probably know at Chesterfield, Harrison and James Bay erecting houses for us, and these trips (extended) would occupy them away beyond their usual schedule. They have to stay at these points until the jobs are done. I believe they figured on a week at each place.\n\nI am worried about the foundation being completed and the house not delivered, as the job might have to be done again if we wait too long for the house. They did promise delivery as soon as we were ready to receive the house, that is when the foundation was ready.\n\nM. Walton.\nInspector of Indian Affairs\n304 P.O.

These figures actually total $35.00 more than his original tender.\n\nAfter spending months trying to find a contractor interested in the job, only to have the Department refuse to accept his tender (which I believe was a fair quotation in view of the location and cost of materials and labour) it is disappointing to be unable to proceed with the construction. The Bishop of Saskatchewan was practically promised by the Department that the building would be erected this year and now it is very doubtful whether it will be possible to erect it even if Mr. Olson's tender is now accepted. The Bishop naturally assumes that I have been neglectful.\n\nIf the Department decide to erect the prefabricated combined teacherage and classroom referred to in Department letter of the 26th ultimo, File No. 1-1-5 (WT), I would be glad to have instructions at once as to the construction of the basement and possibly I shall be able to get the excavation and concrete work completed before freeze-up.\n\nJ.P.B.

I see nothing to criticise in the plans other than that criticism already mentioned, that the cloakrooms should be partitioned off and not left partly open. In my opinion the plan shown is a better plan than the plan of the combined building which was submitted to me for the Chitek Lake Reserve and on which a quotation of approximately $15,000.00 was received from Mr. Axel Olson and not accepted by the Department.\n\nWhy could not our Surveys and Engineering Branch prepare a blueprint such as the enclosed for building by a regular contractor. If this could be done I am sure that Mr. Olson would build the Chitek Lake building considerably under $15,000.00.\n\nJ.P.B.

At a conference between officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Conantz of North American Builders and our own Education officials, it was decided to carry out certain modifications of the preliminary plan submitted by the Prefabrication company.\n\nOur architects discovered that there was a pocket between the cloak room roof, the teacherage roof and the school roof from which there was no escape for rain or melting snow. This, of course, resulted in the leaking of the roof in one corner of the classroom and steps will be taken to have this situation remedied.\n\nThe Prefabrication Company is prepared to do a number of these schools for us and we have received authority from the Deputy Minister to negotiate for the construction of prefabricated schools. In order to get delivery during the summer holidays, it will be necessary to place our orders for these schools in December or January. When our estimates have been approved by the Treasury Branch we will let you know the number of schools in your province we can allow. We will then ask you to notify us as to the number of prefabricated one room day schools you would like ordered for erection next summer.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of the 17th instant, 107-7-5 (WT.) in connection with the Chitek Lake Indian Day school and others for the future.\n\nBefore negotiations so far with the North American Builders Limited, I should point out to the Department that we are having two prefabricated buildings of theirs completed this year; one, Farming Instructor's residence on the Kaseekouse Reserve of the Pelly Agency and the other a teachersage on the Montreal Lake Reserve of the Carlton Agency. Their handling of the work of erection in both instances has been, in my opinion, very unsatisfactory.\n\nI asked both Indian Agents concerned to submit reports through this office, showing in detail all the difficulties which they have had in the erection of these buildings. After receipt of these reports it is my intention to forward them to the Department with my report and recommendation. Neither of the reports have yet been received; nor will they be received until both of the buildings have been completed. However, I am keeping in very close touch with the work and I am very dissatisfied with the whole thing, and as a consequence I make the suggestion that no further orders be placed with this company until we are assured of better services in the erection of buildings.\n\nI appreciate the fact that it is difficult to secure materials, also that those who are performing the labour can be quite independent these days. However, I do not consider that those conditions are any excuse for the expert carpenter, who is supplied by the Company, rushing away without giving the Indian Agent any opportunity to discuss the completion of the building with him. This is an annoyance to which both Mr. Bryant and Mr. Jones have been subjected. There have been many other annoyances which will be disclosed in their respective reports.\n\nJ. P. B.

I have written to the North American Buildings, Limited, pointing out some of the complaints but have not yet received their reply. In the case of the Keesekoose house the hot air pipes and the electric wiring were apparently run in the same section of the wall and the wiring caught around one of the pipes and caused a fire.\n\nFor your information I would say that the Indian Health Services informed Miss Walton yesterday that the Department of National Defence intended to place an order with the North American Buildings, Limited, for some 48,000 homes for members of the Armed Forces. Apparently men are not enlisting at the rate expected owing to the difficulties in securing homes near Army camps. If this report is true, it would appear that we will have considerable difficulty in placing any orders with this firm next year. I believe that the Indian Health Services have already lined up this firm for certain work that they wish to have done.\n\nMiss Walton attended a meeting in Dr. Moore's office a few days ago at which the Fort Harrison prefabricated house purchased from the North American Buildings, Limited, was mentioned. This house appears to be satisfactory from all reports and we have not had any adverse reports on the two prefabricated houses shipped to the James Bay Agency for the Agent and the Clerk. I am wondering why the houses shipped\nall the way from Winnipeg to Moose Factory with all the difficulties of loading and unloading appear to be satisfactory while the one shipped such a short distance as the Keeseekoose Reserve has turned out so badly. I am asking Mr. Allan of Moose Factory to furnish a full report which, when received, I will pass on to you.\n\nDirector.\n\nMW: McG\nRegina, January 17th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of the 10th instant, File No. 1-1-1- X (WT), regarding vacancies in Saskatchewan Indian day schools.\n\nWith regard to the Chitek Lake Indian Day School, there has been considerable correspondence in this connection and I should remind the Department that while there is actually a vacancy for teacher at that point, the old buildings are not fit for habitation. It was hoped that a new combined classroom and teacherage could be erected this year but is has been found impossible. We must not appoint a teacher and ask the teacher to live in the present buildings as the classroom and teacherage are absolutely unfit to use.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nCopied: JGM\nJanuary 24, 1948.\n\nMr. E. S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLeask, Saskatchewan.\n\nConstruction of One-room Day School and Attached Teacherage - Chitek Lake.\n\nWe have now a stock of blueprints, specifications and bills of materials for our standard one-room day school and attached teacher's residence.\n\nThe Auditor General has insisted that, in future, the clauses of the Public Works Act with regard to advertising for tenders be adhered to. During the emergency war years, some variations from these regulations were permitted, but we are now required to advertise for tenders on construction of public buildings in excess of $5,000.00. Attached hereto please find a sample advertisement. It is our intention to advertise for tenders for the construction of the Chitek Lake Day School in the near future. Therefore, we would request you to advise us -\n\n(a) The names of the newspapers in or near your agency in which you would recommend that we advertise;\n\n(b) Post offices and other government buildings in which we should display drawings, specifications, etc.\n\nNaturally, your own office will be one in which we will display drawings, etc. If no tenders are received after advertising, you will be advised so that other means can be considered whereby the construction of this school can be carried out during the fiscal year 1948-49. These other means\ninvolve:\n\n1. Direct approach to contractors when advertising has failed to produce tenders.\n\n2. Construction on a day labour basis.\n\n3. The erection of a prefabricated school.\n\nWith regard to (2) above, the Department, as previously stated, has a complete bill of materials for the construction of this standard school. Other agents have successfully had this school constructed this year by employing a foreman-carpenter and Indian helpers. The drawings and specifications are very clear and the Department buys all the necessary materials. I give you this information so that you can consider such a mode of construction if advertising fails.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving from you the information required in paras (a) and (b) above. We should also be advised as to the availability of hydro and water facilities and their distance from the school building.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nCOPY SENT TO MR.

Before a definite site for the construction of the school is decided upon, it is most essential that we are assured of an adequate supply of water. Therefore, you are authorized to procure tenders for the digging of a well at the proposed site of the school.\n\nI am also forwarding you under separate cover a copy of the plans and specifications for a standard one room school with attached teacher's residence which we are now constructing for use on Indian reserves. The actual location of the well has been left to the decision of the Indian Agent in view of varying local conditions. I would point out that where the school has been constructed elsewhere, the Agents have located the well in one of three positions:\n\n(a) So that the pump is located in the basement in the room marked as \"Storage room\" and situated under one of the entrances.\n\n(b) So that the pipe comes up through the basement and into the kitchen in such a way as to be available for pumping into the sink.\n\n(c) So that the pump is located in the yard outside of the school building and available for use by both pupils and teacher.\n\nWe will expect to hear further from you with regard to the tenders for the digging of the well and also as to your decision of the location of the well in the above building.\n\nBernard F.

I am informed by Mr. W.A. Ross, Regional Director, that a valuation of $4091.46 was placed on the lumber and building material based on an inventory taken by Indian Agent Mr. E.S. Jones and a representative of Mr. Ross, the Regional Director.\n\nI have not an inventory of the lumber as it was turned over to Mr. Ross in triplicate for him to insert the price, and the whole has been forwarded by him to his headquarters in Ottawa.\n\nMr. Thompson may feel that there is no reason to anticipate difficulties in negotiations with the Provincial Government with regard to taking over the lumber and building material. The Saskatchewan Government has already made an effort to buy the lumber, with no thought of reselling to our Department. It should be remembered that the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan is in the lumber business, buying it and reselling it at a profit, therefore I do not expect it will be resold to us without a profit. However, I have no control over the lumber, and if it has to be handled in the way Mr. Thompson requires, I would ask that he kindly sell the lumber to the Provincial Government and ask them to submit a voucher in triplicate, through this office, for the amount of $4091.46, in order that we may reimburse them in full for the lumber, and thereby have full possession.\n\n(Signed) J.P.B.

He re-affirmed the decision given to Mr. Ross, namely that he cannot depart from the procedure outlined in your letter. Major Clark suggested the adoption of the War Assets procedure but Mr. Thompson is quite familiar with this arrangement and does not wish to implement it in this case. He feels that there is no reason to anticipate difficulties in the negotiations with the Provincial Government or its officials, with whom his own relations have been entirely pleasant and satisfactory. Mr. Thompson said that the reason for the procedure quoted arises from Treasury regulations. Before proceeding any further with this purchase, it will be necessary for us to have an estimate of the amount involved. Due to the lateness of the fiscal year, our appropriation is running low at the present time and we must have definite information as to costs in this instance.\n\n(Signed) Bernard F.

Ross, Regional Director, C.V.T.S., Regina, with a view to having it turned over to our Branch. Mr. Ross has now received a letter from the Director of Training, Mr. R.F. Thompson, Department of Labour, Ottawa, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\".....the following procedure would have to be adopted:-\n\n(1) The Province would have to purchase this lumber from the Dominion Department of Labour, and send a cheque for the same to this office, payable to the Receiver General of Canada.\n\n(2) The Province would then bill the Dominion Department of Mines and Resources for this same amount, which would be paid by the Department of Mines and Resources to the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nI do not understand the reason for such a procedure. No doubt the province would be glad to purchase this well seasoned lumber at considerably below the market price at which it is now available for sale. I have grave doubt that they would then agree to resell it to our Branch for the same money, if at all. I am very anxious to secure this lumber as it has been well seasoned under cover for a year, and is in excellent condition. The price which we would be paying for it, if taken over direct from the Department of Labour, is about 60% of the current retail price of lumber,\n\n-2-\nand it is all useful for building purposes in our building program for the coming fiscal year.\n\nI would be glad if enquiry could be made from Mr. Thompson as to the reason why this lumber cannot be transferred direct from the Department of Labour to our Department, as I have no hope that we will get it by the means he suggests. The matter is urgent because Mr. Ross has to make immediate disposal of the lumber and I would ask that I be advised at the earliest possible date as to the action which it is proposed to take. The quantity of lumber is approximately 66,000 ft. and consists of dimension lumber, common boards, shiplap, etc.\n\n(Signed) J.P.B.

It is still stored in the building.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Norman L.

I have not been able to contact Mr. Ross to get a proper inventory of the lumber as he is out of the city.

It is noted authority has been given to proceed with the procuring of tenders for digging the well.\n\nWhen the question first came up regarding the replacing of this school, a suitable site was selected. I personally put down test holes with an augur, these tests indicated a sufficient supply of water at 25 feet, samples were not analysed.\n\nRegarding the location of the pump, either (a) or (b) as outlined in your letter would be modern and convenient, but would only be practical if a sufficient water supply could be found to operate a sand point. This is what I had in mind and the possibility will be further investigated.\n\nRe: calling for tenders to dig the well. Chitek Lake reserve is isolated. We will have to depend upon Indian labour for work of this type. These Indians are the most backward of any I know, it would be useless to have them submit tenders for digging the well and cribbing same. They would not know if the contract was worth fifty dollars or five hundred. I would suggest this be left in abeyance and that I be given authority to determine whether a sand point would be practical or if a well has to be dug.

This deduction of $1,623.82 is the result of that check of our supply.\n\nWith reference to (2) of the Department letter referred to re construction on a day labour basis, there is a possibility that Mr. Olson could be engaged on this basis, and that the cost of the building might be somewhat reduced in that manner. I am not too hopeful of this, however, as we will have great difficulty securing Indian help in that vicinity. The Indians are very backward and know practically nothing about rough carpenter work or any other kind of work. In addition to this difficulty we might have a great deal of trouble keeping them on the job as they are nomadic in their habits and very irresponsible.\n\nThe other alternative, of course, is a prefabricated building. If the price of a prefabricated building is considerably less than the quotation given by Mr. Olson, and it is possible to have it completed promptly, I would recommend the prefabricated building.\n\nPlease instruct me in this connection as soon as possible.\n\nJ.P.B.

As he has quoted $7,785.00 I consider that his price is much too high.\n\nAlso enclosed is a quotation from Holterman and Sons, who are building the same building on the Poorman's Reserve and the Nut Lake Reserve, both of the Touchwood Agency, and their quotation is $4800.00 plus travelling expenses. Travelling expenses, of course, will include the cost of their own travel to the work and shipment of their tools, etc. I would feel inclined to give the Chitek Lake business to Holterman and Sons if it were not for the fact that they have the school at Nut Lake only nicely started and are to build a similar school at the Poorman's Reserve, which, I think, will take them most of the summer. In view of this fact I believe it would be advisable to have a prefabricated building erected at Chitek Lake.\n\nJ.P.B.

It is necessary to arrange for the excavation of the basement, the pouring of the concrete, the installation of the furnace, the laying of the floors, the laying of the siding, the laying of the roof, and finally the painting of the entire building. It also may or may not be necessary to have a chimney erected. In the long run it may take almost as long to erect the building as it would if we accepted Mr. Holterman's tender. However, we will await your decision as to which of the following alternatives will be accepted:\n\n(a) The acceptance of tender of Holterman & Sons,\n\n(b) The ordering of a prefabricated school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRegina, June 9th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Chitek Lake Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, File No. 107-7-5, in connection with the above, I have delayed answering because it was my intention to endeavour to have Holterman Brothers erect the Chitek Lake Day School if we had not been successful in locating a water supply for the Poorman's Day School. However, Mr. J.T. Warden, Field Assistant, Regina Office, visited the Poorman's Reserve this week and located a satisfactory well at a central point on the reserve at a depth of 6 ft. Consequently it is proposed to have Holterman Brothers proceed with the Poorman's Day School as soon as they have completed the Nut Lake Day School.\n\nWe have not had very satisfactory business with the prefabricated buildings, consequently I am not very enthusiastic about them at the present time. It seems advisable to contact Mr. Olof Lidfors at Meadow Lake, as to the possibility of his erecting the Chitek Lake Day School at approximately the same amount that we are having to pay for the Nut Lake and Poorman's Day School. In any case, before ordering a prefabricated school I am anxious to discuss the matter with Mr. Lidfors. He is now building a residence for us at Meadow Lake and will be finished with it early in July. It might not be possible for him to have the Chitek Lake Day School completed by the 1st of September but certainly he will be able to complete it before freeze-up if his price is satisfactory.\n\nI shall advise you later in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nJune 15, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nChitek Lake Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 1039-303-11A of June 9\n\nWe will wait to hear further from you concerning the possibility that Mr. Lidfors might consider the erection of this school. It will give us an opportunity of having the materials on hand if he will not be available until July for this work.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRegina, June 21st, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 15th instant, File No. 107-7-5 (E), in connection with proposed erection of a school on the Chitek Lake Reserve, I have to say that the matter of the Chitek Lake Indian Day School was discussed with Major Clarke when discussing the proposed residential school at Prince Albert. I believe it is the intention of Major Clarke to recommend that no day school be built at Chitek Lake and that the children of that area should be accepted into the Prince Albert Residential School when it is enlarged sufficiently to provide accommodation for them.\n\nI had hoped to have the Chitek Lake Day School built this year but no good purpose will be served in my working at cross purposes with Major Clarke in the matter. Certainly facilities can be provided for a large number of pupils at Prince Albert, and the cost of a day school and teacherage is abnormally high at the present time. If the policy of the Department is now to have a very large residential school at Prince Albert, thereby providing school accommodation for the children of Chitek Lake and other areas where we have no school accommodation, we should make a decision at once and follow it to conclusion.\n\nI am submitting a report on the discussion held recently at Prince Albert between General Turner, Reverend C.W. Fisher, Superintendent E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, and myself in this connection.\n\nIn that discussion we decided that it was possible to eventually have a six-hundred-pupil residential school at Prince Albert.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nJPBO/ed\nJune 28, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nChitek Lake Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 1146-303-11A of June 21st.\n\nThe problem of building a new school at Chitek Lake will be discussed with Major Clark as soon as he returns to Ottawa. In the meantime, it is felt that Mr. Lidfors should be given an opportunity of submitting a labour tender for the construction of this school as previously planned.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nColonel Heary:\n\nProposed school at Chitik Lake, Sask.\n\nThe delaying action regarding this school is justifiable on the following grounds:\n\n1. Enrollment (1946) is mostly Anglican probably.\n2. Child population 25, of these, a few are Catholic and most are non-Christian.\n   Parents adverse to treaty and family allowances.\n3. The contract price is very high, amounting to $1,000 per pupil likely to be enrolled.\n4. Any contractor or crew we can pick up would be better employed on a more useful project.\n5. Prince Albert is only 106 miles by rail. It is the Anglicans for whom facilities are needed.\n   Delmas or Onion Lake would take the Catholics as Meadow Lake will lighten the load of the last two.\n6. This land needs a haven of improved persons to offset the primitives. So far the day school's efforts have accomplished little. The impact of the people has pulled down the school and the former teacher to a low level. When a road goes through that area and civilization makes some headway we might induce a worthwhile teacher to go in. Only the Church can guarantee a competent missionary-teacher, some new cheaper installation might be a fair use of public money.\n\nMr. Ostrander heard me to this effect at Prince Albert on 18 June and seemed to agree.\n\nC.W.T. Clark\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6297, file 628-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSeptember 9, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nMr. Clark has reported to me regarding the situation at Chitek Lake and we feel that an earnest endeavour should be made to recruit the Anglican children on the Chitek Lake Reserve and place them in the St. Alban's or Lac la Ronge Schools.\n\nThe Catholic Indian children might be placed in the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\nWe do not believe that we would be justified at the present time, in proceeding with the erection of a day school on this reserve. I understand that Mr. Clark has discussed the situation with you.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMarch 31, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Bldg.,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nOne-Room Indian Day Schools - Saskatchewan.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department does give considerable attention to the matter of providing suitable accommodation for teachers in one-room schools. Our officials are unanimous in having the teacherage attached to the school and the Regional Supervisors are agreed also on this point.\n\nYou have stated the situation very clearly in the third paragraph of your letter and I feel that plan 886 does provide comfortable quarters as requested by Mr. McLeod.\n\nAs indicated to you in my letter of March 26th, it is our intention to advertise for tenders for these schools as soon as possible and then to compare them with the Quonset hut type of school.\n\nI note that this school is referred to by Mr. McLeod and in our estimates as the \"Pelican Lake\" Indian Day School. I presume that this is the same school and will be on the site near the former building at Chitek Lake.\n\nMr. McLeod can proceed to expend an amount not to exceed $500. for the sinking of a well as soon as weather permits. If he feels that more funds will be required, it will be necessary to secure tenders and to have approval from the Minister's office.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nRegina, April 2nd, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 31st ultimo, File 1-1-5 (E)/628-5, and, in particular, the fourth paragraph thereof, the Church of England has, I believe, always referred to the school on the Pelican Lake Reserve as the Chitek Lake Day School. It is my opinion that we should, at this time, decide on the name, \"Pelican Lake\" Day school for the proposed day school on that reserve. There is a village of Chitek Lake near the Pelican Lake Reserve, consequently if letters were addressed to the teacher of the Chitek Lake Day School they might often reach a teacher in the village school at Chitek Lake.\n\nJ.P.B.

This building is very old and for some time past the Inspector of Indian Agencies and the Indian Agent have been urging the Department to replace it by a new building.\n\nDuring the past year representations have been made for the establishment of a day school on this Reserve under Roman Catholic auspices and it has been pointed out to us that the Catholic children are sufficiently numerous to justify the establishment of a school.\n\nReports were obtained from the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Saskatchewan and after giving these very careful consideration it was decided to erect one Indian day school on the Big River Reserve to be conducted under the auspices of the Church of England and another Indian day school on the same Reserve to be conducted under Roman Catholic auspices.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sanderson, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, with a view to obtaining a competent carpenter-foreman to supervise the erection of the two schools mentioned above.\n\nOn July 19 a requisition was forwarded to the Purchasing Agent, Mr. Bailey, for the material required for both schools.\n\nThese schools will be erected under the general direction of Indian Agent Davis with a competent carpenter-foreman in charge.

School, has forwarded to the office the forms which I sent you with my letter of July 8. The forms are completed in French and there is also an accompanying letter written in French. It is unnecessary for me to state that I have no objection to the French language, nor have I any objection to receiving letters in French. However, there is another principle involved. Last fall Inspector Coleman visited some of the northern agencies in British Columbia and he reported that many of the missionary teachers in that section were unable to give instruction in English, although they were located on reserves where the Indians had not spoken French. This situation came to the attention of the Minister's office and it was intimated at that time that any teacher that we appointed should have a good knowledge of the English language when they are teaching among Indians who do not speak French. I feel that a similar situation will arise in the Carlton Agency if the new teacher is unable to give adequate instruction in English. I think you will agree with me in this particular matter and would appreciate your ascertaining if the new teacher is totally bilingual.\n\nI am leaving for my holidays on the 13th or 14th and, if at all possible, would appreciate receiving your reply before that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.
