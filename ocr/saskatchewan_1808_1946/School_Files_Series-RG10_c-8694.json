A great deal of this direct draft could be avoided by the building of a small porch at this entrance which could be put on each winter.\n\nThe Acting Principal at St. Philips asks if the Department would do this for the school, an estimate of the cost would be as follows:\n\nLumber and material for porch $15.\nLabour $6.\n\n$21.00\n\nThe labour could be done by Mr. G.

Consequently, the allowance for the night watchman's salary at the St. Philips Indian Residential School will be discontinued from April 30th, 1935.\n\nPayment of this allowance will be resumed from October 1st, 1935, and will be continued until April 30th, 1936. The amount allowed will be the same as formerly, viz., $40.00 a month, and, if the Principal so desires, you should forward a voucher at the end of each month during the period for which the allowance is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I thought however if I could get a man with a proper tank and team to haul from other wells to fill the present one, it would relieve for the time being until such time as a decision could be reached as to a permanent supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of night letter of even date which reads as follows,\u2014\n\n\"Make temporary arrangements tank water supply St. Philips School.

The only place we have any water today is in the basement the other three floors being without any. This is due to the well appearing to dry up. It was thought once that we were on a water vein but the difficulty we have experienced in the past months would indicate that we are not and ask you to take the question of water supply and the remedy to the Department, they might have some suggestion to offer.\n\nAt present overnight there is only about one foot of water comes into the well and we are hauling water from the well at the stable now in order to have enough to do the washing; this does not give us any for the dormitories.\n\nI do not think that deepening the present well would be any remedy as there seems to be blue clay at the bottom. The present inlet of water seems to be about seven or eight feet from the bottom of the well.\n\nWould the Department supply an expert water finder to try and locate a vein or what other means would they suggest?\n\nCould this matter be taken up immediately as the water supply here is serious?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nKamsask, Sask.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKamsack, Sask.,\n3rd April, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Principal of St. Philips Indian Residential school regarding the water supply at the school. It appears that they have been experiencing difficulty this past two months. At times they cannot get a sufficient supply to wash dishes, particularly on wash days at the school. Water on the dormitory floors is out of the question which is necessary for sanitary flushing of the toilets.\n\nCan something be done along the lines of another well being sunk from which their present well could be filled by pumping?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a report from Mr. E.A.W.R. McKenzie, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask., regarding the water supply at the St. Philips Indian Residential School. The school has been experiencing difficulty during the past two months, as, at times, they cannot obtain sufficient water to wash dishes, let alone have any pressure in case of fire. The Principal states the only place they have water is in the basement; the other three floors being without any.\n\nThis situation is due to the well having become dry. The school is at present hauling water from the well at the stable. The Agent states that water on the dormitory floors is out of the question and that they are unable to flush the toilets.\n\nIt is doubtful if deepening the present well would be any remedy. The present inlet of water appears to be about seven or eight feet from the bottom of the well.\n\nThe Agent has recommended that something be done along the line of having another well sunk. Difficulty is being experienced regarding the water supply at a number of the Indian schools in the Prairie Provinces. This is, no doubt, due to the lack of rainfall during the past few years, and it is hoped the situation will be overcome, should there be a rainy season.\n\nI would request that you enquire into the water situation at the St. Philips School and submit a report regarding the action you would advise be taken to improve present conditions. Please state if you would recommend that another well be drilled and what likelihood there would be of obtaining an ample supply of water. You should give an estimate of the cost of any recommendations you make.\n\nMr. Agent McKenzie is being informed that the matter is being referred to you for attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the St. Philips Indian Residential School, regarding the water supply. I may say that the same situation has developed at a number of the Indian residential schools in the Prairie Provinces, due to lack of rainfall during the past few seasons.\n\nIt would, no doubt, be useless to deepen the present well, and there is little guarantee, if a new well was drilled, that a sufficient supply of water would be obtained.\n\nThe Department is referring this matter to Mr. Inspector Murison, who will, no doubt, communicate with you. In the meantime, the school authorities will have to make the best arrangements they can to tank a supply. When we receive Mr. Murison's report as to the action he would recommend be taken, consideration will be given to effecting a remedy for the present situation.\n\nThe inconvenience occasioned the school is regretted. The Principal should take extra precautions to overcome fire hazard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of department letter No. 117-3-5, dated the 12th instant, regarding the water supply at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nI may advise the department that I plan on visiting the Pelly Agency in the near future. I have been putting off my visit until the roads become passable. At the present time they are in bad condition and it may be a week yet before they are fit to travel on. The Indian Agent, Mr. McKenzie, informs me that they are hauling water by a tank and are getting along alright in the meantime. When I visit the Agency I will make a careful enquiry into the water situation at this school and will submit a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.117-3-5 of the 12th inst. regarding the water supply at the St. Philips school, I beg to advise that in accordance with instructions contained in your telegram of the 5th inst. I hired Edward Quewzance of Keesekonse Band to haul 20 tanks from a spring about 3\u00bd miles away @ $1.00 per tank, for which voucher is being forwarded.\n\nThis has given relief to their present distress and when there yesterday suggested to the Principal that he arrange to haul one or two tanks each week, particularly on wash day.\n\nWith the water hauled, there is about four feet of water in the well and with what comes in it is about holding at that, except on wash days.\n\nIt is thought now that the present well could be deepened and create a reservoir as it appears that after four feet depth of water has been reached, it runs away.\n\nWith hauling two or three tanks of water each week, am of the opinion they can get along until a permanent remedy can be decided upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nKelly Agency\n\nTo: Hdr.

No skilled labour should be required for this work. If new plank is required to cover the top of the tank, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the quantity necessary, from a firm on the approved list.

Removal of earth from necessary to prevent rendering tank useless. May I have this done. Writing.\n\nSgd.\n\nThis is a cement tank with a double plank 2 inch. top, covered with earth to a depth of about two feet to prevent freezing. From all the information I can gather a cement top reinforced with steel rods is recommended and pending receipt of your advice I have asked Mr. Barton to give me a figure on what the cost of such would be.\n\nOne end of the tank has completely caved in, earth needs to be removed and what has fallen in, cleaned out in order for the tank to perform its proper functions and then be retopped with cement and covered with earth. In the meantime I have engaged an indian to clean out the portion that is caved in.\n\nI trust the action I have taken is in accordance with your wishes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. Philip's Sask\nMay 15, 35\n\nMr. McKenzie, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to the answer to your telegram, re-\nSeptic Tank here, I beg to remind you of the following facts:- This\nis one of the smallest boarding schools and therefore the only man\non the Staff is the farm labourer whose time is fully taken up at\npresent with seeding operations. As for the pupils, they are all far\ntoo small to undertake any such work as that. I may also state, that\non account of the roof falling in, together with so much earth, it\nflooded up the tank and plugged it entirely. This necessitated im-\nmediate steps being taken to have the tank emptied and the sewage\nsystem opened up again. The tank was in a terrible state, and even\namong the Indians here, I had trouble to find a man who would under-\ntake to empty it, and his lowest price was twenty-five dollars ($25.00).\nA whole day passed before he could persuade two more Indians to help\nhim. This will perhaps give you a little idea of the repulsiveness\nof the job, all of which was caused through putting on a lumber top\ninstead of one of cement when it was constructed.\n\nSomething must be done very soon as the septic\ntank remains open at present, and besides being a source of danger, it\ncertainly is not in the best interests of the health of the inmates\nhere, especially when the wind is in an unfavorable direction.\n\nIn the reply to your telegram, I note there is\nno reference to the replacing of the top with concrete and I think\nthis a pity because in about another five years, we shall be up against\nthe same kind of trouble again. As I hear from the contractor that\nthe costs of the material for the lumber covering with rubber roofing\nbetween the cover and earth will cost about ninety-five dollars ($95.00)\nwhereas the material for a good reinforced concrete cover delivered\nhere will only cost about ninety-three dollars ($93.00). The only diff-\nerence would be about thirty dollars ($30.00) for the extra work with\nconcrete that would last indefinitely.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Principal\nKamsack, Sask.\n\n18th May, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to my letter of the 16th inst., in connection with the septic tank at the St. Philips Indian Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith a letter from the Principal of that school, which I received after informing him that the Department would supply material only for the new top.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTo Dep't of Indian Affairs, per.

Mr. A. Bay, of Kamsack, is in a position to furnish the materials and they may be secured from him provided his prices are satisfactory. The work can be undertaken by J. Gellert and Sons, of Yorkton.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a letter dated July 5th, last, your predecessor, Mr. E.A.W.R. McKenzie, forwarded an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in painting the exterior of the building, the screens and storm sash at the St. Philips Indian Residential School. He stated that the cost for two coats of paint on the exterior of the building and the screens and storm sash would be $450.\n\nThe Honourable the Minister has approved of the expenditure. Mr. A. Bay, of Kamsack, is in a position to furnish the materials, and they may be secured from him, provided his prices are satisfactory. The work in carrying out the painting can be undertaken by J. Gellert and Sons, Yorkton.\n\nI would therefore request that you arrange for the purchase of the paint and other materials required and for the labour and have the exterior of the building, the screens and storm sash given two coats of paint. You should see that a good grade of material is used and that the work is satisfactorily performed. All expense for material and labour should be kept within the estimate, viz.: $450.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the paint and other materials, and also accounts, in triplicate, for the labour. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated. These accounts should be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nI have to request that you will have this painting carried out as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack,\nSask.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent, Pelly Agency, in which he mentions that when I last visited the St. Phillips Residential School before the school was connected up with the Power line, the Principal pointed out that when they were connected up there was certain equipment which they would require. This includes one 1 H.P. motor for pumping purposes and a 5 H.P. motor to run the bread-mixer and laundry equipment. These would take the place of the gasoline engines now in use for the purposes mentioned. It is the Principal's desire to use the present gasoline engine which runs the laundry equipment as a farm engine. I would be glad to know if authority can be granted to supply these motors.\n\nIn this connection I might mention that there was authority received from the Department by letter dated June 21st, file No. 117-3-5, for the expenditure of $300.00 for painting the exterior of this school building. When quotations were procured for the material and labour it was found that the amount of $300.00 was not sufficient to cover the job and nothing has been done in connection with painting up to the present time. As this amount of $300.00 is about what is required for the purchase of the two motors mentioned; I would respectfully suggest that if funds are not available for the purchase of motors, the painting might be left off for another year and the money used in the purchase of motors as it is considered that the motors are much more essential than the painting at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 310-11A R. C. of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, provided their total cost does not exceed $300., you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of one 1 H. P. motor for pumping purposes and one 5 H. P. motor to run the bread mixer and laundry equipment. Prices should be obtained from firms on the approved list and the purchase should be made from the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nRegarding the painting of the St. Philips School, I may say that the former Agent, Mr. MacKenzie, under cover of a letter dated July 5th, last, submitted an estimate of $450., covering both material and labour. In official letter of the 19th ultimo, Mr. Agent Ostrander was authorized to proceed with the painting for the amount mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

It is noted that, by purchasing the material from Mr. Bay and having the labour for the painting carried out by Mr. Gellert, the total cost would exceed the amount available. It is considered, therefore, that, as Mr. Bay's quotation for the material and labour would not exceed the sum of $450, the entire work should be placed in his hands.

The water from this auxiliary well could be connected with the present pumping system and made use of when the supply in the present well becomes low. The outside cost should not exceed $300.00 and I doubt if it will cost that much. I have discussed this matter with both the Agent and the Principal of the school and they are in agreement that my suggestion of providing an auxiliary well would be the best solution to the problem. In most instances it is a difficult matter to arrive at the cost of a well, but in this instance we are, I think, fairly well assured of the depth that the well will have to be dug and therefore can make a fairly accurate estimate of the cost.\n\nIf the Department give this recommendation favorable consideration, I will have the work proceeded with at once. I had hoped from the prospects during the summer and with our heavy rain fall that a second well would be unnecessary, but in view of developments during the present month I feel that something should be done without delay to safeguard the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 117-3-5, dated April 12th last, in regard to the water situation at the St. Philips Indian Residential School, Kamsack, Sask., I beg to report that I visited this school and enquired thoroughly into the water situation on May 27th and at that time the supply had returned to the well and the situation appeared to have cleared up.\n\nAs the source of this water supply is from an underground spring, it was hoped that with heavy rain falls during the summer months that the situation would be cleared up and an ample water supply assured. I visited the school again in July and a third time in September. Each time I made enquiry and found that they were getting an ample supply of water, but during the present month the supply has become low and it looks as though it would not be safe to enter the winter depending upon the present well.\n\nI do not think that the situation would be satisfactorily met by deepening the present well. It would be a difficult matter to accomplish in that the present well is lined with cement rings and a heavy cement block covers the top of the well.\n\nMy recommendation is that a well be dug outside and in close proximity to the present pump house of sufficient diameter to provide a reservoir and have this well dug as far below the water line as possible. I estimate that this would be approximately forty-five feet. This well could be cribbed - with 2\" planks -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 22, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 310-11A R.C. of the 17th instant, regarding the water situation at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department approves of your recommendation, that another well be dug, outside and in close proximity to the present pump-house, of sufficient diameter to provide a reservoir to a depth as far below the water line as possible. You may therefore incur an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $300.00, in having the well dug and cribbed with two inch planks. The water from this auxiliary well should be connected with the present pumping system and utilized when the supply in the present well becomes low. I would request that you arrange to have the work proceeded with at an early date. You should have the auxiliary well completed and placed in a satisfactory condition. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to incur any expenditure for the purpose, in excess of the amount mentioned above. If possible, Indian labour should be used in the digging of the well. However, the matter will be left in your hands, to make the best arrangements to have the work satisfactorily completed and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nAfter the work has been finished, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. The number of days or hours each labourer was employed should be stated on the voucher for the labour. You will be forwarded, later, an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure to the sum of $300, and, in forwarding your vouchers, you should state, on each copy thereof, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of this certificate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nNov. 18th, 1935.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Painting Contract-St. Phillip's School.\n\nIn the early part of July we tendered for the painting of the above building. The Department of Indian Affairs approved of this tender at the beginning of October. We hesitated at that time to accept this due to the lateness of the season, but finally accepted it, taking a chance on the weather holding out for us to complete the job. You know that the weather turned very unfavourable towards the end of the month so that we are not able to complete the job until the month of May, 1936.\n\nWhile we have finished about 65% of the work we have invested in all the material to finish the job; and now we are obligated to pay for the labour completed so far. Under ordinary circumstances we would not expect any payment until the job was completed, as it stands now, not expecting to be in a position to complete the contract until May, we would consider it a favour if the Department would advance us 50% of the contract price.\n\nAs security the Department has 65% of the contract completed and we would be willing to place in your care the balance of material necessary to finish the job. This would provide ample security.\n\nWe would be very much obliged if you would take this up with the Department of Indian Affairs and explain the circumstances to them. Trusting that you will do this without much delay, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\nBay's Hardware Company\nper A. Bay.\nKamsack, Sask.,\n21st November, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th ultimo, No. 117-3-5, in connection with the painting of the exterior of the St. Phillip's Residential School, I beg to say that Mr. Bay arranged for the commencement of this work as soon as I received your telegram giving me the necessary authority. The men were able to work until the 26th of October at the painting, but on that date winter set in and since then it has been impossible to do any further work and it will not be possible to finish the job until spring opens up, which, by the way, will be after the end of the present fiscal year and may mean complications regarding the financing.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Bay, which is self-explanatory, and in my opinion also quite true and the request reasonable.\n\nI beg to request authority to comply with the request of Mr. Bay and forward a voucher for the amount of $225.00 in payment of half the completed job. All the building has had one coat and the storm sash and windows are finished so there is considerably more than half the work completed. I do not think it necessary to take over the material for finishing the job, as suggested in Mr. Bay's letter as he is quite reliable, but shall do so if the Department so desires.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 26, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the painting of the exterior of the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may forward a voucher in triplicate, for $225.00, in favour of Mr. Bay. It is noted that it will not be possible to finish the painting of the school until next spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B.

The Agent further stated that approximately 65% of the work had been done and he recommended that the Department pay Mr. Bay $225 at the present time on the understanding that Mr. Bay would complete the work early next spring, at which time the balance, or $225., would be paid to him.\n\nI would appreciate your concurrence in the above arrangement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, December 14, 1935.\n## Statement\n\nSt. Philips Nov 30/35\n\nM.

This, I am sure, is the same seam that we tapped with our wells, but for some reason during the winter months the water supply is cut off. It may be possible that the source from which this water supply arises may freeze up. At any rate the fact remains that during the summer months there is an ample supply of water and in the winter the supply plays out. The Principal feels that an effort should be made to obtain a permanent supply by drilling a deep well, but we have no knowledge as to what lies below this spring in as much as no deep well tests have been made to my knowledge at this point. The sinking of a deep well will be very much in the nature of an experiment. It is very evident however that some action will be necessary in order to try and solve the water problem at this point. You can understand that I feel very disappointed, as I was quite sure and in this both the Principal and Agent agreed that in sinking the auxiliary well and providing surplus storage the problem would be met.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nSir:\n\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 117-3-5, dated the 22nd October, 1925, in which was authorized the sinking of a well at the St. Phillips Indian Residential School in the Pelly Agency as a result of the recommendation made in my letter to the Department dated October 17th, I may advise the Department that the auxiliary well was duly completed and for a time it appeared that the water question at this school was satisfactorily solved.\n\nA well was dug six feet in diameter and for a time there was seven feet of water in this well and it seemed to come in quite fast. I am now in receipt of information that both this and the original well are not supplying sufficient water for the requirements at the school and the Principal now requests that a deep well be sunk with a view to getting a sufficient supply for the requirements.\n\nThere was no provision made in the Estimates for such an expenditure, as it was not anticipated that there would be any further difficulty in so far as the water situation was concerned at this point and, if it is impossible to obtain funds now to sink a deep well, possibly the Department might give consideration to having an item inserted in the Estimates even yet to meet this contingency.\n\nI feel very disappointed that the auxiliary well dug has not proven a success, as the water supply obtained in this well gave every indication of being a spring. There is a seam of water bearing strata at a depth of from forty to forty-five feet and it finds its outlet in a ravine at no great distance from the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to recommend that authority be granted to purchase two 50 feet lengths of 1\u00bd\" fire hose for the St. Phillips Indian Residential School in the Pelly Agency.

The Department is concerned over the situation that has developed in connection with the two wells at this school, as we were of opinion that the auxiliary well which was recently dug would provide an ample supply of water.\n\nThe Department has noted the Principal's suggestion, that, in order to obtain a permanent supply, a deep well be drilled. No provision has been made in the Estimates to cover the cost of drilling this well. We have no information on which to base an estimate of the costs. Our funds during the balance of the present fiscal year are practically assigned, and, unless there is a real emergency, it will be impossible to provide the expenditure. You might advise if there is a well drilling outfit in the vicinity of the school and if the Principal or yourself can state the approximate depth required to drill a new well to obtain a permanent supply of water. If, after consulting the Principal and the local Indian Agent, you can furnish a concrete plan for a permanent water supply, either by deepening the present wells or drilling a new one, and if you are able to give an estimate of the cost of any work you would recommend be carried out, the Department will further consider the matter of providing funds for the purpose. In the meantime, the Principal will have to conserve the present supply and exercise every care to see that no danger occurs to the building or the pupils and staff, on account of fire.\n\nI have also your letter of the 15th instant, recommending that a quantity of fire hose be supplied. In this connection I have to inform you that an order will be placed here to ship to the Principal's address:-\n\n2 - 50 ft. lengths 1\u00bd\" fire hose.\n\nThe account, in triplicate, covering the cost, will be sent you. When you are advised that the hose has been received, you should attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 117-3-5, dated the 21st ultimo, with reference to the question of endeavoring to obtain a permanent supply of water at the St. Phillips Residential School in the Pelly Agency by drilling a deep well, I may advise the Department that immediately upon receipt of your letter I made enquiry and find that there are no well drillers in the vicinity of the Pelly Agency. The closest well drilling machine that I could locate is one now at Muscow near the Qu'Appelle Agency office.\n\nI have been in touch with Mr. Clark who owns this outfit and who gave us very satisfactory service at the Qu'Appelle Agency. He informs me that he will do the work at $2.60 per foot and he will provide the metal casing. He states however that he would require the Department to pay the freight charges on his outfit from Muscow to Kamsack and one half the freight on the return trip.\n\nAs stated in my former letter, it is difficult to ascertain the cost of drilling this well as we have no knowledge of any deep well having been drilled in close proximity to the school. The drilling of a well 200 feet deep, including casing and freight charges, would be $628.00. A 300 foot well at the same figures would cost $888.00. The Department have had plenty of experience in connection with deep well drilling. It is pretty much a question of guess work. We might obtain a supply of water of course at 100 feet, but no one can be assured of even the approximate depth we may have to go without some data to go on in the area where the drilling takes place and even that is not always an indication. Mr. Clark is an experienced well driller and I feel like acting upon his advice as to where the well should be sunk. I am quite satisfied.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your No. 310-11A R.C., of the 4th instant, with reference to the question of a permanent water supply at the St. Philips Indian Residential School, by the drilling of a deep well.\n\nAs it is impossible to ascertain definitely what the cost would be but as it would likely be a large sum, the Department will have no funds to authorize the carrying out of the work. The school will have to carry on under present conditions. The Principal should conserve the water supply now available and continue to exercise every care to see that no danger occurs on account of fire. It is hoped that, at the spring thaw, the present situation will be cleared up and an ample water supply obtained.\n\nOur funds for the balance of the current fiscal year are entirely assigned, and the appropriation for the coming fiscal year is being drastically cut. The Department feels satisfied that the Principal will do his best to see that the present water supply is conserved and that he will augment same by the hauling of water in tanks, sufficient to meet the needs of the school. We regret the inconvenience occasioned the Principal and staff and hope that the present difficulty will be overcome in the spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

A. Paradis, O.M.I., St. Philips, Sask., for Grant for salary night watchman, Dec and Jan.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 117-3-5 dated March 19th, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nin which the present supply of water is obtained at 43 feet has no connection with this spring and that the real supply will be found at a greater depth. I am led to this opinion through the fact that the 'out-cropping' of the spring in the ravine is from at least 20 to 30 feet lower than the gravel seam at the bottom of our well and through the further fact that the spring is not over-flowing.\n\nAndrew Quewezance, an Indian who lives in close proximity to the school, has been obtaining the water supply for his stock by simply digging a hole a foot deep anywhere within eight or ten feet of the creek bed and he obtains all the water required.\n\nIt appears to me that if the spring were fed through the gravel strata that I mention in connection with our well, the gravity pressure would force an over-flow of water at the spring to a considerable extent, but this does not occur. I have had an interview with Mr. Clark, who drilled our wells at the Qu'Appelle Agency and who has had many years experience in connection with well drilling. He has consented to go with me when the snow has cleared away in the spring and give me the benefit of his opinion regarding the prospects of obtaining water in the vicinity of the school. This will not entail any expense to the Department.\n\nIf my surmise is correct, it should not be necessary to go to a greater depth than about one hundred feet in order to tap the main source of supply to the spring. When I have had an opportunity of thoroughly investigating the question under more favorable circumstances than at present, I will submit a further report on the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 117-3-5, dated the 8th instant, with reference to the question of a permanent water supply at the St. Philips Indian Residential school by the drilling of a deep well.\n\nI may report that upon receipt of your letter I proceeded to the St. Philips school in order that I might thoroughly understand the situation there. I was rather worried about the situation from the reports which I had received and felt that I should make a personal visit and size the situation up.\n\nThe wells at the school are supplying sufficient water for the boiler and the toilets throughout the school, but there is no surplus for any other purpose. They are hauling ice from the river and melting same for washing and other requirements. This involves considerable extra work, but they will be able to carry on until the spring opens up. The great danger of course is should a fire break out they would have no surplus of water to use for fire extinguishing purposes. They are however well supplied with fire extinguishers on each floor. A close watch is kept of the building both night and day. They have a night watchman who patrols the school during the night and of course during the day the staff are distributed throughout the building in connection with their daily occupations. They realize the danger and I am satisfied will keep a close watch over the building. There is nothing further than can be done at the present time.\n\nThere is a considerable amount of snow on the ground, which made it rather difficult to really size up the situation in so far as getting prospects of a water supply are concerned. I did look into this question however by making an examination of the surrounding land. I again visited the spring which 'out-drops' in a ravine between a quarter and half a mile from the school. The ground slopes rapidly from the school which is on high ground to this ravine and the flow from the spring comes out on the same side of the ravine that the school is situated on. There is no sign of any 'out-dropping' of water on the farther side of the ravine and I am of the opinion that the sources of supply to this spring comes from the same side of the ravine and from the general direction in which the school is situated. I could only guess approximately at the drop in the land from the school site to where the spring 'out-drops' in the ravine, but I estimate that it is approximately from 70 to 80 feet. I am inclined to the opinion that the strata of gravel - in which the present -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSOLD TO Department of Indian Affairs\n\nReq'n 912\nOur ORDER NO. 7093\nYOUR ORDER NO. 1868\n\nTERMS: CASH 30 DAYS.

This is a disagreeable and slow job with a bucket. An endeavour has been made to thaw out the discharge pipe, but without success, and it appears that it will be necessary to wait until the end of May for the ground to thaw, or dig up the line from the frozen ground which will be rather expensive.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has asked if it would be possible for him to be supplied with a suction pump, as per illustration, at a cost of $39.75. If this pump were supplied the difficulty would be overcome satisfactorily, with no further expense and the pump would be on hand for cleaning the septic tank at suitable intervals in the future.\n\nI would recommend, if possible, that authority be granted for the purchase of this pump and may point out that the Principal of this school has had a great deal to put up with during the past winter with a shortage of water all the time and a month of working with a frozen sewerage system. I consider his request a very reasonable one and trust the Department will supply the pump.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Plourde O.M.I.\n\nDear Father,\n\nMay I be permitted to remind you once more of the very serious shortage of water supply which we had to cope with for a year and ever.\n\nLast fall, Inspector Murison received authority from the Department for the digging of a new shallow well, close to the old one. This was done according to instructions received, but it was found afterwards that the new well drained out the old one, and with those two wells, the shortage of water is even greater than before.\n\nNow, you must understand that this situation cannot last very much longer; - what of the safety of the School, in case of fire? - what of the unsanitary inconveniences under the existing circumstances?\n\nConsequently, I would greatly appreciate if you would kindly draw the attention of the Department in this connection and request the digging of a deep-shaft well.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General:\n\nDue to the failure of the present shallow wells at the St. Philips Indian Residential School, Electoral District of Mackenzie, Province of Saskatchewan, a very serious situation has developed. Owing to the lack of water, the lives of the sixty-five (65) children attending the school are endangered and there is no adequate protection for the buildings in case of fire.\n\nIn order to ensure a proper water supply, it will be necessary to provide a deep well as soon as possible. Mr. Inspector Murison, in reporting regarding the necessity for a deep well at this school, states that there are no well drillers in the vicinity of the school. The closest well-drilling machine is located at Muscow. This well-drilling machine is owned by Mr. Clark, who had previously given the Department very satisfactory service in digging wells at the Qu'Appelle Indian Agency.\n\nIt is difficult to state definitely the cost of drilling a deep well at this school, but it would, possibly, cost as high as $900.00.\n\nFunds for the purpose can be obtained from the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year and, in view of the urgency and importance of this matter, I would appreciate receiving your approval to authorizing Mr. Inspector Murison to engage the services of a competent well driller and to proceed with the work of drilling a well at once.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nKamsack, Sask.,\n3rd June, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere has been a considerable amount of correspondence between this office and the office of the Inspector at Regina, regarding the great need for a well at the St. Philip's Residential School, but there is still no improvement in the situation, so far as the school is concerned.\n\nA new well was sunk close to the old one last fall and there seemed to be sufficient water for a time, but this well has now failed and the school has been without an adequate water supply all winter, neither sufficient for washing nor fire protection, and usually not sufficient for flushing the toilets, consequently the fire danger is much greater and the school can not be kept clean and sanitary.\n\nMany proposals have been made to relieve the situation, but there seems to be only one solution, in my opinion, which is to drill a deep well and thus obtain a permanent supply for all times. We have had a test hole sunk near the buildings, and to a depth of about 100 feet, and the whole distance was blue clay, not very promising, to say the least, and it would therefore be unwise for me to attempt to make an estimate of the approximate cost of a deep well. Including casing, the cost is approximately $2.70 per foot, for a drilled well with steel casing, and the depth might be anything from 150 to 400 feet. So far as I can ascertain, there has never been a deep well sunk anywhere in this locality and no one seems to know what formation the sub-soil takes, consequently I can give no useful information as to possible depth.\n\nHowever, the need is very great and, if funds can be made available, something should be done at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nDue to the failure of the present shallow wells at the St. Philips Indian Residential School, Electoral District of Mackenzie, Province of Saskatchewan, a very serious situation has developed. Owing to the lack of water, the lives of the sixty-five (65) children attending the school are endangered and there is no adequate protection for the buildings in case of fire.\n\nIn order to ensure a proper water supply, it will be necessary to provide a deep well as soon as possible. Mr. Inspector Murison, in reporting regarding the necessity for a deep well at this school, states that there are no well drillers in the vicinity of the school. The closest well-drilling machine is located at Muscow. This well-drilling machine is owned by Mr. Clark, who had previously given the Department very satisfactory service in digging wells at the Qu'Appelle Indian Agency.\n\nIt is difficult to state definitely the cost of drilling a deep well at this school, but it would, possibly, cost as high as $900.00.\n\nFunds for the purpose can be obtained from the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year and, in view of the urgency and importance of this matter, I would appreciate receiving your approval to authorizing Mr. Inspector Murison to engage the services of a competent well driller and to proceed with the work of drilling a well at once.\n\nNOTE:\n\nDr. McGill\nIt is recommended that Mr. Jens Johnson, of Kelvington, Saskatchewan, who lives in the vicinity of the school, should be employed to do the well-drilling.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, regarding the need of a well at the St. Philips Indian Residential School. It is noted that the new well, which was sunk close to the old one last fall, has now failed and the school is without an adequate water supply. The Department understands that the only solution towards the obtaining of a permanent supply of water appears to be to have a new deep well drilled.\n\nThe Department will approve of the drilling of a new well, to a cost which it is hoped will not exceed the sum of $900. Mr. Jens Johnson, of Kelvington, Sask., who lives in the vicinity of the school, should be employed to do the well drilling. You should see Mr. Johnson and arrange definite terms with him, before he undertakes the work. He should state the price he would charge, per foot, including steel casing. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to drill deeper than approximately, 350 ft. If an ample supply of water is not obtained at this depth, you should have the work delayed and report the results of drilling to that depth to the Department and receive further authority before proceeding with the work. I would request that you arrange with Mr. Johnson to start work as soon as possible. Properly itemized accounts, in triplicate, should be forwarded, covering the expenditure incurred. You should supervise the work, as far as possible, and see that a satisfactory job is done.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison is being forwarded a copy of this letter, for his information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.P.B.

A.\nKamsack, Sask., 11th Sept. 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my report for the month of August, 1936, as follows:\n\nThe well which is being sunk at the St Phillip's Residential school, is progressing fairly well at the present time, after a great deal of delay. At the time of writing it is down to a depth of about 270 feet, with no water, but present prospects are rather good.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th July, last, No. 117-3-5, in connection with the well at the St. Philips School, and telegrams which have passed between this office and the Department, during the course of the work, I beg to say that prospects at the present time are not good. The hole has now been drilled to a depth of 370 feet, having gone through a very hard clay and some stone practically all the way. At the depth of about 250 feet there was some stone and gravel and easier drilling making it appear that the clay, where there is never any hope of finding water, had been passed. However this hope did not continue for very long until the drill was again in the hard clay, where it is at present.\n\nI have told the driller to stop work until he receives further instructions and he is now repairing his machine. I do not know whether it would be wise to continue, but there is now so much money spent in the dry hole, and the need of water is so great at this school, that I would feel inclined to try further if funds can be made available for the work. It seems a pity to have spent so much on the effort and still be without water. I have talked with the Reverend Principal and of course he is very anxious to continue, but we are aware that there is now considerably more spent than at first estimated. If the Department will give me authority to continue a further 100 feet, if necessary, I will watch the work closely, as I have been doing, and, if there is no change in the soil by the time that the machine reaches 400 feet, I shall have the work stopped.\n\nThe machine will be repaired in two days and I would be glad if authority could be given me by telegram in order to expedite the work, in the event that the Department decides to continue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, September 26, 1936.\n\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nJ.P.B.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 29, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, in connection with the drilling of a well at the St. Philips Indian Residential School and referring to telegrams which have passed between this Department and your office. It is noted that, at the date of your letter, the well was drilled to a depth of 370 feet and no water obtained.\n\nYou were telegraphed on the 26th instant, as follows:-\n\n\"Reference your letter twenty-third instant, may continue drilling well, St. Philips School, to depth four hundred feet. Report after drilling that depth.\"\n\nThe Department hopes that a supply of water will be found by the time the drill reaches a depth of 400 feet. Considerable cost has been occasioned in drilling the well, and we would hesitate to abandon the scheme if there is any good prospect of obtaining a supply at a reasonable depth after reaching the 400 ft. level. You have been instructed to stop the work at 400 ft. If a good supply of water is not obtained before that\n\nJ.P.B. Ostroader, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the matter of the well at the St. Philips Residential School, and your telegram of the 26th instant, giving authority to go to 400 feet, I beg to say that the work was continued on receipt of this authority and just before reaching the 400 foot level, there was a change in the substance in the hole, from a very hard clay to a slate stone. I am informed by Mr. Jack Simpson, who is working for Jens P. Johnson, to whom the contract was given, and who has had a great deal of experience in deep well drilling, that this is a good indication and he expects to strike water almost any time. He is continuing to drill past the 400 foot level and I have told him that there is a possibility that the Department will not pay for more than the 400 feet, but it is his own wish to continue as he says he has gone so far that he would rather drill some for nothing than to stop when he is momentarily expecting to strike water.\n\nThe well is now about 420 feet deep and I beg to request authority to continue until water is reached, with the understanding, of course, that work will be stopped if the indications again become hopeless. Please instruct me by telegram.\n\nMr. Johnson informs me that he is getting short of money and I would be glad if you would forward me another accountable cheque for the work, $500.00 or $600.00. The cheque for $300.00 has been spent and will be accounted for at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B.

A. Paradis, O.M.I., St. Philips, Sask.\n\nfor Grant for night watchman, St. Philips Indian Residential School\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 117-3-5 dated March 19th, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nI doubt the possibilities of this spring because it seems to be very weak and comes out in a ravine at about the level of the surface wells which have been struck at different points around the school, and they are all about the same depth, 30 to 40 feet and a very small supply.\n\nThe only possibility in connection with this spring is that a reservoir might be made and the water allowed to accumulate in the reservoir, possibly accumulating sufficient for school purposes. It would have to be pumped from there, or hauled in a tank and the water is very hard and unfit for washing without being softened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nKamsack, Sask.,\n29th October, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to file 117-3-5, and several letters and telegrams on the subject of the well drilling at the St. Philips Residential School, I beg to say that work has been stopped and vouchers are being forwarded for payment of this work. The well was drilled to a depth of 569 feet. For the last hundred feet the drill was in a black shale, which looked promising for water, but at last it reached another kind of shale which contains oil in considerable quantity and there is no possibility of striking water as the water would be useless, if any were found in the oil.\n\nI have prepared a sample of the oil-bearing shale and forwarded it to the University at Saskatoon for analysis as I believe there are real prospects for oil, having seen similar formations in Alberta.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the water situation at the St. Philip's School remains acute and something will have to be done for this winter. There was a quantity of rain water stored during the past summer, but it will be finished in about two weeks, after which there will be no water for washing, only sufficient for cooking and drinking.\n\nThe Assinaboine River is over two miles from the school and it will be necessary to haul water from there for washing and flushing the toilets. The Reverend Principal has asked for authority to hire an Indian with a team and tank for this purpose. The cost will be about ten dollars a week to furnish an adequate quantity of water and I beg to enquire whether the Department is prepared to pay the cost of this. It would appear that this will have to be a permanent arrangement, or at least until the rainfall increases to a point where the shallow surface wells improve. Any change in the surface wells in the past ten years has been the reverse. In any case there is no use trying to locate a well at another point as there is no doubt that the same conditions prevail over a large area, as regards both surface wells and deep wells.\n\nThere is a small spring about half-a-mile from the school, the possibilities of which will be explored next spring, but nothing can be done with it at the present time.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith accountable cheque statement for advance made to pay wages for drilling for water at St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n50 + 0 = 50\n50 + 4 = 54\n50 + 8 = 58\n50 + 12 = 62\n50 + 16 = 66\n50 + 20 = 70\n50 + 24 = 74\n50 + 28 = 78\n50 + 32 = 82\n50 + 36 = 86\n50 + 40 = 90\n\n175.00\n200.00\n225.00\n250.00\n275.00\n300.00\n325.00\n350.00\n375.00\n400.00\n425.00\n\n= 3376.50\nOttawa, November 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the drilling of the well at the St. Philips Indian Residential School. It is noted that, after the well was drilled to a depth of 569 ft., there was no possibility of obtaining water and that it will be necessary to abandon the well, owing to striking oil.\n\nThe Department regrets that, after the expenditure incurred, this well will have to be abandoned and that the water situation at this school remains acute.\n\nIt will be necessary to make some arrangements to provide the school with water. Your suggestion, that the Principal be authorized to hire an Indian with a team and tank to draw water, at a cost of approximately $10.00 a week, is approved. It is hoped that you and the Principal will be able to arrange for the services of a competent Indian, with the necessary team and tank, for this purpose. The Department will provide payment of $10.00 per week towards the cost of hauling the water, until other arrangements can be made for a permanent supply. You should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, at the end of each month, for the amount due the Indian who is employed to haul the water, at the rate allowed by the Department, as mentioned above.\n\nIt is noted that you are forwarding vouchers for payment of the work in drilling the well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The contract was given to Mr. Jens P. Johnson, to be paid by the foot of depth, and he was away a considerable part of the time, leaving the work to be continued by Mr. Jack Simpson, who, by the way, is a man of much greater experience in deep-well drilling than Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson's home is at Kelvington, about eighty miles away from the school, and he is a Councillor of the Municipality there, consequently he was forced to be in his municipality where there was some relief road work being done at the same time that the well was being drilled at the school. He told me that he would have pipe and other materials coming by freight from time to time, for the well work, and asked me to give a cheque to Mr. Simpson or his assistant William McCowan, if they asked for it to pay freight or their personal expenses, while Mr. Johnson was absent. This is the reason for the cheques which are questioned in your letter. I have had Mr. Johnson sign orders and had the orders witnessed, covering each of the receipts for cheques which were not issued to Mr. Johnson personally, and I trust this will be in order.\n\nI might say that there was no record of time actually worked by any of these men. As stated, the work was by contract, per foot, and Mr. Johnson made his own arrangements as to the division of the total amount, and neither he, nor the men who were working, kept any record of actual hours worked. The other men are living at two different places, some distance from Kelvington and Mr. Johnson is unable to get in touch with them, consequently he came to the Agency today and signed these orders hoping that they would serve the purpose as he is anxious to receive his cheque for the balance as soon as possible.\n\nVoucher, receipts and orders are enclosed herewith.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nDecember 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my report for the month of November 1936, as follows:\n\nAs the well at St Phillip's school was a failure, it was necessary to employ an Indian to haul water from the river for use at the school. He is being paid at the rate of $40.00 a month, and it would appear that this will be practically a permanent arrangement. During the month of November, with no snow, making it necessary to haul the water with a wagon and tank, his work was very hard, but with snow on the ground and a sleigh being used, the rate of $40.00 a month will be sufficient, and I expect it will be for the future. A tank was constructed for this purpose and a heater installed in it.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources.\n\nI have to refer you to memorandum of June 3rd, last, with reference to providing a well at the St. Philips Indian Residential School, Electoral District of Mackenzie, Province of Saskatchewan. You authorised the employment of Mr. Jens Johnson, of Kelvington, Sask., to do the well drilling. Mr. Johnson was employed, and it was estimated at the time the work commenced that it would cost approximately $900.\n\nWater was not struck at the depth expected, but, as the well driller proceeded downwards, indications were that, with further drilling, water would be obtained. As it was considered necessary to obtain water for this school, the Department, on receipt of recommendations from the Indian Agent, authorised continued drilling, until, at the depth of 569 feet, it was finally decided that there was no hope and the work was discontinued.\n\nMr. Johnson's account, amounting to $3,039.00 has now been received for payment. I realise that this exceeds the original estimate by a very considerable amount, but the work was done at a reasonable rate per foot and authority to proceed to the depth mentioned was given in the hope that water would be secured. I would appreciate receiving your approval for payment of the account.\n\nDeputy Minister.\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 2 x 3' x 1\" Steel Window     |          |            | $10.00      |\n\nMODEL HARDWARES, LIMITED\n\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nM.

If a further sample of the oil is available, I wish you would save some for this office so that we can run an analysis here. Also save any cuttings.\n\nI do not know whether your well driller kept a log of the well, showing the different strata passed through, but if he has done so I would like to receive a copy of same together with the location of the well in relation to some known boundary so that I can plot its position on my map.\n\nI am sending you, by mail, a small container capable of holding a small quantity of oil. If you have a larger quantity on hand I will send you a larger receptacle as this small sample would not be enough to give a complete analysis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. M.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nF. M. Steel, Esq.,\nPetroleum Engineer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n505 Calgary Public Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nDecember 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd. instant #836,\nI beg to report as follows:\n\nIn my opinion there was certainly a showing of oil\nand shale around the 550 ft. level, shortly before the drilling\nwas stopped in the new well at St. Philip's Residential School.\nA log was not kept by the driller, but I visited the scene of\nthe work very often and the following are the approximate depths\nand strata in the course of drilling in the order mentioned:\n\n- 30 ft. of blue clay;\n- 6 ft. of gravel and clay;\n- 200 ft. of blue clay;\n- 200 ft. of blue clay with an occasional 6 or 8 ft. of\nwhat is commonly called \"hard pan\" at intervals of\nperhaps 20 ft., after which there was approximately\n100 ft. of mostly a black clay with layers of\nshaley rock;\nfrom there to the end of the well, which was\nstopped at 569 ft., it was practically all shale.\n\nA jet drill was being used and the hole was filled with\na mixture of the drilling mud and water, which was continually\nrunning out of the top of the hole in the course of drilling.\nToward the latter stages of drilling, when the drilling would\nstop bubbles of oil were rising to the top through this mud, and\nwhen the bubbles would burst on reaching the air a scum of oil\nwould appear on top of the mud. As there was no oil used on any\nof the machinery on the interior of the hole, this oil certainly\ncame from the bottom of the well, through over 500 ft. of thick\nmud.\n\nConsequently, I have no doubt that the shale in which\nthe drill was working contained oil in fair quantities. Otherwise,\nit would not have risen all this distance through the thick mud.\nWe were concerned with obtaining a supply of water for use at\nthe school, and striking oil was only incidental, but I am\nsatisfied that we were not far from oil in commercial quantities\nwhen drilling was stopped.\n\nI procured a sample of the mud referred to and am\nforwarding it to you in the container which you sent me, but it\ndoes not indicate much so far as I know. A similar sample was\nsent to the University of Saskatoon, but I have received no\nreport thereon.\n\nI feel certain that as drilling ceased some weeks ago\nand the water and mud has receded in the well and at the same\ntime the oil would have been rising to the top of the water and\nmud, there will be a considerable quantity of oil at the top of\nthe water and mud at the present time, but I have no equivalent\nwhich can be used to procure a sample of this. If you are able\nto suggest any way for me to do this, I shall be only too pleased\n503 Calgary Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDecember 31st,\n1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am very glad to receive your letter of the 24th inst., giving certain particulars of the well drilled at St. Philip's Residential School. I also thank you for sending me a sample of the mud and fluid taken from the well while drilling.\n\nThis sample does not show any evidence of oil. From your letter, I am not able to advise you how you can procure a sample or any fluid from the well at the present time as you do not tell me whether the hole is cased or not or the approximate depth to the top of the water and mud. If this is not too far down, it might be possible for you to lower a weighted tin receptacle of such a diameter that it will pass down the casing and attached to a light wire or small rope. In this way you might be able to procure a sample of the fluid, from which, by analysis, we may be able to determine whether it is crude petroleum or whether it is oil from some other source.\n\nIn the system of drilling adopted at this boring, there is always the possibility of the oil used to lubricate the rod joints showing up in the drilling mud, giving the impression that an actual showing of petroleum has occurred, although I note from your letter that no oil appears to have been used in the interior of the hole but you may have overlooked the possibility which I have mentioned.\n\nIn making the above, I am not trying to be unduly critical as nobody would be more pleased than myself to find that you had a true showing of crude oil at this shallow depth but I am simply pointing out this possibility with a view to eliminating any doubt as to the true source of the showing. I would be very glad to hear from you further in the matter and, of course, if you can get a sample of the fluid from the top of the mud, it would help considerably.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

St. Phillips School,\nPelly Agency. Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nDecember 1936. Sample to be tested\nfor presence of oil.\n\nExamination To test for the presence\nof oil the whole sample was extracted\nwith chloroform. The extract was\nfiltered and evaporated.\nA faint trace of residue from this\nevaporation was found to be a heavy\ngrease. No light hydrocarbons, or\nsulphur compounds could be detected.\n\nConclusion Such grease as was present\nwas not of the usual crude character\nand was probably derived from the\ndrilling tools.\n\nYours truly,\n\n'Sgd( J.

This test would\ntend to support the view expressed in my letter of\nthe 31st ultimo wherein I stated that the possible\nsource of the oil might have been from the drilling\nrod joints.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

I believe arrangements could be made with the Saskatchewan Power Commission to have the telephone wires strung on the electric light poles. The electric light line is the property of the Federal Government, but there are certain regulations with which I am not familiar in connection with high power lines. If we can overcome this difficulty and make use of the electric light poles, the cost of the telephone line will be small.\n\nI believe it would be better for the Department to communicate with the Saskatchewan Power Commission in this connection before further action is taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B.

A meter was installed at the Agency for measurement of the current used in the Agency buildings and the Cote Day School, and the St. Philip's School is charged with the difference between this amount and the total reading at the commencement of the line, where it leaves the town of Kamsack. In this manner the total line loss is paid by the St. Philip's School, which, I am informed, is in the neighbourhood of $7.00 or $8.00 per month, as near as can be calculated.\n\nThe only way the line loss can be subdivided between the Agency and St. Philip's School is by the installation of a meter at the end of the line at the School and a division made of the difference between the two meter readings and that of the meter where the line leaves the town of Kamsack.\n\nThe cost of the meter will be approximately $115.00 and as I believe the complaint of Rev. Father Paradis, principal of St. Philip's School, is a legitimate one, I would recommend that the meter be installed for this purpose.\nOttawa, May 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is forwarding to Inspector Robertson a copy of your letter of the 14th instant and requesting him to interview yourself and the Principal of the St. Philips Indian Residential School on the occasion of his next visit to your agency.

I have an Indian here who is familiar with this work and would be glad to do it for $2.00 a day.\n\nThe switchbox at the Agency is a direct current switchbox without a cutoff button as used on a rural line, and if the School telephone and the Agency telephone were on the same line as suggested, it might be necessary to install a different type of switchbox at the Agency at a small additional cost.\n\nThe material required would be two wires for a distance of about six miles, 240 brackets and insulators, and a switchbox at the School. I don't think the labour should cost more than $50.00, and I believe a fair estimate would be $300.00 for completion of the line, which would include material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Canada\nKamsack, Saskatchewan\n10th June, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of April 3rd last, No.117-3-5, in connection with a proposed extension of the telephone line from the Agency to St. Philip's Residential School, I beg to say that for some reason the matter seems to be at a standstill and I am unable to ascertain the cause of the delay.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Department of Telephones sent an engineer several weeks ago to investigate the matter and give consideration to a suggestion of hanging the telephone wires on the electric light poles between the Agency and the School, and I believe approval was given but I have not been officially notified and I assume that the Department of Telephones was in communication with the Saskatchewan Power Commission regarding the proposed action. As I was not certain whether any action was being taken from Ottawa I did not make any further arrangement.\n\nAt present there seems to be some kind of misunderstanding because I saw a letter from the Honourable the Premier of Saskatchewan to Rev. Father Plourde which mentions the erection of a line from Kamsack to the School, but in talking to the engineer when he visited the Agency and the School I informed him that for the present if we are permitted to hang the telephone wires on the power poles there would be no cost for the line between the Agency and Kamsack, thus saving about half the expense. In the letter referred to, the Honourable the Premier mentions an amount of $975.00, which is a great deal more than it will cost to do the work which I have suggested.\n\nThe work necessary consists of placing brackets and insulators on the power lines and stringing the wire from the Agency to the School, a distance of about six\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, June 18th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the proposed extension of the telephone line from the Pelly Agency to the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nIn connection with the above, no action has been taken by this Department. The last letter written in connection with it was our letter to you of April 3rd.\n\nProvision was made in our appropriation for the current fiscal year for an amount of $625.00 for general repairs at the St. Philips School. I note that your suggestion regarding the telephone line would cost, approximately, $300.00. You should consult the Principal with regard to the repairs and improvements which he considers necessary at the St. Philips School this year and, if he desires to expend $300.00 of the amount provided for the telephone line, you should continue your correspondence with the Provincial Government in order that you may obtain written permission to hang the telephone wires on the power poles. If you secure this written permission and if the Principal is prepared to forego other replacements in order to obtain the telephone line, you may proceed with the necessary work.\n\nIf you consider other repairs are necessary at the St. Philips School this year in order to use the balance appropriated, you may forward your recommendations for our consideration. It must be distinctly understood, however, that we cannot allow any larger expenditure at this school for repairs and improvements this year than $625.00.\n\nYours,\n\nR. A.

He advised us, in a letter dated June 10th, that, while he had been in communication with the Provincial authorities, he had not yet received final approval.\n\nIf the telephone line could be strung on the present electric light poles, the cost would be, approximately, $300., and Mr. Ostrander was advised in official letter of June 18th that, if the Provincial Government gave written permission to hang the telephone wire on the power poles, he could proceed with the work.\n\nMr. Ostrander has not replied to our last letter but, from the information contained in the letter you have received from Honourable Mr. Gardiner, it appears that this work has not yet been done. I am, therefore, writing Mr. Ostrander today.\n\nDirector.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Welfare & Training  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe Reverend Mother Superior in charge of St. Philip's Indian Residential School is very anxious to secure about sixty yards of Battleship Linoleum to cover the kitchen and pantry floors.\n\nI was very much surprised to learn that this had not been supplied as very definite promises had been made from your office that this Linoleum would be forwarded early in 1937.

I have arranged for this to be done at once and the additional cost will be charged against the original appropriation for this school amounting to $625.00. I have ordered repairs for the washing machine costing about $30.00 and the balance available from the appropriation will be used in flooring for the barn and repairs to the plaster in the main building.\n\nI trust this is in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.B.

Ostrander,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you kindly inform the Department of our Estimates for the year 1938?\n\n1) We need a house for our Farm Instructor:\nThis request was omitted in last year's list of estimates for the reason that, as I was told, the Department would consider no building request, but this is an urgent need and was listed since 1932. Our farmer is now living in a section of the 35 year old school building out of the Reserve, a regular ice-house in the winter. It is not wise to go to any more expense in trying to improve it, since the foundations are giving away. I believe a suitable house for a family could be built for $400.00.\n\n2) We need electricity in our out-buildings:\nIt is deplorable that the Department, when giving us a Power Line two years ago, should have let the enterprise remain incomplete and not extend the wires to our out-buildings as well as to the school, we would now have the full benefit of the line. This will have to be done sometime, why not now? and let us do away with those miserable oil lanterns which carry little light but much danger to stables and hay-lofts, also harmful fumes to the ice-house. This matter would be settled once for all, with $265.00. This of course includes labor; it has to be done by an electrician.\n\n3) We need a certain amount of paint and varnish:\nIt is a disgrace to let Government properties deteriorate for lack of paint; there is no paint left on the North side of our barn; there is no more varnish on our floors and corridors, the walls are simply repugnant in many rooms. The School management would take care of the labor if the Department provides the material, I should think $400.00 would improve much surface and save the dignity of the property.\n\n4) We need some Battleship linoleum to cover the dust carrying cement floors of the kitchen (13x21 ft.) and the adjoining scullery (13x6\u00bd ft.) $80.00\n\n5) The $480.00 or 40 dollars a month (as per temporary arrangement with the Department) for the hauling of water to the School, must not be forgotten in the provision for the year 1938.\n\nHoping these will be considered favorably by you and the Department, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nAlfred Paradis\nO.M.I.\nPrincipal\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to submit application from St. Philips Residential School to have \u00a32125 included in the 1938-39 estimates for building, repairs, etc.\n\n1. Farming Instructor's House - The house now being used is unfit for habitation, it is just an old school houses discarded some years ago when the new building was erected.\n\nThis house is badly needed but I do not believe a house could be built for \u00a3900. It would require in the vicinity of \u00a32000 to build any kind of a suitable house.\n\n2. Electric lighting in outbuildings - This should be done to get away from the fire hazard if for no other purpose. His estimate should cover this.\n\n3. Paint and varnish - The barn is badly in need of paint one side looks as though it had never had any and the siding is cracking and warping for need of it. There has been very little interior decoration done and it is badly needed in some rooms, particularly. The estimate of \u00a3400 should cover this.\n\n4. Linoleum - This supplying of this would assist in keeping the upper floors clean as this sand is carried on the feet but aside from this I do not consider it very necessary.\n\n5. Hauling water - This is a necessary expenditure as the whole water supply has to be hauled - \u00a340 per month is paid for this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nCOPY TO: Rev. A. Paradis, O.M.I.\n\nFor your information.\n\nOttawa, December 15, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of December 9th enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of the St. Phillips Residential School with reference to amounts that he suggests should be included in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1936-39.\n\nIt is regretted that this letter did not reach us before our estimates were prepared. For your information I may say that these were completed about three weeks ago and have already been forwarded to the office of the Honourable the Minister.\n\nFrom a small amount provided in next year's appropriation for miscellaneous expenses it may be possible to provide the funds that would be required to carry out the second and third requests contained in the Principal's letter.\n\nYou may purchase the linoleum that is necessary at a cost not exceeding $50.\n\nThe expenditure for hauling water is a routine one and the necessary funds will be available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThos. Robertson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH\nDIVISION OF SANITATION\n\nREGINA November 25, 1937.\n\nInspector,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the water situation at St. Phillips Indian School on the Keeseekeoose Indian Reserve No. 66, is very unsatisfactory. A representative of this Department has recently inspected the situation and reports that the water supply is obtained from the creek, a distance of two or two and a half miles away, and is placed in the old well and then chlorinated. This arrangement is not particularly satisfactory and I am sure, is rather costly. I would like to urge that every consideration be given to further investigations for the purpose of obtaining an adequate and better protected water supply if at all possible.\n\nI am informed too, that the absorption field used in connection with the septic tank gives considerable difficulty, which may be due to the fact that the subsoil is non-absorbent or that the field is too small. I suggest that consideration be given to carrying the effluent some 300 yards distant to the valley bank where probably a more suitable site for disposal can be found for direct discharge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. G. Schaeffer, B.Sc.,\nSanitary Engineer.\n\nJGS:MB\nCopy to j.e.h.\nThe better plan would be a properly constructed disposal field near the septic tank in the school farm field, a distance of about 100 yards and the slope is away from the creek mentioned.\n\nIt would appear to me that any expenditure on a disposal field before a water supply is secured would be foolish and that before any action be taken an engineer should be sent in to make a complete survey.\n\nIf a period of wet years returned the probabilities are that the well at the school would again supply sufficient water at very little expense.\n\nSubmitted for your consideration. - Department of Health letter attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI am in receipt of a report from the Provincial Health Department on the water situation at St. Philips Residential School.\n\nAs the Department is aware the conditions there are bad. The whole water supply for the school has to be hauled a distance of some 2\u00bd miles at a cost of \u00a340.00 per month, with the result that there is not the amount of water used for drinking purposes of the best quality.\n\nIt has been suggested that water be piped to the school from the river, a distance of about 2\u00bd miles, the cost of doing this, together with the cost of pumps and upkeep in my opinion makes it prohibitive.\n\nThe solution might be found in locating water in the hills about 1\u00bd miles east of the school from whence it could be brought by gravity. This land is owned by whites.\n\nCriticism is also made of the disposal field as being inadequate and suggestion is made that the effluent be carried some 300 yards to a valley bank.\n\nTo do this would mean draining it into a spring creek, the water of which is used by the Indians for drinking purposes all summer and most of the winter.\n\nThe.......\n\nR.

It appears that the water supply at this point was much greater than was anticipated, and, while the well was dug to be used as a reservoir for the spring, to have a supply available for hauling in the tank, we find that the stream is quite powerful, and is running in and out of the reservoir at the rate of about 15,000 gallons to 19,000 gallons a day.\n\nFor some time past the water supply has been provided for this school by hiring an Indian to haul it at a cost of $40.00 a month and this is not very satisfactory for various reasons, chief of which is fire protection. I would like to have an engineer sent to this school to investigate the possibility of installing a pumping system from the reservoir to the school, if funds could be made available for the purpose, bearing in mind the fact that the Department now pays $450.00 a year to an Indian to haul the water, so at least that amount is available. I have no estimate to give as to the cost, other than that, if the engineer finds the installation of a pumping system is practical, and likely to prove a permanent solution of the water question at this school, it will be necessary to put in a pipe line, below the frost line, for a distance of 1500 feet.\n\nI would be glad if you would recommend to the Department, that at least they have an engineer sent to this school to report as to the possibilities of this water supply, and make a recommendation and estimate as to the cost of a system such as I have suggested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Considerable money was expended on this work but we were unable to find water. As a result the school management has had to draw water by tanks for the past two years.\n\nI enclose copy of a letter which has just been received from the Indian Agent, in which he suggests a plan that may remedy the serious water situation at this school.\n\nI should appreciate your arranging to have one of your engineers visit the St. Philips School at an early date and let me know if the plan suggested by the Indian Agent and the Principal is practicable. In that event your engineer should also state what it would cost to provide the pipeline mentioned in the Agent's letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nREGINA, SASK., July 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: Your 117-3-5 of July 9th,\nWater Situation, St. Philip's Residential School.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of July 4th, I beg to advise that I have just returned from a visit to Pelly Agency. While there I inspected the spring referred to.\n\nThis spring is located exactly 500 yards from the School and is several feet below the level of the School. They had this spring dug out to a depth of 13 feet and are putting in a cribbing 18 feet in diameter. There is at the present time 13 feet of water.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nfigure of $400.00 for the pump and meter is only approximate as I have not received accurate prices as yet but, if there are any major discrepancies noted upon receipt of them, I will notify you.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, the present pump is in poor condition and the capacity of it is too small. By using a displacement pump of capacity approximately 1000 gallons per hour and increasing the pressure in the tank to a range of 60 pounds per square inch to 80 pounds per square inch, the water system in the school should be satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJunior Engineer.\nAs already mentioned in Proposal No.1, water would be pumped from the well direct to the pressure tank in the school, with a bypass to the dry well (concreted to provide storage facilities). The pump would deliver 1000 Imperial gallons per hour against a head of 276 feet which, according to my figures, should allow a maximum pressure of 60 pounds per square inch in the pressure tank at the school. This pump would require an electric motor of approximately 1\u00bd to 3 H.P. The motor would be equipped with an automatic starter to come in as soon as the pressure in the tank lowered to 60 pounds per square inch and cut out when the pressure reached 60 pounds per square inch.\n\nThe present pump of capacity 400 gallons per hour could be used as a standby by pumping from the concreted reservoir well.\n\nThe arguments against this proposal are as follows:\n\n(a) The uncertainty of the well flow, in which case the labour and 3\" main and pumphouse expense would be wasted if the well should go dry.\n\n(b) The difficulty in cold weather of keeping the pumphouse warm enough to prevent freezing of pipes.\n\nProposal No.2\n\n| Description                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Concreting dry well         | $200.00|\n| Minor repair work in basement | $75.00 |\n| New pump and motor          | $400.00|\n| Contingencies               | $100.00|\n| **Total**                   | $775.00|\n\nThe disadvantage of this system is the fact that water has to be hauled to fill the reservoir. However the cost of Item 2 is $775.00 against $200.00 for Item 1. Of course there is a yearly charge of $200.00 for hauling water for No.2, which for a period of five years would pay for the cost of the 3\" main and pumphouse, the only question remaining is the certainty of the well delivery over a period of years.\n\nAt any rate Suggestion No.2 could be carried out, and should be at an early date, and during this work provision could be made to allow for the installation of No.1 at some future date if the Department did not wish to spend the $200.00 and risk failure of the well.\n\nProviding a minimum of 8000 gallons per day is hauled to the concreted reservoir, with the recommendation made in No.2 I feel sure the water problem would be satisfactorily solved.\n\nThere is no doubt that No.1 would prove quite satisfactory providing the water supply did not fail and the pumphouse was kept above freezing point. In regard to deciding between Suggestions 1 and 2, I believe this is a matter for the Indian Affairs Branch to decide. I would point out that the\neffect of water in the bottom as any more water flows out through the casing so I was told by the man who handles the pump for the school. This well should be concreted and used as a storage reservoir for the school.\n\nIn my opinion there are two alternatives:\n\n(1) To put in a pipe line from the good well (see plan) and pump directly into the pressure tank at the school with a bypass to the storage well at the school (The storage well of course would have to be concreted). This would entail considerable pipe being bought, a new pump and motor (the old one being of little use except as a standby), a pumphouse and the concreting of the well.\n\n(2) To concret the storage well at the school, install a new pump and a few minor changes in discharge line and still haul the water in tanks to the storage well, thus avoiding the cost of laying approximately 1500 feet of 8\" pipe below the frost line and taking the chance of possible failure of the well.\n\nAn estimate of the cost of the two alternatives is shown below; also the plans enclosed are as follows:\n\nPlan A - showing location of school and supply well, also survey line from supply well as well as proposed pipe line. The profile shown in the approximate grade line of the proposed main.\n\nPlan B - showing suggested arrangement of new pump, etc., if dry well is used and water hauled in tanks to concreted storage well.\n\nRegardless of whether suggestions 1 or 2 are carried out, two things are essential, namely, a new pump electrically driven and the concreting of the present dry well for storage purposes.\n\nThe following is the estimate of the cost of the two proposals:\n\n| Imperial Main (using 8\" galvanized iron main from pumphouse to school) |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| Cost of pumphouse & intake | $400.00          |\n| 1500 lin.ft. 8\" pipe & specials | $60.00         |\n| Excavation to depth of 8ft. @ .50/ | $300.00        |\n| 6000 cu.yds. | $1500.00       |\n| Installation of pipe, etc. | $100.00         |\n| Pump & motor, including automatic starter (pump to deliver 1500 Imperial gals per hr. against 576 ft. head) | $400.00       |\n| 1900 lin.ft. extension of power line to pumphouse | $50.00        |\n| Concreting reservoir well | $200.00        |\n| Minor changes in inlet to pressure tank at school | $75.00        |\n| Contingencies | $100.00        |\n\nTotal: $3225.00\nReport re St. Phillips Residential School\nPelly Indian Reserve, Saskatchewan\n\nThe following report is the result of my inspection of the water supply conditions existing at the above school:\n\nThe well that formerly supplied water for the school had gone dry (from this well the suction line of the pump took its water) and it had become necessary to haul water in tanks from a well approximately 1500 feet away. This water was then placed in the dry well and then pumped into the pressure tank that feeds the school water system.\n\nAs there is no source of water other than the well 1500 feet away, the question was one of the feasibility of laying a pipe line (below the frost) from this well to the school.\n\nAs a result of my inspection, there is no doubt that this could be done and that the well, if it continues to flow as at present, would more than supply the demands of the school (the maximum demand being approximately 5000 gallons per day) occurring on wash days.\n\nHowever there is the question of the possibility of the well going dry at some future date, in which case the pipe line would be of no use. This does not seem very likely to me as the well is located near the bed of a small stream and the well itself has a strong flow.\n\nThe water system at present is operated as follows:\nWater is pumped from the well by means of a small daleo pump of capacity approx. 400 gallons per hour. This pump is driven by a single phase 60 cycle 1 H.P. electric motor. Water is pumped into a pressure tank in the basement (capacity of tank approximately 1500 gallons). The electric motor is so controlled as to shut down automatically when the pressure in the tank becomes sixty pounds per square inch and to cut in again when the pressure lowers to forty pounds per square inch. When the pressure drops to forty pounds per square inch in the tank there is not sufficient pressure in the top floor of the school to satisfactorily flush the toilets, etc., to say nothing of its being useless for fire protection. To my mind the pressure in the pressure tank in the basement should range from a minimum of sixty pounds per square inch to a maximum of ninety pounds per square inch, which should provide ample pressure without endangering the tank or other plumbing (the tank being tested to one hundred and fifty pounds per square inch).\n\nThe flow of the only available well 1500 feet from the school is approximately 400 gallons per hour. The well itself is approximately 9 feet in diameter, with 11.8 feet of water in the well. The well was tested, according to Mr. Stranzer, the Indian Agent, by pumping it out to within 2 feet of the bottom by means of two sludge pumps and the well filled itself (8.8 feet) in a period of six hours. This works out to be approximately 400 gallons per hour. The storage in a well of this size is approximately 5400 gallons aside from the flow of water entering the well.\n\nThe dry well at the school, from which the pump at the school takes its water, is approximately 30 feet deep and 6 feet in diameter. Unfortunately this well will only hold\n2 Black Points\nAward to Principal\non Sept 1st 40\njust for that reason she just say that he will see about it and the first time was finished the principal of the school said that it would be better for me to have that job. But he couldn't do any better for me to have that job and Mr. Anderson and agent told me I could have that job telling Walter to the school and he was telling me to come see me the next day but he didn't show up and go in my place having that job yet now and I trust you to help me to have that work just because it's in my place.\nAugust 26, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am going to write a letter to you to ask you one thing. I was very sorry that I didn't speak to you about it.

However, he will inquire into this matter and when he has secured prices he will forward the information to this office, when you will be advised.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Joe, Musqua.\n\n**ADDRESS:** C/o Indian Agent,\n\nKamask, Sask.\n\nPelly Agency.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Aug. 29 | To hauling water for St. Philip's Residential School during the month of August, 1938. | 40.00 |\n\nAuth., D.

Curbing was installed and the spring supplies a good quantity and quality of water for the school. Recently, an engineer was sent by the Department to report on this supply and the matter of piping and pumping the supply to the school is under consideration.\n\nAbout the time that this spring was developed, the Indian, John Musqua, who has been hauling water to the school for some time, informed me that he was considering quitting his job, as the work was too hard on his horses. His son-in-law is a son of Andrew Quewezance, the complainant, and had spoken for the job, if John Musqua was quitting. Subsequently, after the spring was developed, the hauling of the water was not so difficult, and John Musqua decided to continue until the pumping to the school was completed, and I told him he could do so, as his work has been quite satisfactory, considering the amount he was receiving.\n\nAlthough the water is hauled from a point near Andrew Quewezance's dwelling on the Keeseekoose Reserve, I do not think he has any more claim against it than has John Musqua, and he has not horses as suitable for the work.\n\nRegarding the complaint that I said I was going to see this man and did not. Probably this is partly true, as I said I would advise him, if John Musqua did not continue with the hauling, and would give him the first chance. But, as John Musqua continued, there was nothing further to see him about. He has more time to come and see me than I have to go and see him, at least at the present time.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostander,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Philip's is one of the small schools in the Department and its upkeep is becoming increasingly difficult because there is not the proper relation between overhead expenses and ordinary revenue. A small increase in pupilage would, therefore, be very welcome and would enable the Principal to carry on with less difficulty.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your immediate attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMr. Philip Phelan:\nChief Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the St. Philip's Residential School dated the 9th instant in which he draws my attention to the following:\n\n1. Nothing has been done so far to pipe the water to the school from the spring which was discovered last June, a distance of about 1500 feet. The school water supply is still being taken care of by hauling water from this spring. The quantity is necessarily limited causing hardship to the staff and making the school a greater fire hazard than it should be. The Department is, at present, spending $40.00 a month for the hauling of water. This amount represents $480 a year, a sum equal to the annual interest on $12,000. Surely the Department should make an effort to install a pipe line immediately so as to save the interest on the difference between the amount required for the installation of this pipe line and the amount being spent annually for hauling water.\n\n2. Father Paradis, the Principal, forwarded to the Department a short time ago labour vouchers to the amount of $81.00 representing wages for deepening the spring which is now supplying the school with water. He informs me that these wages have not yet been paid.\n\n3. You agreed last year to stand the expense of hauling water for the school's skating rink. Labour vouchers were forwarded to you but you have not yet reimbursed the school.\n\n4. It was verbally understood that the pupilage of the school would be increased from 70 to 75. Up to the present time you are paying for only 70 pupils. The Principal would be very much obliged if, beginning with October, you would increase the pupilage to 75.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant in connection with St. Philip's Residential School I enclose copy of report made by Mr. Dempster of the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nAfter considering this report and also our finances it was decided to accept alternative No. 2 and the Surveys & Engineering Branch have been requested to proceed with the necessary work.\n\nThere is no record of our having received the vouchers from Father Paradis mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter.\n\nThe other two matters mentioned in your letter will be discussed with you when you next visit the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Hoey.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou are no doubt aware that a year ago last May, a well supplying about twelve thousand gallons of water per day, was discovered close to the St. Phillip's Indian Residential School. This well is about fifteen hundred feet distant.\n\nSince this discovery, the school has taken its whole water supply from this well. The Department has allowed $40. per month for hauling it by team. This money is paid monthly to an Indian from the Reserve. The quantity hauled per day is never quite sufficient for the needs of the school. During the very wet weather and also during the winter months, when there is heavy snow on the ground, only a small quantity can be hauled. This results in a great deal of inconvenience from a sanitary point of view, as sufficient flushing cannot be done. The fire hazard for the school is also much greater, because the water tanks are never filled to capacity.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we hope that the Department will supply the necessary funds to pipe the water from this new well to the school. This will ensure not only a permanent supply, but also a sufficient quantity of water for all purposes.\n\nIt would be most unfortunate if a fire originated in the school, and it was shown upon investigation, that a sufficient quantity of water was not on hand to use the fire extinguishing apparatus, provided by the Department for the safety of the children and staff of this school.\nOttawa, October 25, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the water supply at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41, consideration will be given to providing funds to carry out one of the recommendations of the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.

Father Lamontagne,\nProvincial of the Manitoba Oblate Province under whose\ngeneral jurisdiction comes St Philips, asked that the addition\nto the St Philips be not proceeded with this year and that\nthe sum voted for that purpose be used for the construction\nof a new unit to the Kenora School which lost its staff\nquarters by fire. You agreed to this change.\n\nAs St. Philips is just as much in need of a\nManual Training Room and a small Assembly Hall as it was\na year ago I would ask that the amount of $5,000.00 which\nwas voted for that purpose in the 1939-1940 estimates be\nincluded in the estimates of the coming year.\n\nHoping that you will be able to consider\nthis request favorably, I remain,\n\nyours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Coude\n\n[Handwritten note]\nNew estimate $500\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant I regret that it was impossible to provide in the estimates for 1940-41 the amount that would be required to erect a manual training room and assembly hall at the St. Philip's Indian Residential School.\n\nWe did provide an amount which we hope will be sufficient to install a new water system.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This system of providing water is most unsatisfactory and now that we are assured that the well will provide a sufficient quantity of water for all school purposes it is advisable that proposal No. 1 contained in Mr. Dempster's report be acted upon. This proposal calls for the building of a pump house, the laying of a 2\" pipe line, the installation of a pump and motor with automatic starter and cut off, the installation of an electrical power line from the school to the pump house and other minor work. The total cost, as estimated by your engineer, is $3,385.00. The above sum includes a pump and motor costing $400.00 which have already been purchased. This would reduce the estimate of your engineer to $2,985.00.\n\nI am given to understand that the sum of $1,500.00 has been provided in this year's estimate for St. Philips School. If the Oblate Fathers were allowed to use the above amount for the purpose of carrying out proposal No. 1 they would supply the balance of the money, on condition that the sum of $40.00 per month, which is now being paid for hauling water, be paid over to the school Principal until such time as the amount of money necessary to complete the instalation of this pipe line be paid in full. The Oblate Fathers will not ask for a written undertaking to this effect; they will be satisfied with a verbal assurance of the officials of the Department.\n\nAs the season is drawing to a close it is hoped that a very early decision can be arrived at so that work on this project can be started as quickly as possible. It is estimated that if permission could be granted not later than next Thursday both the pump house and the trench for the 2\" pipe could be proceeded with and completed before the frost sets in.\n\nWhilst the Oblate Fathers, as stated above, are prepared to co-operate with the Department to the extent of advancing the difference between the amount provided in the estimates and the cost of the instalation of this water system it must be understood that they would certainly prefer the Department to supply the whole amount required and the offer must, therefore, be considered as a gesture of good will on their part.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: St. Philips Residential School Water System\n\nYou are no doubt aware that the above school has been without a permanent water system for the last seven or eight years. The original well dug at the time of the construction of the school went dry during the dry spell and subsequent attempts at digging new wells have all proven unsuccessful.\n\nTwo years ago, in the month of May, a spring of considerable size was discovered at a distance of about 1500 feet from the school. Acting on the advice of the Agent this spring was uncovered and a casing 8 feet in diameter and 9 feet deep was installed where the flow of water seemed to be the largest.\n\nIt took 9 hours with two sludge pumps to empty this casing. It was calculated that the flow was about 480 gallons per hour.\n\nIn August, 1938, your Mr. Dempster was asked to make a report on this well and on the feasibility of installing a pipe line from the well to the school, a distance, as stated above, of 1500 feet. Mr. Dempster was also asked to submit an alternate proposal. His report dated August 1 goes into all the details of, first, the construction of a pipe line, and, secondly, into a method of using the water without the pipe line. It was proposal No. 2 which was accepted by the Department, the reasons for this being twofold; first, the funds available at the time were not large enough to install a pipe line, and, secondly, it was deemed advisable to test the flow of water from the well before spending any large amount on piping the water to the school. In the meantime\nthe sum of $1,500.00 which might be utilized to undertake this work, and I am today in receipt of a letter from the General Superintendent of Catholic Indian Missions, in which he states that the Oblate Order would be prepared to undertake the work and complete it this fall, on the understanding that provision for the additional amount would be made in the estimates of next year. They have made the suggestion that they would be prepared to complete the work if we continued to allow them the $40.00 per month that has been allowed them in recent years for the hauling of water. This arrangement however in my judgment would be in no sense satisfactory.\n\nIt is regrettable that we have been prevented until now from submitting this matter to you for consideration owing to our inability to discuss the project with a representative of the Catholic Church. In view of the lateness of the season, therefore, I would recommend, subject to the approval of the Minister, that the Church Authorities be authorized to proceed with this work, at a cost not to exceed $2,985.00. This work in the main consists of excavation of soil to a depth of 8 ft. and installation of 1800 lineal feet of 2-inch pipeline. It is just possible that we may be able to pay an amount in excess of $1,500 from this year's appropriation, but, should it be found impossible to do so, I recommend that the amount exceeding the appropriation of $1,500.00 now available be included in the 1941-42 estimates.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nOttawa, September 17, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Water System - St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nA great deal of difficulty has been experienced during the last 8 years in securing an adequate water supply at the above noted school. This school is situated in the Pelly Agency and has at this date an enrolment of 70 Indian pupils. It is a government-owned institution.\n\nTwo years ago a spring with a substantial volume of water was located about 1800 feet from the school buildings. We were approached at that time to undertake the work necessary to connect this spring with the school. However, it was considered inadvisable to proceed with this work until we were fully satisfied that the supply of water discovered was sufficient to meet the needs of the institution. We did enter into an agreement however to pay an Indian $40.00 per month for hauling the amount of water required from week to week at the school.\n\nMr. Dempster, in a report dated September 6, 1938, estimates that the cost of establishing a pump-house, supplying 1,800 lineal feet 2-inch pipe, excavation, etc., would amount to $3,385.

Father Paradis, Principal of the St. Phillips School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOP/FB\nOttawa,\nSeptember 24, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAt the request of Father Plourde I attach two blue prints prepared by Mr. Dempster in connection with the water system at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nAs these are the only copies of the blue prints that we have on file it would be appreciated if you would return them to this office as soon as they have served your purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. A. Paradis,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Philips, Sask.\nI am sending this letter by Airmail and I wish you would notify Mr. J.L. Bryant, the Indian Agent at Ramsack immediately as to when the engineer is likely to arrive. All labour can be performed by the Indians under the instructions of the engineer.\n\nWill you please send me a copy of the letter that you write to Mr. Bryant and advise me what steps you have taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Christiansen,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention of Mr. Hoey\n\nI wish to inform you that I had a long distance telephone call this morning from Father Paradis of the St. Philips Indian Boarding School, Kamsack.\n\nThis call was in connection with the water supply at the school. I shall refer you to your letter No. 117-3-5 of September 12th, 1936. You say in this letter that it has been decided to accept Scheme No. 2 which was to carry the water from the Spring to the school, for which, I believe, the Department has been paying an Indian $40.00 a month to haul water from the Spring to the school. The other alternative, Plan No. 1, was to pipe the water from the Spring to the school.\n\nEvidently Father Paradis has been in communication with the Department regarding this matter and from the information I have, the Catholic Church are advancing the money for the purpose of carrying out Scheme No. 1. I do not know under what terms this is to be carried out but evidently you have the information there. Father Paradis now informs me that he received authority from his Church this morning to go ahead with the work, as the money is available.\n\nTo do this he will have to have an engineer. Evidently our Department had Mr. Dempster, of the Survey & Engineering Branch, visit the school some two years ago and are familiar with what has transpired. As the season is getting late and the freeze-up is fast approaching, I would ask you to take immediate steps to have an engineer visit St. Philips School to lay out the work in question. In fact, I would suppose that to carry out this project it would be necessary for the engineer to remain there while the work is going on.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI am sending this...\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: St. Philips' Water Line\n\nI appreciate very much your cooperation in securing an early decision on the above project. Work is to be started this morning and if the weather is favourable, the contractor informs us that the job will be completed before Winter frosts set in. The Principal will, in due time, forward invoices in duplicate to the Department and properly endorsed Labour Vouchers will also be supplied.\n\nIt is understood that the Department is to supply the sum of $1,500 towards this project out of this year's vote, and that the balance up to $1,485.00 is to be provided by the Oblate Fathers and repaid to them during the fiscal year 1941-1942. Anything over the estimated amount of $2,985.00 will be supplied by the Oblate Fathers and no claim will be made on the Department for the over-expenditure.\n\nThanking you once more for your cooperation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSEP 28 1940\n**PLEASE KEEP THIS BILL FOR REFERENCE**\n\nBought of\nPainter & Decorator\nDealer in Paints and Wall Papers\n\nKAMSACK, SASK.\n\nDate: May 29, 1940\n\nM.

A. Hoey\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nre: St. Philips' School Water System\n\nIn your letter of September the 23rd last, you authorized the Church authorities, or the Reverend Oblate Fathers to proceed with the installation of a pipe line from the school to the well which was discovered in May 1938. This well is about 1500 feet distant from the school.\n\nActing upon this authority, the Rev. Oblate Fathers began work on this project September 28th and it was completed on November 9th last. The sum of $2,965 was authorized for this purpose, $1500 of which was to be paid during the current fiscal year and the balance, $1465, out of the 1941-42 estimates. It was understood that if the completed job amounted to more than the above sum, the balance would be supplied by the Oblate Fathers and no claim would be made on the Department for this over-expenditure.\n\nAt the time that the Oblate Fathers made this promise it was thought that the cost of the installation of the electric power line from the school to the well, according to the estimate of your engineer, Mr. Dempster, would be only $50.00; that is the amount which appears in his report as the estimated cost for this work. Unfortunately we were not able to do the work for this project on anything like it. For instance, the wire alone cost $257.30. In all $441.13 of electrical supplies were needed for this part of the work. Owing to this and a few other unforeseen expenses the total amount spent on this project is $3288.69. Invoices and labour vouchers for the above amount are hereby submitted for your approval.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BAILEY\n\nIn memorandum dated September 17 addressed to the Deputy Minister it was recommended that the Church authorities be authorized to proceed with improvements to the water system at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nI am now advised that this work has been satisfactorily completed and I attach the following accounts:\n\nW.T. Cotter Company \u2014 Plumbing material .......... $56.30\nCrane Limited \u2014 8 accounts totalling ............. 774.87\nTown of Kamsack ........................................... 16.25\nModel Hardware Limited ................................. 348.90\nMonarch Lumber Company ................................. 383.77\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that these accounts may be paid.

A report received from the school authorities indicates that the new installation is working satisfactorily and part of the cost is being paid from this year's appropriation and the balance is being provided in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

More detailed information will be necessary such as the exact date on which employees of Bay's Hardware were engaged and the rate per day. A statement should also be shown on the account regarding the amount requested for mileage.\n\nThere is also an item of $7.75 for inspection and permit.

Phelan  \n\nOn November the 28th, 1940, Rev. Father Paradis, of St. Philips, Sask., forwarded invoices in triplicate from James Mitchell, paint dealer of Kamsack, Sask., for paint supplied to his school. Promise was made in your letter of November the 20th that this account would be paid immediately upon receipt of invoices properly certified.\n\nRev. Father Paradis now informs me that payment of this account was overlooked. Would you be kind enough to have your Secretary check this matter up and, if the case is as stated by Father Paradis, you will no doubt wish to have cheque issued as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa,\nJuly 2, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo our records indicate that Mr. Mitchell's account was received and passed for payment. However, in checking with the Treasury Branch this morning I find that they have no record of having received the account, although two copies of it were sent to them. This means we only have on file the triplicate copy and it will, therefore, be necessary to secure another account from Mr. Mitchell. I am extremely sorry that this has occurred but mistakes will happen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.O.

Our records indicate that a motor for this purpose was purchased in the fall of 1938 by the Surveys & Engineering Branch. Are we to infer that this motor has already become useless?

Phelan\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Rev. Father A. Paradis, of the St. Philips Indian Residential School in which he desires me to call the attention of the Department to a bothersome defect in the installation of the water system of the School.\n\nIt appears that it is impossible with the present pumping installation to pump water and air at the same time. That is due possibly to the distance that there is between the pump and the pressure tank, which I understand is about 1600 feet. The experts whom the Principal has consulted advise the installation of a small air compressor alongside the water tank. This would not be a costly installation and it is maintained that it would give perfect satisfaction. The pump at the well would then have only one function, and that would be to pump water into the pressure tank.\n\nWhilst I am inclined to agree with the suggestion made to the Principal, I believe it would be wise for the Department to ask its engineer in Regina to report on the matter so that any new installation which would be purchased would meet with his approval. If my request is in order, would you be kind enough to advise your engineer in Regina to report on the matter as quickly as possible.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa,\nSeptember 26, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the defect in the installation of the water system at the St. Philips Residential School.

He also found that the snifter valve on the pump was not operating properly.\n\nAfter discussing the matter with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company in Winnipeg he recommended as follows:\n\n\"(1) The pressure tank must be completely drained of water and fresh volume of air allowed to enter before it is refilled.\n\n\"(2) The snifter valve on the pump must have the Adjuster Cap replaced - this was missing at the time of my inspection.\n\n\"Regarding the draining of the pressure tank, there is a difficulty due to the elevation of part of the piping, and the school authorities claim that they cannot drain the tank completely. However, this may be done by allowing the water to drain back through the force main and escaping through the check valve at the pump house. The flap in the check valve should be removed for this purpose. Also, during this operation it must be ascertained that air has free access to the pressure tank, either through some regular inlet to the tank, or if necessary, through the water gauge glass connections. When the tank has been completely drained and the pressure tank again made airtight, it is believed that on refilling the tank about two-thirds full that the necessary 60-80 lbs. will be maintained for longer periods in the system.\n\nIt is suggested that Mr. Wallace's recommendations be carried out and the results noted carefully before any action is taken on the proposal to install an air compressor unit.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

Flourde O.M.I.,  \n619 McDermot Avenue,  \nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Father,\n\nThe Fairbanks Morse Co. keep on sending to me the account covering the cost of the motor you purchased for our School pump. It seems that the Department is not yet prepared to pay this account, I do not understand why? It is to be understood that the School management cannot and will not take care of this expense. I thought a report from the engineer Mr. Wallace would have brought some result as I have explained the case to him. I shall give you those reasons again:\n\nReferring to Mr. Hoey's letter to you (Sept. 20 1941) the original motor purchased in 1938 has not been rendered useless; it has actually been repaired and is to be used as a stand-by. It must be noted that this same motor has been going to Winnipeg twice for repairs; In Feb. 1941 a careless move of one of my employees overloaded the motor and caused it to burn, the rewiring cost was assumed by the School ($ 44.47). Last August went out of order again through defective bearings. Mr. Hill the Kamsack electrician examined the motor and advised to send it in to Winnipeg as it could not be repaired locally. He also advised to order an extra motor for the pump, as it takes ten days or two weeks before the motor returns from repair.\n\nDo you understand Father Flourde the inconvenience of having our pump stopped? and haul water for two weeks constantly with teams for the house and stock? It was done last winter and I proposed not to have to do it again. Also consider the danger of stalling the pump too long in the cold winter as the water may freeze in the conduits.\n\nFather Flourde I am not asking for a refund for the first repair expenses ($ 44.47) but for the last, that is I am enclosing Mr. Hill's account which I have not paid. Mr. Hill himself took care of the last repairing with the Fairbanks Morse Co.\n\nAlso find enclosed duly signed motor account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlp Paradis O.M.I  \nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach account amounting to $131.00 covering the cost of a small motor purchased for use at the St. Phillips Indian Residential School. The motor which operates the pump had broken down and another motor was absolutely necessary as it is used exclusively for pumping the water and unless a motor is available at all times the school is without water. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 662-76-12-422.\n\nR.A.

Please confer with the Principal and advise me regarding what improvements are necessary this year. Detailed information should be supplied regarding any materials needed in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch. Due to present conditions prompt delivery is difficult to obtain and, therefore, it is in the best interests of all parties concerned to place orders at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nJune 13, 1942.\n\nRev. Father J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n597 McDermot Avenue, WPG.\n\nDear Father,\n\nThe St. Philips Indian Res. School has no motor truck, it has only one automobile for the use of the School, the farmland and the missions. The greater part of our operations are on the Indian Reserves where there are no filling stations nor do we come anywhere close to such stations on the way. One of these missions is 20 miles away. We have no filling station in St. Philips, the closest is in Kamsack, a distance of 11 miles.\n\nConsidering the distance the school is from all filling stations, I would ask you to use your influence through the Department or directly to the Oil Controller, to authorize the delivery of a supply of gasoline to the School, with the use of ration coupons. The School has an underground tank put up for that purpose and always had its gas delivered previous to the rationing. This gas tank is for private use only and has an inside pump.\n\nWe cannot properly discharge our essential duties without sufficient gas handy. Since we started taking our gas from the filling stations in Kamsack we have had to make a special trip just to fill up. I am trying to save as much gas as possible with a Bl Coupon Book while I am entitled to more, so I do not intend to burn one whole gallon of gas every time my tank runs low, just for the sole purpose of filling up.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAlp. Paradis, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter which I have just received from the Principal of St. Philips Indian Residential School. This letter speaks for itself.\n\nMy first idea was to write directly to the Oil Controller but as this gentleman is not likely to know very much about the mode of administration of our Indian schools it seems to me that Father Paradis has a better chance of obtaining his request in the matter of gasoline supplies if the matter is brought to the Controller's attention by the Indian Affairs Department.\n\nWhen our school principals buy gasoline directly from the oil companies they get it at a wholesale price, and do not pay the Sales Tax. That is a considerable economy and one which our schools, under the present difficult conditions obtaining in the country cannot be lightly overlooked.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your kind consideration, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, June 24th, 1942.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a letter from the Principal of the St. Philips Residential School with reference to securing permission to use the gas tank at the school and thus avoid buying from local dealers.\n\nA similar request was recently received from the Principal of the St. Cyprian C. of E. Residential School and, at that time, we communicated with the Oil Controller. In a letter dated May 9th, he replied as follows:\n\n\"We would advise you that the Oil Controller's Orders prohibit the servicing of passenger cars at any point other than a service station. We cannot permit the purchase of gasoline for use in private cars by drum or otherwise. We would suggest that if the car used by the principal of your school could be licensed as a commercial vehicle he would be relieved of the obligation to purchase his supplies at a service station.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The majority of the patches will be from 1 yard to three yards, and in view of the number so to be patched I consider the price of $65.00 quite reasonable.\n\nWe would like to proceed with the work in time to complete it before school opens, and would appreciate your advice at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The former was authorized by you in letter 117-3-5 of August 15th.\n\nAt the time the estimate was submitted for approval no consideration was given to the needs of the chapel. It was, however, decided upon subsequently, and since the outlay was very nominal, I approved of the work. The wood work in the chapel was in bad need of resurfacing, and I trust you will concur in my decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nKamsack, Sask.,\nNovember 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe St. Philips School.\n\nI have been approached by Fr. Tetreaux, with a request to arrange for lumber to build a drying room. Under present arrangement all clothes that are washed must be lugged up to the top storey of the school where it is spread out and dried. This involves hard labour and sometimes accidents to those who do the work. It is believed that the sisters in charge of this last winter suffered illness directly in consequence of this arrangement.\n\nThe new drying room is to be built on the present pump house which is partly below the earth's surface and partly above, and situated back of the school, adjoining it. Washing is also done in this room. The new super structure will not affect the appearance of the premises, but will be much more convenient than having to cart clothes through the school and two storeys up. The principal adds that they will provide their own labour.\n\nI am attaching herewith the estimate of material required and cost of same.\n\nKindly advise if the Department approves of this plan, and if so, an immediate reply would be very much appreciated, so that work could be commenced before cold weather sets in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A.

Tetrault O.M.I.\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School\nSt. Philips P.O., Sask.\n\nApril 19, 1943\n\nMr. Philip Phelan Chief Training Division\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed find the bill for electricity used at our school last month.\n\nI send this bill to the Department because I refuse to pay it. I refuse to pay it, because I was told to do so by my Superior. He has ordered me this because in the contract past between the Department and the Town of Kamsack it is said, and I quote: \"the Department shall pay to the Municipality, seven cents per K.W.H.\" etc. This contract was signed by a representative of the Department, Mr. W. McGill, and not by a representative of the school. Furthermore, the Belly Agency is on the same contract as we, and the Department pays their light bills every month, and have done so always as far as I know.\n\nNow you may say that it is our duty to pay our own light expenses. I say; not according to the contract. And if you find hard to pay such a bill every month... what about us, with so little money. Then something should be done about the whole question.\n\nFirst of all I say that there is no sense whatever to pay 7 cents straight to the Town of Kamsack for the electricity. Those who made that contract were certainly sure not to pay the bills. We have here some electric motors. One 7 horse power, two of 3 horse power, and others of \u00bd horse power. And they are all on the same rate, as for the lights, there is no sense in that. There should be a special rate for our motors. And we should follow the rate table of the Town of Kamsack which I enclosed.\n\nI have spoken to an official to lower our rate according to this table. The answer was: \"We will not do so unless this contract is made void and another one made. They are in their rights, and also are making and have been making big money on us since 1939. So do you not think that something should be done about it. It seems to me that a man should be appointed.\"\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the bill for electricity used at the St. Philips Residential School for the month of March, 1943.\n\nThe management of each Indian residential school is expected to pay, from funds received from per capita grant or other receipts, the cost of electricity and power used at the school.\n\nWhile the present arrangement regarding electricity was made by the Department for both the school and the Agency buildings, the Principal of the St. Philips Residential School at the time this arrangement was first made was fully aware of the conditions and acquiesced in them.\n\nI am, therefore, returning the account which you forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. P.E. Tetrault, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Philips, Sask.\nRegina, April 26, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inform you I have received two or three letters from the Reverend P.E. Tetrault, O.M.I., Principal of the St. Philips Indian Residential School, inviting me to go over to visit the school.\n\nToday I am in receipt of another letter from him informing me he has made many repairs to the school to improve it during the past year and he is now wondering whether the Department will refund this money for the amount he expended on these improvements.\n\nFather Tetrault also states some laundry equipment is badly needed, which is absolutely essential, and I know he is right because between the children and staff there is somewhere in the neighborhood of ninety people there. He states a small high pressure boiler, a drying tumbler, and a water softener are required for the school. The water softener is needed because the water is so hard they have to melt snow during the Winter time with which to wash and the clothes have to be dried during the Winter time in the halls of the school. He further states one of the sisters died some years ago and one nearly lost her life recently due to what he believes is over-exertion, and you can readily understand the Sisters have to work hard carrying baskets full of wet clothes all over the school during the Winter time so that they can be hung up to dry. Also, they have to use hard water for the boiler and as a result of this the flues are gradually corroding, therefore it will not be long before the boiler will have to be re-flued.\n\nI know the reason the Reverend Principal is so anxious for me to visit the school is so that he can talk these different matters over with me and I have informed him I will be there some time in June, so when I submit my report to Ottawa after my visit you will know what to expect.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the St. Philips Indian Residential School. With regard to the second paragraph of your letter, I cannot hold out any hope of refunding to the Principal the expenditures which he made last year, owing to the present purchasing regulations.\n\nI note that you will write further following your visit to the school regarding the laundry equipment that you consider is necessary. Your recommendation will receive careful consideration, but apparently the Principal did not bring the matter to the attention of the Agent when the estimates were being prepared for the fiscal year 1943-44. As a consequence we have only provided an amount of $500.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nFor your information I may say that the following expenditures were incurred at the St. Philips School during the past year:\n\nDecember, 1942 - Lumber for building a drying room .......... $298.31\n\nOctober, \" - Varnishing floors and woodwork ............. 86.40\nSeptember, 1942 - Lumber, cement, shingles, nails, etc. supplied for repairs and improvements $318.04\n\nSeptember, \" - Repairing plaster ...... 65.00\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Principal of St. Philip's Indian Residential School, in the Pelly Agency, and he is asking for blue prints of the school since he wants to go over the sewer system that was installed there.\n\nIt seems Father Tetrault wants to make a few alterations in the school such as installing a toilet near the kitchen and they need the plan of the sewage system in order to make the connection.\n\nI have looked over the records here and we do not seem to have the plans, therefore would you please forward these plans to him.\n\nM.

Father Tetraulx, Principal of the\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School, is being\nforwarded blue prints of the plan of this\nbuilding.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWe made a contract, which I saw there, for the Agency and the Cote School for 7\u00a2 per k.w.h., and that is the same rate that St. Philips are paying. However, Mr. Blewett, the Clerk, informed me that the Superintendent was figuring on special rates; for instance, where an institution of any kind had appliances for electric energy they would get a special rate. I got a copy of this and took it to the school and explained the whole matter thoroughly to the Principal and also advised him that he was to go in and see Mr. Blewett, who would go into this matter further.\n\nAs I have stated before I am herewith attaching a Requisition for the requests made by the Rev. P. E. Tetrault, O.M.I.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nthat drying clothes in the school is not suitable for the health of the occupants whether they are children or grown up.\n\nHowever, I discussed this matter thoroughly with the Principal and made no promises of any kind, only that I told him I was pretty sure that he would get the paint immediately.\n\nI am making a Requisition of his requests, which I am attaching herewith. If the time comes when you can put in a high pressure boiler in connection with the drying tumbler this matter should be gone into thoroughly, because to the best of my knowledge, and I have talked to several experienced steam engineers, a vertical boiler there would not be satisfactory.\n\nThere is also the matter of paying 7 cents per k.w.h. for electric light from the town of Kamsack. This spring the Father Provincial was at the school. He asked the Principal who made the contract for the school for the electric light and the Principal replied \"the Department at Ottawa\" and the Father Provincial replied: \"Then send the bill to them\", which the Principal did and he stated the bill came back, as he expected.\n\nWhile in Kamsack I visited the Town office and I found that no contract has been made between the Town of Kamsack and our Department.\n\n....... We made a contract\nthe dormitories and corridors. The principal informed me that he had been in touch with Stanley Brock and they quoted him a drying tumbler $136 x 50 at $350.00. Then a steam boiler, high pressure would also be needed and this would cost about $445.00. A building has been erected on the south side of the school, that is it joins the school but is just off the boiler room where the tumbler and the boiler are to be installed. There is also a room there where the clothes could be ironed, etc.\n\nThis school gets the water from a spring nearby, but the water is terribly hard. They have tried all kinds of soap, but even at that the water is too hard to wash clothes in, therefore it is necessary for them to melt snow in the winter and in the summer time they use rain water. In order to make use of the water for washing a softener would have to be installed. The Principal informs me that he has a quotation of $310.00 on this. I do not know whether this hard water is hard on the plumbing or not. I got several different opinions on this that did not seem to agree.\n\nThey also asked for some paint to do some interior decorating with and the Sisters informed me that they would do the work themselves.\n\nTo me it is evident that something has got to be done about the whole thing that they brought to my attention. You will understand\n\n...... that drying\nThe first request on the list is a set of 8 grates for the steam boiler. These were out in the back yard and are warped and twisted from being over-heated. I was talking to the Steam Boiler Inspector here who has inspected this school previously and he informed me that in all probability we would have to get them casted either in Winnipeg or Regina and that this would take some time. The boiler is badly pitted. This, the Boiler Inspector informed me, could only be repaired by sawing the bottom of the fire box and welding a new one on and it seems that one or two outfits here have the necessary tools for this purpose. However, we may be able to get through one more year without doing this, but in any event the grates must be furnished.\n\nThe next on the list is a drying tumbler. The present method of drying clothes in the winter time is to take them upstairs and dry them in the corridors, laying some of them on the beds in the dormitories. You can figure out yourself what kind of a job this is for the Sisters to carry wet clothes up three flights of stairs and then hang them in the halls, and as I stated before dry them by putting them over the beds, etc. This in my opinion is very unhealthy for the children. Several had pneumonia there last winter and I can well understand this with wet clothes through\n\n.... the dormitories\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to inform you that during the last three months I have had several letters from the Rev. P. E. Tetrault, Principal at St. Philips Indian Residential School at St. Philips asking me to visit his school. I was finally able to do so last week when I spent practically a week in the Pelly Agency. Mr. Bryant, the Agent, and I visited this school last Thursday and spent considerable time there going over the building from top to bottom, looking over the equipment, etc.\n\nDuring the last year the Principal has spent $324.38 on repairs to the buildings. This consists mostly of changing partitions, putting cupboards up, building drying room for clothes, painting, and other changes given in the interior of the school. The reason for this is that they are so crowded that they have to use every available space that it was possible to find in the school. This accounts for the moving of partitions, etc. As Mr. Bryant already has the invoices he is going to make up a voucher for all of them, and this will be forwarded to Ottawa just as soon as the Clerk there is able to make it up. I think at the present time there are 78 children in residence there in a school that was originally meant for 50 children.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nJune 29 1943\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF St. Philips Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 09-615; 12-415\n\nSHIP TO St. Philips Residential School, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nPurpose for which required Repairs and acquisition of equipment.\n\nNOTE: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nconsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Quantity on hand (1) | Quantity used per month (2) | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------|-------|\n|          |                     |                             |            |       |\n| Set of 6 Grates for Steam Boiler | (Kewanee Portable Firebox Boiler) | 70411 | | |\n| Drying Tumbler 136 x 30 | | | | |\n| Quotation by Stanley Brook Ltd. $550.00 | | | | |\n| Steam Boiler, high pressure, vertical | | | | |\n| Approximate Cost $445.00 - Stanley Brook Ltd. | | | | |\n| Water Softener - cost approximately $310.00 | | | | |\n| 15 gals. ready mixed paint (inside) cream color | | | | |\n| 15 gals. \" \" \" \" White | | | | |\n| 2 gals. boiled oil | | | | |\n| 1 gal. turps. | | | | |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

You can figure out yourself what kind of a job this is for the Sisters to carry wet clothes up three flights of stairs and then hang them in the halls, and as I stated before dry them by putting them over the beds, etc. This in my opinion is very unhealthy for the children. Several had pneumonia there last winter and I can well understand this with wet clothes through\n\n..... the dormitories\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to inform you that during the last three months I have had several letters from the Rev. P. E. Tetrault, Principal at St. Philips Indian Residential School at St. Philips asking me to visit his school. I was finally able to do so last week when I spent practically a week in the Pelly Agency. Mr. Bryant, the Agent, and I visited this school last Thursday and spent considerable time there going over the building from top to bottom, looking over the equipment, etc.\n\nDuring the last year the Principal has spent $824.38 on repairs to the buildings. This consists mostly of changing partitions, putting cupboards up, building drying room for clothes, painting, and other changes given in the interior of the school. The reason for this is that they are so crowded that they have to use every available space that it was possible to find in the school. This accounts for the moving of partitions, etc. As Mr. Bryant already has the invoices he is going to make up a voucher for all of them, and this will be forwarded to Ottawa just as soon as the Clerk there is able to make it up. I think at the present time there are 78 children in residence there in a school that was originally meant for 50 children.\nOttawa, July 7, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building, Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to your recent inspection of the St. Philips Residential School.\n\nIn the second paragraph of your letter you mention that among the expenditures made by the Principal one was for building a drying-room. In the last paragraph of page 2 of your letter, you again refer to drying the clothes upstairs. These two statements do not appear to coincide, especially in view of the fact that on November 3, 1942, Indian Agent Bryant wrote us and explained the difficulty regarding drying clothes and advised that the school management was prepared to provide a new drying-room over the present pump-house, on the condition that we would supply the material required. We supplied the material in November, 1942, at an approximate cost of $500.00. If the school management proceeded with the work, as was apparently intended from the correspondence just mentioned, I feel that they should have a room that could be used for drying clothes.\n\nThe funds at our disposal at the present time will not permit considering the purchase of a drying tumbler at a cost of $550 and a steam boiler at a cost of $445. I presume, however, from your letter, that you do not expect these purchases to be made immediately, in view of the fact that you are not yet certain whether a vertical boiler would be satisfactory.\n\nI note that the Principal has secured a quotation of $310 for a water softener. It would be appreciated if you would arrange to have him forward full particulars regarding this machine, also the name of the firm from whom he secured the quotation, and, if possible, the exact quotation, itself. In receipt of this information the matter will be submitted to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nI am pleased to know that you found it possible to interview the town of Kamsack with a view to having the rate for electricity reduced. In this connection I may say that while the arrangement regarding the electricity was made by the Department for both the Residential School, the Cote Day School and also the agency buildings, the Principal of the St. Philips Residential School, at the time the arrangement was first made, was fully aware of the conditions and acquiesced in them. We so informed the Reverend Principal in a letter dated April 28, 1943.\n\nI am requesting the Departmental Purchasing Agent to secure the grates for the steam boiler and also the paint, boiled oil and turpentine.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOttawa, July 7, 1943.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School,\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT 10-691 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Welfare & Training, OTTAWA.\n\nre St Philips Residential School\n\nLast year you advised that there was $800.00 available for repairs and improvements at this school. Due to the difficulty in getting the necessary help considerable work that was planned could not be completed before the end of year, and only a portion of funds available were spent.\n\nThis spring the principal proceeded to erect the drying room, and move a few partitions and considerable painting was also done. This work was done without authority and Father Tetrault was evidently under the impression that the money was still available.\n\nMr Christianson was here last week and looked over the work that had been done, and will be writing you in regard to this matter.\n\nI am enclosing accounts that have been paid by Father Tetrault hoping that there may be some funds available from which they may be paid.\n\nJ.L. Bryant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 9, 1943.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to repairs and improvements made by the Principal of the St. Philips Residential School.\n\nThe amount provided in the appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school in last year's Vote expired at the end of March, 1943.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation there was provided an amount of $500.00 for repairs and improvements. The paylists which you forwarded and which I am returning total almost this amount. If the Principal wishes repayment, the Department is prepared to pay them, but it should be distinctly understood that in doing so it will exhaust the amount of money provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school. However, before paying the amount for the labour, it will be necessary to have a separate paylist issued for each month. The name of the person who did the work should appear under the heading \"Names\" and the paylists, of course, should be receipted. When these are ready, you should attach them to a voucher form and submit them to this office.\n\nIt is not possible for us to consider payment of the accounts from the Beaver Lumber Company and the Monarch Lumber Company.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nExtract of a letter from St. Philips Indian Residential School, dated May 6, 1943.\n\nThe second question is that of the natural gas found on the property of the school. Last Sunday search was made by a man employed by the Companies drilling for gas near Kamsack. This man also works for different Companies in Alberta to find gas or oil. With his instrument he immediately found a large field of natural gas extending west, south-west and south of the school. The gas would be in great abundance according to him. The depth would be about 800 feet deep at the most and most probably less said he. The cost of drilling might be $4.00 a foot. Next would come the piping to the school. This would mean about 1/4 of mile long or more of pipe. Due to the depth of the gas it would give better service than in Kamsack, more pressure. According to Mr. Mills of Kamsack a three inch pipe would be sufficient for our needs. He will give me an estimate of the piping cost. If you desire to have it I shall send it to you.\n\nWhat a blessing this would be for our institution. The fuel wood is practically all gone from the Reserve. This winter I wanted 300 cords of wood. I may have now on hand about 150. So I am short of fuel right now for next winter. In a few years we will have to buy coal.\n\nIf the Department could pay the initial cost, some arrangement could be made to refund a part of the cost, little by little.\n\nIf I have presented such facts it is that you may consider them and the possibility of their execution.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI am attaching herewith copy of a letter received on May 8th from the Principal of the St. Philips Indian Residential School at St. Philips.\n\nI feel pretty sure, and I told the Principal this when I was there, that there is not much chance of our Department going to the expense of putting down a gas well at the present time. However, I am forwarding this for your information if the time should come when it is necessary to develop this gas. In any case I know how interested our Minister is in anything of this nature.\n\nM. Christianson,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.\n\nThis oil man must be a wizard. On his Sunday off he locates or estimates a gas field 800 feet below the surface. It was suggested that it is fairly close enough or what to have a decision to drill for gas at South entrance.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**RECEIPT FORM**\n\n---\n\n**Supplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\".**\n\n---\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                  | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------------------------|------|-------|\n| 15 gal.  | Paint, interior, S.G. cream  |      |       |\n|          | 3/58 - 1 G.F. 67-1941        |      |       |\n| 15 gal.  | Paint, interior, S.G. white  |      |       |\n|          | 3/58 - 1 G.F. 67-1941        |      |       |\n| 3 gal.   | Boiled linseed oil, 2/16.    |      |       |\n|          | 1 G.F. 2-1940                |      |       |\n| 1 gal.   | Paint thinner                |      |       |\n|          | 1 G.F. 4-1938                |      |       |\n\nEstimated cost........... $95.00\n\nPlease prepay transportation charges and attach receipted freight invoices to regular invoices.\n\n---\n\n**Shipping Instructions**\n\nRev.

Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building, Scarth & Victoria Streets,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication dated May 8 from the Principal of the St. Philips Residential School.\n\nFrom the information now available, the Department does not consider it advisable to take any action regarding the gas which, it is stated, might be secured.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRegina, July 12, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 117-3-5 of the 7th instant regarding my recent inspection of the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nEvidently the information you received from Mr. Bryant in connection with building the drying room was the thing that lead you astray because the present drying room without a tumbler for drying the clothes is more or less useless. This room is for the purpose of housing the dryer, etc. and if you will look at the plan of the school you will see that the school is a three-storey building and the front of the school and a wing one-storey above the ground run back from the centre of the building. The drying room is built in the corner where the one-storey building joins the three-storey building. However, I am writing to Agent Bryant and asking him to send you a sketch showing where this room was built on to the school.\n\nNaturally as I have said above, the room in question is more or less useless without a tumbler. I have discussed this with the Principal of the School and the Sister Superior, and after thinking the matter over carefully I believe the most important items for the school at the present time are the drying tumbler and the steam boiler. We can let the water softener wait for another year if necessary.\n\nReferring to the boiler and my recent report I only mentioned the difference between the vertical boiler and the horizontal boiler because the boiler inspector is of the opinion that a horizontal boiler would be much better than a vertical one. However, that is something for experts to attend to. I know how necessary this equipment is to the school and I think if you and I were in charge of the school we would see that it is practically impossible to get along without the proper equipment when a school is housing up to 100 people.\n\nIn conclusion I might say I am only trying to stress the importance of the situation and I would think that it would be well for our Branch to go into the matter with the Church Authorities. If we have not enough money to spend on the school this year, instead of leaving the matter in abeyance for another year surely the Church authorities might put up some money to instal\n\nthe equipment that is necessary....\nthe equipment that is necessary this year. Then another year our Brethren could refund the money to the church. The Catholic Church has many Brothers experienced in engineering, electricity, etc., and I would suggest that they send one or these Brothers to the school. I know he would see the necessity of furnishing the equipment mentioned above for the school this year.\n\nIn my report I simply tried to show how important it is to have something carried out this year and at the same time whatever is done there should only be carried out on the recommendation of a thoroughly experimented man, that is one who will recommend something to give perfect satisfaction. The more I think over the matter the more convinced I am something should be done for these people to relieve them of their difficulties.\n\nI hope I have made myself clear.\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies,\n\nJ. Christenson,\nOttawa, July 16, 1943.\n\nMr. J. L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Christianson, suggesting the installation of a drying tumbler and a steam boiler at the St. Philips Indian Residential School. I understand from Mr. Christianson that the room for drying clothes, for which the Department supplied material last year, has been erected, but Mr. Christianson states that the school management feel that a tumbler should be supplied.\n\nThe management of the St. Philips School can easily obtain one of their Brothers who is experienced in engineering, electricity, etc., to make a thorough inspection of the facilities available at the St. Philips School, and, if they do so, he should submit his report to you, stating the size and type of tumbler required, also the size and type of boiler. Complete details should be supplied, including references to catalogues of well known firms, in order that we may be able to present the request to the Departmental Purchasing Agent in a proper manner.\n\nIn view of present conditions and the shortage of equipment of many kinds, I cannot definitely promise that the tumbler and boiler will be secured, but if we receive the information we require, the matter will be given our very careful consideration.\n\nR.

Why should the cost be higher than the one purchased for Camperville.\n\n\"Will you please arrange to secure the required information, including a neutral specification, to assist this office in securing competitive prices.\"\n\nI also enclose a copy of correspondence with reference to a softener purchased a few months ago for the Pine Creek Indian Residential School at Camperville, Man.\nIt would be appreciated if you would have one of your officials visit the St. Philips School and advise if the type of softener on which Crans Limited quote would be suitable for the requirements.\n\nActing Director.\nThe Monarch Lumber Co.

Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing three additional requisitions for lumber etc. for repairs at the St. Phillips Residential School. You mention our previous letter in which you were told that an amount of $500.00 was specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new material for this school, but you overlooked the fact that we have already expended $172.81 for paint and furnace grates and, besides, we are endeavouring to secure a new tumbler at an approximate cost of $450.00. Besides this, we have had requests from the Principal for a steam boiler and a water softener. The total cost of these items will greatly exceed the amount specifically provided and consequently the Principal should be advised that it is going to be difficult to fill any more requisitions from this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nThere is a great demand for pork products at the present time and, besides, every effort should be made to keep any roots or vegetables that are grown and, with this in mind, it has been decided to request the Purchasing Branch to secure the material required for repairs to the pig pen and root cellar.\n\nWe are not certain if the type of water softener recommended by the Principal would be satisfactory and consequently we have arranged with the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have one of their officers visit the school and examine the water.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI would be very much interested to know if you are going to do anything for the St. Philips Indian Boarding School. The Father is continually writing to me and wondering what is going to be done for him.\n\nThis is in connection with the water softener for the school, the high pressure boiler, and the drying tumbler.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nAugust 28, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, the Department has already expended $172.21 for paint and furnace grates for the St. Philips Residential School. We are endeavouring to secure a new tumbler at an approximate cost of $450.00. We have written to the Principal for further information regarding the steam boiler. A representative of the Surveys & Engineering Branch has been requested to visit the school, with a view to obtaining definite information regarding the type of water softener that is required. Yesterday we received another letter from Mr. Bryant enclosing a further request from the Principal for material costing approximately $600.00. Funds at present will not permit purchase of this amount, but we have ordered the materials required for repairing the pig pen and root cellar. I feel that we are dealing very generously with the Principal of the St. Philips School and it is felt that we should receive no further requests from him during the current fiscal year. Owing to present conditions it may take some time before the tumbler, steam boiler and water softener are secured, but this delay is due to circumstances beyond our control and will not be improved by constant letter writing on the part of the Principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**Order No. 19933**\n\n**RECEIPT FORM**\n\n---\n\nSupplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\".\n\n---\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                      | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|------|-------|\n|          | The following building material for repairing pig pen, cistern, and root cellar at St. Phillips Indian Residential School, near Kisimoon, Sask. |      |       |\n| 64 packs | Portland cement                                  | 1.7  | 112.8 |\n| 1500     | 1\" x 6\" cedar shingles                           | 32.00| 96.00 |\n| 10 pieces| 2\" x 4\" x 10' spruce                             | 49.00| 490.0 |\n| 17       | Fir studding, 2\" x 4\" x 14 - 100'                | 36.00| 612.0 |\n| 10       | Fir for ceiling, 2\" x 4\" x 10 - 80'              | 30.00| 300.0 |\n\n---\n\nPrices F.O.B. as per your order.\n\n---\n\nShipping Instructions\n\nVote: Primary.

Hoey\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour Department wanted specifications and quotations on the different machines needed at our school. I have already given some on the Drying Tumbler and Water Softener. I also wrote to Vulcan Iron Works Limited of Winnipeg. With their catalogue they answered, quote: \"From information received, it is our understanding that your Department is having the Boiler Room inspected and it is assumed that definite specifications will be prepared for us to quote on.\" end of quotation.\n\nIf I understand well you are to send an inspector to inspect the boiler room and also to analyse the water, for it seems that the analysis made in Winnipeg and Toronto is regarded as not satisfactory by your Department.\n\nWould it be possible to this inspector to come at once, for this reason: To install this new boiler high pressure, we need room, and we must provide for it before it freezes. We could find room in the present boiler room to install a vertical boiler but these are not satisfactory for they last but a few years and must be replaced in a short period of time. Mr. Auchland, boiler inspector of Regina is opposed to the installment of a vertical boiler. But to install a horizontal boiler room must be provided and also for the water softer and tank. So excavating should be done to the west of the present water tank room. This additional room would cost but very little, for only two small walls and a slant roof would be needed.\n\nHoping to welcome your inspector very soon, I remain\n\nSincerely Yours\n\nP.E.

Series Water Softener, Model 24-42.\n\nTenderers shall supply literature fully descriptive of the equipment offered.\n\nNote: If the Department does not wish to call for tenders on the unit installed, full instructions for installation and operation should be supplied by the successful tenderer.\nSeptember 15th, 1943\n\nRe: St. Philip's Indian Residential School,\nWater Supply\n\nIn reference to your notation on Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of August 26th last, regarding specifications for a water softener, we have obtained the following information from Mr. Gow:\n\n1. The total hardness of the water is 36 grains per Imperial gallon.\n\n2. He has no definite knowledge of the daily consumption at the school and states that it may easily exceed 4000 gallons per day, owing to waste in leaky or open taps and lawn watering.\n\nIn this connection, Mr. Gow states that the Indian Affairs Branch should be interested primarily in softening the water to prevent the rapid deterioration and replacement of metal piping, heating boilers, hot water boilers, high pressure steam boilers and certain laundry equipment, and secondarily - although this would be of primary importance to the school authorities - in having softened water for washing and laundry purposes. The average daily consumption for these purposes should not exceed 1000 Imperial gallons with a peak of 2500 gallons on wash days. Limiting the use of softened water to these purposes would necessitate alterations in the piping, and the cost of this could only be determined after an inspection. The difference in the use of salt between a daily softening of 4000 and 1000 Imperial gallons would be about 37 lbs., or a saving of $0.75 per day. This would justify a considerable expenditure on alterations to the piping. He further suggests that a twin unit should be installed so that no untreated water would be used in the equipment mentioned above, although he realizes that it may be more difficult to secure a permit for a double unit than for a single unit.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and the fact that the school has been using this untreated water for many years, it would seem reasonable to delay the installation of this equipment until after the war when material will be more easily obtained, or at least until arrangements have been made to alter the piping to reduce the softened water requirements. However, if the Indian Affairs Branch wishes to proceed at once with the purchase of a unit to treat 4000 gallons per day, a specification is attached which may be used by the Purchasing Agent to call for tenders. As the Dure equipment mentioned by Messrs. Crane Limited, is manufactured by Messrs. Pumps and Softeners, Limited, London, Ont., it is suggested that they be asked to quote.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: St. Philip's Indian Residential School,\nWater Supply.\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of August 26th last relative to the above, I may say that the Duro S.C. 24-42 water softener on which Crane Limited have quoted is considered to be of a type suitable for the requirements of St. Philip's School.\n\nEnclosed for your information and consideration is a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, dated September 15th, which is self-explanatory, together with a specification for a unit to treat 4,000 gallons of water per day for use if it is decided to call for tenders for such unit immediately.\n\nThe difference between the cost of the unit Duro S.C. 24-42, as quoted on by Crane Limited and of the equipment purchased for Pine Creek Indian Residential School, Camperville, Manitoba, is due to the former having a much greater mineral capacity, 11 cubic feet of mineral while the latter (2 softeners) has a mineral capacity of only 5\u00bd cubic feet. The amount of water which can be treated by the former by one regeneration is correspondingly greater than the amount which can be treated by the latter.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nST. PHILIPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nST. PHILIPS P.O., SASK.\n\nSept. 17, 1943\n\nMr. P. H. Abee\nDept. of Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. J. Bryant asked me the necessary information regarding the type and capacity of the high pressure boiler.\n\nI could not give him these informations for the reasons I gave you in my last letter. The Hudson Bay Works of Winnipeg wrote to me saying that our boiler room was to be inspected by an inspector of your department. So I am still waiting for this inspector. We have little or no room available to install this boiler. To be practical and economical a rectangular boiler should be installed and not a vertical. The Saskatchewan boiler inspectors of Regina is opposed to the vertical, for they do not give good service and last kept a few years, as the experience has shown it in some of our schools. So I hope that the inspector from your department, etc. Engineers, who is at least the water, will hope that he will say as a first very soon we could then see what we could do about a room to install this boiler. I think that a 15 horse power would do. But more informations and specifications I shall give\nto your inspectors when he comes.\n\nWill it be possible for you to send me a letter, or to obtain one from a member of the government, to help me in obtaining free passage of the Band instruments that I would like to buy in the United States. The duty is indeed very heavy so I hope that some one in your department or in some other department will assist me in -- a free from duty -- or something of the kind.\n\nRemaining sincerely Yours,\n\nP.

This is our goal, and we will achieve something only with cooperation and good will of all parties concerned. Think of the work to haul that snow, the cost in fuel and especially now that fuel is so hard to obtain, even cord wood is very scarce around here. This work of melting snow is even dangerous for the health of our boys who have to go in and out, and who get wet at the job. In the report it is stated that we \"have been using this untreated water for many years.\" I must say that this is only partly true. This water has been used and can be used for drinking and cooking and also for the flushing of toilets, but it has never been used for washing, and never will be, for it is absolutely impossible to wash clothes with it.\n\nThe great argument nowadays is: We are at war,. It is a fact, I cannot deny it. I am ready to do my share of sacrifice. But these machines are essential in an establishment like ours. I know that you have done much for our school in the past, for which I sincerely thank you, and I hope that I shall have the pleasure of thanking you once more for I know that you will do the utmost to obtain us these machines so urgently needed.\n\nI remain sincerely Yours,\n\nP. L. T\u00e9treault\nDear Sir:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of September the 28th, and also the copy of the letter of Mr. T.S. Mills Chief Engineer.\n\nIn the second paragraph of this letter it is stated: \"That the daily consumption of water may easily exceed 4000 gallons per day, owing to waste in leaky or open taps and lawn watering.\"\n\nI am not of this opinion. Before making any such statement a thorough investigation should be made by one of your Engineer to find out how much water is used by our school. For on this statement was built the argument for refusing this water softener. Such an argument does not stand for I am positive that we do not use so much water. For example: I have not watered the lawn once this summer, and very little water will ever be used for that purpose.\n\nIt is stated again in that information of Mr. Gow that: \"Alterations in the piping\" would be necessary. It seems to me that very little alteration would be needed. For the water softeners should be connected only on the hot water system. For the hot water is used for cooking and laundry, and it is the hot water that deteriorates the metal and piping. In making the connection on the hot water system only it has the advantage of reducing the cost of operation of regeneration. Also the advantage that smaller water softener can do the work, for only about one third of the water used is thus softened.\n\n\"That a twin unit should be installed\", is correct, for that no untreated water would be used.\n\nAs for the permit... Crane Ltd. from Winnipeg had already obtained one from the Metal Control Board of Ottawa. So it would really be easy enough to your Department to obtain the necessary permits, if only you wanted to.\n\nIt is also said that due to \"the fact that the school has been using this untreated water for many years, it would seem reasonable to delay the installation of this equipment until after the war...\" etc...\n\nFor these reasons your Department has decided not to purchase a water softener at the present time.\n\nI wish and I hope that the members of your Department will change their minds on this. One must be in our position to know and feel the absolute necessity of such a machine. And Mr. Christianson has emphasize its absolute necessity. Think for a moment of the long months of our long winter during which we will be without soft water... rain water... and that we will be obliged to melt snow to obtain our soft water. Think of the work, and unnecessary work, impose on our boys. My intention is to do away with these unnecessary gobs. The parents of our boys complain that their boys do unnecessary work, and in so doing do not learn the more essential things they should know, as wood work etc. Another go! I want to do away with is the splitting of the wood for the kitchen stove.

A. Hoey  \nChief of Training Division\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAbout the water softeners I forgot to mention another reason to prove the absolute necessity of same.\n\nTo operate the high pressure boiler which the Department is to purchase for our school, we need soft water, according to Mr. Auchland, boiler inspector from Regina. Otherwise in a very short time pipes etc. will be blocked with scales due to hardness of water.\n\nMoreover we intend to boil the cloths for laundry with this boiler and therefore soft water is needed.\n\nFor these reasons and those already mentioned I hope that the Department will see our needs and the absolute necessity of these softeners, and that it will be granted to us.\n\nRemaining sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOct. 7, 1943\nVulcan Iron Works Limited\nWinnipeg, Canada\n\nOctober 8, 1943.\n\nP.

I am anxious to know if this inspection has been made and if a report has been submitted. You will note that the Purchasing Agent is also anxious to secure a report on the laundry equipment now in use at the St. Philips School.\n\nYour reply, by Air Mail, will be appreciated.\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. welfare & training, Indian Affairs branch, OTTAWA.\n\nReplying to your letter of October 16th which was received this morning, in connection with the type of boiler to be installed in St. Philips Residential school, I regret to advise that up to the present time no representative of the surveys and Engineering Branch has made an inspection of the school.\n\nThe laundry equipment now in use in the school consists of a washing machine manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., No. 1213 - M.7181. This is a barrel shaped machine about four feet long and three feet in diameter. There is also an extractor put out by the same company. The two machines are run by a five horse power electric motor. They also have two large hot water boilers with a wood fire box under each. The water for the washing machine is heated in these first thing in the morning and then put in barrels as the water has to be changed after each tub goes through. The big water boilers are then filled up again and heated, as all clothes are boiled in these before going into the washer. The usual weekly wash consists of at least ten of these boilers full. These are like two large feed cookers that are used on the farm for cooking pig feed, and are about four feet in diameter and two feet deep. Washing was under way when I visited the school today and it was evident that the job was being done under difficulties, due to lack of proper equipment.\n\nJ.L.

The cost of the inspection, if railway transportation is used, would be about $35.00, but if it is desired before the end of this month, it could be done in conjunction with the visit to the hydrometric stations in that district, and the cost would be about $25.00, including car mileage allowance. We would suggest that the latter course be followed, and that the inspection be made as soon as possible.\n\nMr. Gow states that in his opinion considerable alterations to the piping will be necessary, and that it is very desirable that cold softened water be supplied to both the kitchen and the laundry. He also states that it is a fact that the school has been operating for several years past without a water softener during a period when softeners were procurable on request, and it is his understanding that the Metal Controller's regulations were designed to make impossible the installation of equipment under such circumstances. He is not prepared to accept the Principal's statement that it is absolutely impossible to wash clothes with the water supplied, as prairie homes in rural and urban districts are carrying on with water much harder than that in use at the school.\n\nT.S.

We concur in this suggestion and if you approve, the necessary instructions will be issued.\n\nWe concur in the opinion expressed by Mr. Gow that cold softened water should be supplied to both the kitchen and laundry as well as hot if water softening equipment is to be installed.\n\nJ. M. Wardle,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 25, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the water softener for the St. Phillips School, I again took up the matter with the Surveys & Engineering Branch. It has now been arranged to have Mr. Wallace visit your school in the very near future and report on the whole matter.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch is still of the opinion that considerable alterations to the piping will be necessary and that it may be very desirable that cold, softened water be supplied to both the kitchen and the laundry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It would be appreciated if you would arrange to have him visit the school and report.\n\nDirector.\nOctober 26, 1943.\n\nMemorandum\n\nWe have your memorandum of the 23rd instant, and have noted Mr. Bryant's explanation regarding the need for the boiler for the St. Phillips Indian Residential School. In this connection, I may state that if and when this boiler is supplied, it will be necessary to supply and install certain accessories, including a brick boiler setting or base, breeching to chimney, fire box, fire doors, shakers, grates, and piping to and from the laundry equipment. Will these accessories be a charge against this Department?\n\nThere is not sufficient information on the file to indicate that the boiler asked for is the most economical method of achieving the desired results. It is our opinion that before purchasing the boiler, as an isolated piece of equipment, it should be considered in its relation to the complete set-up for the laundry. We have in mind your requisitions for a tumbler dryer and a water softener for this school.\n\nIt is understood that you have requested the Surveys and Engineering Branch to have a representative visit the school in the near future, and to report on the proposed purchase of a water softener. I suggest that the scope of this investigation should be enlarged to include the tumbler, the boiler and accessories. I would also suggest that the engineer's report should embody his ideas regarding the need for the material already requisitioned, and full specifications and details of what he considers to be the most suitable equipment for the purpose required.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 26, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Father Tetrault:\n\nI enclose copy of a memorandum received from the Purchasing Branch, with reference to certain equipment that we are endeavouring to obtain for your school. As stated in my letter of the 25th instant, I understand that Mr. Wallace of the Surveys & Engineering Branch will visit your school in the very near future, and, in order to make certain that he will inquire into the various matters, I am forwarding the enclosed memorandum so that you can hand it to Mr. Wallace as soon as he arrives at the school.

In reply to an enquiry from this Service, Pumps and Softeners Ltd. have recommended the use of their unit No. 24-32 S.C. with a grain capacity of 96,000 which can treat 135 U.S. gallons between regenerations, having a flow rate of 25.1 U.S. gallons per minute, all based on water of 36 grain hardness. This unit would cost $655.75 net, f.o.b. Winnipeg tax paid. Delivery would be subject to the issuance of a permit by the Steel Controller for the manufacture of the tank after placing the order. Mr. Gow has confirmed the manufacturer's opinion that this type of softener would meet the requirements of the school.\n\n(b) Drying Tumbler: Laundry type, with steam heated coils similar to that manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Ltd., with cylinder 36\" in diameter 30\" long, complete with electric motor.\n\n(c) High Pressure Steam Boiler: Vertical type with full length tubes, capacity 10 H.P., to operate at 100 lbs. working pressure, complete with fittings and accessories as follows:\n1. Steel hood with smoke stack connection; 2. Cast iron boiler base and ashpit door; 3. Cast iron circular grate; 4. Cast iron grate rest; 5. Steam gauge; 6. Safety valve; 7. Water gauge mountings; 8. Two gauge cocks; 9. Gate valve with nipple for connection to boiler blow-off; 10. One injector with necessary valves and piping.\n\n(d) Boiler Breathing: The details of this boiler accessory can only be determined when the boiler has been placed in position. It may require certain alterations to the smoke breaching from the low pressure heating boiler to make satisfactory connection with the chimney, and can only be worked out on the job.\n\n(over)\n\nJ.

In our opinion no such arrangement is possible, and we believe the boiler should be accommodated in the proposed boiler room addition for which we understand material has already been supplied. In connection with this addition, it is pointed out that no comment or opinion was requested from this Service before the materials were ordered. Our Architect has been informed verbally however by Mr. Phelan of the Indian Affairs Branch, that labour for all work to be undertaken will be supplied by the school authorities. Under the circumstances it should be pointed out to the school principal that in building the addition, a minimum ceiling height of 10'6\" should be maintained, to facilitate installation of the smoke breeching, and also that in a non fireproof structure the inner face of the walls should be covered with asbestos board to reduce fire hazard.\n\nFurther, when tenders are invited for the high pressure boiler and accessories, it should be stipulated that the successful tenderer will be required to visit the school, obtain particulars regarding the installation of a smoke breeching, and submit a price for supplying same in accordance with conditions determined at the job.\n\nThe information forwarded herein should be sufficient for further action by the Indian Affairs Branch on the matter, if they decide to proceed with the work.\n\n[Signature]\nChief Engineer.\nDecember 29th, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water softener and laundry equipment,\nSt. Philip Residential School,\nPelly Agency, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith further reference to our memorandum of September 17th last and to subsequent correspondence, I am enclosing for your information copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, dated December 28th, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIf it is decided to proceed at once with the purchase of a water softener, we would recommend one of a type similar to Duro S.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1944.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nI am now in receipt of a report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch with reference to the recent visit of their officer to the St. Philips Residential School and we are submitting to the Purchasing Branch a requisition for a water softener, a drying tumbler and a high pressure steam boiler. We have already supplied material for a new boiler room. In reporting on the school the Surveys & Engineering Branch state that the new high pressure steam boiler, if supplied, should not be installed in the existing boiler room space. In their opinion no such arrangement is possible and they believe that the boiler should be accommodated in the proposed boiler room addition for which the material has already been supplied.\n\nPlease point out to the school Principal that in building this addition a minimum ceiling height of ten feet should be maintained to facilitate installation of the smoke breeching. You should also point out to him that in a non fireproof structure the inner face of the walls should be covered with asbestos board to reduce fire hazard.\n\nI feel certain that the Principal will carry out these instructions and we will depend on you to see that he does so.\n\nR.A.

Harey\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter in which you state that you have written again to Mr. Wallace for further information.\n\nHe told us here that he knew nothing about boilers, for this was not his line. In one of your previous letters you stated that the boiler presented by us was too expensive. Mr. Wallace told us that lately a vertical boiler had been installed in a school. If the department finds that the boiler proposed by our school is too expensive\u2014let the department give us then\u2014a Vertical instead of the horizontal as propose by our school we will accept it, for we need it badly. We also need badly the trying troubles with all the damp temperature on croaking days we had again cases of pneumonia, and the Rev. Sister Superior sick with Pleurisy and still in bed.\n\nAnd now that we have exhausted our soft water we have to melt snow and ice. So to say that we are in need of the water softener is to say very little. This one should be send, if possible\u2014immediately. Mr. Wallace was telling me that \"he could not even share with our water.\"\n\nThis boiler should be of 15 horse power.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nP. L. Tetrault\nPrincipal\nRegina, January 4, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have been wondering what action has been taken in connection with the improvements I recommended last Summer in connection with St. Philip's Indian Residential School.\n\nOn December 10th last I received a letter from the Principal saying that although the weather was still fine there were prospects of 'Flu and having to dry the clothes spread all over the school made the outlook for Winter not very bright. Father Tetrault further stated he hoped something would be done to relieve the situation and I would be very glad to know what has been done and what our Branch anticipates doing because I know that I did not recommend anything I did not consider to be absolutely essential.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 8, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Scarth & Victoria, Regina,\nSask.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with\nreference to improvements at the St. Philips\nIndian Residential School. We have been somewhat\ndelayed in forwarding requisitions to the Purchasing\nBranch, due to the fact that we had to await a\nreport from one of the officers of the Surveys &\nEngineering Branch. We now have available all the\ninformation required and we have recently requested\nthe Purchasing Branch to secure a water softener,\nhigh pressure steam boiler and drying tumbler. A\nletter in regard to our action in this matter was\nforwarded to Indian Agent Bryant on the 5th instant.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nST. PHILIPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nST. PHILIPS P.O., SASK.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. R. A. Hare\nSup't of Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised by Mr. M. Christianson that we are to receive in the near future - the high pressure boiler, the drying humbler, and water system.\n\nThis is a great honor to the department of which we are most grateful and thankful. So to you and to the other members of your department, in the name of the Red Sisters, and in my own, I want to say with all my heart - Thank you.\n\nThe putting up of these machines will involve some expenses in wages. I would like to know as soon as possible if the department is willing to pay such wages. I would love the men with the ability of putting up such machines, if only I could pay them. I have been making many repairs on the school, and my finances do not permit me to pay again for the putting up of these machines.\n\nOnce more thanking you.\n\nI remain sincerely yours,\n\nP.E. Petreel, P.M.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the boiler, tumbler and water softener. A recommendation has been made to the Purchasing Branch to secure these items, but, due to present conditions, there may be some delay. When the equipment reaches the school you might give me an estimate of the cost of installation. The Department will be disposed to give the matter favourable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

At that time no adequate provision was made in the building for a laundry. As a result, primitive methods had to be used in handling the washing and during the winter months it was necessary to carry all the wet wash up two and three flights of stairs where the clothes were hung in halls and dormitories until they were dry. Of course, in the summer the clothes were hung outside.\n\nConditions just mentioned had become so aggravated that in the summer of 1943 the Department was requested to supply some modern laundry equipment and also a small quantity of material to enlarge the boiler room. There is an authorized pupilage of 70 and for some time past we have had this number in attendance. When the new laundry machinery arrived it was found that to provide the necessary space for it would still further cramp the quarters required for the pupils and the staff.\n\nThe management of the school consulted me and for the past few weeks very careful consideration has been given to what could be done to remedy the situation in such a manner that proper working of the school could be facilitated.\n\nWe feel that the only manner in which to provide the necessary additional accommodation is by the erection of a wing approximately 60 feet long by 28 feet wide. It has been estimated that the materials for this addition would cost not more than $6000. We feel that the erection of this wing would be a permanent solution of our difficulties and I, therefore, trust that it will be found possible to provide the funds for the\nTransferred to:\nHon.

I am convinced that the extension at the St. Philips School is not only necessary, but is of a compulsory nature if the work of that school is to be carried out in an adequate manner.\n\nMay I suggest that if your Department could not grant the whole of the $6,000. this year, perhaps you could make an expenditure of $3,000. in the present fiscal year with an understanding that in next year's estimate the balance of $3,000 would be provided.\n\nI believe I have a good case and would feel very sorry if I did not succeed in getting at least part of my demand. All you may do to help me in this matter will be very highly appreciated.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAlphonse Fournier.\n\nHonourable T. A.

Mr. Fournier, Minister of Public Works, in the above matter. I quote therefrom:\n\n\"I am convinced that the extension at the St. Philips School is not only necessary, but is of a compulsory nature if the work of that school is to be carried out in an adequate manner.\n\n\"May I suggest that if your Department could not grant the whole of the $6,000. this year, perhaps you could make an expenditure of $3,000. in the present fiscal year with an understanding that in next year's estimate the balance of $3,000. would be provided.\"\n\nThis is referred for consideration, and for the preparation of a draft reply for the Minister's signature.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnc.\nApr. 21.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply.\nappears to be. In educational effort, policy should be clearly defined and easily understood at all times. The setup of the estimates should be designed to facilitate educational policy and expedite the program agreed upon from year to year. In this connection may I refer again to my memorandum to you dated May 31, 1940. We are, in my judgment, rapidly reaching the crisis in the educational work of this Division that I anticipated when I prepared that memorandum. I would not be fair to myself if I did not state that I find existing demands and existing regulations increasingly exacting, with the result that over a year ago I reached the conclusion that I had neither the ability, temperament nor patience for my present position.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nof the Principal for the construction of a well was finally rejected and it is my understanding that the Oblate Order are now engaged in the boring of a well at this school.\n\nA few weeks ago it was decided to proceed with the construction of an Indian day school at the recently established Indian reserve at Calstock, Ont. This decision was reached on the understanding that the materials\u2014lumber, cement, roofing, flooring, etc., would be purchased from funds available in the 1943-44 estimates, and the materials have been already purchased. However, I have recently received a memorandum from the Chief Treasury Officer, in which he states that payment for these supplies cannot be made from the 1943-44 estimates and must be carried over into the present fiscal year. This means that if we are to proceed with the construction of the school at Calstock, funds already set aside for repairs urgently needed at schools already in operation will have to be used for new construction. In view of these facts, I cannot possibly see how we can proceed with the construction of an addition to the St. Phillips School. Such action would, I feel convinced, result in a storm of criticism, but this fact in itself should not in any way influence our decision. I am convinced that from an educational standpoint there are a number of districts far more in need of additional school accommodation than the St. Phillips School is at this date or is likely to be at any time during the years immediately ahead of us. However, this is a matter on which there may be a difference of opinion.\n\nYou are aware that we have, in our educational estimates from year to year, certain unexpended balances, and I am disposed to think that despite the urgent need for repairs at a number of our schools and the equally urgent need for new construction, our unexpended balances this year will be quite substantial. This is due to the present setup of our estimates and the impossibility of making transfers from time to time from the B section of our estimates to the A section. If the design of our present setup is to save money, regardless of the educational needs of the Indian population, the setup is certainly succeeding and perhaps to an extent far beyond the original intention. I have been making a careful survey of the estimates provided for educational work in the provinces. I know of no setup so unworkable in practice as our present setup.\nresidential schools, all of whom resigned during the present month.\n\nThe representatives of the Church of England have been informed on a number of occasions during the last two years that no funds were likely to be available for new construction until the immediate post-war period. In view of this fact, the M.S.C.C. are now engaged in the construction, at their own expense, a school at Carcross, Yukon Territory, to replace the school destroyed by fire on April 17, 1939. They are engaged, also at their own expense, in the construction of a school at Fort George, Que., to replace the one destroyed by fire on January 28, 1943. A somewhat similar statement has been made to representatives of the Home Mission Board of the United Church, with the result that this church is now using the dormitories at the File Hills Residential School for classroom purposes. This fact means that the beds and bedding have to be removed from these dormitories each morning and replaced each night. At Alberni they are using the basement of the new school, which should ordinarily be used as a washroom, for classroom work. There is at present an enrolment of 214 pupils at this school. The difficulty in making provision for such a large group in the basement of a building can be easily realized.\n\nWe have not, as you know, a single government-owned school either in the Yukon Territory or in the Stikine Agency in B.C. Bishop Coudert, at the time of his last visit to the Department, urged upon me the necessity of establishing at least one residential school in northern British Columbia and a program that would aim at the repair and complete reconstruction of a number of Indian day schools in his diocese, all of which have been constructed by the Church. I told the Bishop quite frankly that no provision had been made in our estimates of this year for such construction work and that in my judgment the educational needs of the district should be very carefully reviewed and provision made for the schools necessary in the Government's post-war building program.\n\nYou are already familiar with the requests received and discussed from time to time with respect to the water supply at the Pelican R.C. School. The request\na few weeks ago. At the time of his visit he informed us that during a rain storm the water poured through the walls on the south side of this school. The Surveys and Engineering Branch have, I understand, undertaken an investigation, with the object of having these walls treated with a rubber preparation, and it is altogether likely that we shall receive a recommendation to proceed with this work at once. However, no provision has been made in this year's estimates for such work. In addition to this, we are now in receipt of a memorandum from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, dated April 25, in which the recommendation is made that we proceed with certain repairs at the Alberni Residential School, somewhat along the lines needed at Shubenacadie. The initial cost of this work will amount to $2,882. In view of the fact that this school was constructed only three years ago, we did not anticipate an expenditure of this character and included in this year's estimates only the sum of $975.00 for repairs and the purchase of equipment at this school. In addition to the repairs which appear to be urgently needed at Alberni, it is possible that serious consideration will have to be given to a request recently received from the United Church that the Government assume responsibility for the accumulated operating deficit. Dr. Dorey, in a letter dated April 20, 1944, states:\n\n\"The financial situation at Alberni is a most serious one and, what is more, it is getting worse all the time. With the present setup the school cannot and will not make ends meet. There is a deficit at the present time of at least $6,000 and this is only half the story, for all the stocks are badly depleted. In other words, they have been living on what was taken over from the other school at Coqualeetza to such an extent that very soon\u2014in fact it should be now\u2014three or four thousand dollars will have to be expended on dry goods and household equipment. It would appear to me that now that a break is being made it is the only logical thing to face the situation and at least give the new man a fighting chance to deal with the problem without being hamstrung by debt. .... If you think we should present the case to the Minister personally, wire me when I could see him. I think this matter should be straightened out very soon\".\n\nI may add that the Principal of the Alberni School, Rev. R. C. Scott, was one of three principals of\nOttawa, April 27, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL.\n\nRe: Additional Accommodation,\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that I find myself unable to draft a reply for the signature of the Minister to the Honourable Mr. Fournier's letter of April 21. It seems to me that the decision as to whether or not we shall proceed with the construction of an addition to the St. Philips Residential School is one that should be made by the Minister or by his immediate advisers.\n\nMay I point out that no provision has been made in the 1944-45 estimates for an expenditure such as the one requested, and if a decision is reached to proceed with the construction, then a supplementary estimate will be necessary.\n\nYou may remember that the Onion Lake (C.E.) Residential School was destroyed by fire toward the end of the last calendar year. A decision was reached at that time whereby the representatives of the Church of England were authorized to use St. Alban's College, Prince Albert, for residential school purposes, until the Onion Lake School could be rebuilt. This decision resulted in an outlay of $14,294.00, for which no provision had been made, with the result that we were compelled to take this amount from the comparatively small appropriation set apart for the repair and upkeep of other residential schools. It is our intention at the moment to do all that is humanly possible, with the limited funds at our disposal, to undertake certain repairs at our schools that we were unable to undertake during the last fiscal year.\n\nReverend Father Brown, who was recently appointed Principal of the Shubenacadie School, visited the Department\nOttawa, April 28, 1944.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nRe: St. Philip's Indian Residential School,\nAdditional Accommodation. Preparation\nof draft reply to Hon. Mr. Fournier.\n\nIn connection with the above noted I am enclosing a memorandum directed to me by Mr. Hoey and which is self-explanatory. I have a clear conception of the difficulties outlined by Mr. Hoey and am in full sympathy with the position he takes. Of course, I am in entire disagreement with the views he expressed respecting his own competence, in the final paragraph of his memorandum.\n\nI have discussed this matter over the telephone with Mr. Pratt and have explained the difficulty we have of preparing a suitable reply for the Minister's signature to the Honourable Mr. Fournier, K.C.\n\nIn conclusion I would quote from my report of a visit I made to the St. Philip's Residential School in 1941:\n\n\"At the time of my visit the school was occupied by a number of white children in residence for religious instruction. I am not aware that authority for the use of the school for this purpose was obtained or (was) even requested of the department.\"\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, May 9, 1944\n\nMy dear Colleague,\n\nI have your letter of April 31st again urging that approval be given to enlarging the St. Philip's Indian Residential School. There is little that I can add to my letter to you of the 11th of April. It would seriously embarrass myself, as well as the Government, if at this time we changed the policy decided upon at the beginning of the war, not to increase our Residential School accommodation. There are many places where the need is greater than at St. Philip's school. Because of reduced votes, most if not all of the present school buildings are badly in need of repairs. I have hesitated asking for additional money for this purpose because of the more urgent demands of our war effort.\n\nI am sure you will agree with me that our present buildings should be brought up to a higher state of repair before we embark on a program of providing further accommodation. Then, as I mentioned in my previous letter, we have an obligation to rebuild those schools which have been destroyed in recent years.\n\nVery strong representations were made to me to rebuild the Anglican school at Jaroross, which was destroyed by fire about two years ago. This request I had to refuse. As a result, the church is putting up the building with its own funds. To be consistent I could not approve of expenditures being made to increase the accommodation at another school, regardless of how small the amount involved might be.\n\nHon.

The outside requires paint, as do all the buildings. In my opinion, it is economical to supply paint to keep these buildings in proper condition.\n\nThe upper structure of the barn above the plates has warped about seven inches and should be pulled back into place and braced properly. Agent Bryant was requested to submit an estimate of the cost after obtaining opinions from qualified sources. The earth has rotted the bottom boards and sills. Father Tetrault is taking off the bottom boards and will report on the condition of the building. Repairs will have to be made. If a quantity of lumber is required, then it should be supplied. The labour would be supplied by the Fathers.\n\nThe girls' outside toilet is in a dilapidated condition and should be replaced by a new one. Father Tetrault was requested to write to Ottawa for permission to construct a new one. The old toilet might be salvaged to make two toilets and given to destitute Indians. See remarks on toilets on the Reserve.\n\nThe present root-house - is not large enough for the needs of the school. It is recommended that a cement root-house be constructed in the north west corner of the school, using two walls of the school foundation and building only two walls and a roof. If this is done, a door can be constructed so that it will open into the kitchen. This would be the most economical construction to supply additional root storage. The Agency and Father Tetrault will investigate the cost and submit a report to Ottawa.\n\nHen-house - is facing the wrong direction to benefit from the sun. The windows are now facing the west, when they should be facing the south. This building, at little cost, could be moved to another location and so placed that it would have a southern exposure.\n\nPig-House - too small and infested with rats. It should be moved to a new location and enlarged.\n\nJ.E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nST. PHILIPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nST.

Now, as you say, you already paid $502 for boiler and $12 for sugar. We cannot say enough how we are grateful and thankful for what you and the Department has done for us in regard these machines. The water boilers are still to come but as you said they were to arrive at the end of this month, you cannot imagine what these machines will mean to us all, in saving labor to all the staff, but especially to the Red Sisters and children.\n\nYou state in your letter that you have more than expended the amount you specially provided for our school. May I give my opinion on this. These machines should have been given to the school when it was built in 1897. This is after, and this should not be considered as repairs. And therefore the $700 should remain for expenses on repairs so badly needed on all buildings.\n\nI know you have done much and very much for our school this year especially during such a period as this, in wartime. But you cannot let me aware of the fact, that repairs on a place like this one, cannot\nto put aside and left behind, for the simple reason that they pile up,\nand then comes a time when buildings and all are in great need, and\nsuch a situation would not happen if a little was done every year.\nBut $50.00 is really not too much for the upkeep of these build-\nings. Paint is badly needed on all buildings, as Mr. Harris\nwill state in his report.\n\nSo you shall receive a request by the Agent Mr. J.\nBryant; but much more than this would be needed, for all\nthe repairs on all buildings.\n\nKnowing that you will do all you can to\nhelp us in our present needs,\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nP. L. Tetreault Esq.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nAugust 3rd, 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., Chief, Training Division, Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nSt Philips Residential School\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of July 18th, to Rev. Fr. Tetrault, of St. Philips school in regard to his request for repairs at the school this year in addition to what has already been provided out of this year's appropriation, and I wish to advise that certain repairs are indeed necessary.\n\nThe cement floor and mangers of the stock barn will have to be repaired. The cement mangers were not strongly constructed in the building, and these are broken in several places. The gutters are narrow and deep and the cement at the bottom is nearly all gone entirely, with the result that a cow goes down a foot or more in muck if she steps in the gutter, this is dangerous, and it is also impossible to properly clean out the gutters.\n\nIt is estimated that it will take 30 bags of cement for this repair work at an estimated cost of $1.15 a sack. The gravel will have to be hauled, and the cost of this and labour in doing the work will run into approximately $100.00.\n\nFather claims he is in urgent need of a granary 30 x 12 for storage of this year's crop, the material would cost locally about $200.00. He would supply the necessary labour in order to get this constructed this fall.\n\nThe inside of the building should have more paint especially the laundry, kitchen and store rooms, and if it is at all possible to supply the paint, good use could be made of 20 gallons of cream, and 10 gallons of white paint.\n\nJ.L.

Bryant, Indian Agent, Kamsack, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to repairs and improvements that you consider are necessary at the St. Philips Residential School. You have already been advised in official letter of July 16 regarding the expenditures that the Department has found it necessary to make at this school. However, in view of your representations it has been decided to assist the school management from a small amount of unallotted funds which is in our appropriation.\n\nYou may purchase 50 bags of cement and incur an expenditure of $100 in making necessary repairs to the floor and mangers of the stock barn. You may also purchase the 100' of 1\u00bd\" pipe which is required for the installation of the boiler, dryer and water softener. It is noted that you can secure this at a cost of 30\u00a2 a foot.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch will be requested to secure the paint mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| July 1     | Hauling tank water from S.

We have been doing everything possible to have these delivered, but the delay is due to circumstances beyond our control. Some of the material required for the softeners is extremely hard to obtain, owing to the fact that this material is required for war purposes.

I immediately wired the Qu'Appelle School and ascertained that the water softeners they have were installed when the building was erected, about 10 years ago. While the Principal of the Qu'Appelle School states they are in good condition, he further advises that if they are removed he will require one of a larger capacity.\n\nThe type of softener ordered for the St. Philips School was decided following information received from the Surveys and Engineering Branch. We were advised by them that the softener ordered would be suitable for softening the water that you have at the St. Philips School. There is no guarantee that the softeners at present at the Qu'Appelle School would be suitable for the St. Philips School. Besides, if the softeners are transferred, we would simply have to secure another softener for Qu'Appelle. We have given very careful consideration to your request, but we cannot see our way clear to authorize the transfer. As previously stated, I am extremely sorry that there has been such a delay in securing the water softener for your school, but this is due to circumstances beyond our control, although we are making every possible endeavour to have the softener shipped as soon as conditions will permit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I have to request, therefore, that you will issue a certificate in his favour.

Hoey, Sup't of Welfare & Training, tells me in one of his letters, quote:\n\n\"Due to the present conditions, there may be some delay.\"\n\nYesterday I had the surprise of my life when entering into Mr. Parkinson's Hardware in Saskatoon, in seeing there in front of my eyes a water softener. Asking him how many he had, he replied: TWO. When did you order them? I again inquired, he answered about a month and a half ago. I got them from Farbauer Horse of Regina.\n\nThere is something I cannot understand. He obtains two water softeners for small private homes, which can go without them, when we cannot get ours for our Institution. I was told also that the delay was caused by the difficulty of obtaining some kind of materials with which they are built. I cannot yet understand why one company can obtain the material when another cannot.\n\nWe are still melting snow and ice for soft water, this means a great deal of work and hardship for the Rev. Sisters and children alike. We all hope the end of such a situation is near.\n\nHoping that you will soon be able to announce to us the delivery of this water softener.\n\nI remain sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nShipment promised by Mr. Cody, Crane Ltd between Mar. 15th, 30th. He is trying to get the factory to improve upon this delivery. A promise arrives as soon as shipment is made.\nOttawa, February 14, 1945.\n\nDear Father Tetrault:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding a water softener for the St. Philips School, we have again communicated with the manufacturer of this machine and we have been definitely promised that it will be shipped some time between March 15 and 31.\n\nI have noted your remarks regarding the water softener you saw in the local store. If this was only a small machine, suitable for a private home, it is quite possible that the material in it could be more easily secured than the larger one with which you are being supplied. As far as we can ascertain, every possible endeavour has been made to secure the machine for your school, but, due to urgent war demands for some of the materials required for this particular machine, the delay, while aggravating to you, has been due to circumstances beyond anyone's control.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The latter is very urgently required as there are no proper facilities for the storage of meat and other perishable foods.\n\nAll the old buildings are very much in need of at least one coat of paint. To paint them all would take hundreds of gallons, but the Principal would like to do some of them this year, and requests that he be supplied with 25 gallons of Barn red paint, and 5 gallons of white for trim. In all cases the labour will be furnished by the school if the material is supplied.\n\nThe Barn will require new studding for most of the east end and part of one side; partial cement foundation is also required. The east end of the barn is down below the ground surface; this has caused the studs to rot, and these will have to be replaced up to where they are sound.\n\nIf it is possible to find the necessary funds I would strongly recommend that the material asked for is supplied.\n\nJ.L.Bryant, Indian Agent.\nAttention Mr. Phelan\n\nRegina, March 15th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Repairs, St. Philips School.\n\nHerewith is Mr. Bryant's letter of March 12th enclosing an estimate of the cost of repairs to buildings and the frigidaire plant at the St. Philips Indian Residential School.\n\nIn my report during my visit to the St. Philips School last year I indicated the need of immediate repairs to the barn, the reconstruction of a larger pig pen and the construction of a root cellar. I would therefore recommend that approval be granted for the purchase of necessary material to do this work as well as the purchase of 25 gals. of barn red paint and 5 gals. of white for trim. All the work, of course, will be done by members of the staff without cost to the Department.\n\nRegarding the frigidaire, you will recall that I mentioned Father Tetrault was badly in need of this equipment so that meat could be properly kept. However, I am not sure if the suggested construction is practical and I had no idea that the cost would be, as estimated, $1088.81. Perhaps Mr. Doucett may have some ideas on the proper construction of an insulated box which could be operated with the frigidaire unit, the cost of which should be a great deal less than the amount estimated. Further consideration, therefore, should be given to the proper box to be installed. In the meantime, however, I would suggest that the other work be proceeded with and would recommend that the materials be supplied.\n\nJ. E.

PHILIPS P.O., ONT.\nMay 8, 1945\n\nMr. Philip Chelan\nChief Training Division\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI receive your letter announcing the purchase of paint for our school. I am very grateful and thank you very much.\n\nWith our boys, we have this year painted nearly all the interiors of the school. We have started to paint in red the buildings surrounding the school. Next year we should have paint to paint the exteriors of the school if needed. We do all the work ourselves because we feel that this is a good training for our boys. I must say that some are now very adept at the work.\nThe war in Europe is over. So much equipment will be put aside. We here need a 2-ton truck. I just phoned Mr. Bryant\u2014he has no forms for such application. If you have such forms, would you please send me a few. If you know what equipment will be available for schools would you please\u2014send me a list.\n\nWe are in great need of a truck. We are at 11 miles from town. So a two-ton truck is badly needed to bring in supply\u2014coal\u2014building materials\u2014to haul our grain\u2014stock etc.\n\nAwaiting your reply I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nP. L. Tetrauld\nOttawa, May 14, 1945.\n\nDear Father Tetrault:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to securing a two-ton truck.\n\nAs far as we know at the present time, this equipment will not be available for free distribution. All trucks surplus to requirements of the Armed Services are turned over to the War Assets Corporation, Montreal, to whom application should be made directly by yourself.\n\nThis Department is not handling any of this equipment, as the War Assets Corporation have placed a price on each item of equipment, and the purchaser has to accept the article in the condition in which it happens to be. It is therefore felt that by dealing directly with the Corporation any school principal would be in a better position to decide if he wished to pay the price requested for any equipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

In your letter of Feb. 14th you wrote: \"We have been definitely promised that it will be shipped some time between March 15th and 31st.\"\n\nMonths have gone by and the water softener is not here. Our soft water supply holds till October. We would like to receive this machine soon so that we may put it in operation in Sept. when the children come in.\n\nI know the department has been very generous for our school since\nI am in charge. I have obtained much to better our condition, and to improve the buildings and all.\n\nI have one more thing in my feet. I mean we have great trouble to keep our meat and food\u2014because we have no frigidaire.

We have an ice-house, but it is inadequate to keep meat. From the first days of April till the middle of November it is very difficult for us to preserve our meat or the left over from tables. In fact it is practically impossible. This is a serious problem when a hundred persons must be fed and fed properly. Especially these days we cannot let meat or any other food stuff go to waste when so many others in the world go hungry.\n\nI hope that you will consider as important this new need for our school, for on food and especially meat well kept depends the health of our children and the members of the staff.\n\nSincerely Yours\n\nP.E.T\u00e9trault O.M.I.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOCT 30 1945\nOttawa, November 1, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo, requesting that provision be made in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47 for a frigidaire for the St. Philips Residential School. Your request will receive further consideration when we are preparing the estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend E.

Lavigne, O.M.I., Manitoba Provincial, under whose management the St. Philips Indian Residential School is placed, has asked me to request the building, by the Department, of an employees' residence. Although this school was erected over 15 years ago, no structure was ever provided for that purpose and the few employees have had to either reside in the school or else in the Fathers' own residence. Both methods of lodgement are inadvisable, and now that the Department is free again, to undertake such expenditures, I hope that Father Lavigne's request will be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 26th December, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the construction of a Farm Instructor's Residence at the St. Philip's Indian Residential School.\n\nI would appreciate an opportunity of discussing this matter with you at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Frigidaire for St. Philips and Brocket Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing the original of a letter received this morning from the Keyes Supply Co. Ltd., of Ottawa, re frigidaire equipment and cost of installation for the two above schools. You will notice that after providing $150.00 for the installation or building proper of this unit, the total cost is $1540.00, which is considered less than the bids received from Western Canada.\n\nThis unit would also serve all the needs of the Beauval School.\n\nYou will notice that the installation would consist of dual purpose refrigerator, in which one part would be kept at 0\u00b0 F. for freezing purposes and the other at from 32\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 F. for normal food storage. I think that this is ideal for our schools.\n\nAs these three schools are not providing ice for next summer, I hope that you will be able to supply them with this unit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Laundry Tubs for St-Philips' School.\n\nAttention: Mr. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReverend Father Tetreault, principal of the above school, is anxious to secure one set of laundry tubs, similar to the attached illustration. At the time of building his school was never supplied with them. If you can purchase them, I certainly will be very much obliged to you.\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet visited St-Philips, he remarked that the school was badly in need of paint and Father Tetreault suggests that if you can supply the material he will undertake the job himself. The following quantities would in my estimation, be sufficient for giving the school, 2 coats:\n\n600 lbs. of white lead.\n30 gallons of lionoil\n5 gallons of turpentine\n3 - 4\" brushes\n3 - 3\" \"\n2 - 2\" \"\n\nIf you prefer to supply ready-mixed white paint, that will be acceptable but in that case, the quantity of lionoil should be reduced to 25 gallons.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Instead of just replacing the bowls, Father wishes to install the teck flush valves which will make the system fool proof.\n\nThe washing machine is intended for the laundry and is to be used when washing is necessary and the laundry is not being operated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nThe Well-Known Coffield\n\nElectric Washing Machines\n110-Volt, 60-Cycle A.C. Current\n\nThe famous Canadian Coffield Electric Washers will be available in limited quantities on or about December 5th, 1945. Small shipments are expected from time to time during the term of this catalogue. Machine illustrated is the De Luxe electric model priced at $145.00, but it is expected we will be receiving various models priced from $119.50 to $145.00. It may be necessary to substitute on your order so we would appreciate your permission to ship you the nearest value to that ordered and charge you accordingly. The permission to substitute will be wise, as it is anticipated that demands for Electric Washing Machines will far exceed our supply. If we cannot supply we will advise you.\n\nThe De Luxe Coffield\nElectric Washer\n\nThe De Luxe \"Coffield,\" as illustrated, has many outstanding features. Gleaming White 7-lb. capacity tub, 22\u00bd inches diameter x 14 inches deep; Porcelain Enamel inside and out, set up on electrically welded legs with easy rolling castors. Fast, thorough, positive washing action with gyration. Equipped with efficient 110-volt 60-cycle A.C. motor mounted on rubber to assure quiet operation. Reliable oil-less bearings. It is suggested you order this $145.00 De Luxe model and if a substitute of a lower price has to be sent, your money will be refunded accordingly. Shipping weight about 170 lbs. Takes first-class freight rate.\n\n- Price: $145.00\n- Delivery Charges Extra.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, March 19 1946.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSt. Philips Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10-691\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated\n\nVoucher No.: 3\nDate: April 15, 1946\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn various occasions, during the past five years, I have mentioned to your Department, the necessity of providing chapel accommodation for the St. Phillip's Indian Residential School. Due to war conditions, I did not press for an appropriation for this purpose.\n\nWith the rapid increase in the school population, the chapel project is becoming every day more urgent and we feel that its execution should not be delayed any longer. We have on hand, for charitable purposes, a sum of money which we believe to be about sufficient to carry out our plans.\n\nWe therefore ask the department to grant us permission to erect this building, as an addition to the school. We will follow the same architectural lines so that the chapel, from the outside, will appear to be an enlargement of the school building.\n\nOf course it is understood that no claim will be made by the Oblate Order, no matter what disposition may be made later on of the St. Phillip's School property by the Department.\nOttawa, April 25, 1946.\n\nDear Father Flourde:\n\nRe: Chapel Accommodation - St. Phillip's Indian Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 17th, in which you intimate that chapel accommodation is urgently needed for the pupils of the above-mentioned school.\n\nIt is noted that the chapel will be erected as an addition to the school and that the same architectural lines of the school building will be adopted.\n\nThe officials here inform me that a somewhat similar concession was granted at other residential schools during the last ten-year period and I can see no objection to the granting of your request in this case. It will be satisfactory to the department, therefore, for you to proceed with the construction of the chapel at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend J. O.

PHILIPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nST. PHILIPS P.O., SASK.\n\nAug. 4-86\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs you know we have built an addition to our school, the size of which is 36' x 30'.\nThe basement will be the playroom for the girls.\nThe first floor the chapel, and the second floor a dormitory.\nWe were unable to find for our floors - hard wood. So they were made out of spruce. So now to protect these floors from wear we would need some linoleum - feltship or other good and heavy material, and this has two floors 36' x 30' each.\nI spoke to Mr. A. Macdonald about it at Regina, and he may discuss the problem with you at his return at Ottawa.\n\nHoping that you will be in a position to help us,\n\nRemain\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nW. E. Petrie, Principal\nOttawa, August 15, 1946.\n\nDear Father Tetrault:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant requesting approximately three hundred and eighty square yards of linoleum for St. Philips Indian Residential School. This would cost in the vicinity of $750.00.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we provided an amount of $800.00 for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment for the St. Philips Residential School. We placed an order for a refrigerating unit at a cost of $640.00 and in addition we have paid an account of $1009.86 covering the cost of lumber, etc. Under these circumstances, the amount specifically provided for this school has already been exceeded. We have received many heavy demands on our appropriation and at the present time we are not in a position to favourably consider the linoleum. However, you might write to me again before the last of October, at which time we will again review our appropriation and see if we have the necessary funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E.

Pere,\n\nDe retour \u00e0 mon bureau je trouve votre lettre qui m'attend.\n\nJe suis ravi de savoir que l'\u00e9cole a emport\u00e9 de si nombreux prix. Veuillez en f\u00e9liciter le personnel et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves.\n\nJe regrette que vous n'ayez pas pu faire accepter la commande pour le \"linoleum\". Il y a cependant esp\u00e9rance.\n\nQuand vous aurez sign\u00e9 la facture nous assurant que vous avez re\u00e7u les \"Panic Bolts\" envoyez nous le compte.\n\nVos classes sont en marche et je sais qu'\u00e0 ce temps c'est le travail qui manque le moins.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA.J. Doucet.\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School\nST. PHILIPS P.O., SASK.\n\nLe 27 ao\u00fbt 1896\n\nCher Monsieur,\n\nJ'aimerais savoir si le d\u00e9partement nous fournirait des cat\u00e9chismes pour la Catholic Faith School et bien fait sous forme d'exercices, etc.\n\nNotre \u00e9cole a remport\u00e9 200 prix cette ann\u00e9e aux deux expositions de Regina et de Prince Albert.\n\nJ'ai re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse de M. Shelan au sujet du Lionnem. Il dit que les finances du d\u00e9partement ne permettent pas l'achat d'un nouveau ouvrage d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u. 500.00 plus 640. reste encore \u00e0 payer pour le frigidaire. Tout de m\u00eame il me demande de lui \u00e9crire de nouveau en octobre.\n\nJe viens de recevoir la facture pour les \"Panic Belts\". Toute\nfaire ces derni\u00e8res ne sont pas arriv\u00e9es, je suppose qu'elles le seront ce jour-ci. Est-ce que je peux envoyer cette facture au d\u00e9partement ?\n\nNotre fournisseur pour le chauffage de l'\u00e9cole a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 par l'inspecteur des boulilliers. Je lui ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l'agent M. Bryant, il m'a autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 demander \u00e0 la Co. Northern Locomotive de r\u00e9parer le tout.\n\nMais nous ne ferons pas comme le demande l'inspecteur, \u00e7a co\u00fbterait le prix d'une nouvelle. Ce fournisseur garantit que son ouvrage rendra le boulillard encore bonne pour au moins dix ans. Les flues doivent \u00eatre chang\u00e9es. Il faudra un clou de 2 pouces traverser. Si l'on apprend encore plus tard, il sera trop tard de mettre un autre syst\u00e8me de chauffage.\n\nBien voil\u00e0,\n\nP.S. P.F.

Neary\nDept. of Mines & Resources\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have received this refrigerator unit for which we are grateful and thank very sincerely the Department.\n\nThe C. has supplied us with instructions regarding selection, installation and finishing of storage rooms, operation and equipment.\n\nAs we have yet much work to do on our new wing to our school, we had not the time to work at the storage rooms to install this refrigerator unit. It will take sometime yet before we can work at it, probably not before spring. But as soon as the work on the storage rooms go under way I shall let you know.\nDecember 5, 1946\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was in your office sometime last week, to discuss the transfer of some beds from St. Mary's Indian School at Kenora, Ontario, to ours at St. Philips Saskatchewan.\n\nThe beds are now on their way here. We went ahead with Rev. Father Provincial's approval and had these beds shipped here. As you know Kenora Indian School received quite a number of these beds last summer. This year on account of the very small number of children in School they did not need them all. As for our School our number has increased considerably and so we are short of beds. I tried to buy some in Winnipeg without success. The Department was unable to send us some. Also Father Perreafel O.M.I. having repaired many of his double-deck beds, by using the upper spring down, doing away with the double deck beds, thus making first class beds out of old ones, he had therefore some new ones left over, so they were sent here to help us out.\n\nI hope this will meet with your approval.\n\nI remain\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nT.E.

Hoey, Director.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe understand that the St. Phillips Indian Residential School at Kamsack is contemplating installing a new steam heating boiler, and we are taking the liberty of quoting prices on two different sizes, as follows:\n\n60 Horsepower Low Pressure Boiler........$2,440.00\n75 \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" 2,888.55\n\nThese prices are F.O.B. Cars, Kamsack, Sask. We have been asked to quote our prices on installing the new boiler and removing the old one but we do not do this work. We believe it would be far cheaper to make arrangements with a trucking company in Kamsack to remove the present boiler and make the necessary setting for the new boiler, and from there on the men in the school could do the necessary connecting up.\n\nDelivery on these boilers would take approximately two weeks from receipt of order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS COMPANY LIMITED,\n\nF.W.Piper/ES\nPlumbing & Heating Department.\nOttawa, June 13th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant, Indian Agent,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nFurther to our letter of similar file of June 6th, we have received the attached letter from Marshall-Wells Company Limited.\n\nAs you are probably aware, it will be necessary for us to have an official of our Surveys and Engineering Branch investigate fully before such an expenditure can be made.\n\nCan you please advise whether it will be necessary to send an official immediately to this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nc/o Inspector Ostrander.\nIn reply to Dept. letter of June 13th, 1947, File No. 117-3-5 (WT), to Indian Agent Bryant, copy of which was sent to this office, about replacing the boiler at the St. Philip's School.\n\nThis boiler was in need of repairs which it was not possible to get done last year, some minor repairs were made so the boiler was safe to use for the last winter.\n\nThe Provincial Boiler Inspector has condemned this boiler unless the following work is done:\n\nRe-tube boiler, Reface manhole cover and Arc Weld Water Legs; Replace main Stop Valves.\n\nFr. Tetrault, the Principal, has considerable knowledge of heating boilers and does not want the present one scrapped and a new boiler installed for two reasons. The present condition of this equipment does not warrant the replacement and the cost of the alterations and installation would be more than the cost of repairs to the boiler now in use. This would be in addition to the price of a new unit, over $2000.00.\n\nThe North West Iron Works, of this city, have been asked for a quotation on doing the necessary repair work to put the boiler in first class shape. As soon as this is received I will submit the offer to the Department for consideration. This company assure me that they are in a position to do this work during the summer holidays if given the job.\n\nJ.P.B.

We will advise you further when Inspector Ostrander submits the quotation mentioned in the last paragraph of his letter. It is felt that this will have to be one of the schools to be visited by Mr. Hargreaves on his future trips west.\n\nDirector.\n\nBEN/EGD\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Rev.

This summer the inspector condemned it again, and his report stated that its condition was poor, and repairs must be made.\n\nMr. B. Ostreuter from Regina was supposed to care about this matter. But apparently nothing has been done yet. July is gone, half of August and no sign of any work is being done to repair this boiler.\n\nA Co. could be had in Regina to do the work.\n\nCould you please notify immediately Mr. Ostreuter to contact this Co. and have the work done immediately before the arrival of the school children.\n\nThanking you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nP.E.

The Boiler Inspector has condemned the low pressure boiler unless the following work is done:\n\n(a) Re-tube boiler,\n\n(b) Re-face manhole cover and replace water leg,\n\n(c) Replace main stop valves.\n\nAfter considerable difficulty, Mr. Ostrander was able to interest the Northwestern Iron Works, Limited of Regina in this work.\n\nTheir tender was submitted to the Surveys and Engineering Branch for their consideration. Please find attached a copy of their recommendation for the acceptance of this tender. The total amount of the above tender is $1,028.\n\nI would request your authority for proceeding with this work.\n\nEmil.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: St. Philips Indian Residential School\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum of August 11th, 1947, bearing your notation of the 13th instant, together with attached quotation from the Northwestern Iron Works, Ltd., with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWhile we have no first hand knowledge of the condition of the boiler, it would appear, that the sum of $1028 as quoted by the Northwestern Iron Works Ltd., for removing and replacing water leg and 73 tubes, is fair and just for the work involved. No price was stated for refacing manhole ring, but if repacking only is required as stated by the above firm in their quotation, the sum would be nominal. Travelling expenses would be extra.\n\nIn addition to the above, it should be borne in mind that the services of a steam fitter will be required to remove and replace main stop valves as called for in Mr. Ostrander's letter of June 16, 1947. No figure for these items appears in the correspondence, and we are unable to estimate what this work would cost.\n\nIt is necessary that this work be carried out, if the boiler is to remain in service. We are therefore recommending that this work be executed under the direction of Inspector Ostrander who should certify the accounts and forward same to Indian Affairs for payment.\n\nWe are returning, herewith, the quotation of the Northwestern Iron Works, Ltd.\n\nT.

Mr. Betrand\nfrom Regina was here over a month ago to investigate and take steps\nto have this boiler repaired. The month of July is gone, and half of\nAugust, and no sign of work has been done yet. A few days ago\nI wrote directly to Mr. McNeary, and no reply came.\n\nI am writing to you in the hope that you will see fit\nimmediately that someone gets the ball rolling. This work should\nhave been done before the arrival of the children. But at least it\nshould be done before freeze up.\n\nMay I hope to have an answer from you, and may I\nhope to see this work done in the immediate future.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nH. Betrand\n\n[Signature]\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School\n\nDear Father Tetrault:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 15. I immediately got in touch with our Surveys and Engineering Branch and have been advised by them that they have recommended the acceptance of the tender of the Northwestern Iron Works, of Regina, for the work required on your low pressure boiler.\n\nThis was immediately sent over to the Minister's office for final approval, and I expect to send a telegram to Mr. Ostrander within the next 48 hours, advising him to proceed with this work. I hope this will solve your heating problem for next winter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend P.E.

No price was stated for refacing manhole ring, but if repacking only is required as stated by the above firm in their quotation, the sum would be nominal. Travelling expenses would be extra.\n\nIn addition to the above, it should be borne in mind that the services of a steam fitter will be required to remove and replace main stop valves as called for in Mr. Ostrander's letter of June 16, 1947.

We have the paint which was given by the Department. But would the Department pay to have it applied by someone by contract? This work is really too dangerous to be done with our small boys, and we have not the time to do so, and the school should be painted this fall, it needs it badly, you can see Mr. Duncet he knows.\n\nAlso another question. Mr. B.

It is noted that you have the paint on hand. As you are aware we have already authorized an expenditure of $1024.00 at your school for repairing the boiler. It is doubtful if we can provide the funds for the labour for painting but a definite decision will not be made until you let us know the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Neary Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: St. Philip's Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 20th, File 117-3-5 (E.I.) I wish to advise that the washing machine now in use at this school, is in very poor condition. It is an old wooden machine and in many places the wood is rotten. The wood is so unsound that it is not possible to tighten it up sufficiently to prevent leakage. The wood in the outside section is also quite spongy and soft in places. The machine now in use was made by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. of Toronto, it is 36 inches in diameter and 45 inches long, outside measurements. The number is 1213 - 7181.\n\nThe school would like to get a machine a size larger. It could be 10 inches longer and still fit in nicely in the space available.\n\nThe Canadian Norwood Cascade Washer is made in Toronto and sold in Winnipeg by the Stanley Brock Co. They have a machine listed that is 42 inches in diameter and 54 inches long. If these are outside measurements this machine would fit in the space available and be about the size of machine required.\n\nA steel or wooden machine will be acceptable, whichever you consider will give the best service will be satisfactory.\n\nJ.

The boiler has been condemned by the Provincial Government and it is absolutely urgent that we renew it this spring and summer. Retubing is entirely useless. Actually, we should have two boilers at this school, each to carry 30% of the load. We should also be burning lignite coal as wood is vanishing from the area.\n\nA rough estimate of the cost to carry out all these alterations would be as follows:\n\n(a) Extension to boiler room ... $10,000.\n(b) Replacement of boilers ... $5,000.\n\nBFN/MDG\n\nF.

The boiler is over twenty-seven years old and has shown signs of failure for several years. The Provincial Boiler Inspector has ordered various repairs after his yearly inspections, and the unit has now reached the stage where no further satisfactory or lasting repairs can be made. From 1944 to 1947 inclusive, the Boiler Inspector's reports have summarized the condition of the boiler from fair to very poor. Pitting at the lower section of the boiler has resulted in many thin spots in the boiler plate and any further attempts at patching would be impracticable.\n\nIt was found that one new wing had been added to the building and that one or two future extensions are contemplated, all of which must be taken care of by the boiler plant. This, coupled with the isolated location of the school, justifies a two boiler installation, each boiler having an approximate capacity to handle eighty per cent (80%) of the entire load. With such an arrangement, future repairs to either one of the boilers could be made at any time without shutting down the system. It was also noted that the original plans made no provisions for removing any equipment from the boiler room.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt is our recommendation, therefore, that the following operations be carried out as soon as possible after the close of the present heating season.\n\n1. Enlarge the present boiler and fuel room and provide proper entrance to same.\n\n2. Remove existing worn-out boiler and replace with two new low pressure steam steel firebox boilers, each having a net stoker fired rating of 3058 sq. ft. E.D.R.\n\n3. Provide two under-feed stokers ranged for single hopper and of a type suitable for burning lignite coal at a rate of not less than 180 lbs. per hour when operating at high speed.\n\n4. Replace existing boiler return trap and air eliminator with one new condensation return pump.\n\n5. Make necessary changes to boiler room piping to accommodate the new installation.\n\nTo carry out the above operations and have the plant ready for service by next fall, tenders should be called for as soon as possible and work started shortly thereafter. It is estimated that an approximate amount of $15,000.00 would cover the installation, and it is expected that competitive prices could be obtained from several firms in the area.\n\nIf Indian Affairs have funds to apply to the work recommended, this Division will undertake the preparation of layouts and specifications which will undoubtedly be a basis for a more accurate estimate of cost.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, April 26, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nWe have your memorandum of April 21st and reporting on Mr. Hargreaves visit to the St. Philip's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the amount of $15,000 will be necessary to carry out the suggestions made by Mr. Hargreaves. While we have no doubt that the work suggested by him would improve conditions at this school, I regret that from our present year's appropriation there will not be sufficient funds to provide the amount mentioned.\n\nWe are prepared to purchase a new boiler to replace the present one which has been in use for over twenty-seven years. Possibly, Mr. Hargreaves could give us definite information regarding the type and size of boiler that is required and we can then arrange purchase through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/IM.\nMemorandum\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe Washer for Kamsack I.R.

The steel boilers will necessitate a very large hole being breached in the back of the boiler room but the cast iron boilers will not require such a large means of entry.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Rev.

It is again pointed out that the Provincial Boiler Inspector's last report described the unit to be in a \"very poor condition\" and recommended that a new boiler be installed.\n\nTo carry out the minimum requirements one new steel low pressure steam heating boiler must be installed and some alterations to the coal bin must be made in order to provide access doors large enough to admit the new boiler and to provide coal storage.\n\nThe School authorities reported to our heating engineer that the wood used for fuel was becoming somewhat of a problem as its source was gradually receding, thus necessitating increased charges for cutting and hauling. For this reason it is considered advisable to recommend a stoker suitable for burning Lignite coal. Lignite coal is widely and successfully handled throughout the Prairie Provinces and is in plentiful supply.\n\nWe are proceeding with the design along the above lines and it is expected that the work will cost approximately $8,000.00.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nRe: A. Gibson, Esq.\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMr. Hoey - I trust this will meet with your approval.\n\n8/5/48. Director.\nMemorandum\n\nRe: St. Philips Indian Residential School, Kamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn reply to your marginal notation of the 6th instant which appears on Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 30th with reference to the above, we are in a position to advise that there is not sufficient space in the boiler room to accommodate two boilers of any kind without extensive structural enlargement.\n\nSince the expenditure must be kept to a minimum, owing to lack of sufficient funds in this year's appropriation, the only solution which will satisfy the recommendations is to install one high fire-box type low pressure steam steel heating boiler, along with one underfeed stoker.\n\nThe Canadian Brown Steel Tank Company Limited of Brandon manufacture a steel boiler designed to meet these requirements and suitable for burning lignite coal. The Vulcan-Drawz Stoker, which is also manufactured in the West, has been specifically designed to burn lignite coal and is widely and successfully used.\n\nIn order to get this equipment into the building, it will only be necessary to make an opening in the existing fuel storage bin, thereby keeping the structural alterations to a minimum. It would be advisable to erect a shed at the rear of the present coal bin for the purpose of storing a winter supply of fuel. The operations outlined herein are estimated to cost not more than $5,000.00.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Ostrander Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: St. Phillips Residential School.\n\nYou will recall our recent visit to St. Phillips School, and Sister Superior's request that she be supplied with a rug for the office reception room of the School.\n\nShe has decided that tile would be much more serviceable and the cost would be little if any more than the rug.\n\nShe also asked for 10 yards of material for curtains for the windows.\n\nThe tile and curtain material are available at Eaton's in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nA requisition for this material is attached and I would recommend that the material be supplied.\n\nThe Brother at the School will lay the tile at no cost to the Department.\n\nJ. L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent.\nWhen at the St. Philip's Indian Residential School, Pelly Agency, recently, the Reverend Principal and Sister Superior drew my attention to the fact that the reception room in the school has become rather unsightly because the rug is worn out and the curtains are not very attractive.\n\nI informed them that if they submitted a requisition for a rug and curtain material through this office I would pass it to the Department with the recommendation that it be authorized.\n\nHowever, since then apparently they have come to the conclusion that Kentile for the floor would be more satisfactory than a rug, and have submitted their request for Kentile and curtain material through this office. I am forwarding herewith copy of a letter from Superintendent J.L. Bryant, of the Pelly Agency, and a requisition form 37 without the prices inserted therein but describing the materials required, also with the condition that the materials described are listed in the T. Eaton Company Catalogue, and giving the catalogue numbers.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department to furnish the reception room at an Indian residential school I would recommend this as a deserving case as this school receives the very best of care and it is the wish of those responsible for its operation to keep it in a condition in which they can be proud to receive visitors.\n\nJ.P.B.

It is felt that Mr. Gow should be authorized to contact reliable firms in the area and ask for competitive tenders. This method has been successfully employed in connection with several jobs which have been and are being carried out. The installation would be under Mr. Gow's nominal supervision.\n\nIt is expected that our heating engineer will be making final inspections of work now being carried out at Brandon, Elkhorn and Punnichy some time this summer, and he could visit Kamsack on this proposed trip and make a progress inspection of the work.\n\nWe will appreciate receiving your instructions in regard to our suggestion for obtaining prices for this work.\n\nJUN 4 1948\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

The recommendations included two boilers and two stokers, along with the necessary auxiliary equipment, and our estimate was given as $15,000.00.\n\nIn Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 26th, he advised that it would not be possible to provide that amount from this year's appropriation and that they were prepared to purchase one new boiler only. Since the work was considered urgent, our plans were revised to include one boiler and one stoker and to provide only the minimum of structural changes, which involved the enlarging of one door and the installation of one new door in order to permit the old boiler to be taken out and the new boiler to be taken in. As a result of this re-design, our estimate was brought down to $8,000.00, and in a subsequent memorandum from Mr. Hoey dated June 10, he agreed that this sum could be provided. Consequently tenders were called and the lowest bid was received from Messrs Neale Stothank and Chapman, of Brandon, which was for the sum of $7,702.69.\n\nSince the work had not been started when our heating engineer left for an inspection trip through the West, it was not considered necessary to have him call at Kamsack, as no purpose could be served. When the work is completed, it is expected that he will visit the school to make an inspection before final payment is made to the contractor.\n\nIt is noted in Mr. Hoey's memorandum of August 31st, that Father Ruest has on his staff a Brother who is qualified to carryout inspection work. It is suggested that they be requested to provide an estimate of the cost of a coal bin made of frame construction and that if satisfactory to the Indian Affairs Branch, funds be provided to have this work carried out apart from the contract.\n\nR.A.

When we have this quotation we will decide what action we can take.\n\nThe contract for the installation of a new boiler has been awarded to Messrs. Neale, Stothard and Chapman of Brandon, at a cost of $7,702.69.

Neale Stothard and Chapman is provision for a ramp leading to the cellar. The Lands and Development Services Branch are inclined to feel that if the new coal bin is not completed soon, it may delay the work of the contractor. This Branch does not desire the work delayed.\n\nYou may, therefore, inform Father Ruest that the Department will allow an amount not exceeding $400.00 for the erection of a frame coal bin. We see no reason why a bin of this type would not serve the purpose. Arrangements should be made to erect the bin immediately.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood by all parties that the amount mentioned is all that we will allow.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Father Ruest.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: St. Phillip's Indian Residential School, Kamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nYou are advised that the Principal of the above school has requested permission from the Indian Affairs Branch to construct an addition to the coal bin.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch informed this Division today by telephone, that they would comply with the Principal's request, and authorize him to carry out this work, which of course, will not be included in the contract, under which Neale Stothard and Chapman are carrying out revisions to the boiler room and boiler room equipment.\n\nThe Principal has requested the contractor to defer structural alterations to the existing boiler room and coal bin as he contemplates building the proposed coal bin in this area.\n\nIt is our definite recommendation that the contractors work in connection with the structural alterations be carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by this Division, and that the Indian Affairs Branch be advised to instruct the Principal that the proposed auxiliary coal shed must not be built around the ramp.\n\nThis ramp together with other structural changes outlined in our drawing and specification, was included to provide for a means of access to the boiler room, as no suitable openings were provided for in the original plans of the building. For this reason no coal should be stored in this area.\n\nIt is suggested that the new coal shed be built in the form of a lean-to and located adjacent to the rear wall of the existing drying room at ground level.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nFor your information please.\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\n16/10/48\nOctober 19, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nRev. A. Ruest, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Philip's Residential School,\nSt. Philips, Sask.\n\nDear Father Ruest:\n\nThe Department has been informed that you have requested Messrs. Neale Stothard and Chapman to defer the work that they are doing at the St. Philip's Residential School until you build the coal bin.\n\nIt is the definite wish of the Indian Affairs Branch that the contractors' work in connection with the structural alterations be carried out in accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by the Lands and Development Services Branch, and consequently, the proposed auxiliary coal shed must not be built around the ramp. This ramp, together with other structural changes outlined in the drawings and specifications were included to provide for a means of access to the boiler room as no suitable openings were provided in the original plans of the building. For this reason, no coal should be stored in this area.\n\nThe new coal shed should be built in the form of a lean-to and located adjacent to the rear wall of the existing drying room, at ground level. We wrote Superintendent Bryant regarding this matter on October 15th and a copy of that letter was forwarded to you.\n\nWe are also forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. Bryant and we feel certain that you will carry out the instructions contained in this letter. As you are aware, the St. Philip's Residential School is a Government-owned building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| DATE | MATERIAL                                      | FOLIO | DEBIT | CREDIT | TOTAL |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Oct. | To-- One only steel coal chute complete      |       | 18.60 |        |       |\n|      | with steel door.                             |       |       |        |       |\n|      | For St. Philip's School.                     |       |       |        |       |\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTREASURY ONLY\n\nPay to: Neale, Stothard & Chapman,\nAddress: 118 Right Street,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct. | One only steel coal chute complete with steel door.

A. Russell\n23rd March, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L. Bryant,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKamsack, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have received a letter from Rev. A. Ruest, O.M.I., Principal of the St. Phillip's Residential School with reference to painting the exterior of the building. He refers to the fact that Mr. Len Turnbull was supposed to paint the school in the fall of 1947, but did not do the work.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of 24th September, 1947 addressed to Mr. Ostrander. On 10th October, 1947, we advised Mr. Ostrander that we accepted the tender of Len Turnbull to paint the exterior of the school at a cost of $765.00. It was understood at the time that the paint required was at the school, and I presume it is still there. Authority was given for local purchase of lead, zinc oxide, white japan dryer, and turpentine.\n\nIs Mr. Turnbull prepared to carry out his contract at the same amount he quoted previously? If not, can you obtain any other quotations for our consideration? Father Ruest suggests that the work be done during the month of May. Do you consider this a suitable month? It would be preferable to us to have the painting done during the summer holidays.\n\nBernard F.

Personally, I see nothing wrong with the fire pole escape. It is customary in our residential schools where such type of escape is used for the larger boys and the larger girls to assist the smaller boys and the smaller girls in using this type of escape, and no difficulty has been found. So far as the larger boys and the larger girls are concerned, they have plenty of practice in the use of such a fire escape and rather enjoy the practice, with no fear whatever. Actually, these larger children reach the ground more quickly by the pole type than they would by the stair type. However, when the requisition in this connection is received I shall forward it to the Department for further consideration.\n\nJ.P.B.

Bryant, Indian Agent  \nSt. Philips, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving more girls at work in the sewing room this year, we are short of sewing machines. There are ten girls who are able to sew and eight who would be able to learn. We now have six machines, one of them in poor condition, and two were bought by Rev. Father Principal. If one or two machines could be obtained, this would allow the girls to do much more work \"sewing and mending\". Giving them also more time to work for the war services, in which they have taken a great part and interest.\n\nSo knowing your great interest you take in our school we thought you could obtain us this favor from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThanking you for your kindness, also taking this opportunity to thank Mrs. Bryant for her kindness and help she has given for the Junior Red Cross and war services.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nMissionary Oblate Sisters\n\nSister Mary of the Rosary.\nKamsack, Saskatchewan,\nMay 9th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have received a request from St. Philips Boarding School for one or two sewing machines. They have six now, one of which is in very poor condition. The girls at St. Philips get a great deal of very useful training in sewing and needlework and I would strongly recommend the supply of at least one new machine at this time if it is at all possible. The Singer Sewing Machine Co. at Yorkton will supply a suitable new machine at $76.50 less a discount of 45% where the machine will be used in a school.\n\nI am attaching the Reverend Sister Superior's letter for your perusal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.L.

You should receive them in a short while.\n\nThe military authorities have not yet released any of the Moving picture machines and even if they had I greatly doubt if they would be of very much use to us. It must be kept in mind that these machines have received very rough usage because of the conditions under which they were used. They would probably cause our schools a great deal of trouble. We have, however, put in our estimates for the coming year sufficient money to purchase a number of these machines. We intend to introduce them gradually.

Les gar\u00e7ons ont bien fait cela, et il n'est pas \u00e0 dire qu'ils aiment cela, ils sont tous enthousiastes de ce nouveau genre d'\u00e9tude et de travail. Le fr\u00e8re P.B. Lacasse est bien content des r\u00e9sultats tout fraisage que tout ira pour le mieux. Les gar\u00e7ons du premier groupe, les plus vieux, recevront bien leur deux chaises comme travail un \"bon lundi\". Il le terminera le m\u00eame jour, et recevra tr\u00e8s bien.\n\nIl est question ici que l'on rende notre mission pour dernier huit jours nos indiens. Le P.P. Plante ont demand\u00e9 une maison pour notre ferme. Si cela se passe, cela veut dire de la pratique en construction pour nos gar\u00e7ons, car tout le travail sera fait par le fr\u00e8re et nous. Aussi nous serions oblig\u00e9s de construire une grange, il faudra construire pour installer encore de la pratique. Nous devons aussi terminer les r\u00e9parations \u00e0 l'\u00e9table des premiers travaux pour le printemps pratique encore. Nous devons aussi construire un hangar pour les machines, une maison pour les P\u00e8res, une \u00e9cole de chapelles sur les r\u00e9serves, pratique encore et toujours. D\u00e8s au printemps les gar\u00e7ons apprendront \u00e0 se servir des outils, \u00e0 mesurer et \u00e0 faire certains travaux, puis d\u00e8s les travaux finis, viendra la pratique sous le feu.\n\nJe viens de recevoir le \"Shipping Bill\" - pour m\u00e9tiers - ils nous arrivent bient\u00f4t - je suppose. Nous n'avons pas d'endroits pour les installations, notre \u00e9cole est si petite - trop petite. Le P. Dauzet ne savait pas bien derri\u00e8re. Elles iront apprendre s'il est prochain.\nNous n'avons pas encore re\u00e7u de t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe \u2014 comme cons\u00e9quence nous ne pouvons pas r\u00e9imprimer certaines feuilles dont le fr\u00e8re a besoin pour ses gar\u00e7ons.\n\nIl conviendrait aussi une certaine quantit\u00e9 des suivantes:\nStudent Reading and Job Chart\nStudent Record Sheet\nComplete Bill of Material Sheet.\n\nIl conviendrait aussi recevoir \u2014 les livres suivants dans au moins de chaque si possible.\n\nHand Woodworking\nInstructional Units in Hand Woodwork\nWoodwork for Junior High School - Grade 7-8\n\nJe viens de vous offrir notre machine \u00e0 tricoter \u2014 pourriez-vous l'essayer?\nr\u00e9parer. Vous serait-il possible d'en envoyer une autre, les P.S. en ont grandement besoin.\n\nDura. 1. Il faudrait s'obtenir une machine \u00e0 pelure les patates avant\ntrop longtemps. Quelle corv\u00e9e ennuyante pour les gar\u00e7ons de pelure plusieurs\nchambres de patates tous les jours. Pas grand chose \u00e0 apprendre le dedans,\nc'est du temps perdu.\n\nNos machines fonctionnent bien, encore un souci de moins pour\nles gar\u00e7ons est-il dire faire fondre de la neige pour obtenir de l'eau douce.\n\nCe qui importe beaucoup maintenant c'est un frigidaire si essentiel\ndans les maisons comme les n\u00f4tres. Il nous faut promis \u2014 plus ou moins \u2014\nLe P.P. Plante ou! une dit de ne pas couper de glace pour la\nglaci\u00e8re. S'il fallait que ce frigidaire ne nous soit pas envoy\u00e9,\nSt. Philips Indian Residential School\nST.

Very few of the day schools have qualified teachers and I think these should be employed by the department and not by any church organization if we are going to get suitable men and women for this very important work. A day school teacher could be employed for the full 12 months, and they should devote considerable in organizing sports and healthy recreation for the young people.\n\nWe have one Residential school and two day schools at this agency, but have several pupils from all reserves attending residential schools at other points in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In a residential school good management and an efficient teaching staff are a prime necessity and in St Philips school here, we fortunately have a good teaching staff and a school that is exceptionally well managed. Apart from academic subjects the pupils are taught cooking, sewing, general housework, manual training, field work, care of livestock, and poultry etc. This school is filled to capacity at present and there are several pupils at home at present that should be in school if accommodation was available. There should be provision made for at least another 40 pupils and this may not be sufficient in another ten years. We would also like to see pupils that are anxious to make something of themselves, given the opportunity of staying on in school after they are 16 years old, in fact I think it would be a great help to many of the girls if they were kept in Boarding school at least another year longer.\n\nJ.L.

The horses are absolutely necessary for the opening of the school as we are 11 miles from Kamsack and cannot have the goods delivered but have to go for them, also for getting firewood. About milk cows I do not suppose it is necessary that I would explain that children will need milk.\n\nThe Department has no barn as yet for the keeping of cattle and horses but as the Oblate fathers have a barn unused this winter and this only 300 yards from the school we could keep there as I am authorized to use it I am well supplied with feed for both horses and cattle.\n\nTrusting this will be readily granted, I remain dear sir your obedient\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir:-\n\nI forward a copy of a letter from the Reverend Principal of the St. Philip's School, which was sent to me by Mr. B.A.W.R.

In regard to the sleigh, this was authorized in Department No. 117-3-14, dated 21st February, 1928, and the purchase will now be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

These should be purchased to the best advantage and an account covering the cost should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

Sir:\n\nI have the honour to make application to the Government to authorize us to prepare the means for the official establishment of a boarding school for the children of the catholic Indians of Battleford reserves, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The number of catholic children resident on the reserves of Roundmaker, Little Pine, Moosomin, &c., is considerable.\n\n2. The day schools of Roundmaker and Sweet Grass reserves, although more or less satisfactory, do not give an efficacious result in regard to the education and civilization of the Indian.\n\n3. The heads of catholic families of these reserves, ask for a boarding school, such as the sisters of charity conduct at Onion Lake.\n\n4. The Rev. Father Cochin has written to me that, contrary to the second clause of, No. 14 of the heading (cap.) relative to the Department of Indian Affairs, Statutes of Canada, page 4, the protestant ministers, Macdonald, Clarke, Matheson, of the Battleford Industrial School and their teachers have gone, several times, among our catholics, for the purpose of inducing them to give up their children for the Industrial School, Battleford, and that two have yielded to their importunities.\n\n5. The Industrial Schools of Qu'Appelle and High River, are too far off from us. The school at Duck Lake, although not yet approved as an Industrial School, has already too many demands for a place so limited.\n\nTrusting to your goodness for the successful result of my legitimate request,\n\nI remain, &c.,\n\n(Sgd.) X Albert, C. M. I. Bishop of Marianopolis,\nVicar apostolic, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a translation of a letter from His Lordship, the Bishop of Mariopolis, making application for the establishment of a Boarding School for the Roman Catholic children of Indians of Battleford Reserve; and in reply I beg to inform you that this Department approves of the action taken by you in this matter, in which nothing further can be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nPrince-Albert, Sask., 25th September 1893.\n\nTo the Hon. Clifford Sifton,\nMinister of the Indian Dept., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI have the honor to call your kind attention upon the anomalous situation in which our catholic indian children actually stand at the Battleford reserves of Saskatchewan.\n\nYou are well aware that we have no other Boarding-School than that of Duck-Lake, if we except the small one of \"Ile a la Croix\".\n\nIt is quite painful to us to see that our catholic Indians are obliged to send their children to the Industrial School of Battleford, when I feel that the Government could do justice to them.\n\nI have been informed that over 60 of our children are now frequenting the Battleford Ind. School, and I know by hearsay that their parents are ever so desirous to have a Boarding-school of their own that they requested me to petition the Government in their favor. As to sending their children to Co-Appelle or Calgary, they will not think of it, and it is impossible to have them frequent the Duck-Lake school which is over crowded.\n\nI therefore come again to you, hon. and dear Sir, and for the third time appeal to the Government through you, to allow us to open, at once, a separate Boarding-School for these children, at Thunder-Child, be it ever so modest, but large enough to contain at least 60 children, giving thereby satisfaction to the legitimate demand of all the Catholic Indians of Battleford;\n\nMoreover may I be allowed to ask you that the Government make a grant of at least $500.00 to cover the first building expenses.\n\n+ Albert Pascal o d c s. W. M.\nVicar of Saskatchewan\nMy Lord Bishop,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's communication of the 22nd ultimo, applying for a grant for a boarding school on your reserve. As no money was voted by Parliament at its last Session for the purpose, it is impossible for me to grant your Lordship's request. The furthest I can go is to say that it will be noted and given every consideration when the estimates to be submitted to Parliament at its next Session are being prepared.\n\nAs to your Lordship's comment regarding the pressing necessity for such a school, and your reference to the fact that many of the Indian children of your church are in the Battleford Industrial School, I venture to say that it might be possible\n\nHis Lordship,\nRight Rev. Albert Pascal, O.M.I.\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nfor you to arrange to have some of the children taken at the High River and Qu'Appelle Schools, if you Lordship opened communication on the subject with the Principals of these institutions. I understand that both are short of the number allowed, and I know that Father Hugonard is very anxious to get more pupils, as he finds it rather hard work to keep things running when he is short of the number for which the Department undertakes to pay the per capita grant. With his cooperation it might be possible to overcome, in some measure at least that objection which your Lordship intimates the Indians have to sending their children to his school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\n(Sd) Clifford Hilton\ndifficulty in keeping up to the maximum. I am aware that Your Lordship had stated that the difficulty in the way of sending pupils to the Industrial school at Qu'Appelle and High River was the objection of the Indian parents to having their children so far removed from them, but it occurred to me that as to the Catholic children whom Your Lordship states are at present in the Presbyterian school at Battleford it would be a much easier matter to get these children to the High River Industrial school as their parents have now become habituated to their absence from home. Father Lacombe was so impressed with the great importance of a special effort being made to fill the High River school that he asked me to write to Your Lordship the substance of our interview.\n\nI may add that he expressed his thorough agreement with my view as to the great importance of making sure that the Industrial schools which have been erected and equipped at great cost should be kept running, and that no risk should be taken of their having to be closed or contracted in operation.\noperation through the failure to secure a sufficient number of Indian pupils; and he quite heartily joined in my suggestion that a special effort should be made to get the children at present in the school at Battleford transferred to the High River Industrial school.\n\nI do not think it at all possible to have provision made for another boarding school until it has been established that every effort has been made and that it has been found impossible to place the children in the schools already provided.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature] J. A. J. McKenna\nOttawa, 9th March, 1900.\n\nMy Lord Bishop,\n\nFather Lacombe brought to the Minister's attention the other day (as your representative) Your Lordship's desire to have a boarding school established for Indian children. The Minister was just leaving for Europe, and consequently Father Lacombe discussed the matter fully with me. As Your Lordship is aware, the Minister could not see his way to making provision for the school; and as the estimates are now printed and submitted to Parliament, and the amount to be expended upon Indian education fixed, it would not be possible at this stage to re-open the question.\n\nIn discussing the matter with Father Lacombe, I pointed out to him that in making individual applications for grants for Indian schools each applicant took into consideration merely local needs; and that, as had been pointed out to His Lordship,\n\nBishop Pascal,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nme by the Principal of one of the leading Indian schools conducted under the auspices of the Catholic Church in the North West Territories, there was danger that the multiplication of boarding schools would soon make it impossible to secure a sufficient number of children to keep the large Industrial schools running. I pointed out to Father Lacombe that already the High River Industrial school, which is one of the best Indian educational institutions in the country, has more than twenty pupils short of the number for which we agree to pay a per capita grant, and that if Father Hansens could not succeed in getting the maximum number, it was questionable whether he would be able to keep the school running, and certainly, beyond doubt that he would not be able to keep it running at its present high state of efficiency.\n\nI further pointed out to Father Lacombe that while at the Qu'Appelle Industrial school they had at the present moment the full number of pupils, there would necessarily be discharges of older pupils in the spring, and that from what I had learned when at the school there would be considerable diffi-\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert wishes me to convey his thanks to the Department for the appropriation made for a building and maintenance of pupils at the Boarding School to be established at Thundershield's Reserve, Battleford Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\n$3,300 voted in Supplementary Estimates for buildings & pupils' better & Boarding School at Thundershield\n\nThe Secretary\u2014\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n15 [signature] 1901\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Rev. Sister Saint Anselme, the appointed principal of the Boarding School to be established upon Thunderchild's Reserve in the course of the current fiscal year, asks whether it would not be possible to obtain some government help towards pupils who might attend daily pending the beginning of operations at the Boarding School. As half of the boarding school grant is unexpended I would suggest and recommend that part of this\u2014say at the rate of $12.00 a year be given for such pupils as might attend until the opening of the Boarding School.\n\nYour obt. servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 18th December, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant applying on behalf of the newly appointed Principal of the boarding school to be established on Thunderchild's reserve for a grant for pupils who might attend daily pending the opening of the boarding school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be as well to wait until the school is regularly in operation.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI respectfully approach you on a matter that is going to involve people a good deal of trouble on this Reserve. The Roman Catholic priests wish to build a boarding school on our Reserve. A large majority of my people are opposed to it. At a meeting specially called to consider the matter on the 17th inst., twenty-two voted against it and very few voted in favour of it. We feel that as a majority of the Indians on the Reserve are Protestants there is no reason why it should be placed here, and to do so will cause ill feeling. We wish to live together in peace, and we do not wish any cause of contention to be introduced. The Roman Catholic Mission is situated immediately outside of the Reserve and we see no reason why the school should not be there if the priests are determined to have it in this neighborhood. If you wish it I can furnish the names of those who are against and for the building of the school on our Reserve, but the facts will be found to be as I have stated them, and respectfully beg you will decide this matter in the interest of peace and good will.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThunder child X Chief\n\nWitness P. Mc Donald\n\nThe Hon.\n\nThe Deputy General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 24th February, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nA protest has been received from the Chief of Thunderchild's reserve objecting on behalf of the majority of the members of his band, who are, he states, Protestants, to the erection of a boarding school on that reserve by the Roman Catholics.\n\nProvision was made in the Supplementary estimates for the current year for $3,500.00 for this school, $1800.00 for buildings and $1600.00 for the maintenance of 25 pupils at the usual per capita rate of $72.00 each. There is nothing on file to show that any of this money for buildings has been expended and no provision is made in next year's estimates for buildings although the maintenance of 15 pupils is provided for.\n\nIn this connection I beg to call your attention to a letter from the Minister to Bishop Pascal (File 157,443) on this subject, and also to a letter from Mr McKenna to the Bishop, in the latter of which it will be seen that it was not contemplated then to make provision for this school, although in the Minister's letter it is stated that the Bishop's letter would be noted and given every consideration when the estimates for the next session are being prepared.\nThe Census Return in the Annual Report for 1900 gives the population of Thunderchild's reserve as 137, being made up of 67 Anglicans, 31 Roman Catholics and 19 pagans. The Church of England has a day school now in operation on this reserve.\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of 11th December last, relative to the proposed establishment of a boarding school on Chundershill's reserve under the auspices of the Roman Catholic church, I am directed to inform you that it has been deemed advisable to make an appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the erection of a building thereon.\n\nA protest has been received from the chief objecting on behalf of the majority of the band, who are, he states, Protestants, to the erection of a boarding school there, and as nothing appears to have been done by the Church in the way of commencing building operations up to the present, the Department would like you to take the necessary steps to prevent anything being done in this direction.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the provision made for the opening of an R.C. Boarding School for the Indians of the Battleford Agency, I beg to say that the fact of erecting a building for this purpose on Thunderchild's reserve would probably lead to trouble as an arrangement, of which I have only recently been made aware, has been arrived at between the C.R. and R.C. Churches by which the C.R. School on Sweet Grass' Reserve would be closed if the R.C. School on Thunderchild's were closed, leaving only one school on each reserve. The arrangement took effect. The C.R. authorities now object to the opening of a school on Thunderchild's and Thunderchild, the Chief, has also petitioned against this institution. In consequence His Lordship Bishop Pascal is willing to erect a building on the Mission property adjoining the reserve. I had thought that possibly we could have had this institution at Sweet Grass' reserve, but this does not meet with the wishes of the Bishop.\n\nI desire to know whether the Department has any objection to the school being erected on mission property.\n\nHis Lordship has asked that on account of the high cost of lumber that he be allowed to remove the old R.C. Day School building to the site where it is proposed to place the boarding school. I do not see any objection to this except that the\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nbuilding may be wanted for Agency purposes. I should like to have your authority for the removal subject to this condition.\n\nHis Lordship further requests a concession of an additional piece of land to be reserved for school purposes. I recommend that the land be granted for such time as may be needed, to remain the property of the Crown, and be opened for settlement should at any time the school work discontinue. The piece of land referred to is the N.W.\u00bc of Section 6, Township 46, Range 18, West of 3rd Initial Meridian, which adjoins the present R.C.Mission property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, informing me that the Department has not authorized any grant for the R.C. Thunderchild Boarding School, and that His Lordship Bishop Pascal had received notification of same on the 9th of March last. I am unable to reconcile this with prior transactions in regard to the opening of this school.\n\nAn appropriation was asked in connection with the main estimates for the current year and struck out at Ottawa. The Department, however, without my intervening, included an amount later on in the supplementaries. See Supply Bill.\n\nOn the 10th of July last I was authorized to advise parties concerned of the amounts appropriated for school purposes. I presumed this held good in connection with the supplementary estimates included in the Supply Bill received a month afterwards and notified His Lordship Bishop Pascal accordingly.\n\nBeing therefore committed to the establishment of the school I would like to be informed whether the last ruling will be final.\n\nI would refer to the latest correspondence in regard to this school and point out that there is no further question as\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto this establishment being placed on the reserve.\n\nThe Church Authorities have been duly informed of the Chief's protest, and are willing to have the school on their own property outside the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 23rd February, 1901\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nI have turned out the letter referred to by the Commissioner in his communication of the 15th instant hereunder and beg to call your attention to the two concluding paragraphs of Mr Laird's letter, in one of which he asks whether, in view of his previous statement, the ruling of the Department respecting the establishment of a Roman Catholic boarding school on Thunderchild's reserve, is to be followed.\n\nMartin Benson\nSir,\n\nYour communication of the 15th instant, in further reference to the proposed establishment of a Roman Catholic boarding school for the Indians of Thunderchild's Band, was submitted to the Deputy Superintendent General, who directs me to inform you that there is to be no grant for this school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOTTAWA, 28th February, 1901\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant proposing the reserving of more land for the boarding school proposed to be established under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church for the Indians of Thunderchill's Band; and in reply I beg to say that as no grant is to be made this school, it will not be necessary to secure any more land.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Jan.\nMr. McKenna has brought to my attention the question of the correspondence between Bishop Pascal and Mr. Laird, and also the correspondence of the Department with reference to the Thunderchild Roman Catholic Boarding School. In looking again into this matter I find something that should have been brought to my attention in Mr. Benson's report, namely, that the money was specifically voted for this School, - in other words, that the School was named in the estimates to get the grant. Mr. Benson refers to it, but I presume, as is usual in votes for schools, that it was included in a total vote. It evidently, however, was determined last year to give the grant of $1500 to the building, and provide for a certain number of pupils, and there is nothing to be done but pay the amount when it is earned and also to make provision for a given number of pupils for next year.\n\nThis school appears to have been located outside of the reserve altogether, and I understand as well that the Church\nChurch of England and the Roman Catholic authorities have come to an agreement with regard to it, so that there would be no objection on the part of the Church of England.\n\nYou will notice in the letter of Chief Thunderchild, dated the 19th January last, what he says with regard to the School being outside of the Reserve, and as long as it is outside of the reserve I do not see that he has any just reason to complain. In fact, I do not see that his complaint is well grounded anyway.\n\nHowever, the grant having been agreed upon and provided, and the Church authorities having been advised of it, I do not think that there is any reason why it should not be paid.\n\nMr. Scott appears to have been wrong in stating that no money had been provided for buildings, as on page 46 of the Statutes of 1900 you will note an item of $3300 for buildings and pupils on Thunderchild's Reserve.\n\nI think that the Accountant should follow the same practice with regard to the description of Votes in this case, from time to time, as it will save a good deal of trouble. Schools should be voted for in a general way, and no school specifically named in the estimates.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\nOTTAWA, 18th March, 1901\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence respecting the proposed establishment of a Roman Catholic boarding school for the Indians of Thunderchild's reserve, I am directed to inform you that, this matter having again been submitted to the Deputy Superintendent General, he has decided that the grant having been agreed upon and provided and the Church authorities advised of it, there is no reason why it should not be paid, as the school is to be outside the reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Secretary.\n\nI noted what the Deputy-Minister says in his memo. of the 13th. of March. My memo, which appears to have been wrong, was not so in effect, but was not sufficiently explicit. What I meant was, that nothing was provided for buildings in next year's Estimates, that is for 1901-02. The statement made is not sufficiently definite to stand by itself, but it was made in Mr. Benson's presence; he understood what I meant, and wrote his memo, of the 4th. in accordance therewith. The paragraph of his memo, dealing with funds is quite correct. I have also noted what the Deputy-Minister says about giving a general wording to funds in the Supplementary Estimates, and I shall be guided by it in future.\n\nAccountant.\n\nDept. of I.A.,\nOttawa, March 26th\u20141901.\nFondations\n\nUne ma\u00e7onnerie en pierre de 1/2 pied de largeur sur 1/3 pied de hauteur, une traverse de ma\u00e7onnerie int\u00e9rieure \u00e0 partir de l'entourage de mur de refend fait suivant le plan.\n\nSols\n\nDes sols de 6 x 8 en \u00e9pinette, premi\u00e8re qualit\u00e9.\n\nSous-pierre\n\n2 sous-pierres dans le mur de pierre, avec cadre de 2 pieds et chaise sur 1/6 pied de largeur, 1/2 pied de hauteur, avec 2 barres de fer de 5 lignes pos\u00e9es dans le cadre, suivant les instructions qui seront donn\u00e9es pour les places, avec ch\u00e2ssis pos\u00e9 et ajust\u00e9.\n\nCharpente\n\nUne charpente tr\u00e8s solide, scantlings 2 x 4 pos\u00e9s de 1/6 pieds, centre en contre pour recevoir la latte, longueur des scantlings pour le carr\u00e9 1/6 pieds.

No money has yet been given to the Contractor who refused it to the acting Agent, Mr. Chisholm who said that he was to take this into consideration and to write to the Department to certify that\nall the materials were there and the building almost finished; this took place a few weeks ago, and today he says to us that he did not understand and of course nothing was made.\n\nIt is too bad for Mr. Pomerleau and his workmen who worked with so much energy to make that building without receiving any money, even to pay for their board.\n\nI hope that I will very soon receive the amount voted for the said Boarding School $2500.00\n\nYours truly,\n\nSister Saint Amelie\nSuperior.\nOttawa 24th July, 1901.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, with six enclosures, relative to the amount voted for the new Roman Catholic Boarding School, Thunderchild's Reserve, I beg to say that the Department is in communication with the Indian Commissioner in regard to the matter.

Owing to the nature of his agreement, Mr. Pomerlean informs me he thought it unnecessary to have statements of account made out for wages, plastering, and such like, and to obtain and furnish receipts for each outlay.\n\nIf the account in its present form is satisfactory I would recommend that it be paid, as Mr. Pomerlean is in much need of the money.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.

This cheque will be held here until you can obtain from the contractor receipted accounts covering the amount of the same.

O. McKenna,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn my quality of Principal of the Thunderchild Boarding School, I come to beg of you a favor. Your kind visit of last Fall to our poor school encourages me to come to you today. Having seen by yourself almost all the extra buildings which have been made in addition to the school, for which we received no help from the government, you may see also in the blue book entitled \"Annual report of the Department of Indian Affairs\", some of the expenses made by us; the workmen that we had to erect these buildings did not receive their pay for all their work, made very near a year ago; we hoped at that time that we could receive any money from the Department for the indispensable buildings made by us, but nothing was granted.\n\nThen it is with great confidence that I come to you, because you know that we have no resources and you have seen everything. Lately, the last thing we asked to Mr. Laird was not granted to us; we asked to allow us to receive 25 boarders instead of 15, as we have accommodation for that number besides the staff, he refused to accede to our request, though we see in the \"blue book\" that the grant is for 25 children. It is true that we could not have that number 15 before March, on account of the prevalence of the measles or other sickness.\namong the children of the Reserve, but now they are well and they ask us to come to our School and we are in the necessity of refusing them, being too poor to receive them without any help from the Department. You know, by your own experience, what is the beginning of such a school, how many things are necessary. Please take our cause in hands and I have the certitude that very soon we will receive what is necessary for the development of our school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFather Helmer,\nPrincipal.\n\nN.B.\n\nIf we cannot admit more children, those who would like to come now, will go somewhere else and we will not be able to have any more.\n\nF. J.\nMr. McKenna:\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Principal of Thunderchild's boarding school, I beg to say that although the Commissioner asked to have a grant for 20 pupils for the current year, the number was reduced to 15 by the Department. This school was opened on the 1st April 1901 when provision had been made for 25 pupils in the Supplementary Estimates for that year. This number was reduced last year to 15 as the school opened with 15 pupils and as the whole of the amount available for the additional number had to be used to pay for the buildings, $1500.00 being the only amount voted for this purpose, although the Department paid $2500.00. The Principal is correct in stating that the amount which originally appeared in the blue book was 25 pupils but he should bear in mind that $1500.00 was all that was voted for buildings.\n\nThis school is erected on property belonging to the Church and belongs entirely to them. Protests were received against the Department's contributing towards the establishment of this school and it was only after a great deal of correspondence that it agreed to recognize it.\n\nI am aware that no school can be carried on with only 15 pupils but for the current year this is all that are provided for, and by the last return that number is all that are shown. I do not see that they\ncan expect anything further for buildings considering that the Department has already given them $1000.00 more than it agreed to.\n\nFather Delmas' letter returned herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOTTAWA, 8th August, 1902\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th June last addressed to Mr Assistant Indian Commissioner McKenna with reference to the grant to Thunderchild's boarding school; and in reply I beg to say that it is regretted that no increase in the number of pupils authorized can be allowed you this year as Parliament has only provided for fifteen pupils although the Indian Commissioner made application for twenty.\n\nWith respect to the cost of the buildings to which you refer, I beg to say that although only $1500 was voted to cover the Department's contribution towards their erection, the sum of $2500 was actually paid, which was $1000 in excess of the amount appropriated. For this reason, therefore, the Department cannot grant you any further assistance in this direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nI don't understand how you can refuse us what is voted; if the Indian Commission made application for twenty boarders, his request was acceded, and not only twenty, but the grant is for twenty-five as you can see in the Blue Book entitled \"Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs,\" page 49 in Part II Tabular Statement, and you can see too in the past year that \u00a3250.00 had been voted for the erection of the building. If you don't mind the extra buildings, at least authorize us for twenty boarders if not for twenty-five.\n\nYours truly,\nFather Delmas,\nPrinical.\nExd.\n\nOTTAWA, 23rd September, 1902\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with further reference to the grant to Thunderchild's boarding school; and in reply I beg to inform you that you are being paid for all the pupils for whom the vote is made. As you were before advised the Commissioner's recommendation that 20 pupils be allowed for was not acceded to by Parliament, and therefore, the Department is unable to pay you for more than the number authorized, namely 15.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You remember that there is a Boarding School for the Indians on Thunderchild's Reserve that is due to your own intervention. I come to ask you to continue to take our interests, at the next parliamentary session, in asking the reimbursement of all the extras made by ourselves, such as a laundry, a stable, a pantry, a well, the painting of the interior of the school building, etc., notice here that the outside of the government building that cost \u00a3250.00 is not painted, you understand how important it would be. The enclosed bill will show you all the expenses made by us.\n\nWe would be very pleased too, if you could obtain a grant for a greater number of boarders being paid actually only for fifteen, it is scarcely sufficient for the children and the living of the staff; this same staff could take care of more boarders.\n\nThanking you by anticipation, I am,\n\nYours truly,\nFather Delmas, O.M.\n9th March, 1900 addressed to His Lordship Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert, and turned out herewith, states clearly that the Department did not consider that there was any necessity for this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Beaucage\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 5th January, 1903.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Father Delmas, Principal of St Henry's Boarding School near Thunderchild's reserve, has applied through Mr Davis, M.P., of Prince Albert, for a grant for buildings put up by the Church amounting to $946.00, and also for provision for more pupils.\n\nWith reference to the grant for buildings I beg to say that a similar application was dealt with in July last when it was decided that no further assistance could be given in this direction. See Memorandum turned out herewith.\n\nThe school is now paid for 15 pupils, being the full number provided for. The Commissioner asked that 20 be allowed last year but this application was not entertained. The census return for 1901 for this Band gives the total population as 145, of whom 49 are Anglicans, 56 Roman Catholics and 40 pagans.\n\nThe Church of England has a day school now in operation on this reserve with an enrollment of 7 pupils out of a school population of about 18. There were 300 Roman Catholics in the Battleford Agency with a school population of nearly 60 belonging to that faith out of a total number of school children of 145. There are six day schools in the Agency, 4 of which are carried on by the Church of England and two by the Roman Catholics.\n\nA protest against the establishment of this boarding school was received from the Indians of the Thunderchild's reserve, and Mr McKenna's letter of the\n9th March, 1900 addressed to His Lordship Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert, and turned out herewith, states clearly that the Department did not consider that there was any necessity for this school.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 13th, 1905.\n\nDear Mr. Davis,\n\nI have your favour of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a letter from the Reverend Father Dolan of the Thunderchild's Reserve, in which he asks for an increased grant there. At present there is no financial provision for meeting this demand and I am unable to hold out any hopes that it will be entertained in next year's estimates. The school expenditure is, as you are aware, very high at present and the tendency is rather to curtail than increase it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. S. G. T. A.\n\nT. O.

Davis, M.P.,\nHonourable and dear Sir,\n\nIt is at the request of P. Vachon that I write these lines. Rumours are circulating that the Doukhobors wish to obtain an extension of land from the Government towards Lake Mackey, or T.6-46-6 towards the unsurveyed limits of the reserve. P. Vachon adds that there are squatters in this township, and that he is going to bring several families there from the United States. He wishes me to beg you that you use your influence with the Government. The Doukhobors have been sufficiently favoured up to now. It would be suitable for the Canadians who are coming to us from the States, and for whom you are very desirous of finding a proper location. I dare hope, dear sir, that you will consider this request legitimate and that you will give it your attention.\n\nI also take the liberty of reminding you again of the quasi-promises which has been made me by the Hon. D. Laird to increase the number of children at the boarding schools at Thunderchild and at l'\u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse from 12 to 15 that are there, to the number of 25 or 30 for each of them.\n\nThat if you would obtain a boarding school for the La Ronge and Pelican Missions etc. at Cumberland, you may believe that you have won our deepest gratitude.\n\nWith best wishes for your health and success,\n\nI am Honourable Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Apr\u00e8s les explications que j'avais eues de l'Hon. G. Sifton et de l'Hon. D. Laird, Je ne m'attendais pas \u00e0 une pareille r\u00e9ponse.\n\nConsid\u00e9rez cher Monsieur, et daignez faire comprendre \u00e0 ces Messieurs du Dept. Indien la justice de ma requ\u00eate.\n\n1. L'\u00e9cole pensionnat St. Henri, (Thunderchild) nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e afin de recevoir chez nous trente enfants catholiques, nombre de ceux qui \u00e9taient alors \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole protestante de Battleford.\n\n2. Maintenant que cette \u00e9cole fonctionne admirablement bien et que les Soeurs ont fait de grands sacrifices pour cette \u0153uvre, le D\u00e9pt. les laisse avec 16 enfants seulement, au lieu de les autoriser \u00e0 en recevoir 30, dans le local fait AD HOC.\n\n3. Nous d\u00e9sirons fermer l'\u00e9cole de Sweet Grass afin d'\u00e9conomiser au D\u00e9pt. les $300 du teacher en faveur du Boarding School St. Henri, et cela n'est pas m\u00eame accept\u00e9.\n\n4. J'apprends que les Indiens catholiques de Pound Maker ont offert plusieurs enfants au Principal de l'\u00e9cole St. Henri, et qu'ils devront \u00eatre refus\u00e9s.\n\n5. Est-ce plus \u00e9conomique pour le Dept. de donner $136 par enfant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de Battleford que $22(72) \u00e0 celle de St. Henri?\n\n6. Faut-il laisser d\u00e9primer cette \u00e9cole qui ne peut se maintenir \u00e0 quinze enfants sans faire des dettes, au lieu de l'encourager?\n\n7. Les objurgations possibles du V\u00e9n. Archev\u00eaque McKay et des autres Ministres seraient elles cause de ce refus? Cette \u00e9cole fait elle ombrage \u00e0 ces Messieurs? Je ne vois pas pourquoi puisque nous n'acceptons pas les enfants d'Indiens protestants, et que nous nous contenterons de 30 enfants.\n\n8. Pour toutes ces raisons et d'autres que Je ne puis \u00e9crire, Je Vous prie, Cher et Hon. Monsieur, de faire un effort supr\u00eame aupr\u00e8s du dept. indien, afin que justice soit rendue \u00e0 nos Indiens catholiques de Battleford ainsi qu'\u00e0 la population catholique de ce district, qui comme Vous savez, tient beaucoup \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole. J'en ai \u00e9crit un mot au Principal, et Je ne serais pas surpris qu'un cri d'indignation parte de ces c\u0153urs qui pourtant Vous sont tout\nd\u00e9vou\u00e9s jusqu'ici.\n\n9.\u2014Pour mon compte, je croyais que cette augmentation de quelques enfants nous serait accord\u00e9e sans difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 notre demande mais je vois par ce double refus non motiv\u00e9, que NOUS NE COMPTONS PLUS DANS VOTRE ESTIME ET VOS INT\u00c9R\u00caTS.\n\n10.\u2014Je suis d'autant plus attrist\u00e9 par ces refus, que l'objet de ma demande \u00e9tait plus l\u00e9gitime et bien peu de chose.\n\n11.\u2014Je vous laisse m\u00e9diter ces lignes et me dispose \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer une petition en r\u00e8gle \u00e0 la Chambre et qui ne sera pas un\n\nCOMPLIMENT.\n\nVotre humble Serviteur\n\n+ Albert Pascal + en S.\nv. ep. de Salles\nTranslation\n\nPrince Albert, 1st May, 1903.\n\nT. O. Davis, Esq., M.P.\n\nHon. and Dear Sir,\n\nI am exceedingly pained at the refusal of the Dept. of Indian Affairs in regard to the St. Henri School, Thunderchild's, and the Ile \u00e0 la Crosse school. After the explanations that I received from the Hon. G. Sifton and the Hon. D. Laird, I did not expect such a reply.\n\nConsider, dear sir, and be good enough to make the gentlemen of the Dept. of Indian Affairs understand the justice of my request.\n\n1. The St. Henri, (Thunderchild's), boarding-school was granted us in order that we might receive 50 Roman Catholic children, the number of those who were then at the Battleford Protestant school.\n\n2. Now that this school is working admirably, and that the Sisters have made great sacrifices for this work, the Dept. leaves them with only 15 children, instead of authorizing them to receive 50 in the school, for this purpose.\n\n3. We desire to close the Sweet Grass school, in order to save the Dept. the $500 for the teacher, in favor of the St. Henri boarding-school, and that was not even accepted.\n\n4. I learn that the R.C. Indians of Poundmaker's reserve offered several children to the Principal of the St. Henri school, and that they were refused.\n5. Is it more economical for the Dept. to give $136 per child to the Battleford school than $72 to St. Henri school?\n\n6. Ought this school to be allowed to perish, which cannot maintain itself on 15 children, without running into debt; or ought it to be encouraged?\n\n7. Is it possible that the objections of the Ven. Archdeacon McKay and of other clergymen are the cause of this refusal? Is this school the cause of umbrage to these gentlemen? I do not see why; since we do not accept Protestant Indian children, and as we shall be content with 30 children.\n\n8. For all these reasons and others that I cannot write, I beg you, dear sir, to make a supreme effort with the Dept. of Indian Affairs in order that justice may be done our R.C. Indians of Battleford, as well as the R.C. population of this district, which, as you know, counts a great deal on this school. I wrote a line to the Principal and I shall not be surprised if a cry of indignation comes out of those hearts that have everywhere been devoted to you up to the present time.\n\n9. As for myself, I believe that this increase of a few children will be granted us, without difficulty, at our request; but I see by this double refusal, without grounds, that we can no longer count on your esteem and interest.\n\n10. I am the more saddened by these refusals, as the object of my request was most legitimate, and a very small matter.\n\nII. I let you think over these lines, and I shall prepare a petition in connection with the matter to the House, which will not be a compliment.\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\n+ Albert Pascal, A.M.\nVic. Ap. of Sask.\nOttawa only\nMay 7 1903\n\nMy dear Polly,\n\nI am writing from\nthe Bishop of St. Andrews\nand send you a copy.\n\nYours,\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 11th May, 1903:\n\nMy Dear Mr Davis:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 7th instant enclosing a letter from Bishop Pascal in French, and in compliance with your request I herewith enclose a copy of the translation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.O. Davis, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 11th May, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to Bishop Pascal's letter of the 1st instant forwarded by Mr Davis, M.P., in reference to the Thunderchild's and Isle \u00e0 la Crosse boarding schools I beg to say that the Department has already declined to increase the number of pupils at present provided for at these schools and Mr Davis has been so informed. It is the policy of the Department, approved of by the Minister, not to increase the number of pupils or schools of this class at present, and I think this decision should be adhered to until the whole question of Indian education is thoroughly gone into.\n\nIn the case of Thunderchild's school I may state that it was started contrary to the express wishes of the Department and the Indians most interested, and it was only recognized after the persistent importunity of Bishop Pascal, who imagines he can obtain the desired increase by the same means. The whole tone of the Bishop's letter indicates that he thinks he can force the Department to meet his views.\n\n[Signature]\nMr. Benson,\n\nI am unable to note that Bishop Paschal makes certain definite statements. These statements are clearly stated.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 16th May, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn further reference to Bishop Pascal's letter on the subject of an increase for the Thunderchild's and Isle-a-la-Crosse boarding schools, in which he states that he is exceedingly pained at the refusal of the Department to accede to his request for the following reasons:\n\n1. The Bishop claims that he was granted the Thunderchild's school in order that 30 Roman Catholic children might be received, which number, he states were then in the Battleford Protestant school.\n\nThere is nothing on file to show that this school was established for the purpose of receiving this number of children. It was established by the Roman Catholics on their own responsibility and is situated on property belonging to their mission just outside the reserve, and although the Department has contributed $1500.00 to the building and provided a per capita grant for 15 pupils, it was done on its own initiative that it made these contributions, but only after pressure was brought to bear by Bishop Pascal. I believe he was correct in stating that there were a number of so-called Roman Catholic children at the Battleford school, but they were there with the full consent of their parents.\n\n2. The Bishop states that the school is\nworking admirably and that the Sisters have made great sacrifices for the work, but the Department leaves them with only 15 children instead of authorizing them to receive 30 in the school established for that purpose.\n\nIt is admitted that this school is in good working order but 15 pupils are all that are provided for and if it was erected to accommodate 30 children the Department was not consulted in the matter.\n\n3. The Bishop says that they wish to close the Sweet Grass school in order to save the Department $300.00 for the teacher's salary, and to assist the Thunderchild's school, but that the Department did not accept this offer.\n\nThe Sweet Grass day school is poorly attended but it is as much the fault of the missionary as any one. The Bishop evidently wishes to use the plea of inefficiency of the day school to attain his ends. They have also a day school on Thunderchild's Reserve, which they are endeavoring to freeze out.\n\n4. The Bishop says he is informed that the Indians of Poundmaker's reserve offered several children to the Principal of Thunderchild's school, and that they were refused.\n\nI have no doubt that His Lordship is correct, as this school already has the full number of grant earners enrolled.\n\n5. The Bishop asks whether it is more economical for the Department to pay $135.00 to the Battleford school than $72.00 to Thunderchild's.\n\nIt is not altogether a question of economy.\nIf it were so it would be cheaper to carry on day schools than boarding schools. It is still a question whether the day school should be altogether ignored in favor of boarding and industrial schools as Indians who wish their children educated at day schools have to make some sacrifices, while they are relieved of all responsibility when they place them in the other schools.\n\n6. He questions whether the boarding school should be allowed to perish, as it cannot maintain itself on 15 children without running into debt.\n\nI have already pointed out that no school can be made a financial success with this small number of pupils, but no one was better aware of this than the Roman Catholic authorities when they established the school.\n\n7. Bishop Pascal wants to know whether the objections of Ven. Archdeacon Mackay and other clergymen are the cause of the refusal.\n\nI may say that the Church of England authorities objected to the establishment of the school in the first instance, but since it has been recognized by the Department, no further protests have been received from them.\n\n8. The Bishop states that for the above reasons and others that he cannot write, he begs Mr Davis, M.P., to make a supreme effort with the Department in order that justice made be done the Roman Catholic Indians of Battleford, as well as the Roman Catholic population of the district, and he adds that he shall not be surprised if a cry of indignation comes from these hearts that have everywhere been\ndevoted to Mr Davis up to the present time.\n\nI can see no just cause for indignation on the part of the Roman Catholics in the way they have been treated by the Department in regard to the establishment and maintenance of boarding schools in the Territories, or in fact in any other part of Canada. The last census gives the Indian population of the Territories as 17,992, of whom 4,279 are said to be Roman Catholics, while the Protestants number 4,788, the balance being pagans. To meet the boarding school requirements the Roman Catholics have established 17 schools, towards the maintenance of which the Department makes provision for 617 pupils; while the Protestants with over 500 more adherents, have only 15 schools and provision for but 468 pupils. This surely shows no unjust discrimination against the Roman Catholics. I think that in dealing with all religious school questions, the Department is justified in taking a broad view of the treatment meted out to the different denominations. The Methodists and the Presbyterians, whose Indian missions are conducted under regularly organized systems, recognize this view of the case, but the Church of England and the Roman Catholics, whose schools are under the immediate charge of the bishops of the different dioceses take much narrower views and consider that the needs of their own particular charges are all the Department has to consider.\n\n9. The Bishop says that as for himself he believes that this increase of a few children will be granted without difficulty at their request, but that he sees by this double refusal without grounds, that they can no longer count on Mr Davis' esteem.\nand interest.\n\nThe Department considered that it had ample justification for refusing the Bishop's previous demands and if it accedes to them now, it can only be on account of his importunity, as his letter does not strengthen his case in any way, and I cannot see that the refusal of the Department shows any lack of interest on the part of Mr Davis, who has at all times been most insistent in endeavoring to have his recommendations carried out.\n\n10. The Bishop says that he is the more saddened by these refusals as the object of his request was most legitimate and a very small matter.\n\nProvision for 15 more pupils at this school may be a small matter but it is one of principle and should not be made even to stop the clamor of a bishop.\n\n11. He concludes by saying that he will let Mr Davis think over these lines and that he will prepare a petition to the House in connection with the matter, which will not be a compliment.\n\nI think when His Lordship has been put in possession of the facts above stated, he will hesitate about having this matter brought up in the House.\n\n[Signature]\nTO THE HONORABLE\n\nT. O. DAVIS, M.P.\n\nHONORABLE SIR,\n\nSome time ago I was informed by the priests at \u00cele \u00e0 la Grosse, that the government has granted our request re: Increase of children at that school. Though the number allowed does not entirely answer my request, it shows however the good will of the department, and I wish to convey my sincere thanks to the said department for partially acceding to my wishes, trusting to see our hopes fully realized at a later period.\n\nSo far nothing has been received in regard to the St. Henry's Boarding-school at Thunderchild. The Principal of that School, Rev. Father Delmas, informs me that the catholic Indians of the different Reserves are greatly discontented, seeing that their so legitimate demands have not yet been taken into consideration. Hence I maintain my request that an additional grant for 15 more children be allowed so as to raise the total number to 30, number equal to that of the catholic children frequenting the Battleford protestant Boarding school before that of Thunderchild was opened.\n\nI hope You will do Your best to settle this question in a satisfactory manner before the next elections.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNote:\n\nMr. Pedley, I was under the impression You had sent the request to Thunderchild School. If not let me know.\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 22nd October, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of Bishop Pascal's letter (not dated) addressed to you on the subject of an increased grant for Thunderchild's boarding school, I beg to inform you that provision has been made in the supplementary estimates for the current year for five more pupils, which will bring the number up to twenty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nT.O.

The school authorities have now been informed that they can secure additional land, a matter which should be looked into. In view of this fact, belonging to the P. Co. Co., the Board called upon me to urge and make a strong case for the Co. Co. that they have paid off about three thousand dollars worth of bills, and what the government has been able to build on some of their existing lands, dollars, such of the government will be paid. I believe he will be pleased to do what he can.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n254853\nHouse of Commons\n\nOttawa\n\nTo the Crown\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 24th February, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Davis, M.P., writes under date of the 16th instant on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church authorities asking the Department to assume the liability of about $1800.00 incurred by them in the erection of Thunderchild's boarding school. He states that if the Department will do this the Church is willing to transfer the property to the Government.\n\nThis school was put up by the Roman Catholics on their own responsibility on property belonging to the Mission just outside the reserve and although the Department has contributed $2500.00 towards the building to help them out of their difficulties, they are apparently still short this $1800.00, which they are more than likely to get, if persistence can obtain it.\n\nTwenty pupils is the number provided for and there never was any good reason for establishing the school in the first place, which was started contrary to the express wish of the Department.\n\nI do not see that it would be any advantage to the Department to own the property if it has to assume this liability, and it would only give a pretext for Bishop Pascal to obtain a grant for an increased number of pupils.\n\n[Signature]\nW Benson\n\nPlease note the 1st paragraph of this letter. Add an fourth line up here building.\nOTTAWA, 3rd March, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the first paragraph of the letter from Mr Davis, M.P., to which you call my attention, I beg to say that the Department did not put up the buildings for the boarding school near Thunderchild's reserve. As stated in my memo. of the 24th ulto., this school was put up by the Roman Catholics on their own responsibility. As I said before, however, the Department has paid $2500.00 on account of this building and it is most likely that Mr Davis has taken this contribution as if the Department had put up the building in the first instance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Oliver\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Sup't. General.\n\nI think this attempt of the Thunderchild Boarding School management to place the whole future responsibilities for the maintenance of this school upon the Department should be resisted.\n\nIn the first place, we have no money to meet the demand; in the second place, I am not aware that the Department desires the doubtful privilege of keeping these buildings in repair and looking after the whole property as a Government Institution.\n\nAccountant\u2014\n\nOTTAWA, March 18th\u20141904.,\nDept. of I.A.\nSir,\n\nI beg to quote for the information of the Department the following extract from Mr Agent Day's report for the month of March dated the 7th instant:\n\n\"The Thunderchild Boarding School is free from quarantine too, and is again in operation.\"\n\n(Sgd) D Laird\nIndian Commissioner\nDear Mr. Davis,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th of March last, and to say that I am very thankful to you for the interest you take in the matter regarding our Boarding School. I am thankful to you especially for the hopes you give concerning the result we made to the Department.\n\nI long to have this affair settled. I would like it should be so soon as possible. I will agree with you that they ought to come attention but to each his own rights, and the officers must have been stronger the day you obtained this Boarding School than it will be to obtain the little we now rely at such good conditions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Delmas Pen\nEx'd.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Rev. H. Delmas addressed to Mr. Davis, M. P., May last, regarding the Thunderchild's boarding school, I beg to say that in January, 1896, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Saskatchewan made application for the establishment of a boarding school for the Catholic children of the Battleford Reserve; but it was not until the supplementary estimates for 1900 were passed that any appropriation was made for the Thunderchild's school $3,300 was then provided, $2,500 for buildings and $750 for the maintenance of 25 pupils at $30 per capita.\n\nThe buildings were erected by the Roman Catholic Church authorities on property owned by them outside the reserve. A protest was made against a school being started in this locality and it was not until the year 1901 that the grant was allowed for the buildings and only fifteen pupils were provided for them.\n\nThe Roman Catholic authorities have asked the Department to assume the liabilities of about $1,800 incurred by them in the erection of this building in addition to the $2,500 already granted and I should consider that these two amounts about represent the total cost of the school.\n\nThe school is now recognised by the Department and is in receipt of a per capita grant for twenty pupils, five additional pupils having been provided for in this year's estimates.\n\nYou will see that this school has been forced on the Department and that it has already paid more than half the cost of its erection which is the usual extent of its contributions to boarding school buildings.\nAt present the Department does not exercise full control over any of the boarding schools in the West which are all conducted by different religious denominations and I do not see that it would be any advantage to obtain the title to this school property at present.\n\nProvision is now made for about all the pupils they can accommodate and twenty are all that are now in residence.\n\nThere is no special appropriation for paying the indebtedness on the buildings and the church should not have undertaken their erection if they had not money enough to complete them.\n\nThe application for an increased grant and for payment of the existing debt has been refused repeatedly by the Department and there is nothing on file which would lead it to reverse its decision as any further grant or payment to this school would only be forming a precedent for other schools to ask to have their liabilities wiped off.\n\nOttawa, 21st September, 1904.\nPrince Albert, March 14th, 1906.\n\nThe Hon.

Baird.\n\nA year ago, we received the news from the Indian Commissioner that we would be notified by the Department to have the number increased. We waited from that time and no news...\nare coming.\n\nAs some of our Indians are going away North and they could not have Day schools for quite a while yet, they bring their children to our Boarding School. So lately, we received five from Moosomin Reserve. I accepted them trusting that the Department will be generous enough to give us the means of keeping them.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Delmas, Principal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith application from the Principal of the Thunderchild Boarding School for permission to increase the number of Pupils in that Institution up to forty, which was the number estimated for. I might say, in support of this request that they have ample accommodation for the number asked for; also that this School is giving splendid results, and is a real benefit to the Indians: there are also plenty of Children available.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, May 13, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., enclosing an application from the Reverend Principal of the Thunderchild's Boarding School for an increase in the pupilage at that institution from twenty to forty.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that no provision has been made by the Department in the current year's estimates for any increase in the number of grant earners at this school, and the request of the Principal cannot, therefore, be granted.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise Father Delmas accordingly.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.P.G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver.\n\nWith reference to the attached letter addressed by the Rev. H. Delmas to Mr. A. Champagne, M.P., I have to say that the Department provides for 20 pupils at Thunderchild's R.C. Boarding School at $72 per capita. No increase in the number of pupils allowed has been made in the current year's Estimates, and therefore the number at Thunderchild's has not been increased. We are receiving many applications for like increases and it seems impossible to consider any of them favorably.\n\nDeputy Supt.

P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, December 13, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nOn several occasions the Roman Catholic authorities have applied to the Department for an increase in the pupilage of the Thunderchild's Boarding School. The Department is disposed to favourably consider this request at the present time provided the accommodation is sufficient. They have asked to be granted 40 pupils whereas they have now only 20 and when you visit the school you will be good enough to look carefully into the accommodation in respect to the dormitories, class-rooms, etc., and to report specially in this respect. Previous reports on this school from yourself show that there were a number of half-breeds in attendance. By a recent ruling of the Department half-breeds cannot be admitted to an Indian school and draw the grant; and in any event their presence in a school should not be allowed to in any way affect the interests of the Indians. As above said, if conditions are favourable, the Department will favourably consider an increase in the number of grant earners in the school and I have to ask you to give early attention to the matter of reporting upon these conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, March 17th., 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith two Agreements, in duplicate, between Your Lordship and His Majesty the King, represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, for the future maintenance and management of the Lac la Plonge and Thunderchild's Boarding Schools, and I have to request that you will be good enough to sign these documents in the presence of a subscribing witness and affix your official Seal, returning same to the Department at your earliest convenience, as the Agreements will go into effect on the 1st. of April next.\n\nOn the return of these documents the signature of the Deputy Superintendent General will be affixed, and a copy of each will then be sent you. Certain alterations and improvements may be necessary to bring the buildings at these two Schools up to the required standard. An officer of the Department has been instructed to inspect and report on the improvements required at these Schools. A reasonable time will be granted by the Department to allow you to have the necessary improvements made, and in the meantime, provided these Agreements are completed, the increased grant will be paid from the 1st. of April next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. Albert Pascal, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Prince Albert,\nPRINCE ALBERT, Sask.\nOttawa, March 25, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith duplicate agreement relating to the future maintenance and management of the Thunderchild's Boarding School duly executed by the Superintendent General.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. Albert Pascal, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Prince Albert,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSt Henry's Boarding School,\nDelmas, May 14th, 1911\n\nTo the Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the number of pupils admissible in the St Henry's Boarding School, I have the honour to say that our accommodation is ample for 116 pupils and a full staff of teachers, which statement was made to me by Inspector Chickleton when he went over our buildings for the purpose of taking measurements in order to ascertain the amount of cubic air space contained in the various rooms.\n\nIt is our intention to take down the partition between the refectory and the school-room, which would then make the classrooms the full size of the ground floor of the annex i.e., 28' x 36'. And we will then use the original refectory for the purpose for which it was designed. The dormitories are ample, heating well ventilated and lighted; they are also kept in perpetually clean and healthy condition.\nIn view of these circumstances, I would, therefore, respectfully ask the Department for permission to increase the number of pupils from 20, as we have at the present time, to 30; or, in the event of your not being able to comply with my request, I would petition that no way be allowed to admit white children to complete our number, as the running expenses of the school are much heavier for the smaller number of children in comparison to what they would be if we had our full complement of pupils.\n\nHoping that these considerations will secure your kind and prompt attention and that my request shall be granted,\n\nI am,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH. Delmas, pte. o.m.,\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith application from the Rev Principal of the St Henry's Boarding School for permission to increase the number of Pupils up to forty. This School has, since its inception in 1901, been a splendid success; and the results attained have been most gratifying, and beneficial to the Pupils, Indians and the Department; and I consider that an Institution which has for ten years given such alround satisfaction should receive every encouragement: and I therefore, in my Estimates for 1908-'09, 1909-1910, 1910-1911, 1911-1912, made provision for forty Pupils, as there is ample accommodation for that number; and there are also plenty of Children available, to keep this School up to its full complement.\n\nI have the honour to again recommend this application to your earnest consideration; and trust that you will be able to grant the increase up to the forty Pupils. In this connection, I would ask you to kindly refer to my annual Reports on the Schools of this Agency for 1910 and 1911, wherein I have given a full description of the work accomplished by this School.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN ESQ'RF.\n\nASSISTANT DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo enclosing an application from the Reverend Principal of the Thunderchild's Boarding School to have the pupilage of that institution increased from twenty to forty.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in a report dated February 1st, last, the Department was advised that there were 42 children in attendance at this school, 20 Indian and 22 other. Pending a final decision as to the repairs and alterations to be made to this building to make it conform to the requirements of the Department I may say that it is not thought advisable to grant the Principal's request in its entirety at the present time. There is only accommodation in the school at present for less than 40 children. If the Principal, however, will discharge ten of the children for whom he is now receiving no grant from the Department he will be allowed to substitute for them ten Indian children and will then be paid a grant for thirty pupils, provided they are in attendance, at the rate of $100.00 per annum from July 1st, next. This is upon the condition that the extra class-room space referred to by the Principal is provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nAsst.

Referring to your letter dated June 7, 1911, the pupilage of our institution has been increased from twenty to thirty since July 1st, 1911. So, we believe that the Department has only forgotten to pay the grant for Jean-Baptiste and Thomas Solosie admitted on October 2, and we hope that the balance will soon be forwarded.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\n\nI remain,\n\nJ.

I ask of you to give to the Delmas school the full grant of $185 per capita, and to make this grant go back as far as possible. This proof of your good will and interest in the welfare of their school, will be a great encouragement to the Sisters who are doing superior work in their school and who deserve that you should show in a practical manner that you appreciate their efforts.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 10, Volume 6337, File 663-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 1st, 1912.\n\nRev.

Grandin, O.M.I.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIn my report on a recent inspection of the Thunderchild Boarding School, dated the 20th inst., in the latter part of paragraph 7 reference is made to the case of a pupil, Genevieve Samoganis, who is suffering from a severely inflamed eye. I am now in receipt of a letter from Medical Attendant Dr. Macadam, who recently visited the school, in which he says: \"I would recommend sending the girl to the Prince Albert Hospital. Her father is blind, which makes it all the worse for her chances of recovery.\" Apparently the Doctor does not feel confident that special treatment will be of avail to restore sight the use of the inflamed eye; but as the girl is quite strong and healthy in other respects, and as the other eye is perfectly good as yet, it seems advisable that an effort should be made, either to check the disease and restore the inflamed eye, or if that cannot be done at least to prevent the disease extending to the sound organ. I would therefore respectfully recommend that the removal of the girl to a hospital at Prince Albert and the employment of a specialist be authorized.\n\nThere are two specialists in diseases of the eye, namely, Drs. J. W. Eede and J. A. Labrecque, either of whom might be employed, as directed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 1, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in which you again call attention to the case of Genevieve Samoganis, who is suffering from a severely inflamed eye, and recommending that she be sent to the Prince Albert Hospital for treatment.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation and you may have her sent to the hospital at once on the usual terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDelmas, Rock,\n6th Nov., 1904\n\nMr. Duncan Scott\nDeputy Chief, General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Reverend Father A. Watelle, Principal of the Thunderchild Boarding School at Delmas, announced to me today that the Department is refusing to pay the grant for more than thirty children, this being the number authorized for our school.\n\nNot long ago, Mr. Inspector Chubbeler of the Prince Albert Inspectorate, told very plainly to the Indians on the Red River and Assiniboia that they were free to send their children to any Indian school, either Day School or Boarding School.\n\nHere, the Thunderchild Boarding School is approved by the Medical Health Officer and School Inspector for at least forty children. Therefore why should the Department refuse the Indians to fill the house to its full capacity? I have many demands for admission on hand already, shall I tell the parent of these poor children that the Department refuses to give them what they are entitled to?\nThe Officers of the Indian Department should be justified to see that the Indians are beginning to realize the good of a higher education, as they have received in Indian Boarding schools, and they should do all what is in their power to encourage them, instead of trying to restrict them. It is bad enough that the Battigood Industrial School has been closed, you should let the Indians draw all the benefit possible from the only center of Indian Higher Education that is left in the Battigood Agency.\n\nI conclude in asking you, dear sir, to reconcile your decision, and to let the Authorities of the Standing Rock Boarding School, at Delmont to receive so many children of the band can return according to the medical Health Officer.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour very truly,\n\nE. Jacobs, O.M.I.\nIndian Missionary\nin the Battigood Agency\nNovember 13th, 1914.\n\nDear Father Cahill -\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter which I have just received from Rev. Father Lacombe, of Delmas, Sask., in reference to the Thunderchild Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn connection therewith I wish to inform you that the contract for the maintenance and management of this school, signed by his Lordship the Bishop of Prince Albert, provides for the maintenance of thirty pupils, and our records do not show that any direct application for an increase in the pupilage has ever been made. True the officer who checks the returns and computes the amount of the quarterly grant based his computation on the pupilage provided in the estimates sanctioned by Parliament. Had there been a direct request for an increase in the number for which the grant is paid it would have been brought to my notice, and I should have been very pleased to have given it sympathetic consideration, and\n\nRev. Father Cahill,\n222 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nand for this reason I consider the remarks of the Rev. Father Lacombe as to the attitude of the Department towards the Indian children on the Reserves in question entirely uncalled for.\n\nI would further point out that the children affected by the closing of the Battleford Industrial School to which he refers, could not be eligible for admission to the Thunderchild Indian Boarding School, and furthermore provision was made for these children in the establishment of an improved day school which should fully meet their educational requirements.\n\nIf an application is made for an increase in pupilage stating the grounds therefor it will give me great pleasure to consider it immediately, and I would ask you to be kind enough to inform the Principal accordingly unless you would wish to make the application yourself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSt. Henry's Boarding School,\nBattleford Agency, Delmas, Nov. 12, 1914.\n\nSir:\n\nDoctor Macadam was here a couple of weeks ago and, as we had some children suffering from toothache we asked him to extract them. He said these teeth were too decayed and that they ought to be treated by a dentist. On our objecting that the department might not grant the permission he replied \"I wonder why they would not do it for you while they do it for the other schools?\"\n\nUnder these circumstances I would kindly ask you to write to the department about it. I think that the cheapest way would be to send Dentist Rock from North Battleford to Delmas, as we have seven or eight that have to see him. The expense for their fare and the hotel would be, I think, greater than for him to come here.\n\nHoping that with your recommendation the permission will be granted,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

You will note that he quotes Dr. Macadam as saying that the Department gave this permission to the other schools. This letter was shown to Dr. Macadam, and he denies absolutely having made any such statement. I would like to say that during my term as Agent, the only time that a Dentist's services were engaged, it was for the children of the St. Henri School.

The Department has a medical officer, Dr. McAdam, who visits this school and in reply to a similar request made by the Principal in November, 1912, he was informed that the Department considered that the medical officer should be competent to do this work.\n\nThe only case of a similar kind that I can find any record of was an application made by the Principal of the Fort Frances Boarding School in March, 1912, for the obtaining of dental treatment for a pupil of that school and on that occasion the amount of money expended for the purpose was deducted from the money at the credit of the pupil in the savings account.\n\nIt has not been the practice of the Department to pay for treatment of this kind for pupils attending boarding and industrial schools. Where dental service has\nhas been required in the past the schools have paid for this service from their grant.

I am forwarding the correspondence to Edmonton, residence of Rev. Father Mandine, who has charge of Alberta & North B.C.\n\nI deplore the tone of Mr. Lacombe's letter, and I think you show considerable patience and self-possession in dealing with him. Matters of that kind should pass through the hands of the Superintendent (or Provincial, as we call him), and Department would be thus saved considerable annoyance, and interests would be better served.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nChas.

Beside, the high expense recently made, for greater accommodations.\n\nIf you would, therefore, fully meet our desire in increasing the number of our pupils from 30 to 40; this would be sufficient for two teachers, and the pupils could then be advantageously taught in separate class-rooms.\n\nHoping that my request will receive a prompt consideration,\n\nI remain,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Watelle, Principal of the Thunderchild's Boarding School, for an increase in the pupilage from 30 to 40 children I beg to say that, in view of the report of Mr. Inspector Chisholm, who was instructed by you to make an inspection of this school and report on the present accommodation, I consider the Department would be quite justified in granting the increase asked for, as Mr. Chisholm, who has gone thoroughly into the question of accommodation, states that they have ample room for this number.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, March 19, 1915.\nOttawa, March 22, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nIn further reference to your application for an increase in the pupilage of the Thunderchild's Boarding school I beg to say that, in view of the accommodation your school affords, the Department has decided to allow you to take up to forty pupils, which will give you an increase of ten over the number now provided for. This increase will date from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A.

This increase will date from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nExtract from Agent's Monthly Report on the Thunderchild's R. C. Boarding School for the month of May, 1916.\n\nOriginal on 137443-7\n\nDuring the month a death took place. This was Elmirie Mirasty of Meadow Lake.\n\nSgd. J. A. Rowland,\nAgent\nDelmas, Sask., January 1, 1917.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott, Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSeveral times the ecclesiastical authorities were constrained to blame the young Father Lacombe for his interference with Departmental business on the reserves. The young Father was instructed by the Acting Provincial to manage his own affairs, and to restrict himself to his missionary work. As, instead of carrying out the instructions, he was still meddling in matters which did not concern him, then he was removed from the reserves. After six months, on his earnest desire, he was put again to the work of the missions, but under some conditions, of which I must give you notice.\n\nFather Lacombe has no authority at all by himself. I am not only the Principal of the Boarding School, in Delmas, but also in charge of the Missions in the reserves, and in charge of the Father; and Father Lacombe is working on those reserves wholly under my authority. Besides that, on account of the past trouble and to prevent any in the future, Father Lacombe is forbidden to make any request to the Department without his letter bearing my written approval. Therefore would the Department have the advice or the support of the missions for anything\nconcerning the welfare of the Indians, I am the only channel the authorities of the Department should communicate with.\n\nI hope by this to avoid any trouble in the future, as I highly appreciate the support and fair play given to us by the Authorities of the Indian Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Watelle\nPrincipal.\nFebruary 5th, 1917.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 1st, with reference to young Father Lacombe. I have noted its contents carefully and have to thank you for your interest in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. Watelle,\nPrincipal, Delmas Boarding School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nSeptember 12, 1917.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nHon. Dr. Roche,\n\nIncl. I am inclosing herewith a letter from Rev. Father Natelle, Principal of St. Henry's boarding school, Delmas, Sask., urging payment of the grant to that institution for the June quarter, 1917, which has been withheld under your instructions. Mr. Champagne, M.P., was in to see me this morning and stated that he intends to see you regarding this matter; he is still insistent that the grant should be withheld.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 21, 1917.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 17th instant, with reference to the correspondence which Rev. Father Watelle, Principal of the Delmas Indian boarding school, has had with the Department, regarding payment of the grant to his school for the June quarter, last. In this connection I have to say that I regret that I have not been able to reply to his letters, as the correspondence is now all before the Minister.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Grandin, O.M.I.,\nCor. 10th Street & Victoria Avenue,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSeptember 21, 1917.\n\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon. Dr. Roche.\n\nIncl.- I have to inclose herewith letter which I received to-day from Rev. Father Grandin, regarding the case of Rev. Father Watelle, the papers about which are now before you.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nPRIVATE\n\nL. J. G.\net\nM. I.\n\nEDMONTON, ALTA., OCTOBER 5TH, 1917\n\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Pascal has forwarded to me the letter you wrote him on September 24th, about Father Watelle, principal of the Indian School of Delmas. As I am the superior of Father Watelle, his Lordship thought that it was my business to attend to this matter. In fact I had written a few weeks before to the Deputy superintendent general of Indian Affairs about this same school, and I was expecting some communication from the Indian Department, when your letter was forwarded to me. Allow me, Sir, to express frankly and sincerely my surprise at the contents of your letter to Bishop Pascal. The staff of the St. Henry School have done their full duty by the children intrusted to their care. The Department have no word of blame or reproach for the work done by the principal or teachers. They have fulfilled their part of the contract entered into by the Department and the mission, and yet the Department refuse to do their share by paying the grant agreed on by both parties, for work done. Even if the principal was guilty of the conduct imputed to him, the Department could not without injustice withhold the salary of the teachers, and the payment of expenses incurred for the feeding and clothing of the Indian children, and without any proofs, on the word of politicians, you, as head of the Indian Department, assume the responsibility of refusing to pay the grant due the St. Henry School for the last six months, depriving thereby the teachers of their salaries and the traders of the payment due them for the supplies bought for the maintenance of the Indian children. For the last 30 years, I have had to deal with the Indian Department, as principal of Indian schools, or as superintendent of our Indian missions in Alberta and part of Saskatchewan, and I have never seen or heard of anything of the kind. I have fought one your predecessors in the office of superintendent\nof Indian Affairs, and I must render this justice to the Honorable Frank Oliver, that although he knew from his men and from me, that I had done my best to defeat him in one of his elections, he had the manliness to acknowledge my right to differ from him, and he never showed that he had the least wish to make my schools suffer for my conduct.\n\nAs regards the accusations made against Father Watelle, I am afraid, Sir, that your good faith has been imposed upon, and that you have given credence to tales concocted by a sorry lot of politicians. As a rule we do not meddle with politics, and it is only when the platform of a party or a candidate makes it an obligation for us to speak, that we say what in conscience we are bound to say. Let the party or candidate respect our rights, and none of us will take part in any election but if a party or candidate publishes that one of their aims is the destruction of our schools, our duty is clear and we cannot run away from it. This was the case in the last election in Saskatchewan, and to this platform, must be attributed the crushing defeat of the conservative party in the province. As to the facts in the present case, Father Watelle has not taken any part in any campaign for or against any party. Once in a meeting of his parishioners about church matters, in answer to a question put to him by one of the members, he said that in view of the programs of the two parties, he thought that our schools had a better chance with the liberal party, but he did not even urge his people to vote for the liberal candidate, leaving them absolutely free to vote as they liked. To say that Father Watelle's conduct has destroyed the harmony in the district, is an absolute untruth, but it would be true to say that, if to satisfy the rancor and malice of a very few men whom I shall not name or qualify otherwise, I were to remove him from his school, then indeed there would be anger and disunion, and the end you have in view would be farther removed than ever before.\nI hope, Sir, that this true explanation will prove satisfactory to you and that you will give orders that the grant too long due the St. Henry's school be paid at once, and that you will not insist on the removal of the principal of said school. I have greatly at heart to keep friendly relations with the Department, but I cannot sacrifice one of my men to the antipathy of defeated politicians who are trying to make you the instrument of their ill-will and disappointment.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Scott, Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAllow me to call your attention to my answer to the letter written to Bishop Pascal, by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, about Father Watelle principal of the St. Henry boarding School of Delmas. I cannot believe that the Department will persevere in the line of conduct indicated by the letter of the Honorable Dr. Roche. If we had to change the principal of our schools on the recommendation of dirty politicians, we would never be able to do anything with those schools. There are many defeated candidates in every election, and if these were allowed to take revenge for their defeat on missionaries who may have displeased them in any way, I would have to make changes every time we had an election. As I see it, this would be the best way to kill our schools, and that is exactly what is wanted by the party or parties making accusations against Father Watelle.\n\nMoreover there is in that case a question of justice which cannot be ignored. The full grant has been earned by the staff of the school, and this full grant must be paid, or else the Department keeps money which does not belong to them. I would hate indeed to make trouble and to start a fight with the Department, but, dear Sir, you understand as well as I do, that I cannot allow one of our schools to be robbed of its due, without taking the means to have such a wrong redressed.\n\nTrusting your love of justice, I will wait for your answer, and I remain,\n\nYours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\nOctober 19th, 1917.\n\nMy dear Father Grandin,\n\nI have your note of the 13th October enclosing copy of your letter to the Hon. the Superintendent General. This is a matter on which I must await instructions. As you have no doubt learned, the Hon. Arthur Meighen is now the Superintendent General, and he has had no time as yet to take up the matters current, but I have no doubt that before long he will be able to do so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

The letter containing the accusations had been sent to His Lordship Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert who forwarded it to me as I am the superior of the accused, Father Natalie, principal of the St. Henry's Indian boarding School at Delmas. Such there is not the least foundation for the accusations made against Father Natalie, and even if he had been imprudent (but I absolutely deny) his imprudence would not justify the Department in its action, by which the staff of the school is unfairly deprived of the grant earned by its members. The annual due to this school by the Dept., must be today, near, if not over $3000, and if such a sum is not, may be, of much importance to you, you may easily understand that an Indian agent cannot bear such a deprivation of its revenue without suffering and making others suffer. Once more I appeal to your sense of justice and I ask you, Sir, to put an end to this persecution against a school which has been doing good work among the Indians of the surrounding reserves. I say not that if the whole story of this misfortune was made known to the public, it would give a very strong and sharp weapon against the present administration. I do not lay to fight the Indian Dept., but I frankly express my firm intention not to allow us to be bullied by unscrupulous politicians. The Rev. Dr. Roche has been made a tool of by these politicians, and I hope and trust that you will not become a party to the unholy and sordid contemplated by them.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir, your obedient servant\nOBLATE FATHERS\nPROVINCIAL HOUSE\n10188 - 107th Street\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nEDMONTON, ALTA., November 16th, 1917\n\nD.

If Father Watelle had acted as his enemies\nsay he did, I would be the first to remove him, because I do not\nwant any of our fathers to mix in politics, but I cannot yield\nto the pressure brought against him by the party who boasted that\nhe would ruin the school and break the priest in charge of it.\n\nIf you believe, dear Sir, that it would be better that I should go\nto Ottawa at once, will you kindly wire me, and I would start at once\nbecause I want to see the end of this trouble. As I said before\nI would not like to start a fight with the Dept., but at the same\ntime I cannot accept the principles involved in this removal of a\nprincipal on the false accusation of a dissappointed politician.\n\nIf by the 20th of this month I have no answer from you or the\ngeneral superintendent I will understand that you refuse to give us\njustice, and then I will know what to do.\n\nYours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, Nov. 15th, 1917.\n\nRev.

Father A. Watelle, the nature of which trouble we do not know exactly, as Father A. Watelle has refused to make us know, \"the matter being under consideration,\" he said; but having heard that the trouble is in connection with us as consequence of reports regarding the conduct of Father A. Watelle in our place during the last provincial election.\n\nWe consider our duty to put a strong protest and to assert by the present:\n\nthat the reports against Rev. Father A. Watelle are false reports, that can only have been made by strangers to the place. It is true that we have been nearly unanimous in voting for the liberal party, but what we have done, we have done freely, and Father A. Watelle has not taken any part in any campaign for or against any party. If we are guilty for having done so, we have to assume the responsibility, and it would be unfair to let another one have trouble for it, as well as it is unfair on the part of the others to look for an excuse to their defeat by false reports.\n\nEvery one at the present time wants union and harmony, but union and harmony cannot exist, if not grounded on justice.\n\nWe know that in the present case the Department has been mistaken, and we hope to have the mistake removed by this respectful representation.\n\nPlease, Sir, give knowledge of this to the Honourable Superintendent General, if necessary.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFrank Bellavance\nAlphonse Douville\nWilfrid Douville\nHenry Adam\nVictor Howard\nNovember 21st, 1917.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Thunderchild's Boarding School and Rev.

I have looked these over carefully and have no hesitation in recommending that his request to increase the number of pupils allowed from 40 to 50 which would not in any way crowd the Building and the extra children are available.\n\nI might add that this School is always kept in perfect repair and order, and conditions are such that it is always a pleasure to assist in any way the Principal or Staff.\n\nTrusting that the Department will see fit to grant Father Watelle's request.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 16, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nMr. Agent McDonald applies on behalf of the Thunderchild boarding school for an increase in their pupilage from 40 to 50. It appears that they have provided five additional rooms for the accommodation of the pupils. If the accommodation is satisfactory I would like to grant this increase and have made special provision in the Estimates for cases of this kind.\n\nAs you are aware we have under consideration provision for the Protestant children of the Thunderchild Reserve. At the present time only two of the Roman Catholic children are in the Thunderchild boarding school. I would like to have it understood that if this increase is granted the children on the Thunderchild Reserve will be given an opportunity of attending.\n\nWill you kindly let me have a report when you have had an opportunity of enquiring regarding the accommodation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

At that time they were adding additional space, but I understood it was for white children, to be conducted under the same management. However, if the additional room you speak of has been added I think that it would be a good idea to grant the additional pupilage. After this had been done I would advise that Agent Macdonald be instructed to make every effort to place the Roman Catholic children that are now on Thunderchild Reserve, where there is no school accommodation, in this school, as suggested by you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.G. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir -\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of October 6th, last, regarding an increase in pupilage at the Thunderchild boarding school. In view of your recommendation which is supported by Mr. Commissioner Graham it has been decided to grant an increase in the number of grant earners from 40 to 50. This increase is, however, made upon the understanding that Roman Catholic children from the new Thunderchild Reserve will be given every consideration. The Department will look to you to see that as many as possible of them up to this number are enrolled. It has been intimated that the purpose of the authorities in making the addition to this school was to provide for a number of white children. It is presumed, however, that in view of the present application that this is not so. Of course the Department would not sanction any such arrangement. This increase will go into effect from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, November 5, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo regarding an increase in the pupilage at the Thunderchild Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it has been decided to grant an increase in the number of grant earners at this school from forty to fifty, such increase to go into effect from the first of the current quarter.\n\nMr. Agent Macdonald is being informed of this increase in pupilage and that it is being made upon the understanding that Roman Catholic children from the new Thunderchild Reserve will be given first consideration and that the Department will look to him to see that as many as possible of them up to this number are enrolled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the request for an increase of forty in the pupilage of the Thunderchild's Boarding School I beg to say that there is no grant provided in the current year's estimates for this increase. As, however, the addition to the building to provide for this number has not yet been begun and will likely take sometime before it is ready, the Department would not be called upon to pay for this extra pupilage for the December quarter next, and, if it is decided to allow the increase, no doubt the funds for the balance of the year could be provided from the appropriation for Indian Education. Next year the increased pupilage could be provided for when the estimates are being prepared.\n\nIt is noted that the Architect's Branch state that the sketch forwarded of the proposed addition to the building will provide the necessary accommodation for forty pupils.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, June 7, 1920.\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Mr. Meighen,\n\nIn December, of last year, Rev. Father Grandin, who has supervision of the Roman Catholic boarding schools in Saskatchewan and Alberta, asked whether, if an addition were built to the Thunderchild's boarding school at Delmas, Sask., the Department would increase the pupilage of the institution. I replied, asking for definite information as to the extent of the proposed enlargement, so that I might know what financial obligation would be involved. I have just received a communication from Father Grandin, submitting a sketch of an addition which would accommodate 40 or more pupils.\n\nThe total population of the Battleford agency is 882, of whom 384 are Roman Catholics. Our last census showed a Roman Catholic school pupilage of 157, with 170 children under six years of age. There is only one day school in operation on the agency, on Poundmaker's reserve. A few years ago the Thunderchild and Moosomin bands, near Battleford, surrendered their reserves, which were sold and they moved a number of miles northward to new reserves. On the new Thunderchild reserve no day school has been established. On the new Moosomin reserve we conducted a day school under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church for about four years, but it was unsuccessful, and was closed two years ago. It will thus be seen that a residential school with a capacity of 90 would hardly be sufficient to provide for the needs of the Roman Catholic children of the agency.\n\nThe present pupilage of this school is 50, with a per capita grant of $145.00. The additional pupilage\nasked for would, therefore, entail an increased annual expenditure of $5,800. We would not be called upon to make any payment before the December quarter, and can arrange for the increase involved from this year's appropriation. Next year, provision for the increase would be made in the Estimates.\n\nI feel that in view of the fact that the Church is willing to undertake the cost of building under existing conditions, and having in mind our proposed compulsory attendance at residential schools, we should accede to Father Grandin's request, and I would submit the matter for your consideration. I have no doubt that they will wish an early decision if they are to proceed with the building this year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 29, 1920.\n\nDear Father Grandin,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 31, last, asking whether this Department will be willing to increase the per capita grant to the Thunderchild's Indian boarding school by 40 pupils, if you build an addition to the present school, in order to accommodate that number.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, after giving the matter full consideration, we will be prepared to support your request, but it would not be possible to begin to pay the increased grant until April 1, 1921.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, October 22, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo informing the Department that Mr. M. B. Edwards has resigned as teacher of the Little Pines Indian Day School, his resignation to take effect from the last day of September, and also enclosing a copy of a report which you received from Mr. Agent Macdonald, in which he advises the closing of this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the Agent's recommendation, which is approved by yourself, this school may remain closed for the present. Your suggestion that the children from this reserve be sent to the Brandon Industrial School will receive consideration.\n\nWith reference to the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve I beg to say that the Department is including in the estimates for submission to parliament at the next session an increase of forty in the pupilage at the Thunderchild's Boarding School, and, if this item is approved, the children of school age on the Poundmaker's Reserve can be placed in the Thunderchild's Boarding School. With the new addition, which is just about ready for occupation, this school will be able to provide adequate accommodation for ninety children and the grant will be increased to that number, but will not be available until April 1st, next. In the meantime the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve is to remain open. I shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Agent Macdonald accordingly.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give the necessary instructions to those concerned for the placing of all the children of school age who are Roman Catholics and in good health in the Thunderchild's Boarding School after the first of April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nExtract from Report of Inspector W. Murison on the Battleford Agency, dated Sept. 16, 1920. Original on 42702L-5.\n\nDELMAS BOARDING SCHOOL (Thunderchilds)\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and is situated on land owned by them in close proximity to the village of Delmas on the Canadian Northern Railway. The building is in three sections 32-36 ft. 3 stories high with full sized basement. It is heated with hot air furnaces. Has running water through the building. Sanitary closets and bath in each dormitory as well as in the basement. Ventilation is provided by two shafts one of which is alongside the furnace chimney. With the new addition which was just about ready for occupation at the time of my visit this school will be able to provide adequate accommodation for at least 90 children. The fire escape is a safe stairway extending from the ground to the upper storey on the outside and access to it is obtained from a door on each flat. This school is provided with modern conveniences with the exception of electric light. The principal informs me that he has in contemplation the purchase of a plant at an early date.\n\nThe Rev. Father A. Watelle is in charge as principal and has as his assistants one lay brother and eleven Sisters of Charity. Attached to the same building and under the same management is a separate school for white children.\n\nW.

You have been made aware that the buildings at this Institution have been largely increased and modernly improved last summer, and that both the Inspector and the Indian Agent have reported very favorably for the increased accommodation. There is now ample accommodation for an additional 30 pupils.\n\nIn a communication addressed by you to our Rev. Fr. H. Grandin, Provincial, now absent in France, you have stated that the increase in the number of pupils would be allowed in March 1921. This is the reason why I take the liberty to bring this matter to your consideration.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nA. Macrossan, O.M.I.\nActing Provincial.\nOttawa, February 10, 1921.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant regarding an increase in the pupilage at the Thunderchild's Boarding School at Delmas, Sask.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that an item is being placed in the estimates for submission to parliament at the coming session for an increase of forty pupils at this school. If this receives the assent of parliament, the grant will be increased to provide for ninety pupils from the first of April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst.

It has been decided to close the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve at the end of the present quarter, namely, June 30th, next. You will be good enough to notify the teacher, Mr. J. M. Seeber, that his services will not be required after that date.\n\nAs you were also informed in the letter above referred to, the Department desires that the children of the Poundmaker's Reserve be placed in the Thunderchild's Boarding School. You will be good enough to notify the principal of this school of the increased pupilage allowed and the Department will expect you to assist the principal in every way possible to recruit for the Thunderchild's Boarding School the children of school age on the Poundmaker's Reserve who are in good health.\n\nApplication forms and certificates of health should be forwarded for all children who are to be admitted to this school.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will give this matter your early attention and inform the parties interested accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

It is stated that the total quantity of milk supplied for the whole institution is about two gallons per day, and that there are only two cows milking, from which the total daily supply is obtained.\n\nAccording to your December quarter return, there was an average attendance of 58.5 Indian children, and it is considered that the above quantity of milk is insufficient for the daily requirements of these children.\n\nMilk forms one of the principal items of diet for children. The Department desires that you will see that each Indian child receives a sufficient quantity of milk each day, and will be pleased to be assured that you have arranged for an ample supply of milk each day for Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier, Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 31 ultimo, drawing my attention to the quantity of milk supplied each day for the use of the Thunderchild Indian Boarding School, and I agree fully to your statement that only two cows milking cannot give a sufficient quantity of milk for the daily requirements of the children.\n\nI beg to say that, even before I got your letter, I have arranged for a better supply of milk, by buying a third cow milking, and a fourth one is expected to give milk very soon.\n\nI even contemplate to keep more cows, but the stable is old and too small, and I cannot afford to build another one at the present time.\n\nLast year, I have enlarged the School for the Indian at the cost of $8000.00 without any help from the Department. For the last eleven years I have been the Principal of the School, I did never ask any extra help out of the grant, but now that I contemplate to build a new stable and a new poultry-house at the cost of $1200.00 I should be very pleased, if helped by the Department for the total sum, or a part of it.\n\nThis year, I did not use up with the grant the full amount of credits voted for the School on last March by the Government, as I did not keep the full number authorised of children; may be the help could be drawn from those credits. Please let me hope to hear of you on that matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours respectfully, A. Waddell, Principal.\nOttawa, February 16, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, informing the Department of the steps taken by you to obtain an adequate milk supply for the pupils of the Thunderchild Boarding School. I am pleased to note that you expect to have four cows milking, which should provide sufficient milk for the daily needs of the Indian children.\n\nRegarding your request for assistance to enable you to erect a new stable and poultry house, I beg to say it is regretted that we are unable to comply with your wishes. I would point out that the Thunderchild school is the property of the Church authorities, and in such cases, where schools are the property of the Church, it is not the policy of the Department to erect buildings or contribute to their cost. In any event, we have no funds available for the purpose mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. A. Watelle,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Boarding School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOttawa, March 19, 1923.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the Thunderchild Indian Boarding School. I have noted that the Rev. Principal requests this Department to erect a stable that will accommodate 10 head.\n\nIn reply I am pleased to state that the present policy of the Government is to provide funds, whenever possible, for capital expense for not only government-owned Indian residential schools, but also for institutions that are owned by the church authorities. If this building activity can be postponed until next year, I shall cause to be placed in our estimates an item in this connection. I am not hopeful that funds can be found this year for this purpose.\n\nThe Thunderchild Indian Boarding School is a combined white and Indian residential home, and only a portion of the expenses at this institution can be met from parliamentary appropriation. I understand, however, that an $8,000 addition was erected last year, and, in view of this heavy expense, I shall be pleased to ask Parliament to provide funds for the erection of a cow stable, next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to a portion of Mr. Inspector Murison's report, in which he states that the Thunderchild Indian Boarding School has ample accommodation for at least 100 Indian pupils. Our Inspector reports that the school authorities are unable to purchase the extra beds and other equipment. I should be pleased if you would communicate with the Rev. Principal, with a view to ascertaining exactly what is needed to provide accommodation for 10 more Indian pupils. You should also report on the classroom and dormitory space available in case these extra pupils were admitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have before me a copy of the annual report submitted by Mr. Agent S. L. Macdonald to the Department on the schools in the Battleford Agency.\n\nI would particularly draw attention to the portion of the report which states that the boys at the Thunderchild Boarding School receive no training in farming. It is altogether wrong that boys should be kept at our Boarding Schools until they are seventeen or eighteen years of age without receiving this training; for, as I have pointed out in previous correspondence, it is in agriculture and stock raising they must depend on for a living when they return to the reserves. I trust that steps will be taken to remedy this state of affairs which exists not only at the above mentioned school, but also at other Boarding Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

I have noted your remarks that the boys of the Thunderchild Indian Boarding School receive no training in farming. I have to draw your attention to the tender years of most of the Indian boys enrolled at this school. However, some instruction and practical work should be given them, and a communication is being addressed to the Rev. Principal in an effort to improve the training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This would allow for 82 children in the Indian part, which in my opinion is all they have room for and that any more would overcrowd it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa\n\nDo not accept more than 82 for time being.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I took up with the Principal of the Thunderchild Boarding school about supplying more milk for the children and he claims that he has no Barn and no funds to build one or buy cows.\n\nThey have four Cows milking and there are in the school 72 Indian Children, 25 white children and a staff of thirteen, making a population of 110, so that the Department can judge about how much milk would get to the Indian Children, what a necessity it is for small children and most of the Indian children are small.\n\nThey should have at least 10 cows and more if possible. I think something should be done to supply more milk and if necessary assistance be given by the Department. I am loth in asking for this assistance on account of the White children boarding there, of course all children would benefit by more milk and in this way the Indians would get more in any case.\n\nI have explained the situation as well as I can and would leave it to the Department to judge what action should be taken, but the two section or two department school in my opinion is not a good feature, though the Sisters take good care of the Indian Children, there is always the feeling that assistance and supplies given do not always go where they should.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 4, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your Numbers 584 and 585-308 of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the accommodation for more pupils at the Thunderhilde Indian Boarding School and to the inadequate supply of milk at the institution.\n\nI have to inform you, in reply, that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that the need for a barn be kept in mind when preparing the Estimates for the fiscal year 1924-25. When more milk is being supplied, it will be possible to arrange for added pupilage. The principal of the school should be directed by you not to recruit more than the present number of children (72) until such time as a stock barn is erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I am surprised at this criticism, for it is understood that school authorities in the Prairie Provinces will engage instructors qualified to give the male pupils training in farming, gardening and the care of stock. Such instruction is highly important for boys at Indian residential schools, and I should be pleased if you would inform me what training has been given in past years and concerning the remedial measures you can undertake in the immediate future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It is true that as to training in farming they have received little, but not less than in the other schools under the management of the Sisters of the Assumption, see: Onion Lake, and Hobbema. Please look at the reports, and you will see that they are all little boys in the school, only three over fifteen, and two of the three are at home for vacation authorized on account of bad health. However, as you wish something to be done, an able man has been engaged and the boys will work with him, as much as their age and their progress in elementary instruction will permit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott, Deputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 28, 1923.\n\nDear Father Watelle:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the training in farming offered to the boys at the Thunderchild's Indian Boarding School.

This work I completed before leaving the Battleford Agency, and the erection of the barn should now be well under way. I did not make a regular inspection of the school, as I intended to return at a later date for that purpose. I, however, went all over the building while there and noted that since my last inspection the school, which was formerly a mixed school for the white as well as the Indian children, has now been all set apart for Indian pupils. The building throughout I found scrupulously clean and tidy. The children presented a happy and healthy appearance.\n\nSince my last inspection a new Principal has been appointed here in the person of the Rev. Father Portier. He appears to be taking an active and intelligent interest in the school and he impressed me as being a man who can be expected to improve conditions.\nconsiderably over what they have been in the past at this school. He tells me that he is anxious to bring the pupilage up to the number for which the buildings will provide accommodation. The church authorities own a half section of land in connection with this school, part of which is used as pasture for their cows and part has been leased for cultivation purposes. Now that they will have stable accommodation for six horses in addition to that provided for 10 cows, I would think that it would be advisable and profitable for them to farm this land in connection with the school themselves. It would provide a means for giving the boys a training in agricultural pursuits.\n\nThe water supply at this school is piped from the Canadian Northern Railway water tank at Delmas and the service is reported as very satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nINFORMATION OFFICE\n\nAt Battleford, Sask.\n\nDec. 17th, 1924\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Department letter No. 105-1-1, Nov 4th, re Pupilage at the Thunderchild Boarding School.\n\nFormerly one wing of the Building was used for white children. This since Rev Fr Portier took charge has been remodeled and the whole school is now used for Indian Children. This additional wing is three storey with an Interior measurement of 45 x 51 feet and this wing is now used exclusively for the Girls and Sisters quarters.\n\nThere are now five Dormitories in the building, Girls Dormitory 45 x 51 x 8 ft high, Boys two Dormitories each 56 x 32, spare Dormitory 32x28 and a small one used in case of Sickness 28 x 28.\n\nWith the addition of this new wing, over one third is added to the size of the school and there is now easily accommodation for 120 pupils, running water installations were put all through this wing during the summer.\n\nWith regard to Cows, they have at present six cows with four milking, the Principal has asked for eight more, so as to have an average of 8 or 10 milking all the time and I would recommend that the Department supply these cows, good grade Milk strain. Cows are what is required and should be purchased at about $75.00 a piece, subject to T.B. Test.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 13, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 375-308 of the 17th ultimo, in which you give the size of the dormitories at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The question of increasing the pupilage at this institution has been given careful consideration by the officers of the Department. I have to inform you that favourable consideration will be given when the management of the school farms the half section which it owns, provides training to the older boys in agricultural pursuits and when ten milch cows are supplied at the school. When these conditions have been complied with, I should be pleased if you would report to Mr. Commissioner Graham, who is receiving a copy of this communication.\n\nI have examined the figures of your letter and I find that the school has accommodation in the four regular dormitories for 108 pupils if the ceilings in each case are 8 ft.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, January 13, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of official letter to Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald, relative to the increasing of the pupilage at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would inform the Department when you receive word from either the school management or Mr. Macdonald, concerning the complying with the conditions laid down in my letter. Your recommendation should be attached. The enrolment at the school for the September quarter was 98 and the average attendance, 87; but the Department allowed grant for only 82, which has been the pupilage at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nFebruary 12, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nFor some years, a pupilage of 90 was allowed at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. This fact was known to the Rev. Principal and the Indian Agent. In November, last, the Department learned the exact size of the dormitories in the Indian wing of the building and the pupilage was placed at 82 and the Agent so informed.\n\nIt appears that the Rev. Principal has been able of late months to recruit a considerable number of Indian children, and in order to have accommodation for them, he discontinued white work and released the entire building (accommodation 108) for Indian pupils. The Department learned of this change in programme, after we had notified the Agent of the pupilage of 82. The Principal in the meantime had recruited sufficient children to give him an earning capacity in the September quarter of '87. However, grant for 82 was all that was paid.\n\nYou will remember that, when the formal application for a pupilage of 108 came before the Department, it was decided to request the school authorities to undertake farming instruction and comply with other requests, before giving favourable consideration.\n\nI wish to recommend, in view of the misunderstanding, that a pupilage of 90, and not 82, be allowed until such time as the management complies with the request of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 13, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to my letter of this file number of November 4th, last, in which the pupilage of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School was placed at 82. The Church authorities have explained that there has been a misunderstanding in this connection, and I have now to inform you that a pupilage of 90 will be allowed, until such time as the school authorities comply with the requests in official letter of this file number of the 13th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, February 13, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has decided to allow a pupilage of 90 at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, until such time as the management provide instruction in farming and arrange for a suitable supply of milk. This action is being taken following your information of a misunderstanding on the part of the Rev. Principal as to the amount of his pupilage. The Indian agent is being informed. Supplementary payments for September and December quarters will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 24, 1925.\n\nSIR,\n\nThe question of increasing the pupilage at the Thunderchild Residential School so as to provide grant for 120 pupils has again been brought to the Department's attention.\n\nIt is understood that the entire building is now available for Indian children, as the school management has discontinued the work it formerly did for white children. As a result there is now sufficient accommodation in the building for 120 Indian children, whom it is stated can be easily secured.\n\nIt would appear advisable to provide for this number in order that this school may extend its usefulness to the maximum of its accommodation. I would be pleased to have a recommendation from you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, SASK.\nIn your letter of January 13th you asked Mr. Macdonald to report to me on these matters. This he has not done, nor have I received any communication from him on the subject. If these matters had been taken up direct with this office, as I think they ought to have been, you would have had this report by now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., OCT. 1st, 1925\n\nSIR:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, #105-1-1 with reference to increasing the pupilage at the Thunderchild Residential School so as to provide a grant for 120 pupils. I note that the suggested increase in pupilage is considerably more than the number mentioned in your letter to Agent Macdonald of the 13th January last, the number at that time being 108.\n\nI wish to remind you that farming operations have not yet commenced at this institution, and the elder boys therefore could not have received proper agricultural training. Mr. Murison was at this institution in May last and no farming had been commenced, in fact, the land set aside for the school is under lease. The farming at this school and the instruction to the elder boys was to be undertaken before an increase in pupilage was to have been allowed. Do I understand the Department has waived these conditions?\n\nIn your\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1925.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your 302-11B of the 1st instant relative to increasing the pupilage at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The Department has not waived the conditions mentioned in earlier communications without securing your recommendation. My letter of the 24th ultimo was to draw to your attention that the white work had been discontinued by the management of this school and that accommodation was now available for an increased number of Indian children. It is the Department's wish that this type of institution be filled to capacity so that the maximum amount of educational work among our wards will be effected.\n\nMy thought was that you and Mr. Indian Agent Macdonald might co-operate with the management and by either suggestions or the supplying of equipment or both make it possible for the Rev. Principal to comply with our conditions and thus in due course enroll a maximum number of children.\n\nPlease view the matter in this light and after correspondence with the management and the Indian Agent make a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner, Acting Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your 105-1-1 of the 7th instant relative to increasing the pupilage at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. I would refer you back to your letter on this subject dated January 13, 1925 with which you enclosed a copy of an official letter sent by the Department to Mr. Indian Agent, McDonald, relative to this subject, which you asked him to reply to me. So far I have not received a report from Mr. McDonald and have today written him informing him that the increase in pupilage at the Thunderchild Residential School will be conditional on the Principal operating his farm land under the supervision of the School management, so as to provide means of giving the boys a training in farm work. I have asked the Agent to take this matter up with the Principal and to submit a full report to me without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the Estimates for the Battleford Agency for the fiscal year 1926-27, in which an increased grant to provide for the accommodation of 120 pupils at the Thunderchild Residential School is asked for, I beg to inform you that I have received a letter from Mr. MacDonald with regard to the question of operating a farm at the school which he says he has discussed the matter with the Principal and that the Principal agrees that a farm should be operated but has no means of financing it. I have again written Mr. MacDonald to see the Principal and to submit to me a full report setting forth what will be required in the shape of equipment and also ask the Principal if he is prepared to take the quarter section of cultivated land which they have now rented and operate it in connection with the school so as to provide means for the boys to obtain a training in farming. I have been unable to get very much information from Mr. MacDonald but will not let the matter rest now until I am fully satisfied as to what is required and what is the best thing to do in connection with the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Rev. Sisters in charge of the school had originally built the school for the use of white and Indian children. Acting upon repeated requests from Ottawa the Sisters decided to dismiss the white pupils and to make alterations to suit the Indian children. Over $7000.00 were spent last year, the school authorities not doubting a moment that the place of the white children would be taken by the Indians.\n\nThe pupilage was increased from 76 to 90 but with space large enough to accommodate 120 children and after having sacrificed the revenue coming from the white children, the Sisters are refused the increase in pupilage to which they are entitled.\n\nThe reasons set forth for such refusal were: 1. Lack of milk for all the children. This objection does not exist any more as the Department has provided the school with the necessary number of cows;\n\n2. Lack of farming facilities. That is the principal objection. I regret to note that it is given so much importance and thereby deprive the school of proper revenue and many children of educational advantages. The school authorities are not adverse to developing any farming activity but lacking a suitable farm believe that the Department should supply same.\n\nAnd then of what weight is that objection in the face of the fact that the school authorities can clothe, board, educate and give proper training to the children confined to their care? Moreover, as the children in Thunderchild are rather young, farming operations would have at least for a time, to be carried on by hired men.\n\nI could suggest that until such time as proper development of farming activities is assured at Thunderchild, the grown up boys of the latter be sent to Duck Lake to train more actively in farming. The Principals of both schools are most willing to cooperate along the lines of that plan at least for a certain time.\nThe Department is aware that in the reserves adjoining Thunderchild School there are more than the number of children necessary to fill it to its capacity.\n\nI therefore leave the whole matter to your judicious consideration with the hope of a favourable decision.\n\nJoseph [signature]\nOttawa, Canada, October 30, 1925\n\nThe Principal Rev. Fr. J. Perrier, O.M.I., has submitted a list of his requirements as follows:\n\n1. \"It is necessary without any more delay to paint snow the buildings (a surface of 2800 square yards).\n\n2. To keep meat and other food during the summer months, we have a cool place, but a ice-house would be better to keep everything in good condition.\n\n3. We have water service in every part of the house, but once in a while for varied reason the water is not carried to the school during a week or two at different times, and it would insure the safety of the building and of its inhabitants as well as provide for the ordinary needs if we could install two tanks as to keep a reserve of water in case of emergency.\n\n4. We should also think of improving the system of lighting. I suppose electricity is better and safer than the Ker/Sene and Gasoline lamps that we have at present.\n\n5. The laundry department certainly needs some improvements; we have only a few cotton washing machine and nearly all in bad shape.\"\n\nI have found out by myself that the above requests are more than reasonable and I deem that favourable consideration should be given to them.\n\nINCREASE IN PUPILAGE.\n\nDifficulties have arisen with regard to an increase in pupilage at Thunderchild Residential School and I would kindly beg that the following remarks be weighed and a decision given.\nOttawa, Canada, December 21, 1925\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI take the liberty to urge consideration of a request made on October 30th, in connection with an increase of pupilage at Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nI need not repeat the reasons set forth in that request but I must distinctly say that I am quite sorry at the stand taken by Mr. Graham in this matter. The Provincial, Rev. Fr. Blanchin and the Principal, Rev. Fr. Fortier, wish to express the same sentiments through my intermediary. It is certainly a very extraordinary attitude under the circumstances. I leave the whole matter to your personal investigation and judgment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph [Name]\nOttawa, January 7, 1926.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, concerning the request for an increased pupilage at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.

I am writing to the Church authorities regarding the Rev. Principal being absent without advising the Department.\n\nThis institution is now solely for Indian children and I feel that we should give them some help in connection with their farming operations and also increase the pupilage. As from the first of the calendar year, grant for 110 children will be allowed. And, as from the beginning of September, next, if the lease on the school property has been cancelled, if 100 acres are under cultivation and a suitable instructor has been added to the staff, a pupilage of 120 will be allowed. I am so informing the Church authorities, the Rev. Principal and the Indian Agent. Under separate cover will be forwarded authority to you to supply the school with certain agricultural implements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nExtract from Report of Inspector Hurison on the Thunderchild's Residential School - dated March 23rd, 1926.\n\nThis school is situated at Delmas, on the Canadian National Railways. I visited this school on March the 15th and when there enquired into the question of land available for cultivation. Apart from the land occupied by the buildings and school grounds, there is 40 acres under cultivation and about 100 acres of prairie, part of which is bluffy and river banks. In all about 90 acres could be cultivated but if they break up any more land they will not have enough pasturage for their cows and there is no land in the vicinity which they can procure.\n\nThe school is situated in a prosperous settlement where land values are high and to add to their holdings would entail a large expenditure. They have 13 milch cows for which they purchase winter feed as they have no hay lands.\n\nThe question of operating a farm at this school has been under consideration and I am submitting the foregoing information in order that you may be in possession of a knowledge of the situation as regards the land available.\n\nThere is stabling accommodation for their cows and if they are provided with work horses further stabling will be required.\n\nThe main building requires repainting and I noticed that the floors in two rooms will have to be renewed shortly.\n\nIn a letter dated April 13th, 1926, Commissioner Graham makes the following remarks regarding the above report:\n\nWith regard to the Inspector's remarks about farming operations at the Thunderchild Boarding School. It seems to me that there is a problem here to face. 90 acres will not by any means provide pasturage and sufficient land for a farm. If we pasture 20 head of cattle there it will take almost the 90 acres, to say nothing about grain growing land. Would the Department be disposed to buy some land? It appears to me that the school will never be a success if they have to purchase all the winter feed for their cattle. They cannot afford to do it. The report on the school is very satisfactory. Does this school building belong to the Department, and is the matter of re-painting it an obligation of the Government?\nRegina, Sask.,\nMarch 30th, 1927.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Battleford Agency.\n\nTHUNDERCHILD'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI notice that the school now have cows of their own, but there is not sufficient land under cultivation here and our boys are not getting a training that will fit them to go home to raise stock and grow crops for themselves. The Department authorized the purchase of farm equipment and horses, providing they would arrange to get additional land under cultivation, but the school have not complied with this request, and nothing has been done to supply horses and equipment, nor should anything be done until there is land to carry on the work.\n\nSgd. W. M. Graham.\nOttawa, April 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 30th ultimo, reporting on the various schools in the Battleford agency, which has reference to the Thunderchild's institution. I am going to discuss this whole question again with the church authorities, with a view to proper training for the boys of this school. The Department will provide the necessary horses and farm equipment, if the school authorities will arrange for more land to be placed under cultivation and for a course in farming instruction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nANNUAL SCHOOL REPORT.\n\nBy S. L. Macdonald, Indian Agent.\n\nSIR:\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith the Annual school report for the Battleford Agency, for the year ending March 31st 1928.\n\nThere are four schools operating in this Agency, the Thunderchild Residential School and Day Schools at Red Pheasant, Little Pines and Thunderchild reserves, with an attendance of approximately 190 children.\n\nTHUNDERCHILD RESIDENTIAL.\n\nThis school is at Delmas on the Main line of the Canadian National Railway and about 15 miles west of Battleford. It is owned and run under the auspices of The Roman Catholic Church, the Principal at present is the Rev Jos Angin O.M.I., who is the most capable Principal we have had there yet; he is assisted by from 12 to 16 Sisters. The Superior, three teaching Sisters, one Nurse and the others take charge of the various duties of the building.\n\nThis school has authority for 120 pupils, with 111 attending at the present time.\n\nThe old main building is 2 stories and has two three storey wings on the north and south of it; the building is all frame construction and has full basement under it, is heated by six hot air furnaces distributed through the basement.\n\nThe Water supply is from the Canadian National railway tank by gravitation; it is now modern with running water all through the building and the Lighting plant installed by the Department during the year has reduced the fire danger by half and a big saving in work for the Sisters. At the present time a reserve pressure tank system is being installed to tide over occasional shut off of the water supply and this will be a further fire protection.\n\nThe building itself is more or less run down, the floors are worn through in many places and all is badly in need of paint.\n\nThis school does no farming but have about 14 cows for milk supply for the school and the big boys and girls are all taught some dairying.\n\nThe health of the children is usually very good; there were two deaths from the school during the year, one from Paritonitis and the other from Heart failure, otherwise the children have been fine and the progress at the school has been very good.\n\nA school garden of about two acres is maintained but does not nearly supply the needs of the school so much of the produce required is purchased from farmers in the district near the school.\nMarch 14th 1929.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan SCOTT,\nDeputy Supt. Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI decided to undertake a journey to France, my mother-country, from April 9th to the end of August.\n\nDuring my absence, I think that the school would be very well managed by Sister Saint-Simon, Superior of the Sisters of the school.\n\nI hope, dear Sir, that this will meet your approval: that Sister Saint-Simon be acting-principal during my absence.\n\nKindly receive, dear Sir, with my thanks, my best regards,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nprincipal,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOttawa, March 20, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, informing the Department that it is your intention to be absent from duty as Principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School from April 9th, next, to the end of August, following, and recommending that Sister St. Simon, Superior of the Sisters of the School, be Acting Principal during your absence. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of this arrangement.

Angin, O.M.I., Principal of the Thunderchild Residential School, is taking leave of absence from April 9th, next, to the end of August, as he intends to visit his mother country, France. During the absence of Father Angin, Sister St. Simon, Superior of the Sisters of the School, will act as Principal. The Department has approved of this arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF W. M. GRAHAM, INDIAN COMMISSIONER, REGINA, SASK., DATED APRIL 15TH, 1929, enclosing Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Battleford Agency. Original on File 105-1-5.\n\nI would again draw your attention to the fact that no farming operations are carried on at this school, and I think it is a great mistake paying this money out for the education of Indians and not teaching them anything about farming. The boys should be discharged from the school after they are fourteen years of age if we are not going to have any farm training there, and I would advise the Department to insist either on the establishment of a farm or the discharge of the boys at this age.\nMay 11, 1929.\n\nDear Father Boys:\n\nIt has been drawn to my attention that practically no farming operations are carried on at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The graduates of this institution return to reserves where farming is the chief means of livelihood, and I am surprised to learn that the older boys are not being better equipped for their future. A few years ago, the Department had some correspondence with Rev. Father Guy in this connection. A barn was erected and a few milch cows purchased. Further, Mr. Commissioner Graham was authorized to provide the school with one or two teams of horses and some agricultural implements if farming was undertaken in earnest and a suitable instructor engaged.\n\nI should be grateful if you will make arrangements to commence instruction in farming at this school this spring. You should instruct the Reverend Principal to write to the Department when it is timely to supply the horses and implements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Boys, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n10,188 - 107th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, May 22, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the Thunderehild Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Principal,\nThunderehild Indian Res. School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, Ref. No. 105-1-1, with regards the starting of Farm operations on the Thunderchild Indian Residential School.\n\nI also greatly deplore the absence of training in Farm work in such a School. A few years ago I called Rev. Fisher's attention to this particular subject, and about two years ago, at my last visit to Ottawa, I also mentioned this matter to Mr. Ferrier, and asked him to see what could be done in that respect. Moreover, last year I instructed the Principal of the School to write to you in this regard.\n\nThe first step to be taken would be the purchase of some land. At the present the School has only about ten Acres, most of which is taken up by the buildings and play-grounds, the balance being mainly reserved for the vegetable gardens and tree-plantations.\n\nTherefore, if besides the feeding and the caring of the few milch cows, Farm operations should be undertaken, the Department should secure sufficient land around the School so that Farm training might be given to the older boys.\n\nI remain, Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nJune 8, 1929.\n\nDear Father Boys:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of the 20th ultimo, concerning farm operations at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. This is the first intimation, concerning the need for more land, that the Department has received. In 1924, Mr. Inspector Murison reported that the church owned a half section in connection with this school, and, later, Mr. Graham wrote that 60 acres of the mission property was under cultivation, that 40 more could be tilled and that there was sufficient left for pasture. The Commissioner also stated that this land had been leased but it could be taken over by the school at any time. In January, 1926, the Department wrote Father Guy, concerning the assistance which would be given the school, if the Oblate Fathers would cancel the lease, engage a suitable farm instructor and cultivate 100 acres. Before your application can be considered, I should like to learn what disposition has been made of the farm referred to.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Boys, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\nHonorable Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th instant, I beg to say that, to our knowledge, no farm operations of any extent have been done at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, outside of a few acres of garden and potatoes.\n\nThe School buildings and play-grounds take up some ten acres or thereabout. There is a cow-pasture for the use of the institution.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers own also a Fraction of a Quarter Section adjoining the School site, comprising about 115 Acres, not cultivated, which has been leased to a neighboring farmer, from year to year, and on which we pay Municipal Taxes.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.B. Beys, O.M.I.\nProvincial.\n\nper A. Haussen, O.M.I.\nProv.Ec.\nJune 28, 1929.\n\nDear Father Boys:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to farming operations at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. Could not you arrange to cancel the lease on the Oblate Fathers' farm and use the property for school purposes? It seems to me that this is the natural thing to do. Your Order owns both the Institution and the farm which adjoins, and the older boys should certainly receive a good training in farming.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Boys, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDelmas, Sask.,\nJune 24th, 1929.\n\nHonorable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Chief, General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nWe have just learned through the Rev. Father Beys, Provincial of the Oblate Fathers that he had received a recent communication from the Department in which it was stated that the Inspector had advised them that everything was ready for the opening of a farm at the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nThe stating of this readiness of affairs rather astonishes us inasmuch as at Mr. Morrison's last visit in February this question was not at all discussed. He only emphasized the fact that we needed a new barn as the one we have, having been improperly built, is now only suitable to be used as a hen-coop. The latter being urgently needed.\n\nSo far as farming is concerned I beg to openly express my opinion. I am strongly opposed to it for the following reasons:\n\n1st.- We actually have but a tract of land sufficient for the cultivation of potatoes for our own supply, and pasture-land barely large enough for our cattle.\n\n2nd.- We have but a few large boys who are able to work and it is expected that they shall not return after the holidays.\n\n3rd.- The parents have said in the past: \"We do not place our children at school to have them work and if they are to make use of them for this purpose we will withdraw them. They might as well work for us as for the school officials.\"\n\n4th.- We would be compelled to hire outside help and be continually handicapped about the means of raising funds to pay the required salary especially when the crops have failed.\n\n5th.- It is difficult to find competent and trustworthy hired men who will take the interest they ought without being supervised by one of the authorities, and you will readily agree with me that few men will submit to female authority. They act more as proprietors than as caretakers and if one tries to uphold his rights they will feel slighted and not remain in service; thus it is a perpetual change of employees. Furthermore, I do not believe it befits the dignity of a religious to manage a farm.\n\n6th.- We have but one school where this farming business has been introduced, and we are convinced, after having interviewed the staff, that it is a source of all sorts of troubles from which we hope to be exempted.\n\nWe do sincerely hope that you will not make this compulsory, as actually, state of affairs at our school is very good and this opening of a farm would but bring on trouble.\n\nIt is not our intention to act contrarily to your wishes but trust you will kindly take the matter into consideration and make known to us your decision which will be that this question has been settled by your agreement with us. This is the reply we anticipate and thank you for same.\n\nTrusting that the frank way in which I have expressed my opinion will not cause our mutual good relations to cease to exist, and with apologies for same I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Principal.\nHonorable Sir,\n\nRev. Father Beys, Provincial, requests me to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June the 28th, with reference to farming operations at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. And in reply wishes to say that the Oblate Fathers can easily arrange to cancel the lease of the land which had been let to a neighboring farmer for grazing purposes only. But you are aware that in this School, the Rev. Sisters have practically the administration and the running of the Institution; they have been frequently told about the wishes of the Department with regards the training of the older boys in farming; but they seem to have objections towards complying with these instructions in that respect. We are convinced however that should the Department put before the Sisters the necessity of having a farm for the better education of the Indian children the Rev. Sisters shall comply with the wishes of the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Racossen, O.M.I.\nSeptember 4, 1929.\n\nDear Sister Saint Simon:\n\nI wish to refer to earlier correspondence and particularly to your letter of June 24th, with reference to a training in farming for the older boys at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. I have now learned that the Oblate Fathers can easily arrange to cancel the lease on the land which they hold at the school, and I write to inform you that it is the Department's wish that this activity be commenced. At all Indian residential schools, the most important part of the boys' training is along vocational lines. In the Prairie Provinces, instruction must be given in farming, gardening and the care of stock. There may be difficulties in the way, but these can be surmounted, and I know that you and the Reverend Principal will arrange this important work next spring. You will find that a well run farm will not be a financial burden, as the produce raised will more than meet the expenses of the farming instructor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Sister Saint Simon,\nActing Principal,\nThunderchild Residential School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nSeptember 4, 1929.\n\nDear Father Boys:\n\nI have received Father Naessens' recent letter, with reference to instruction in farming for the boys at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. I am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my letter of today's date to the Acting Principal. Will you please give the necessary instructions to Father Angin when he returns. The Department will assist in the purchase of work horses and agricultural implements.\n\nEnc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Boys, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to notify you that I came back to the Thunderchild Residential School, and that I resume the functions of Principal of the above-said School, if you have no impediment to it.\n\nKindly accept, dear Sir, my best compliments,\n\nRev. Jos. Anglin,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 8, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, informing the Department that you have resumed duties as principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to learn that you have returned to your duties, and I am very hopeful that certain improvements concerning which we have been in correspondence with Very Rev. Father Beys will be effected at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nThunderchild Indian Res. School,\nDelmas, Sask.\nThunderchild Residential School,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nDelmas, Oct. 14th 1929.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference with your letter No 105-1-1 of Oct. 8th 1929, concerning the instalment of a farm at the Thunderchild Res. School, I beg to state that, after reading your letter No. 105-1-1 of Sept. 4th 1929, I was ready to undertake this farm, not with pleasure, but only to obey the orders of the Indian Department. I had even prepared an estimate of the farming implements to be supplied by the Department, when Father Beys, who came at Delmas lately, Oct. 8th 1929, advised me that I had nothing to do with the farm, this work should be exclusively undertaken by the Sisters without any cooperation of the Principal. In fact, this decision astonished me, but I am obliged to consider it nearly as an order, therefore you will, please, refer to Rev. Father Beys for further arrangement in this connection.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOctober 19, 1929.\n\nDear Father Beys:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 4th ultimo, with enclosure, concerning farming for the older boys at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. Father Angin writes that this activity will be undertaken by the Sisters and that he understands he has no responsibility in the matter. This is rather surprising, as it is the principal who should be responsible for the training of the boys. Further, even if the Sisters at the school were to finance the scheme, with the help of the Department, the principal of the institution should have control.\n\nThere has now been considerable correspondence with reference to this important matter, and there have been no results as yet. Any Indian residential school in the prairie provinces that is not prepared to give instruction in farming to the older boys cannot remain a factor in our educational programme, and you may so inform those interested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Beys, O. M. I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th inst. re. the establishment of a farm in the Thunderchild School.\n\nYou are undoubtedly aware of a double difficulty we have to cope with in the present case:\n\n1st. By special arrangement of our bishops, in the early days the Sisters had the full management of the schools. Little by little this has been changed in most schools but still prevails in the schools of Delmas, Onion Lake and Robbema. I am writing immediately however, trying to remedy the situation.\n\n2nd. The other difficulty is a financial one. In other schools, as in the Blood and Piegan reserves, the Department has provided for the most essential requisites to run the farm; but to make of it a real success, we have been obliged to provide ourselves very important items, such as tractor, wheat separator, crushers for grain and even buildings for married employees. We are not in a position to make such expenses at the present time, should similar needs be felt in the running of a farm at the Thunderchild school.\n\nWe shall however do our utmost to overcome even this second difficulty and follow the instructions of the Department in regard to the running of an educational farm.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.B. Beys\nProvincial Secretary\nOctober 31, 1929.\n\nDear Father Boys:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, and I note with satisfaction that you are prepared to overcome the difficulties attendant upon instruction in farming to the elder boys at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. Perhaps you will find that it is not necessary for the school to own such expensive equipment as a tractor and a threshing outfit. As far as the usual equipment is concerned, you will remember that I wrote on May 11th, last, stating the Department was prepared to provide the school with one or two teams of horses and some agricultural implements, if farming was undertaken in earnest and a suitable instructor engaged. Please instruct the Reverend Principal to inform the Department concerning the new arrangements, and ask him to indicate when the Department's help would be timely.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Boys, O. M. I.\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton,\nAlta.\nOttawa, November 19, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 11th instant, concerning farming activity next year at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. When our Estimates are being prepared, your need of a barn, work horses and agricultural implements will not be overlooked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I am pleased to approve of the appointment of the Rev. Joseph Angin, O. M. I., as principal of the Blue Quills School and the appointment of Rev. D. Dubois, O. M. I., as principal of the Thunderchild School. I am informing our local representatives.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O. M.

Father Jos. Angin, O. M. I., as principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, to succeed Rev. Father LeGeff, O. M. I., also of the appointment of Rev. D. Dubois, O. M.

I., as principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, to succeed Rev. Father Angin.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nDo you think that arrangements could be made with the Department to grant the children two months summer holidays, say, from June 27th. to August 27th.?\n\nIn compensation, all would be willing to do away with the two weeks' holidays at Christmas, and the one week at Easter, as granted by the Register.\n\nI really think that this arrangement would be of a greater benefit to both children and staff, and you will readily understand it. The children being compelled to remain here at Christmas, do not enjoy their vacation, the cold being too intense for much outdoor sports. They therefore long to break the monotonous routine of indoor life, they long to go back to class work. As to the staff, vacations are hardly profitable with the children in the house. Whether in class or in holiday, they require the same constant care.\n\nBesides, the legal holidays that fall at both seasons, would be sufficient rest from their intellectual work.\n\nMoreover, very few of the children are exact in making their entry at Mid-August, the majority of them come back only in September, modelling themselves on the Public School children.\n\nYou may be certain that if such arrangements could be made both staff and children would be very grateful to the Department.\n\nGratefully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nS. L. Macdonald Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith, letter from the principal of the Thunderchild school, asking to have the summer holidays longer and the Winter holidays done away with.\n\nPersonally, I agree with his idea, at present most of the children are taken home for short periods, come back half perished and usually dirty and derive no benefit from it, many do not return when they should and much time and effort is wasted rounding them up.\n\nIf it is not against regulations, I would recommend that his request be granted, it would be a benefit to both the staff and the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 855-308 of the 23rd instant, with enclosure, with reference to holidays at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. You may inform Father Dubois that the Department does not authorize holidays at residential schools, except for 43 days in the summer. In the enclosure, reference was made to the regulations on the inside cover of the classroom register; but these are for day schools only. I am enclosing, for your information and for that of the Rev. Principal, copies of the circular letter which has reference to holidays at Indian residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nOttawa, August 27th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, requesting that a number of beds, mattresses and pillows be supplied. In this connection, I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide this equipment.\n\nIt is noted from the Principal's letter that he wishes to take a number of young children into the school, some of whom are half-breeds. In this connection, I would point out that the grant allowed at this school is for 120 pupils only. The June quarter return showed an enrolment of 121 pupils, with an average attendance of 117. The Department cannot approve of the admission of half-breed children or of Indian children under the age limit, unless, in the latter case, there are exceptional circumstances. As the school is allowed to have one extra child enrolled for every twenty grant-earning pupils, the total number enrolled at this school should not exceed 126 pupils at any one time and no recruiting in excess of that number should be undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo in regard to the new R.C. Boarding School near Thunderchild's Reserve, and to enclose the specifications, original and translation, a plan of the building and a photograph of same. I have been unable to procure receipts for the material and labour. As the Mechanic's Lien Ordinance of the N.W.T. Cap.59,a.3., is rather strict there might be some danger in handing over the cheque as, if the material and labour have not been paid for, the persons concerned have a lien on the building. However the building has been handed over by the Contractor (see Indian Agent's letter enclosed) and probably there will be no trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nBattleford Agency.\n\nAug. 17th, 1901.\n\nRef: Letter Aug. 7, 1901, No. 122/65.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state that on receipt of your above quoted letter I immediately communicated your instructions to Mr. Pomerleau, who is now in Edmonton, and enclose herewith his reply.\n\nI may say that Mr. Pomerleau erected and completed this building in a very satisfactory manner and handed it over for School use some time ago.\n\nThe material and workmanship are first class in every particular. I have requested the Rev. Principal to forward the plan and specifications to you, and I expect you will receive them by the following mail.\n\nI have twice been over this school, but will if you wish make another special visit and report on the subject.\n\nI am certifying to the vouchers and returning them herewith, and I trust that they will be favourably recommended by you for payment, as Mr. Pomerleau has faithfully carried out his part of the contract, and as he said, before leaving for Edmonton, he is not a rich man, and the delay in receiving payment for his contract has put him in a very serious and awkward position.\n\nI have the honour, &c.\n\n(Sgd) J.P.G.

In the meantime, we would be exceedingly pleased to receive a copy of the photograph of Mrs. Scott and yourself taken when you were here. Delightful reminiscences of this pleasant visit are engraved in the minds of those who were here at that time, but for those less fortunate who had not the pleasure of making your acquaintance, with the knowledge of your qualifications which we have already imparted to them it would enable them to know better the generous benefactor to whom they, as well as we, are so greatly indebted.\n\nThanking you again for the cheque and for your unforgettable favors of last August, the long list of which is headed by: \"Your delightful visit\", we remain\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nThe Sisters of the Assumption of the B.

J.

In this connection I have to say that the communication which you stated you were enclosing from the Acting Superior did not accompany your letter.\n\nYou may place an order for the supplying of 4 rear seats and 2 single desks of the necessary sizes. It is noted that \"Globe\" desks are required and the Western agents for these desks are F. E. Osborne, Calgary, Alta., and The Western Seating Co., 179 Bannatyne Ave. East, Winnipeg, Man. It would be advisable to communicate with one or other of these firms and obtain their prices F. O. B. nearest shipping point to the school. You should obtain an account, in duplicate, and, when the desks are received, if in good condition, you should certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nRelative to the piece of cotton wood for poster board for the classroom, I beg to say that you may also arrange for the purchase and delivery of this equipment. A properly certified account, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L.

It had been estimated at $750.00 but when it was done the expense ran up to $900. I am aware that the Department had not agreed to give more than $750 towards this work and do not expect that they will; however, I am confident enough to make appeal to them again in this instance, and if, after kindly taking the matter into consideration, a sympathetic turn is taken towards us and the balance covered by them we shall be very thankful.\n\nWith hearty thanks for the recent favor of the extension of the class-room and porch for convalescents as well as for all past favors received from the Department, I remain\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSister St. Simon\n\nActing Principal.\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the cost of enlarging the classroom and making a balcony at the Thunderchild's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that when the accounts covering the cost of this work have been received from Mr. Commissioner Graham consideration will then be given to payment of any amount in excess of the $750 which was authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J. Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nESTIMATE of a Laundry Equipment to be installed at the Thunderchild Residential School during the year 1930, if agreed by the Department:\n\n1) One Canadian Globe Wood Washer with 30/48\" inner cylinder,\n   Price complete - - $ 1008.00\n\n2) One Canadian Sand-Cloth Extractor, with 30\" inner basket,\n   Price complete - - $ 442.40\n\n3) One Canadian \"S\" Ironer, 56\" Roll, individual Motor driven\n   and electrically heated shoe,\n   Price complete - - $ 800.00\n\nTotal: $ 2250.40\n\nIt would be desired that all those machines be driven by the same strong motor, the same being required also to generate the electric light for the school. The small motor, 1 1/2 H.P., actually generating the electric light and supplied by the Department in 1927 is nearly worn out, being operated 4 hours a day, and only for electric light. Till now, the repairs needed have cost more than its price, and we have had no satisfaction with it.\n\nA special estimate of barn and farming implements will be sent later, when all arrangements have been made with Rev. Father Beys.\n\nThe Principal,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nOct. 28th 1929.\nOttawa, November 19, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nA request of the Rev. Principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, that he be supplied with laundry machinery, etc., has been received by the Department. I am not sure that funds can be provided next year for this purpose, as the Department contemplates heavy expenditure at this institution in connection with the commencing of farming training. It is proposed to ask Parliament for funds for a new barn, for some work horses and for agricultural implements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nI visited this school on the forenoon of the 8th instant, and inspected the building throughout.\n\nI visited\n\nTHUNDERCHILD R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nI visited the three classrooms and noted that the children presented a clean and healthy appearance. There were 80 pupils present out of an enrolment of 97. A number of the pupils from the outlying reserves had not returned since the holidays. A few were permitted to be absent to assist their parents at hay making, but I directed the Agent to take steps to have the absentees returned to the school without delay.\n\nThe building presented a very clean and tidy appearance inside and out.\n\nThe Sisters directed my attention to the lack of laundry equipment. They have not been provided with a power washing machine extractor or dryer. Should the Department see fit to provide this equipment, it will be necessary to also provide a larger engine. They have at present a Delco lighting plant which they claim is not strong enough for the load that is necessary to light this large school.\n\nI was also informed that it is the intention to commence operating a farm in connection with the school next year. This will mean that an enlargement of their stabling accommodation will be necessary.\n\nA large garden was planted last year, but they got very little return from it. Only 312 bushels of potatoes, and they are now purchasing the roots and vegetables necessary for their requirements.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Battleford Agency.\n\nPersonally, I do not think it would be wise to send the boy, Adam Cuthand to a place where he would receive a higher education, with a view of his taking up missionary work. Our experience in the past has been that the educating of Indians for missionary work did not prove very successful.\n\nYou will note that the Sisters at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School are asking for additional laundry equipment. This school has had a lot of money spent on it in the past two years in the way of grants from the Department, and as they are not doing anything towards teaching the boys to become farmers, or to milk cows, etc. I do not know that they should be granted much more.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter 105-1-5, November 19th., re- laundry machinery for the Thunderchild residential school.\n\nThis laundry equipment is badly needed at the school but would mean a fairly large expenditure as it would necessitate as well as the cost of the machinery a much larger capacity motor and dynamo to the present plant there. If the Department cannot supply the new equipment this year it would not be vital to the school as they can use their present one for another year as the farm equipment which the Department contemplates supplying would be of much more benefit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been advised by Mr. Macdonald, Indian Agent at Battleford, that the Department could not supply, this year, the Thunderchild Res. School with a laundry equipment. Of course, I know the new farm to be installed, will necessitate many expenses, and I will wait till next year for this equipment of laundry. But the small motor, which generates the electric light is nearly worn out, and will not last one year yet. According to the experts, a motor of 6 H.P. should be very sufficient to generate the electric light and at the same time, to work the laundry machines, to be supplied in the future. Could it be possible to be supplied with this 6 H.P. motor this year, that there be no interruption in the light, and I would be very grateful to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Father Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOttawa, January 24, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, requesting to be supplied with a 6 H.P. motor to generate electric light.\n\nIn this connection I have to regret that the Department has no funds available to provide for the expenditure required in the purchase of the motor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner\n\nMay 7th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nRegina\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 376, amounting to $80.25 in favour of Bowman Bros., Ltd., Regina, Sask., for Fire Extinguishers & Refills for Thunderchild R.C. Indian Residential School, Battleford Agency.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 105-1-5 dated 25th April, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, May 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThere has been considerable correspondence with the church authorities, with reference to farm instruction at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. The Department has been assured that there is now 50 acres ready for cultivation and that an additional 30 acres will be prepared this year. The Rev. Principal has promised to make arrangements for extra horses, without cost to the Department. The Department has promised to erect a barn and an implement shed and to give some help with agricultural machinery. You may proceed with the erection of these buildings. The amounts in the estimates are $5,000 for the barn and $600 for the implement shed. If this is not all required, the Department will be glad to learn that you can effect a saving. When arranging for the new buildings, please be guided by general instructions of the Deputy Superintendent General's 1-1-5 of the 14th instant.\n\nAt a later date, you may make recommendations regarding the agricultural machinery that should be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir:-\n\nI have your letter of the 17th. instant with reference to the matter of farm instruction at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, and I note the Department has been assured that there is now 50 acres ready for cultivation and that an additional 30 acres will be prepared this year. Does this mean that there are fifty acres already cultivated, or has this amount of land merely been brushed and made ready for plowing?\n\nI note the Department has promised to erect a barn and an implement shed, and that the amounts in the Estimates covering these two items amount to $5600.00. I consider that this amount is altogether too high, and I think a good barn could be put up for $3000.00. If, however, you have told the Church authorities that $5000.00 has been allowed they will expect to have it all spent, which makes it difficult for me. I should be glad to know if the Church authorities have been notified to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your 302-11A R.C., of the 23rd instant, I have to state that the Department informed the Principal that funds would be available this year for a barn at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School. You were directed, in the Deputy Superintendent General's 1-1-5 of the 14th instant, to effect a saving wherever possible, and, if the entire appropriation for this building is not required, of course, it should not be expended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nIn connection with the barn and implement shed to be erected at the Delmas School, I beg to inform you that this is now under way and I would be glad to have an accountable cheque for $1,100.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Macdonald,\n\nReceived with satisfaction the forms 21 you have sent me last week. Will apply to Ottawa for getting forms 28. Many thanks.\n\nDuring next fall\u2014if the Department permits\u2014we are expecting quite a number of small and young children, orphan, destitute, and neglected ones from 4 to 8 years old. We will apply for their admittance, but as we are short of beds for these little ones, I will dare to ask the Department to be so kind as to supply our school with new beds\u201411 beds size 4\u00bd, and 11\u00bd long, with mattress, blankets and pillows. You can just assure that the School will know how to appreciate the favour.\n\nNow here are the names of a few children for whom we are willing to come to school. But knowing not exactly the name of their parents nor their residence, I will ask you to help me to fill in the proper admissions:\n\nEdward Beatty.\nEdward Soliverry.

L. Macdonald\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 27th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, requesting that a number of beds, mattresses and pillows be supplied. In this connection, I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide this equipment.\n\nIt is noted from the Principal's letter that he wishes to take a number of young children into the school, some of whom are half-breeds. In this connection, I would point out that the grant allowed at this school is for 120 pupils only. The June quarter return showed an enrolment of 121 pupils, with an average attendance of 117. The Department cannot approve of the admission of half-breed children or of Indian children under the age limit, unless, in the latter case, there are exceptional circumstances. As the school is allowed to have one extra child enrolled for every twenty grant-earning pupils, the total number enrolled at this school should not exceed 126 pupils at any one time and no recruiting in excess of that number should be undertaken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The senior room has twenty-five pupils, four in Grade 6, and twenty-five in Grade 7. The junior room has Grade 2, with twelve pupils, Grade 3, with six pupils, and Grade 4, with ten pupils, totalling twenty-eight pupils. The primary room accommodates the little ones with twenty-seven on the roll. The children had only been back from holidays a short time, but all appeared strong and healthy. They were neatly dressed and clean. The Sisters in charge of the class-room work appeared capable, and, I believe, progress is made. The rooms were all well aired and tidy.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and all the beds were neatly made, with good bedding. The children all have night robes to sleep in, and the rooms have plenty of light and air. The toilets were spotlessly clean and all in working order.\n\nThe kitchen, sewing room, and laundry, I found to be in splendid condition and scarcely a spot of dust could be found. The departments are all under the supervision of a Sister and excellent work is done.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThis school is a frame building, and in many respects unhandy; but it is one of the best kept schools I have been privileged to visit. The place throughout was clean and tidy and the children were happy and apparently contented.\n\nOne boy and a girl were sick at the time of my visit, but both were receiving the best of care. In the case of the girl, typhoid fever was suspected, and she was being carefully watched both by the Sister and Doctor.\n\nA new barn is now under construction. The lumber used is all No. 1 fir and the dimension all 2 x 6. This barn should be thoroughly satisfactory and is certainly badly needed.\n\nThe old log building used for a chicken house is ready to fall down. A new up-to-date building should be supplied. At present they have about two hundred hens, and this work is supervised by a Sister. I believe a real success is made in this line of work, and it is one which will be of great benefit to the boys and girls in later life. I think every encouragement should be given to this line of work.\n\nThe fire protection consists of extinguishers placed at convenient places throughout the building, and a water supply is always available. The fire hose are good and I found all fire escapes in excellent condition.\n\nThe yards are large and I found them tidy and well kept. Swings and teeters are provided both for the boys and girls.\n\nAt present twelve cows are kept, but it is hoped to gradually increase this number. The extra barn room will enable the Reverend Principal to keep more stock, from which the children will benefit. Pigs are also kept,\nand are butchered for home consumption.\n\nI was greatly pleased with the lay out of this school and I believe it is under excellent management.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Oct. 14th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Battleford Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nAfter reading through this report I would say that everything in connection with these schools is being carried on fairly well.\n\nThe Inspector states that screens and a screen door are required for the classroom at the Little Pine Day School. These should be supplied next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nThe barn and implement shed at the Delmas Indian Residential School, Battleford Agency, have been completed, and the Agent will require a further $140.00 to complete payment for draying and labour. I will be glad if you will forward me a cheque for this amount at the earliest possible date so that we may clear this matter up.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n| ARTICLES          | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS                                      |\n|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                  | Scoring              |                                             |\n| Lumbar etc.       |                      |                                             |\n| Taffeta thread    |                      |                                             |\n| at. $1.50        |                      |                                             |\n\n**DO NOT USE THIS SPACE**\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDept. of: [Signature]\n\nDate: [Signature]\n\nCity or town: [Signature]\n| DATE | ITEMS | FEET | PRICE | DEBIT | CREDIT |\n|------|-------|------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Aug 28 | 4 x 12 x 8 cm 3x | 1/4 | $60 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 10 cm 6x | 1/4 | $55 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 12 cm 6x | 1/4 | $50 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 16 cm 6x | 1/4 | $45 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 20 cm 6x | 1/4 | $40 |\n| Aug 29 | 4 x 12 x 24 cm 6x | 1/4 | $35 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 30 cm 6x | 1/4 | $30 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 36 cm 6x | 1/4 | $25 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 42 cm 6x | 1/4 | $20 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 48 cm 6x | 1/4 | $15 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 54 cm 6x | 1/4 | $10 |\n|       | 4 x 12 x 60 cm 6x | 1/4 | $5 |\n\nTotal: $148.75\n\nWork performed; Material supplied; Prices fair and just.\n\nResidential School Authority Committee #302 MARC Oct 25/30\n| DATE | ITEMS | FEET | PRICE | DEBIT | CREDIT |\n|------|-------|------|-------|-------|--------|\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n|      |       |      |       |       |        |\n\nTwo hundred and ninety-eight dollars and fifty cents\n\nMaterial supplied to implement the Thunderbird Residential School Authority Commencement Letter 302-11HRE.

We have, as yet, had no result of the decision that may have been taken in this connection.\n\n---\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI regret that your SS-308 of December 5th, last, has been inadvertently unanswered.\n\nBefore considering a larger lighting plant for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, the Department would like to learn if there is any prospect of electric power being available in the near future. I regret there are no funds for the team of horses and the other equipment requested by the Rev. Principal. As far as the team of horses is concerned, I may say that correspondence of some months ago shows the Rev. Principal had promised to make arrangements for the cultivation of more land and to get extra horses, without cost to the Department. This is one of the conditions on which the pupilage of this school was increased. The Department would like to help with agricultural machinery but will have to wait until funds can be found for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nSir:\n\nI have Department letter #105-1-5, March 18th, Re lighting Plant, Horses and farm Machinery for the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nThe Principal has been advised as to contents of Departments letter.\n\nWith regard to the lighting, The Provincial Power Commission took over the North Battleford Plan last year and their policy is to extend Electricity to the smaller towns, this has been done in the Saskatoon district and will no doubt be carried out here, Delmas being one the larger sized towns near North Battleford, would no doubt benefit when it is done, but there is no intimation when it will be extended. In the mean time present plant at the school will give them necessary light and something definite will likely be known before another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to advise you as follows.\n\nOn the night of Dec 1st about 8 o'clock, I received a phone message from the Thunderchild Boarding School to the effect that all the girls in the dormitory were ill, some vomiting and others fainting and that there was a strong odour of gas. I immediately proceeded to the school, taking along a tank of oxygen and a mechanic. On arrival I found all but a few fully recovered. The oxygen proved beneficial to those who were still under the influence, and I was able to return after being there about an hour. The Sisters were to advise me in the morning if any of the children showed any bad effects. As no phone call came in I concluded that everything was all right.\n\nThe cause of the trouble was a crack in the exhaust pipe of the gasoline engine which generates their electric light and which is left running for about one hour each evening. The man in charge was aware of the defect and left the basement window open advising one of the sisters to leave the window open until the engine was shut off. One of the sisters not being aware of the instructions, happening along, saw the window open and closed it, with the result that the fumes were forced up to the recreation room and dormitory in that section of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nMedical Officer\nOttawa, December 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, regarding the illness occasioned the girls in one of the dormitories at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School from gas escaping from a broken exhaust pipe of the gas engine which generates the electric light for the school. The Department notes the prompt action taken by you in the case of the girls affected.\n\nWe are referring this matter to Mr. Agent Macdonald, with the request that he arrange with the school authorities that there will not be a recurrence of gas escaping from the exhaust of the engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nH. O. Norquay, Esq., M.D.,\nBattleford,\nSask.\nOttawa, December 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Dr. Norquay, medical officer, in which he states that, on the night of the 1st instant, he was called to the Thunderchild Indian Residential School and found, upon arrival, that all the girls in the dormitory were ill as a result of gas escaping from a break in the exhaust pipe of the gas engine which generates the electric light. He states that the man in charge was aware of the defect and left a window open, but that one of the sisters, not aware of the circumstances, closed the window, with the result that the fumes were forced up to the dormitory.\n\nIt would appear that the engineer was remiss in carrying out the repair required to the exhaust pipe of the engine, which might have resulted in fatalities. I have to request that you will give the necessary instructions that the repairs required to overcome the condition mentioned are immediately carried out, if same have not been attended to before this date.\n\nIt is hoped that the girls have entirely recovered from the effects of the gas inhaled by them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. H. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI have Department letter, re exhaust Gas at the Thunderchild Residential School.\n\nThe Children were all recovered the following day and apparently none the worse.\n\nThe leak was also repaired the following morning; it was only small in the first place, instead of shutting down the Engineer opened the window of the lighting plant room and one of the Sisters not aware of the leak shut the window and the Gas went up in that wing of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

OCT. 19, 1933\n\nJ.B. Sutherland\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nAllow me to remind you of the promise you had the kindness of giving us at the time of your visit at Delmas, which was to furnish us with a Night-Clock and the monthly grant for a night watchman from November 1st to May 1st. This help will be all the more appreciated, dear Mr. Sutherland, as we were secretly notified recently by letter that our school was threatened to be burnt. Since then the Reverend Sisters, frightened and uneasy are obliged to mount the guard every night after their hard day's work of teaching and training.\n\nHoping that you will be allowed to fulfill your kind deed, I remain, dear Sir, with sincere esteem\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\nPrincess\nOttawa, October 25, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding a grant for a night watchman at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School and the supplying of a watchman's clock.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we are today communicating with Mr. Agent Macdonald, Battleford, informing him that the Department will allow a grant, at the rate of $40 per month, towards the salary of a night watchman for the period from November 1, 1933, to April 30, 1934. The Agent has been requested to prepare vouchers, in triplicate, and forward same for payment of this grant at the end of each quarter.\n\nThe Department is also placing an order with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited, to ship, addressed to you, one (1) only D-P Watchman's Clock, complete with ten stations, record dials and full instructions.

Odilon A. Head (P.O. Box)\n\nPrincipal\nStatement regarding the Water-Supply Question at the Thunderchild Residential School,\nDelmas, Sask.\n\nThe Thunderchild Residential School was founded in 1905.\n\nFrom 1905-1915 water was supplied from a well of 3 feet diameter & 28 feet deep, situated at proximity of the school. Although there were neither bath-rooms nor water toilets in the house this well was far from furnishing the quantity of water needed; to remedy this the best we could, barrels were placed here and there in the house: kitchen, dining-rooms, and dormitories and were filled as water rose in the well. This water was never good and sometimes undrinkable.\n\nIn 1915 the school Officials made arrangements with the Canadian National Railway Company, which providing ready money, furnished, since that date, the necessary water.\n\nOn the first of May last, the C.N.R. dismissed its Pumping-man and notified us that we would have to provide water for ourselves as it was closing the Delmas tank; agreeing however to loan us the Pumping Plant that we would operate at our own cost plus a monthly rent, till we could find another way of providing our water supply. We were obliged to accept this agreement, but the expenses it incurs are beyond our means and as the water question is a vital question and very important for the pupils' health, we hope the Department will kindly come to our help to allow us to meet these present difficulties. The cost of running the pump at the present time is an expense of seventy-one dollars $71.00 monthly.\n\nAs is shown by the monthly statements paid out to the C.N.R., since 1915, the school consumes an average of 2000 gallons of water daily, and after a thorough study of the question, particularly through experiments made on different surface water wells around the school and in the town of Delmas, we sincerely believe the surest, the most steadfast and after all the most economical way to provide us of this daily supply of water is to install a Modern Water Supply System which to the best of our knowledge and experience could be summed up to the following estimates.\n\nOf course, dear Mr Agent, this statement is just to give you an idea of the situation. If yourself or the Department have a better to solve the matter we would only be too glad to adopt it.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSome,\nof the other Residential schools. Father Allard was for several years at the Duck Lake School and his Estimate is based on the equipment used there and he had got estimates from various local firms and his figures of cost are based on this.\n\nHe figures on a deep small bore well, while I think, that two three foot wells, at a lesser depth, of say 100 feet each, if a good flow was available, would be cheaper and more satisfactory.\n\nI would recommend, that if possible, assistance in this be allowed, as in case of any break down of the present arrangement, the school would be in a bad situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI beg to attach herewith, Statement from the Thunder child school, as to the Water supply at the school.\n\nAs stated, since 1915, they have been dependant on the Canadian National Railway for water, this is pumped from the Saskatchewan river, approximately one and a half miles to the Railway Tank and then supplied to the school approximately a half mile by gravitation. In May of this year the Railway closed down the tank, but agreed to rent it to the School and since that date, they have been operating the plant themselves, which is costly, as they have to employ a Pump man and in the winter it will be necessary to keep both the Pump house at the River and railway tank at the track heated and there is always the danger of some of the two miles of piping freezing or going out of commission, which would leave the whole school plant in danger as there is no reserve supply and the one small shallow well, 28 feet, can be pumped dry with a hand pump in one hour.\n\nI took this up with the school early in the season, but the previous principal did not seem interested, but when the Rev Father Allard took over, it was one of his first considerations, as it would be a vital matter if the water supply was shut off or broke down during the winter.\n\nPrior to bring up the matter, Father Allard, had made tests of pumping wells adjoining, but they were all shallow wells and the water easily pumped out in a short time, but it seems certain, that water is available as there are wells all over the town of 25 to 30 feet, but many go dry during dry weather, but I feel confident, that if well was sunk a reasonable depth, that a good water supply could be had.\n\nI am not well enough versed in water supply systems to make any definite recommendation, but no doubt the Department have Officials qualified to handle that part or recommend some system giving satisfaction at some\nNovember 24, 1933.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. McGill.\n\nA letter has been received from Indian Agent Macdonald advising that arrangements will have to be made to provide a satisfactory water supply for the Thunderchild School.\n\nSince 1915 the School has been depending on the Canadian National Railway for water.

The estimated cost of digging the well and supplying the necessary tanks, etc., is $2,600.00 approximately.

Macdonald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nREPORT\nON\nPROPOSED WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM\nFOR\nTHUNDERCHILD INDIAN SCHOOL, DELMAS, SASKATCHEWAN,\n\nby\nP. A. Fetterly, B.Sc.,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report\n\nInstructions were received from the Director, dated January 5, 1934, to prepare a report on a proposed water supply pressure system for Thunderchild Indian (R.C.) School at Delmas, Sask.\n\nAn inspection was made by P.A. Fetterly of this staff on January 11. A consultation was also held with Mr. S.L. MacDonald, Indian Agent at Battleford, on the matter at the same time.\n\n2. Necessity for a New Water Supply.\n\nThis school was founded in 1905. From that time to 1916 the water supply was of a primitive nature. In 1916 the Canadian National Railway agreed to supply water through an extra pipe from their tank at Delmas. Water was pumped from the North Saskatchewan river, one mile to the north, and 250 ft. below rail level, to the tank. A pipe was laid from the tank to the school, one-half mile.\n\nRecently, the Railway discontinued the use of their tank for Railway purposes, but agreed to rent the plant to the school. The cost to the school is over $70 per month for wages and maintenance. In addition to\nthe excessive cost, the water coming directly from the river, and lying in the tank, is naturally not very pure. The present arrangement, therefore, is far from satisfactory.\n\n3. Location of Water Supply System\n\nThe system must be placed in an outside basement similar to that in which the Delco Light System is housed further along the building as there is no room in the present basement. The north and south sides of the building are very irregular in outline since the buildings which contain the school are of different sizes, although under an irregularly connected roof, additions having been made at various times.\n\nThe plumbing system in the building is complete. The source of supply, only, is to be altered.\n\n4. Proposed Scheme\n\nThe general proposal, as suggested by Rev. Father Allard, and agreed to by this office, consists of an extension to the basement somewhat similar to that at Duck Lake School and also to the Delco Light basement at Thunderchild School. This basement is to be placed in an alcove on the west side of the building, and will be 30 ft. north and south against the present well and parallel to the length of the school. The north side of the alcove is 8' long and the south side 15 feet. The basement should be \"squared\" to a width of 15 feet. In addition a small alcove north of this space, and\nbetween it and an entry can be used for the pump and windmill. The superficial area of the new basement would be 30 ft. by 15 ft. with an added area 8 ft. square on the north west corner. The west side will therefore be 38 feet long.\n\nIn the main portion will be placed two 48\" pressure tanks, parallel to each other and lying north and south. The well, pump jack and gasoline engine will be suitably located in the north-western portion of the basement. A ten foot windmill will be erected on a 40 foot steel tower directly over the well. Three of the legs of the windmill (8 ft. apart) would be on solid ground. The south-eastern leg would be on a concrete post. This windmill is to be used as auxiliary power.\n\nIt might be mentioned that the basement wall on the east side of the alcove is only 18\" deep. The south side, 15 ft. long is also only 18\" deep. Only the north side, 8' wide, is 8 feet deep.\n\nThe pressure system will be connected directly with the plumbing system already installed. The main feed pipe is 10 feet east of the alcove wall, under the building.\n\n5. Water Requirements for School\n\nFather Allard stated that 120 persons of all grades inhabit the school. It was ascertained that St. Barnabas (C of E) School at Onion Lake, Sask., used 20 gallons per capita during last summer's holidays, and\nwas measured by meter. The usual amount considered is 30 gallons. In this report 30 gallons will be used as an average. The average requirements would then be 3600 gallons. Father Allard stated that he would be satisfied if the pump activated for 12 hours or even more. The pumping capacity would then need to be about 300 gallons per hour. The amount of water needed depends upon the care and economy with which it is used. The farm stock should be supplied from shallow wells now in existence.\n\nIncidently, most schools appear to pump their water in from 6 to 8 hours.\n\n6. Details of Construction\n\n(a) Wells.\n\nWater is not economically available from the Saskatchewan river because of the distance, difference in levels, possible impurity of the source and cost of maintenance. No springs being known in the vicinity, the only available source will consist of wells.\n\nSeveral shallow wells, about 20 to 30 feet deep have been sunk in the vicinity, one being within 30 feet of the proposed basement. This well is 28 feet deep and 3 feet in diameter. The water is 2' deep and can be pumped out in a short time, yielding only about 75 gallons at one pumping. Even two or three shallow wells would not be sufficient because of the paucity of water and uncertainty of supply. Two other similar wells, at least, exist within a few hundred feet nearer the\nriver. A well 64 feet deep was sunk in the centre of the village of Delmas a few hundred feet to the west of the school for public purposes. This is said to contain the best water in the general vicinity. A sample of water from this well was obtained. An analysis will be made of this shortly by Calgary City Chemist.\n\nAnother well was drilled to a depth of 300 feet, four or five miles to the southeast and about 1\u00bd miles south of the river, some time ago. This well yields a good flow of water. A well driller named Garrett, was evidently consulted by Father Allard, Principal, when preparing his original report and estimates (a copy of which was sent to the Indian Department). Mr. Garrett stated that he could guarantee a well with a flow of 250 gallons per hour. Mr. Garrett evidently believes that he can obtain a good flow at 250 or 300 feet, which is about the level of the river.\n\nConsidering the total available evidence, a deep well would appear to be the best source for water.\n\nThis well should be drilled in the north-west corner of the proposed basement and should be completed before any other work is done in order to insure that water will be available in sufficient volume.\n\n(b) Basement.\n\nThis will be constructed of reinforced concrete. It is suggested that the west wall be constructed of brick to facilitate possible removal of the tanks if this be ever found necessary. This suggestion is open to\ncorrection. It will be 8 feet deep to correspond with the existing basement to the northeast. The present wall on the east, 30 feet long, is only 18\" deep and will have to be removed. No basement exists on the east and south sides. The south wall, 15 feet long, is also only 18\" deep and will be treated similarly. The north wall, for the east 8' is 8' deep, and need not be disturbed. A door will be constructed to this basement. The west wall, 38 feet long and the west portion of the north wall will be of new construction.\n\nThe floor will be at the same level as that of the main basement, and the ceiling will be at the same level as the top of the basement containing the Delco Light system. This is a few inches above the ground.\n\nIn order to connect the ceiling of the basement with the existing walls it will be necessary to remove the sills or lower the walls. Of course, the west and south walls can be removed entirely as they are only 18\" deep.\n\nIt will be noted that when the tanks, engine, etc., are placed in the room they can never be replaced without a certain amount of demolition.\n\nThe basement will be heated from the school. Two windows can be placed high on the west side and a door constructed at the north-east angle to allow communication with the present basement.\n\n(c) Gasoline Engine\n\nThe power for pumping will be supplied by\na three-horse-power gasoline engine as an auxiliary power when a windmill cannot be used. The electrical energy at present in use in the school is supplied by a Delco Light system, consequently no electrical power is available for other uses.\n\n(d) Pump-jack\n\nThe well will be cased for the whole length with 5-5/8 inch casing. A 3\" pipe will contain the 1-3/8\" octagonal rods and the 2-3/4\" working cylinder. A pump jack will be placed over the well in the basement. It will be connected to the engine. The usual deep well pump with a motor cannot be used because of absence of electrical power. Simple means will be provided for transfer of connections from engine to windmill.\n\n(e) Pressure Tanks\n\nTwo 48\" tanks, 24 ft. long, lying parallel, and on concrete cradles, will occupy a large portion of the space. These tanks will consist of 5/16\" material with 1/4 inch heads, dished outwards, with manhole and accessories such as pressure gauge, water gauges, etc., and will conform to the Saskatchewan Boiler Act.\n\n(f) Windmill\n\nThis is to be used as auxiliary power whenever wind power is available. It will consist of a 10 foot wheel mounted on a 40 ft. steel tower. The matter of whether this wheel will lift the water 250 to 300 ft. (the estimated depth of the well) under pressure has not as yet been fully discussed.\n7. The Time Element\n\nThe letter received from the Director stated that it was desirable to have the work finished by March 31st in order to take advantage of the existing appropriation of $2500, and also as to the effect of winter conditions on carrying on the work. It is understood that if the work cannot be finished before March 31st., then the vote will lapse.\n\nIt is undoubtedly unwise to attempt this work during frozen conditions. The physical labour, and the costs are excessive when excavating through 6 feet or more of frozen ground and when pouring concrete. It was learned during construction at Sacred Heart School and St. Barnabas School that both costs and difficulties increase enormously under these conditions. In these cases work had to be postponed, and renewed in May.\n\nHowever, if it must be done before that date or not at all, in order to obtain the appropriation, then the only alternative is to complete the work. In that case allowance will have to be made for excess cost.\n\n8. Costs\n\nPlans and estimates are being prepared and will be sent very shortly. Meanwhile it was thought best to prepare this portion of the report for the immediate use of the Indian Department.\n\n9. Recommendation.\nIt is recommended that the work be proceeded with because of the urgency. The time of completion is left with the Indian Department considering paragraph 7. This office will be prepared to undertake supervision. The total time occupied would be about one month particularly if all of the material were on the site before construction began.\n\nCalgary, Alta., January 23, 1934.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nO.H. Hoover\nEngineer-in-Charge.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 4th instant requesting a report on a proposed new water supply for the Thunderchild Indian Residential school at Delmas, Sask., I enclose herewith a preliminary report dated the 23rd instant.\n\nThis report is being supplied now in order to indicate the nature of the proposed scheme and will be supplemented by plans which are now being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSpecifications\nfor\nWater Supply System\nat\nThunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Saskatchewan.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe material supplied, and the work done, in connection with the construction of the proposed water supply system are to be to the satisfaction of the Engineer-in-Charge, Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, Calgary, Alberta. Only material of the best quality is to be used and workmanship is to be also of the best quality.\n\nLocation\n\nThe School is situated in the town of Delmas, Saskatchewan, about 1/2 mile from the Canadian National Railway Station and siding. No difficulties will be met in freighting.\n\nNature of Works\n\nThe works consist of the drilling of a deep well, and the construction of a basement contiguous to Thunderchild Indian School, in accordance with plan supplied. This basement will contain pneumatic tanks, engine, and pump-jack. A windmill will be constructed over the well for auxiliary power. The new pressure system will be connected with the present gravity system from the Railway Tank, a two-inch pipe from which runs under the building 10 feet east of the wall.\n\n(a) Excavation.\n\nThe area will be excavated sufficiently\nlarger than the size of basement indicated on the plan to allow for construction of forms. The excavation of the cellar to the east of the proposed site does not enter into this contract.\n\nThe present concrete platform will be removed and the portion of the present wall which is 18\" deep will be removed or shored up, for deepening to 8'.\n\n(b) Well.\n\nThe well shall be drilled before any other work is done. Water will be obtained in sufficient quantities to produce at least 300 gallons per hour and 3600 gallons per day. It will probably be 250' to 300' deep. The hole will be straight and the casing properly placed. The casing, plugged and reamed piping and rods will be of good material of approved manufacture. It will be located as shown on the plan.\n\nA log of the well shall be kept in order to ascertain the geological structure.\n\n(c) Concrete.\n\nThe concrete comprising of the basement and saddles shall consist of clean screened gravel, clean sand with the addition of Portland Cement in the proportions of one part cement, three parts sand and five parts gravel, except the top slab of the basement and the saddles which will consist of one, two and four parts respectively. One inch\nof grout shall be placed between tanks and saddles.\n\nThe ends of the reinforcing rods should be wired where feasible, and should not protrude.\n\nThe finished work shall be trowelled smoothly. The floor should be capable of draining to the N.E. corner and thence to the main drains of the building.\n\n(d) Gasoline Engine.\n\nThe engine shall be capable of producing 3 horse power and shall be of approved make. It shall be set in proper relation to the pump jack and rods.\n\n(e) Pump Jack.\n\nThe pump jack shall be of approved make and shall be capable of sustaining the load of pumping 300 gallons per hour against a head of 300 feet (probable depth of well) and a pressure of 60 lbs. per sq.inch.\n\n(f) Tanks\n\nThe two tanks shall be 4' diameter and 24 feet long. These will be laid horizontally and parallel to each other and to the north side of the building, on three concrete saddles. They shall be made of five-six-tenths inch shell material, with three-eights-inch heads, 100 lbs. working pressure, tested to 150 lbs. Ends of the tanks to be dished outwards. A manhole sized according to Saskatchewan Boiler Act rules shall be placed at the rear end of\neach tank.\n\nDrain plug at the bottom, front end.\n\nTwo water gauges on each (half-way each), complete with cut-off valves and blow-down cock.\n\nOne piece of zinc 6\" x 6\" x 2\" for each tank to prevent electrolysis (not rivetted to tank).\n\nAll connections including screwed brass pipe, gate valves, etc., to connect with existing system 10 feet east of the proposed basement.\n\nOne 1/2\" connection on each tank for air pressure; also a pressure gauge to be provided.\n\nNecessary connections to be made between pump and tanks, also between tanks and existing supply system. All necessary connections and accessories to be provided in proper lengths and sizes.\n\nConnections to be so arranged that tanks can be used independently if needed.\n\nTanks, engine, etc., to be placed before basement is finished.\n\nOutside of tanks to be painted with Dr. Smith's Solution.\n\n(e) Windmill.\n\nThe windmill shall be of approved make to lift the water from a 2-3/4\" working barrel 300 feet deep into tanks under pressure of 60 lbs. per square inch. Estimates are to the effect that a 12 foot windmill on a 40 foot steel tower will produce 1 horse power in a 15 mile wind.\n(h) All necessary connections, such as valves, pipe in proper lengths and sizes will be provided by the tenderer. Such connections are to be provided so that changes may be made on rods from windmill to pump jack and vice versa.\n\nAll work is to be performed in a thorough and substantial manner and to the approval of the Engineer-In-Charge, Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, Department of the Interior, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nJan 31, 34\n\nP.A.

H. Odilon Allard, O.M.\nPrincipal\nAddendum Report\n\non\n\nProposed Water Supply\n\nat\n\nThunderchild Indian School\n\nDelmas, Saskatchewan,\n\nBY\n\nP.A. Fetterly,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report\n\nA preliminary report was prepared on January 23rd, 1934, on this subject. Since that date the plans and estimates have been prepared.\n\nIn view of the statement of the Secretary of the Indian Department to the effect that only $2500 has been appropriated for this work, it is considered advisable to state all details in connection with the estimates instead of the usual method. This is done in order that criticism may be made with all facts in evidence, so that, if the Indian Department wish to change the sizes to smaller dimensions, the designed details may be known.\n\n2. Details of Estimates.\n\n(a) Concrete and Brickwork.\n\nThe floor is designed to be 6\" in depth, walls 10\" and the roof slab 8\". The latter\nis 16 feet wide and 30' to 38' long. These dimensions necessitate an 8\" thickness for roof, with reinforcement 5\" and 18\" apart respectively. This roof will be occupied, as a door enters the building above the present concrete platform; but no vehicles or horses should ever be on it. Father Allard expects at some future time to erect a building over this area.\n\nThe three tank saddles are 1' wide and are sunk 2' into the earth to hold the tanks. This extra 2' is possibly open to criticism but the bearing weight certainly should not all be on the floor.\n\nThe floor itself should be levelled and prepared so that it will drain to the north-east corner and thence to the main drains of the building. The land in general drains rapidly to the North-west, toward the river.\n\nThe brickwork is placed at such a point so that if it be ever found necessary to replace the tanks, this can be done with a minimum of demolition.\n\nWindows are provided in the west wall for light and ventilation. Openings are provided in the east wall for entrance of heat from the adjacent heating pipes.\n\nA door is provided in the north-east corner for ingress and ventilation.\n(b) **Excavation**\n\nThis will be somewhat larger than the size of the basement to make room for forms. The price 75\u00a2 per yard, is certainly not excessive as the total amount to be moved is not large.\n\nFather Allard wishes to excavate a basement to the east of the proposed basement, to be paid for by the School. He estimates that 80 cu.yds. of earth will be moved. This would have to be done while the other excavation is proceeding.\n\n(c) **Well**\n\nThe estimated depth is 300 feet. Father Allard estimated 250 to 300' but estimated prices on 250'. It is obviously impossible to estimate the depth to which one must drill to obtain an adequate amount of water. The price of casing, pipe, rods, and the horse power of the engine depend on this depth. The 50 feet possible extra depth will make a difference in total cost. No person, even a driller, ever estimates closely the depth, to which he will go, and rightly so. Drilling is estimated at 1.75 per foot. This should cover contract price.\n\nThe well should be under the windmill although an apparatus is available for transfer of power from a windmill at a distance. It consists of a double lever with cross wires.\n\n(d) **Gasoline Engine.**\n\nThe power required to lift water 300 feet against a pressure of 60 lbs. (in the tanks),\nincluding friction, is found as follows:\n\nPower required = Gal. per minute x height\n\n1980\n\n= 5 x (300 ft. / 60 x 2)\n\n1980\n\n= 1.1 horse power.\n\nA 1\u00bd horse power engine costs $92.00, while a 3 h.p. engine costs $144.00. Two h.p. engines are not listed. It was considered by all means advisable to purchase a 3 h.p. in order to have some surplus power.\n\n(e) Pump Jack.\n\nThe power working head considered, costing $67, appeared to be rather light, but the wholesalers stated that it was designed to do the required work.\n\n(f) Pressure Tanks.\n\nFather Allard wished to have two 4' x 24' tanks, holding 1257 gallons each at two-thirds capacity, for the requirements of the school. In this case no reserve supply other than that in the tanks will be available. One thousand dollars f.o.b. Delmas, is a very modest estimate.\n\nThe tanks should be placed before the wall is built.\n\n(g) Windmill.\n\nThis question of a windmill as auxiliary power is open to criticism because\nof the lack of power. A table of available power is as follows, in a 15-mile wind (a pleasant, brisk gale):\n\n| Size of Windmill | Horse Power | Size of Windmill | Horse Power |\n|------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|\n| 4'               | 1/12        | 12'              | 1           |\n| 6'               | 1/5         | 14'              | 1-3/5       |\n| 8'               | 3/10        | 16'              | 2-2/5       |\n| 10'              | 3/5         | 18'              | 3-3/5       |\n\nIf the wind velocity be increased or decreased the power of the windmill will increase or decrease in the ratio of the square of the velocity.\n\nYou will note that a 14' wheel at least, will be needed. Inquiries elicited the fact that a 14' wheel is not made. The sizes are 10', 12', 15'. Consequently a 12' wheel would just about supply the necessary power.\n\nThe costs are as follows:\n\n| Wheel Size | Horse Power | Head | Tower |\n|------------|-------------|------|-------|\n| 10 ft.     | 3/5 h.p.    | $101.00 | 91.30 |\n| 12\"        | 1 h.p.      | $180.00 | 110.00 |\n| 15\"        | 2 h.p.      | $336.00 | 166.00 |\n\nEstimates were made on a 12' wheel, 40 ft. tower.\n\nThe location of the windmill and consequently the well, caused some trouble. It could not be placed over the basement because that would necessitate anchoring the legs.\n(spread = 1/5 height) on the roof of the basement. The constant shifting strain of the tower would ruin the roof in a short time. Father Allard suggested the west side but this would necessitate an extra alcove 6' x 6' x 8', deep. It was determined at last to add the alcove on the north side adjacent to the entry. Three legs would then be on solid ground and the fourth on an extra post anchored to the present wall angle.\n\nA 12' wheel would probably supply sufficient power most of the time, especially when the tanks are not filled to capacity and if the well be not the full 300 feet deep.\n\nThis matter of a windmill is fully discussed in order that the Indian Department will be in full possession of the facts.\n\n(h) Labour\n\nThis will include all other work except concrete, the price of which is based on materials plus labour, erection of the windmill and demolition, excavation and the well proper. The sum of $200 appears to be none too large.\n\nThe remainder of the estimates are self-explanatory.\nConclusion\n\nThe whole matter has been fully discussed in this report since the Secretary of the Indian Department states that only $2500 is available. This office does not understand how work to the extent needed in this case can be done for $2500. It might be considered advisable by the Indian Department to decrease the walls to 8\" and the floor to 4\", use a 10' windmill, decrease the reinforcement, use a 1-1/2 h.p. engine, consider only a 250' well instead of 300', lessen the width to, say, 13 feet, make the saddles shallower, do without the windmill altogether, and thus eliminate the alcove, etc., etc. The total cost would be lessened but the efficiency and safety would also be lessened correspondingly.\n\nThe present estimates, similarly to Father Allard's, are based on summer conditions. The cost of winter work is difficult to estimate as men have to use a pick instead of a fresno or shovel, they lose time warming themselves, concrete must be warmed etc., etc. The percentage of cost increases on a comparatively small job such as this. Criticism for lessening costs without losing efficiency and safety will be welcomed. It is understood that the work will not be done by contract but by direct supervision from this office, supposedly under a good foreman, e.g. Geo. Devlin, of North Battleford, who constructed the water supply system at St. Barnabas School, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nIf the work is to be completed before March 31 it should be begun about March 1. Three weeks will be\noccupied in fabrication of the tanks. Before this is done the tenders have to be called from the firms enumerated in your letter of January 5. Negotiations in connection with this take some time.\n\nThe difficulties in connection with winter work have already been dealt with. If at all possible the work should be postponed until May.

This would seem to be more economical than attempting to have the work completed before the end of March.\n\nI shall be glad to have your further instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

As already advised there is an amount of $2,500.00 available for this work. I would therefore ask you to kindly arrange for the purchase of the machinery and materials in order that they may be delivered and paid for before the 31st of March and charged to the $2,500 available. The installation of the system can be left over until weather conditions are favourable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T.

Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nJoseph Rahrick, Esq.,\nUnity, Saskatchewan.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 10th instant regarding the proposed new water supply system for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, I am advised by Mr. Hoover that tenders for the machinery and materials authorized to be purchased have been sent to prospective bidders, which were enumerated in your letter of January 4th. A copy of each of the tenders is enclosed herewith.\n\nMr. Hoover has been instructed to telegraph the prices when they are received, if time presses. You will then be able to refer to these copies, particularly in regard to machinery.\n\nThe tenders for drilling and building material should be available before the tenders for machinery.\n\nI shall be glad to know that this procedure meets with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\nHighgate Siding, Sask.\nFeb. 23, 1934.\n\nEngineer-in-Charge,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nCalgary.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received your letter of the 16th inst. asking me to put a bid in on the well to be drilled at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School at Delmas, Sask. I have not a drill but have a boring machine. I have had the experience drill and boring around Delmas, and as far as drilling concerned it is a waste of time. You go down about 150 to 200 ft. and you strike fine quick sand, it is impossible to do anything with a drill. There are four wells drilled around Delmas. The people that owns the wells they are not worth a nickel to them.\n\nFar as I am concerned about digging wells, I would bore it but the drill I will not put no tenders on it, because it waste of time and money. So who ever drill can go ahead and when they are beat with the drill I will go and bore you one and get you all kind of water. So if you decide to bore with well machine give me an idea what you want if it is going to be piped into building or tank built over, then I will give you my price.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) T.A. Nicholson,\nHighgate, Sask.\nMarch 3, 1934.\n\nRe Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 17th ultimo, I beg to advise you of activities on the above matter.\n\nBuilding Supplies. (refer to your letter of Jan. 4)\n\nI have received a tender from Battleford Lumber and Supplies Ltd., Battleford, Sask., as follows:\n\n- Lumber 1\" boards per m.ft. Nor. Spruce: $29.50\n- \" 2\" x 4\" struts per m.ft. Nor. Spruce: $31.50\n- \" 2\" x 4\" Jack Pine: $21.00\n\nBricks No. 1 Redcliffe per m.: $33.75\n\nCement per barrel: $4.08\n\nEnc. \" Sack: $1.02\n\nReinforcement 1/2\" round rods, per 100 lbs.: $5.85\n\nThese prices are reasonable. No other tender was requested. Consequently, I would recommend that this tender be accepted. The prices are as delivered at the School, 17 miles west of Battleford.\n\nWell Drilling.\n\nTwo tenders were requested as per your letter of Jan. 5.\n\nJ. Rahrick, of Unity, Sask. (50 miles S.W. of Delmas) tendered for drilling a well for the following prices:\n\n\"$1.50 per foot to the depth of 50 feet.\n\n$0.50 per foot for every 50 feet thereafter until sufficient water is found.\"\n\nThis is interpreted as follows:\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nThis price appears to be excessive. The estimates in the report of Jan.30 were for $1.75 per foot as obtained from another well driller, verbally. Another price obtained at Macleod was $1.50 straight. It is apparently difficult to obtain correct prices except through bone fide tender, as in this case.\n\nT.A.Nicholson of Highgate (not Battleford, as in your letter of Jan.4) who lives 6 miles east of the School, answered my first letter as per enclosed copy.\n\nI wrote him on Feb.26, giving the requested information and asked for an early reply, with a tender.\n\nSince receiving his letter I have interviewed several men in Calgary. They appear to think that boring machines are only useful to 50' or 100' depth.\n\nThe matter of drilling or boring the well could be postponed until Mr.Fetterly is able to examine some of the wells around Delmas, probably in May.\n\nHardware, Engine, etc.\n\nAs mentioned in my letter of 17th ultimo, for firms were requested to submit tenders.\n\nBeatson Hardware Co.of Unity,Sask., accepted the invitation by letter dated Feb.27. They sent the specifications to a firm in Winnipeg and will submit tenders as soon as they get a reply.\n\nL.A.Halliday, of Battleford, accepted the invitation and stated that he would have the tenders at our office as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile I was surprised to receive a tender from McPherson & Thom of Regina, (with whom we have dealt with before in connection with the Muscowequan School at Lestock, Sask.) Mr.Fetterly, while in Saskatoon on Feb.27 on hydrometric work, ascertained that Mr.Halliday had sent his complete letter to J.H.Ashdown & Co.of Saskatoon. As they could not quote figures for all of the equipment it was sent to the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Co.at Toronto, who sent it to McPherson & Thom; their agents at Regina.\nMcPherson & Thom then submitted a tender, in duplicate, including well drilling. Copies are enclosed.\n\nNo answers have been received from the other two firms as yet.\n\nOwing to the short time available, it is considered necessary to acquaint the Indian Department with conditions. Small firms such as these never submit tenders of their own accord. They always send their letters to their wholesale representatives. Estimating on tanks, particularly, occupies some time. I anticipated that these delays would occur from former experience.\n\nI wrote to Mr. Halliday and also to McPherson and Thom on March 2 acquainting them with conditions and requesting to know whether the tender of the latter firm was to be considered as submitted on behalf of the former.\n\nThe whole matter rests as above detailed at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nMarch 10, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th with reference to the new water supply system for the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, I would ask you to kindly wire Mr. Hoover and instruct him to purchase the materials required to the best advantage after he has obtained prices from the firms, the names of which have already been furnished him. It will not be necessary for Mr. Hoover to refer these prices to Ottawa. As already pointed out it is desired that the equipment be purchased before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

You can do a better job if you are not rushed. As you people know what dry gravel and gas is to fight with.

Toronto engine, instead of a 3 H.P. engine. We have, however, arranged the price so that there would be very little difference, if any, had the 3 H.P. Engine been quoted on.\n\nItem No. 3 - Pump Jacks. This is a combination Pump Jack, and working head, which we have been selling in Western Canada for a number of years. A number of the Creameries who have Branches throughout Western Canada have been using this particular type of a Jack, and we have also sold some of these Jacks in the oil fields. We certainly have no hesitation whatever in highly recommending this particular type.\n\nItem No. 4. Windmill. As requested, we have given you a quotation on a 14' mill, which is of the very latest type being self-oiling, automatically governed, and equipped with the Timken bearings, and the ball-bearing turntable. Even the gears on this particular type of a mill are machine cut.\n\nInstead of giving you a quotation on the ordinary style of tower, we have thought it advisable to make our quotation covering a heavy tower, namely 3\" x 3\" corner posts, having the girts placed every five feet apart. This, of course, being a little larger sized mill than used for ordinary farm purposes, we need a heavier tower, especially in Western Canada, where climatic conditions perhaps are more severe than in other parts of the country.\n\nWe hope that we will receive a favourable reply as we feel that we can deliver these goods at Delmas, Sask., at mighty interesting prices.\n\nWe also wish to take this opportunity of thanking you for the courtesies which you had shown to our Mr. Lundell one week ago today, when he called on you, at your office, in Calgary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcPHERSON & THOM (SALES AGENTS)\nOntario Wind Engine & Pump Co.\n(western branch) Limited.\n\nper D.C.

However, everything has been arranged quite satisfactorily and no doubt the information in this letter will complete your files.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcPherson & Thom (Sales Agents)\nOntario Wind Engine & Pump Co.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau\n\nCalgary, Alta.\nMarch 9, 1934.\n\nSir,- Re Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 6th instant, I am enclosing two copies of a letter received today from McPherson & Thom of Regina.\n\nIt would appear from this letter that this firm did not consider any possible profit for M.A.Holliday in their tenders for Items 2 to 10 inclusive, but that their tender for No. 1, the pneumatic tanks, will go through Mr. Holliday.\n\nMr. Holliday stated in his letter of 5th instant, two copies of which were sent to you, that McPherson and Thom's price would be his estimate.\n\nIt is to be understood that the resulting misunderstandings are not in any way the fault of this office.\n\nThe item for fabricating two tanks is becoming very short. This work will occupy at least three weeks. The remainder of the material could be requested.\n\nI do not understand the silence of Phillips Bros. and Co. Hardware. I have written twice but received no answer whatever.\n\nBeatson Hardware Co. are evidently awaiting answer from their Winnipeg correspondents as he wrote on February 27 to that effect.\n\nI stated in my letter of 3rd instant, third last paragraph, that delay would probably ensue.\n\nIt will be almost impossible to have the tanks finished before March 31.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n'SGD' O.H.Hoover,\nEngineer-in-Charge.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...

They informed me I have to board myself and hire man at Hotel and team of horses at livery barn because feed is scarce in this country. So, at that rate, I will have to put my bid in high.\n\n36\" hole at $2.50 per foot to water if there is no dry sand or dry gravel to bother with and when I strike water I will charge $2.25 per hour to make basin for water as you may understand the quick sand or gravel how hard it is to make a basin for water or otherwise the reservoir.\n\nThe case of a 4' well you may strike gravel or dry sand 10' below surface so therefore you have to dig a 4' well to get same crib to water, so this would cost $3.00 per foot to water and some $2.25 per hour to make basin.\n\nYou want information on well I have dug around Highgate and Delmas. Any well that I have dug around Highgate or Delman there is usually lots of water this is the two hardest districts to get water in.\nThe well run from 140' to 40' deep also 30' if you are lucky enough to hit the right place where water runs. How to my experience the drill wells are from 300' to 350' 225', but the water is bad, cattle are the only things that can drink it, and then you have to starve them for 3 or 4 days before they will drink it.\n\nAlso the drill wells. You cannot force your casing through after certain depth, so if this well requires to be drilled go ahead and drill and find out for yourselves, case anything may happen I may get all the blame for it. I have dug lots of wells in this country. I have been at it for 14 years and have not dug two wells alike any of these wells I have dug they have been located by water which so I do not know how deep you may have to go behind the school.\n\nThere are very few wells around Delmas or Highgate the water rise in them.\n\nI will inform you of one thing. There is a good spring our far from the School there is ocean of water in it very best of water too. How I know I cleaned this well our five years ago I baled the well and you could not bale it out the well is only 40' deep. This spring runs a very short distance for school if you people had some way of tracing it it would be very valuable to you.\n\nSo there if you want to use the drill or if you want to bore, use your own judgment this is the very best information I can give you.\n\nOn other side of this page you will find the depth of some well I dug around Highgate & Delmas.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sd) T.A.NICHOLSON.\n\nHighgate, Sask.\n40' quick sand lots of water - Delmas\n75' lots of water in gravel - Delmas.\n99' lots of water in quick sand - Delmas.\n95' lots of water in gravel - Delmas.\n140' lots of water in quick sand - Delmas.\n25' lots of water in gravel - Delmas.\n90' lots of water in gravel - Delmas.\n60' lots of water in quick sand - Delmas.\n\nThese are in the village limits of Delmas\n\n1/3 of these wells are poor drinking water.\n\n250' slow portion of water quick sand - Highgate.\n14' lots of water in quick sand - Highgate.\n30' lots of water in quick sand - Highgate.\n68' lots of water in quick sand - Highgate.\n24' lots of water in quick sand - Highgate.\n110' lots of water in quick sand - Highgate.\n105' lots of water in quick sand - Highgate.\n136' lots of water in quick sand - Highgate.\n\nHalf of these wells are poor drinking water.\nBEATSON HARDWARE LIMITED\n\nUnity, Sask., 12th March 1934.\n\nDom.

I received the Beatson tender on the 12th instant.\n\nSeveral telegrams were interchanged between McPherson & Thom, Holliday and this office during March 16 and 17 until Holliday consented to accept McPherson & Thom's tender as his own providing 10% were added to the Regina tender as sent to you on March 3rd. Even with this advance Holliday's prices were very reasonable.\n\nI will not trouble you with copies of the telegrams sent to the tenderers. Suffice it to mention that excellent individual prices were obtained when the purchase was divided between the two tenderers.\n\nSchedules of the prices and awards are enclosed.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nI have held the drive shoe and drive head in abeyance as Beatson had neglected to tender on these two articles. They can be obtained later.\n\nAs haste was necessary owing to the proximity of March 31 the deal was closed on March 17 and the materials ordered as follows:\n\n**McHolliday, Battleford.**\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Gasoline Engine       | $126.80|\n| Pump Jack             | $59.47 |\n| Windmill, 14' wheel   | $156.20|\n| 50' Tower             | $269.50|\n| Rods                  | $92.40 |\n| Casing                | $368.50|\n\nTotal: $1105.87\n\n**Beatson Hardware Co., Unity, Sask.**\n\n| Item               | Cost   |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| 2 Pneumatic Tanks  | $1058.00|\n| Fittings           | $121.30|\n| Pipe               | $225.30|\n| Working Barrel     | $28.00 |\n\nTotal: $1432.60\n\nThis provides for a total of $2537.47, which is slightly more than the available appropriation. However, it was thought best to award these materials, allowing the drive shoe, drive head and building materials to be purchased later. The building materials, especially, would deteriorate if delivered now.\n\nNo communications whatever were received from the other two firms named.\n\nThe matter of drilling or boring the well has not been settled until Mr. Fettery has had an opportunity to examine wells in the general vicinity. Mistakes in this matter should be avoided if at all possible as once decision is made regarding procedure rectification will be costly.\n\nI am enclosing two copies of Mr. Nicholson's letter regarding this matter.\nSeveral Calgary experts and others have been interviewed on the subject.

Letters of confirmation are being mailed today.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 10th instant regarding the new water supply system for the Thunderchief Indian residential school, I enclose herewith copies of correspondence received from Mr. Hoover with respect to purchases of machinery and equipment.\n\nThis correspondence is described in Mr. Hoover's letter of the 19th instant, copy of which is also enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI wish to advise you that I have today received a telegram from Mr. A.F. MacKenzie, Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, dated March 31, reading as follows:\n\n\"Reference your telegram re Thunderchild School have accounts dated March Thirty first and forward to reach Ottawa by April Fifteenth\".\n\nThis was in answer to my wire of March 30 to you.\n\nI received a wire from Father Allard dated March 31 stating as follows:\n\n\"The only material arrived is a second hand engine and 300 ft. of casing from McPherson and Thom\".\n\nI immediately wrote to M.A. Holliday of Battleford for whom McPherson & Thom of Regina are acting, requesting an explanation of the shipment of a supposed second-hand engine and stating that before payment can be made, the matter will have to be explained as it is obvious from the specifications that a new engine was intended.\n\nI might say that the delivery of material at Delmas appears to be a slow process but it cannot be hurried except possibly by reminder.\n\nI am not at present able to state how much of the material will be at Delmas by April 10; this being the latest date possible if Mr. MacKenzie's wire be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nMcPherson and Thom\n\nRegina, Sask., April 7th 1934.\n\nMr. O.H.

Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are enclosing invoices covering the material, as we understand that it is necessary to have these invoices in your hands early enough so that copies may be forwarded by you to Ottawa by the 15th instant.\n\nIn sending this invoice, it is necessary for us to advise that the windmill, the tower, and the rods have not, as yet, been shipped. These are coming from the Factory, and should be here the first of the week. Just as soon as they arrive, shipment will be made.\n\nYou will notice that there is a little difference in the amount of casing and rods, as it was impossible to pick out just the exact amount, as referred to in your Tenders.\n\nWe are forwarding a copy of this invoice to Mr. M.A. Holliday of Battleford, and also a copy of this letter.\n\nWe trust that you will find everything satisfactory, which we feel quite certain you will, and we also wish to take this opportunity of thanking you for the order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcPherson & Thom (Sales Agents)\nOntario Wind Engine & Pump Co.\n(Western Branch) Limited.\n\nper D.G.

These invoices cover only those goods which have been delivered at Delmas.\n\nIn my letter of April 3 the matter of the gasoline engine was described and Father Allard's telegram quoted, also the fact that I wrote to Mr. Holliday. Receiving no answer from him I sent a night lettergram on April 6 as follows:\n\n\"Re your invoices just received (received on April 5) and my letter of March thirty-one it now becomes necessary to have certificate from you stating that engine as supplied is new and has never been used otherwise we must eliminate engine from invoice for present payment stop wire certification Saturday.\"\n\nMeanwhile, I received a wire from Father Allard as follows:\n\n\"Received O.K. from Unity two tanks but no fittings the engine already mentioned is second hand pretty much shop worn very old model of no use to us\".\n\nI received a wire from Mr. Holliday on April 7 as follows:\n\n\"As per advice from Regina can guarantee engine is new\".\n\nEven with this guarantee I do not wish to take the responsibility of certifying the engine for payment until more information is obtained. Consequently the casing is the only item properly vouched for in Mr. Holliday's invoice (through McPherson & Thom) on the present date.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa.\nThe increased price for rods and casing and explanations therefor will be noted in the enclosed copies of letters. I agree with the increased price as explained.\n\nIn the case of the invoices of the Beatson Hardware Co. of Unity, Sask., in spite of warnings they were found to be dated April 7 when received on April 9. As sufficient time was not available for transfer of letters to and from Unity, I caused the date to be changed in this office.\n\nSeparate invoices for tanks, pipe and fittings were sent to us although the tanks only have arrived at Delmas to date. The remainder are en route.\n\nIt would therefore appear that the items available for payment from the 1933-34 appropriation are as follows:\n\nM.A. Holliday, Battleford, Sask.\n(Invoice of McPherson & Thom)\n303 ft. 5-5/8\" Casing. $372.19\n\nIt will be noted that the invoice covers this amount only by certification.\n\nBeatson Hardware Co., Unity, Sask.\n2 Horizontal pneumatic tanks\n4' diam. x 24' long. $1058.00\n\nI would therefore recommend that these several payments be made.

MACDONALD, INDIAN AGENT.\n\n---\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith, the Annual school report for the Battleford Agency, for the year ending March 31st 1934.\n\nThere are now five schools in the Agency, the Thunderchild and Beauval Residential Schools and Day schools at Red Pheasant, Little Pine and Thunderchild reserves.\n\nThunderchild Residential.\n\nThis school is in the Village of Delmas about 18 miles west of Delmas on the main line of the Canadian National Railway. The building is of frame construction with full basement and stone and cement foundation; the old or main building is 2\u00bd storey and the two wings on the north and south are three storey, the building is steam heated and fully modern. Their water supply is from the Railway track water tank, but steps are now under way to have their own water supply which is being installed by the Department.\n\nFarming at the school is only on a small scale and at present about 40 acres are under cultivation there is a modern barn and there are usually twelve to fifteen milk cows in use.\n\nThe Staff consists of the Principal, 12 to 15 sisters, a Steam engineer, night watchman and a laborer and there is authority for 120 pupils at the school which is usually well up to capacity and is full at the present time.\n\nThis school is always well kept and everything in perfect condition, the children are well fed, clothed and are a clean healthy looking lot of pupils, happy and contented, there has not been a runaway from this school for years. This school is owned by the Sisters.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOFFICE OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose Official Cheque No. ________\n\nin payment of your claim as detailed hereunder.\n\nTHE RECEIVER GENERAL\n\nAPR 17 1934\n\nOttawa,\n\nPlease quote Cheque Number when referring to this remittance\n\nV 188 SCH 663 / 243 ER 1283\n\nREFUND TO TRUST FUND %C 136,\nEXPENDITURE FROM ADVANCE BY\nCHEQUE NO 1692\n\nMARCH %C P A FETTERLY\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nNO ACKNOWLEDGMENT IS NECESSARY.\nRe Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of 14th instant regarding the gasoline engine supplied by McPherson & Thom of Regina through M.A. Holliday, of Battleford, I wish to state that Mr. Fetterly has informed me that he interviewed Mr. Thom in Regina on April 16 while in that city on a regular Hydrometric trip.\n\nMr. Thom stated that this was one of five or six \"Toronto\" 5 horse power engines which had been in stock in Regina for seven or eight years. They had not been sold because of displacement by tractors. These engines had never been used, but had become slightly shop worn. He offered to \"Duo\" the one supplied, if we wish. He stated that they tested it thoroughly before shipping to Delmas. He also stated that a substitute would be merely a replica.\n\nMr. Fetterly examined those left in the warehouse which were duplicates of the one dispatched. Not being a gas engine expert the examination was only of a superficial nature. Mr. Thom stated that the wholesale price of this engine was $150 with a retail value of $180 but that in order to move the stock he had quoted $129.80 in the tender.\n\nThe material left Regina April 20.\n\nHowever, before deciding on the matter it will be necessary for Mr. Fetterly to interview the Principal and examine the engine on his next trip to Battleford.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nCOPY.\n\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, DELMAS, SASK.,\n\nApril 24, 1934.\n\nMr. O.H.

The Battleford Lumber & Supplies Limited will supply the building materials.\n\nReferring to my letter of March 19th and to copies of letters to the two tenderers, of the same date, I have received a letter from Rev. Father Allard that the various materials have arrived. I am enclosing two copies of his letter. I was impressed with Father Allard's business ability and therefore have no hesitation in accepting his certification.\n\nEncs.\n\nTo capitulate, the materials are as follows:\n\nM.A. Holliday, Battleford, Sask.\n\n1 - 5H.P.

He can therefore interview Messrs. Nicholson and Ramsick re well drilling and Holliday and Beatson Hardware Co. re the various matters.\n\nAs before mentioned, the well will need to be sunk before anything else is done.\n\nI am not at present aware of the intended procedure of the Indian Department regarding construction. If the Department intend that this work will be supervised by this office, I would suggest that Mr. Fetterly be empowered to make progress on his present trip to Duck Lake for the sake of economy.\n\nMr. George Devlin, Carpenter, of North Battleford, Sask., was in practical charge of the Onion Lake School.\nwater supply improvement last year. He is an excellent and reliable workman. It is possible that he could be engaged by the week instead of hourly.\n\nI would also suggest that labourers be hired in Dalmas to save living expenses. Dalmas is less than 20 miles west of Battleford.\n\nIf feasible, this office could be advised by mail or wire immediately on receipt of this letter of the intentions of the Department. I could then instruct Mr. Fetterly who will be in the general vicinity for 10 or 12 days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the new water supply system for the Thunderchild Indian school, I enclose copies of two letters received from Mr. Hoover dated the 20th and the 27th instant, together with accounts for equipment and machinery as follows:\n\nM.A. Holliday, Battleford, $610.95\nBeaton Hardware Co., Unity, 387.10\n\nThe payment of these accounts is recommended by Mr. Hoover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

He has already been furnished with the names of two well-drillers.\n\nWith reference to the labour required for the construction of this system, if you will advise me the amount of labour required the necessary instructions will be given you as to who may be employed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

The Treasury Branch of this Department has objected to payment of the account from McPherson & Thom Company. They consider that this account should be made out on the letter head of the firm. I would appreciate if you would arrange to secure an account, in triplicate, made out in the manner mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRe. Thunderchild Indian School, Delmas, Sask.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to labourer and a foreman carpenter as discussed in my letter of the 27th ult., please find herewith an extract of a letter just received from Mr. P.A. Fetterly who is at present in the field.\n\n\"I beg to report that I had a conference with Father Allard, Principal, re the school supply system this evening.\n\nIn the letter to the Director dated about April 28, we mentioned talking to George Devlin of North Battleford. On talking to Father Allard I find that he knows of a foreman carpenter and builder and contractor here at Delmas who has built several structures for him and in whom Father Allard has confidence. His name is A. Dupont. He thinks we could get Dupont as practical foreman on the job for 40\u00a2 per hour.\n\nFor the digging and drawing of gravel we would need 3 men and teams at 50\u00a2 per hr. (25\u00a2 + 25\u00a2) and two extra men at 25\u00a2 per hr. We could get them all in Delmas thus saving extra expense of board and room, which, if the men had to pay, would add considerably to the cost.\n\nThe gravel is less than 1/2 Mile away at 1.50 yd.\"\n\nFrom this further information it will be apparently much cheaper to employ men at Delmas and if the work is desired to be carried forward without delay I might be able to have Mr. Fetterly initiate the work before he returns.

The work is being carried out under the supervision of the District Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch. In carrying out this work I am advised by the Engineer that the services of one fellow carpenter, one bricklayer, two teamsters and teams and two laborers will be required. Will you please advise me who may be employed for this work? The District Engineer recommends that all men should be obtained from Delmas to save extra expense of room and board, and the Reverend Principal recommends Mr. A. Dupont as foreman.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nUnity, Sask.,\nFeb. 21, 1934.\n\nU.H.

Fetterly, B.Sc., R.P.E.\n\n1. Purpose of Report\n\nA Preliminary Report on the above named subject was prepared on January 23, 1934. An Addendum Report was prepared on January 30, 1934.\n\nSince that time material has been ordered and delivered.\n\nThe writer visited the school on August 27th and on September 3 to inspect progress of drilling and to confer with the carpenters, etc., regarding the construction of the basement in pursuance to the letter of instructions from the Director dated August 2, 1934.\n\n2. Progress of Well Drilling\n\nMr. Joseph Mahrick, well driller, began drilling on August 19. He found soil to a depth of 4 feet. He then struck quicksand. This quicksand is different from other quicksand of his experience. As soon as the casing enters it and the sand becomes wet it grips the casing so that a blow only lowers it a fraction of an inch. He was compelled to dig a hole 15 feet deep and 4 feet in diameter around the pipe and insert 20 feet of 8 inch casing obtained from Duck Lake School. The log is now:- 4' earth 22' Sand, 8' Clay and sand to 88'.\nHe is having a great deal of difficulty in lowering the casing. During the writer's visit on September 3, he arrived from Unity with a hydraulic outfit. He was going to try the hydraulic system. He mentioned that he might find it necessary to insert a slightly smaller casing, say $4\\frac{1}{2}$\" after a certain depth inside the $5-5/8$\" casing.\n\nMr. Mahrick did not say very much but he was obviously disturbed over the difficulties he has encountered. He is, of course, being paid by the foot.\n\n3. **Progress of Basement.**\n\nThe writer ascertained over the phone that Mr. G.A. Webster, of Unity, intended to proceed to the School with his helper only when the basement and tanks were in place and ready for connections. He is a tinsmith and steamfitter.\n\nMr. L.A. Riches of Riches and Jaynes, the other parties mentioned in the letter of instructions, met the writer at the School on September 3. The details of installation were then described and discussed.\n\nMr. Riches is beginning construction of the basement on September 10 with 3 men whom he will take from Unity. He will be paid at the rate of 50\u00a2 per hour while the men will receive 25\u00a2 per hour, similarly to the men at Duck Lake School. The work should occupy about one month.\n\nThe drilling and construction will be carried\non simultaneously for a time.\n\nThere is no way of ascertaining either the length of time occupied by Mr. Rahrick in drilling or his ultimate success in obtaining water. This Department now is well conversant with the hazards in this connection. At any rate, the basement has to be built regardless of the source of the water.\n\n4. Excavation under Kitchen.\n\nWhen the water supply system was first considered Father Allard, the Principal, stated that the School wished to excavate an area under the kitchen and contiguous to the proposed basement to provide for freer ingress into the tank basement. This excavation consists of about 80 cubic yards of earth. Father Allard at that time proposed that the school bear the expense.\n\nHe informed the writer on the present visit that school funds were lower than he had anticipated and that they could not undertake payment of costs. He stated that he was proceeding to Regina on September 4 to interview Mr. Murison on the subject and also on that of a concrete root cellar to the west of the tank basement.\n\nThe writer did not commit himself on the matter to Father Allard but it appears logical that this excavation should be done at the same time as the principal work. It certainly cannot be done after the walls are built and everything enclosed. It is therefore recommended that this extra work be undertaken at the same time. The extra cost will probably not exceed $50.00. As a matter of fact, this should be decided upon\nimmediately as the work of excavation is beginning on September 10.\n\nMr. Riches will obtain a team locally (Delmas) as the Fresno work will only occupy a few days.\n\n5. Conclusion.\n\nThe Director will be kept informed of development and progress. Messrs. Rahrick and Riches were informed that Father Allard would be in practical charge as time keeper and representative of the Engineer-in-Charge, and in the absence of the writer. He understands the work thoroughly. It might be added that the men will attend to sustenance themselves.\n\nFather Allard was requested to send a sample of water, if and when encountered, for analysis, to this office.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nO.H. Hoover\nEngineer-in-Charge.\n\nCALGARY, Alta. September 10, 1934.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith an Interim Report dated the 10th instant by Mr. P.A. Fetterly on the progress which is being made with the new water supply system at Thunderchild Indian School.\n\nYou will note that the well driller is making slow progress and there is no indication at present as to the depth at which water will be found. The recommendation is made that some additional excavation be authorized at this time to provide an area under the kitchen and contiguous with the basement now under construction, to provide for more easy access into the tank basement. The extra cost of this excavation will, as stated, probably not exceed $50, and I shall be glad to have your authority to have this work done as recommended in the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nResidential School\nDelmas, Sask.\nSept. 20th 1934.\n\nMr. O.H. Hoover,\nEngineer-in-Charge,\nDominion Bureau,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAlthough working hard and very conscientiously our well digger did not yet get water. They reached today 385 feet and will be very glad if you could help them out in the expenses already incurred, - let us say $50. Being out of found (meals and bed expenses, he means) they will require about that to carry on this work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) J.H.O. Allard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nRe Thunderchild Indian School\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing two copies of a letter dated 20th instant received from Father Allard. I wired you on 24th instant. In addition I wired Father Allard by night lettergram as follows:\n\n\"What is present depth of well and size of hole at bottom stop Is further casing necessary stop Have you any further suggestions to make stop Wire collect stop Have Kahrick submit invoice for two hundred fifty feet of drilling at contract price certified by yourself by letter\".\n\nI received a wire this morning (Sept. 26) from Father Allard as follows:\n\n\"Present depth of well three hundred ninety five feet size of hole at bottom six and one half inch no casing necessary at present\".\n\nThe wire was sent to inform you immediately of conditions. The driller has evidently drilled over 300 feet since Mr. Wetterly's visit of September 3. Apparently Mr. Kahrick worked through sand with the hydraulic system mentioned in last report, although this is conjecture only. I cannot see how the presence of Mr. Wetterly would be of use just now.\n\nAs mentioned in one report a farmer's well at Highgate, 6 miles south-east and similarly placed relative to the river, is \"about\" 300 feet deep. Water was obtained at this depth in the well.\n\nThe hole at Thunderchild school must now be below the river bottom which is 2\u00bd miles to the north.\n\nThe cost now amounts to nearly $1300.\n\nIt is quite possible that the ultimate supply\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nwill have to come from subsurface wells, say up to 60 feet, accumulations to be stored in a concrete reservoir placed just below the surface, although this is a cumbersome system.\n\nThey certainly cannot depend on the present source indefinitely as the Railway will wish to remove their tank. In addition a man has to be engaged continuously for the purpose of pumping to the Railway tank from the river. The pipes, also, would require renewal at some time in the future.\n\nAs indicated in my wire, I would recommend that J. Rahrick whose address is Unity, Sask., receive an interim payment of six hundred dollars with which to carry on.\n\nApparently no new developments have taken place between Sept. 20 and 26 except deepening of the well by 10 feet.\n\nYou will be kept advised of developments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nDelmas, Sask.,\nSept. 25, 1934.\n\nFor work done at the Thunderchild School Delmas in well drilling.\n\nPrice for first two hundred and fifty feet as per contract.\n\n| Depth (ft.) | Price |\n|-------------|-------|\n| 50 ft.      | $75   |\n| 50 ft.      | 100   |\n| 50 ft.      | 125   |\n| 50 ft.      | 150   |\n| 50 ft.      | 175   |\n\n$625\n\n(Sgd) Joe.

Hover,\nEngineer-In-Charge\nDom. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nRe Thunderchild Indian School\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of 27th ultimo regarding the well at the above named school, I instructed Mr. P.A. Betterly, of this staff, to inspect conditions as soon as possible. He visited the school on October 5, spending the whole day conferring with the Principal and with Mr. Rahrick, well-driller, and studying the situation.\n\nHe reports as follows:\n\n1. New Well\n\n\"I personally measured the depth of the well and found it to be 535 feet on October 5. Mr. Rahrick has been using a Hydraulic jet in drilling.\n\n\"The log of the well is as follows:\n\n- 0 - 4' earth\n- 4' - 24' sand (a little water)\n- 24' - 32' shale\n- 32' - 102' sand gravel and quicksand (a little water)\n- 102' - 535' Blue clay and boulders; shale with a few hardpans.\n\n\"In order to obtain a sufficient supply the drill will have to penetrate sand, gravel or \"Coal\" of sufficient water carrying capacity.\"\n\nMr. Rahrick was informed that this office is not authorized to go beyond 500 feet, approximately.\n\nHe, together with his two helpers who are\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nexperienced oil well drillers and practical geologists, have consistently made a close study of the log and believe that the formation is changing slightly and favourably. After a long discussion Mr. Rahrick stated that he had definitely made up his mind to go ahead for another hundred feet, or even possibly down to 700 feet in his own responsibility. This would seem to indicate that he believes he can reach water. He stated that, if he failed, possibly the Department might reimburse him to some extent while if he obtained water the Department would be sufficiently pleased to reward him even more adequately. At any rate he intends to try to get water regardless of possibility of financial reward as he does not wish to leave a job unfinished. I told him plainly that the responsibility was entirely his and he accepted the situation.\n\nHe said he had gone 700' at other times and found water. The water as a rule rises in the hole. He had never been compelled to place a cylinder lower than 300'. As a result of his decision he continued to drill Friday. My note reads:- He is unwilling to give up at present\".\n\nHe has placed only 90' of casing in the well. He said the rest of the hole is sufficiently firm to hold up at present. He had to use dynamite occasionally (10 sticks in one instance at the 400' level) in order to remove boulders. He ruined his 300' of 2\" rope and was compelled to purchase new rope. He put it on while I was there.\n\nThe well is now 535 feet deep as certified definitely by myself. Of course the casing is only inserted for 90 feet.\n\nAccording to the Contract the amount due Mr. Rahrick (without considering the casing) is as follows:\n\n| Depth | Amount |\n|-------|--------|\n| First 50' | $1.50 |\n| Next 50' | $2.00 |\n| 50'     | $2.50 |\n| 50'     | $3.00 |\n| 50'     | $3.50 |\n| 50'     | $4.00 |\n| 50'     | $4.50 |\n| 50'     | $5.00 |\n| 50'     | $5.50 |\n| 50'     | $6.00 |\n\n$1875\n\nExtra 35' $6.50\n\n227.50 depth before notification to stop\n\nTOTAL $2102.50\n\nAs Mr. Joe Rahrick is under a considerable expense I would recommend that an additional $600 be paid to him immediately in addition to the $600 already recommended. Since I have certified the depth no actual invoice is necessary.\n2. **New Basement.**\n\nFour men have been busy on the basement continuously since Sept.17 together with a team and teamster for a portion of the time.\n\nThey have excavated the whole area, 30 feet long by 16' wide outside the building and 14' under the Kitchen. It is 7 feet deep. The earth has been used to level the grounds. A portion of the wall under the School has been constructed (of concrete). Some difficulty was experienced in propping up the school walls but this has been done successfully. I obtained certified time sheets of the men engaged on this work from Sept.17 to Sept.30.\n\nThe following table includes work on all excavation.\n\nFather Allard states that the school will be able to pay for the wall under the school proper, this being an unexpected added expense.\n\nThe time sheet is as follows from Sept.17 to 29 inclusive.\n\n| Name          | Hours | Rate | Total   |\n|---------------|-------|------|---------|\n| L.A.Riches    | 120   | @ 50\u00a2| $60.00  |\n|               |       |      |         |\n| A.Baldry      | 113   | @ 25\u00a2| 28.25   |\n|               |       |      |         |\n| G.Cox         | 115   | @ 25\u00a2| 28.75   |\n|               |       |      |         |\n| M.Quackenbush | 113   | @ 25\u00a2| 28.25   |\n|               |       |      |         |\n\nLacoursiers & Co., 9\u00bd dys.@ $5.00 per dy. 47.50 \" Delmas,Sask.\n\n(team and teamster)\n\n$192.75\n\nA certified time sheet is enclosed herewith. I would recommend that interim payment be made to these employees to September 29.\n\n3. **General Situation.**\n\nThe general situation may be indicated by the fact that I was very considerably dismayed when receiving the views that no water had been struck down to 500 feet. Father Allard was in much the same state of mind and welcomed my appearance on the scene.\n\nSub-surface waters are too small in volume to be much of a factor. Several wells would have to be sunk, etc.,etc. In fact this seems out of the question.\n\nAgain the river is 1\u00bd miles away and several\nI visited the old pump house. It is on the edge of the North Saskatchewan river. The engine is a Fairbanks-Morse 25 h.p. torch ignition oil-burning engine.\n\nThe School Engineer runs the pump two days per week of 5 hours each using 1 gallon gas 2 gallons coal oil per hour, 1 pint of cylinder oil. He pumps 2' in the 60000 gallon tank through a 6\" discharge pipe nearly 2 miles long. This is costing the school $100 per month.\n\nAnother factor is that the trains are not supposed to use water from this tank \"except in cases of emergency\". However, they load their trains heavily at Battleford and cannot get to Lloydminster on one filling. As a result the emergencies arise frequently. The school is pumping this water together with their own supply.\n\nThe Railway consider the tank and pipes as near the end of their usefulness. If necessity for replacement occurs or necessity arises I understand that their plan is to drill a well and construct a tank at Bressaylor, a few miles further west.\n\nIt is possible that in the end the supply will have to be obtained from the river through a 2\" or 2\u00bd\" pipe. It is unfortunate that the school is so far from the river.\n\nThe whole problem is straight cut and is very disturbing.\n\nI hope that Mr. Rahbrick's bravery in going ahead will have its reward as his failure to obtain water will precipitate a very grave and difficult and expensive problem\".\n\nCertified certificates, in quadruplicate, for work completed by Messrs. Rahbrick, Riches, Baldry, Cox, Quackenbush and La Coursiers & Co. are enclosed herewith and payment for same is recommended.\n\nWhen cheques for these payments are forwarded, I would be pleased to be informed of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the water supply system at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School I enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 9th instant from Mr. Hoover outlining the conditions regarding the new well which is being drilled at that school. From this you will see that the well has been drilled for 535 feet without finding any water but the well driller is so confident of finding water eventually that he proposes to continue to 700 feet on his own responsibility.\n\nEnclosed herewith are certificates in duplicate for an additional payment of $675. to Mr. Rahrick, the well driller, and for $192.75 on account of labour employed in constructing the basement. If these accounts are found in order I beg to recommend that they be paid forthwith.\n\nThe certificate on account of Mr. Rahrick covers drilling to 400 feet and there would still be due him an additional 100 feet which, at the contract price, would amount to $575.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Johnston, Chief of the Borings Division of the Geological Survey, with respect to the deep well now being drilled at Thunderechild Indian School. After reading the reports on the well, Mr. Johnston stated that it would be useless to drill below the 700 foot depth now reached, that records of wells drilled in that district showed that water, if found at all, was generally at depths from 18 to 30 feet below the surface, no record of water being found deeper than 200 to 300 feet, and that if water should be struck at a lower depth in this formation it would be salt and unfit for use.\n\nGenerally speaking, the water near the surface is of better quality than that found lower down and in this case the river water, especially if filtered through a standpipe or caisson in the river, would be better than the well water. Also if the water in the well did not rise to say 200 feet from the surface, the cost of pumping from the river would not be much greater than the cost of pumping out of the well.\n\nIn this particular case, Mr. Johnston suggested that it would be best to try and make a well out of the existing drilled hole, as a preliminary measure and before abandoning it, in the following manner:\n\n(a) Pull the casing out of the hole and replace with casing having screens at the two horizons where water has been found; that is between 4 feet and 24 feet and between 32 feet and 102 feet according to the log supplied in Mr. Hoover's letter of October 9th.\n\n(b) If the casing cannot be pulled out due to the quicksand or for other reasons, perforate the casing at the horizons where water has been found and insert screens at these levels.\n\n(c) Abandon the lower part of the well.\n\nIf these measures fail to produce a sufficient quantity of water, there appear to be two alternatives to obtain a water supply.\n\n1. Drill or dig two or more shallow wells not exceeding 30 feet deep, of considerable width, similar to those already in existence, and connect them with pipes or drains so that the water may be collected in one well for pumping. These in effect would be\nunderground tanks for seepage, and except during a succession of dry years as at present, might readily supply enough water for the school.\n\n2. Pump water from the North Saskatchewan river, with or without arrangements for filtering and storing it.\n\nM.F.

Macdonald our Indian Agent of Battleford and to Mr. Joe Rahrick, our Well Driller, the spring I discovered a few days ago and on account of which I wired to you yesterday. Both men admit without hesitation that they never saw such a plentiful source of water. A six inch pipe could hardly suffice to carry the water that shoots out of it about 25 feet below the ground level. But... Is it in the possibilities to bring that water to the school, without too high expense, a distance of 1\u00bd mile? An Engineer only could say it.\n\nPlease have Mr. Betterly bring his Surveyor's level along with him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) J. H. O. Allard.\n\nPrincipal.\nRe Thunderchild Indian School\n\nSir,-\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th inst., together with a memorandum which sets out the view of Mr. Johnston, the chief of the Borings Division of the Geological Survey.\n\nThe suggestion as set forth in paragraph (a), (b) and (c), of the memorandum have been transmitted to Rev. Father Allard, and Mr. Rahbrick, the well driller, requesting new terms from Mr. Rahbrick for the undertaking of the suggested work and also his reaction in reference to such a suggested scheme.\n\nIn the meantime to date I have no reply from Mr. Rahbrick but two very interesting communications from Rev. Father Allard are received,- a wire of Oct. 24th and letter of Oct. 25th copies of which are herewith and which will be found to be self-explanatory.\n\nIt is now proposed to have Mr. Fetterly again visit the school possibly next week to investigate the feasibility of the new spring before Mr. Rahbrick goes forward with the new work as suggested and a full report will be submitted covering his visit as soon as possible.\n\nIn reply to the last paragraph of your letter please find herewith in triplicate, certificates covering the drilling by Mr. Rahbrick as follows:-\n\n| Depth Range | Cost   |\n|-------------|-------|\n| 250 to 400 feet | $675.00 |\n| 400 to 500 feet | $575.00 |\n| 500 to 535 feet | $227.00 |\n| 535 to 700 feet |       |\n\nPlease note that a certificate for the well drilling signed by myself only for the portion 250 to 400 feet of well as above mentioned was forwarded with my letter of Oct. 9th but\n\nThe Director,\nOttawa.\nconsidering that this certificate should have been signed by Mr. Rahrick and Rev. Father Allard, I have duplicated the same as above.\n\nI would be glad to be informed when Mr. Rahrick is paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the water supply system at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School I enclose herewith copy of a letter from Mr. Hoover, dated the 26th instant together with certificates in duplicate, covering the drilling of the deep well by Mr. Rahrick for the full depth completed.\n\nIt will be noted that the certificate covering the portion 250 feet to 400 feet was sent you with my letter of the 13th instant, but as that certificate had not been signed by Mr. Rahrick and Rev. Father Allard, a duplicate certificate is now being supplied. Regarding the drilling from 535 feet to 700 feet, I do not feel the Department is obligated to pay for this as Mr. Rahrick carried this out at his own risk and without instructions from the Indian Department or from Mr. Hoover.\n\nYou will note that a spring appears to have been discovered about a mile and a quarter from the school and Mr. Fetterly is investigating the possibility of obtaining water from this source.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to inform you that I visited the above named school to ascertain the possibilities of the spring mentioned by Father Allard.\n\nI beg to report, in a preliminary way, that I interviewed Mr. Rahrick and also obtained information regarding the spring.\n\nWe discussed the suggestions mentioned in the Director's letter.\n\nNeither (a), (b) or (c) are practical as only 5 balers (25 gallons) collected in 12 hours. Any system which involves using water in the sand from 4' to 100' is doomed to failure because of the paucity of water at these depths, the sand being hardly more than damp. Shallow wells in the vicinity 30' or 40' deep produce barely sufficient water for a family. That at 100' or less is similar.\n\nPerforating the casing would produce similar results, viz:- only a nominal amount of water. It is to be noted that the casing is only down to 90 ft. at present. It cannot be pulled. (A perforator costs $700 or $800 according to Mr. Rahrick).\n\nI asked Mr. Rahrick what he \"honed\" to obtain for the drilling from 535' to 700'. He states, incidentally, that the actual depth is over 700 feet. He also evidently considers that the official depth is 535 feet, not 500, as\n\nO.H. Hoover, Esq.,\nCalgary,\nAlberta.\nhe received word to stop when he reached 535'. This appears only fair, as a matter of fact.\n\nHe stated that he thought that a 50-50 basis should be considered and named $600 gross. A 50-50 division would amount to $660 (165' x \u00bd of $8.00). I wish to obtain his idea of a fair deal.\n\nHe had not removed his rig from the School, although he had returned home to Unity himself. The reason for this was that he had a suggestion to make when I arrived (he came in from Unity today). His suggestion was to drill to the 200' depth - that is, between clay and shale, at some other point. He thought possibly water would be obtained. However, he removed his rig to Unity to-day after his conversation with me. Incidentally, I was told to-day that other wells were sunk to considerable depth in the general vicinity to 300' or 500' without water. One at Meota, 12 miles east, was 1100 ft. with no water. Other wells have produced water at various horizons. And so it goes.\n\nThe Spring.\n\nThe spring mentioned by Father Allard in his telegram lies to the Northwest of the school. It is on the farm of Mr. A. Lavallee and crosses the School farm and that of Mrs. U. Douville. It lies at an azimuth of 318\u00b0 from the school. The spring is 7325 feet from the basement wall near the drilled well.\n\nI ran a straight transit line from the School to the spring, using the 200 foot chain to place stakes 100 feet apart. I then obtained a profile of each 100' point. The\nline falls fairly gradually with some rolls and irregularities from Sta. 0 to Sta. 71 + 90, the break of the hill. The fall from the School to the break on the hill is about 45 feet. The fall from the break to the spring, a distance of 130 feet, is 35 feet. The spring is in a coulee about 3/4 mile from the river proper. This hill forms a first break, as it were, in the descent to the river, over 200 feet further down. The coulee is really 100 feet wide and shallow, with the spring outlet in a smaller shallow coulee.\n\nThe farm house is at Sta. 70 and about 100 feet west of the line of stakes.\n\nI tested the yield of the spring. The principal stream alone filled a 5 gallon pail in 15 seconds, a total of 28,800 gallons per day. The water actually pours out in a large stream over a trough which was put in 20 years ago and never removed. This spring water appears pure and it never varies in volume. The principal stream is probably three-quarters of the total amount emerging from the bank.\n\nFather Allard was on a parochial visit to this home a few days ago. He was offered a drink of water. It was so cold and refreshing and free from alkali that he asked where it was obtained. He was shown the spring and also a pail that had been used to hold it for a year. This pail is quite clean and unmarked, as I saw it afterwards. I obtained a quart self-sealer full for analysis.\n\nThis report is a preliminary one as I may not return for several days and possibly the Director would be interested in ascertaining immediately my findings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) P.A. Fetterly.\nRe Thunderchild Indian School\n\nSir,\n\nFurther to my letter of the 26th ult., paragraph four, please find herewith, in duplicate, a copy of a preliminary report just received from Mr. F.A. Fettery with reference to the spring which has recently been located some 7300 feet distant from the above school. From this report it would appear that an excellent supply of water is available at the spring; and as soon as possible a further report with more details will be submitted in reference to the spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 13, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo (your File 40782-W), with reference to the water supply system at the Thunderchild Indian Residential School and enclosing copy of a communication from the engineer in charge, together with certificates, in duplicate, for the amount due Mr. Rahrick.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that a cheque to the amount of $202.50 is being sent Mr. Rahrick, Unity, Sask., in payment for the drilling of the well from the 400 feet to the 535 ft. depth. He had previously been paid for drilling to the 400 ft. depth. It is noted that Mr. Rahrick continued the drilling of the well to a depth of 700 ft. and that he carried out, at his own risk and without instructions, the drilling of the well below the 535 foot depth. In view of your statement, that you do not feel the Department to be obligated to pay Mr. Rahrick for the depth he drilled in excess of 535 feet, the Department is not paying him for this work. It would appear that no water has been obtained and that the well may ultimately have to be abandoned.\n\nThe Department has received the copy of the communication forwarded to you from Mr. Hoover, the engineer in charge, dated the 6th instant, together with copy of report of Mr. Fetterly, with reference to the spring which has recently been located. We will await a further report, with full details and an estimate of the cost involved in obtaining water from this spring for use of the above named school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power &\nHydrometric Bureau,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nA.

Netterly, B.Sc., R.P.E.\n\n1. Purpose of Report\n\nA wire was received from Father Allard, on Oct. 24, followed by a letter, describing a spring he had found about 1\u00bd miles from the school which might be used for supply. Copies of the letter and telegram were sent to you on Oct. 26.\n\nThe writer visited the school on November 2 and examined the spring. He then prepared a preliminary report on the same evening. Copies of this report were sent to Ottawa under date November 6.\n\n2. Comparative Elevations.\n\nA profile was run in a straight line from the school to the spring to ascertain the general configuration of the surface and the difference in height. An actual construction line would diverge from this straight line westward in several places such as the vicinities of Stations 14, 26, 38, 42, 46, 62. In other words a falling contour would have to be located in order to negotiate the slightly rolling land. The general down slope is to the north and the river. Eight angles would be used.\n\nThe surface of the land at the new basement is\n2.\n\n99.6. The break in the hill at Station 71/90 is\n56.2. Thus the total fall from the school to the break\nis 43.4 feet, an average of 6' in 100' or 6%. The fall\nfrom the break at 71/90 to the spring at 73/24 (Elevation\n19.8) is 36.4 feet, an average of 27%.\n\nThe spring coulee falls rapidly to the\nnorth.\n\n3. Ownership of Spring.\n\nThe owner of the land upon which the spring\nis located, Mr. A. Lavallee of Delmas, naturally thinks\nthat the spring belongs to him and valued it at $1000 in\nconversation with Father Allard.\n\nHowever, the Dominion Irrigation Act vested\nownership in the Crown, as the writer understands it, and\nno doubt this ownership is now vested in the province by\nthe provincial act.\n\nAs a precautionary measure the writer inter-\nviewed Mr. C.J. McGavin of the Department of Natural Resources\nat Regina, regarding the matter. He agreed to give us a\ntentative and unofficial prior right to file. Normal\napplication is deferred for the present.\n\n4. Estimates.\n\nIt would necessitate a too great loss of\nvaluable time under present conditions for the writer to\nprepare more than the most approximate and tentative\nplans and estimates. Another reason is that\nthere is no doubt that the expense of development would be considerable because of the length of pipe and trench. The Department of Indian Affairs may not think it advisable to go further. The writer believes that it is an excellent and practicable source of water but the question of advisability of spending the money must be left with the Department.\n\nThe present system may cease at any time although present indications do not denote immediate failure although the expense is considerable. That would be to unduly alarm. Frequent repairs are however necessary.\n\nIt must be confessed that the idea of furnishing water to the town has occurred to the writer but this may be left for future consideration.\n\nThe \"owner\" of the spring could have a connection placed in his house which is only 100 feet from the line of pipe.\n\nThe estimates may be divided into three parts:\n\n(a) Spring.\n\nA hydraulic ram has been considered, as probably 40,000 or 50,000 gallons per day are produced while 6000 or 7000 gallons per day are needed at the school. The elevation (spring to tank) is about 75 feet. The coulee falls rapidly. A ram would have to be housed. Costs of a ram have not yet been obtained. One dealer\nthought that the work, including head, friction on\n7300 feet of 2\" or 2\u00bd\" pipe and working pressure of the\ntanks, would be too great for practical use of a ram.\nIt would probably amount to 100 or 110 feet roughly.\nThis matter has been only tentatively considered.\n\nIf a regular pumping system were installed\nthe items would be as follows: Concrete cistern 8x8x8,\nsay, pump house, gasoline engine, force pump or\ncentrifugal pump and accessories. This would cost possibly\n$1000 or $1100 altogether.\n\n(b) Trench and pipe.\n\nEnquiries have been made to the Town Engineer\nof North Battleford, Sask. (20 miles from the school) regard-\ning a trench-digging machine the town is said to possess.\nData regarding frost line was also requested. However\ntentative enquiries in Calgary have indicated that the\ncost of trenching and backfilling a 9' trench amounts to\n50\u00a2 per lineal foot for a machine and $1.50 for hand\nlabour. A 2\" pipe costs about 35\u00a2 and 2\u00bd\" pipe 38\u00a2 per\nfoot.\n\nThus the cost of a completed trench would\nappear to amount to 90\u00a2 to $1.00 per foot. This price\nmust be considered as tentative only until more specific\ndata is obtained. A trench 6' or 8\u00bd\" deep would be\nproportionately less.\n\nThe cost of the trench would therefore be about\n$7,000 with a trench digging machine, or $15,000 by hand\nlabour.\n(a) School.\n\nThe water could be pumped directly into the pressure tanks but some form of automatic control would have to be evolved at the pumping plant. One sees no reason for a cistern at the school. Electricity could not well be used at the pumping plant as it is not very practical, the school not having much available power from the two Delco Light plants. In addition, the power, if available, would have to be taken to the spring, 7300 feet away.\n\nThe total cost would therefore be in the general vicinity of $9,000. This however would produce a sure and pure supply.\n\n5. Conclusions.\n\nOwing to failure of the well this would appear to be the only source available except the present source which will need rehabilitation frequently in part and possible replacement in the near or distant future. Two copies of a sketch plan are enclosed.\n\nThese are sufficient for present purposes as there was no practical value in spending time preparing detail plans until it is known whether the work will be proceeded with.\n\nFather Allard stated that he was prepared to carry on as at present, even during the winter, until a competent system is decided upon.\n\nThe work could not well be done until spring as experience has taught this office that winter work in this vicinity practically doubles the cost.\n\nP.A. Setterly\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Nov. 15, 1934.\nP.S. A letter has just been received from Father Allard stating that the \"trench-digging\" machine he had heard about in North Battleford is in reality a stone crusher. However, a machine may be available elsewhere. Maple Creek put in a new water system with one.\n\nThis sort of thing is very difficult to handle as many machines must be available if one knew where to find them.\n\nIt has since been suggested that\n\nNumber of gallons delivered by a ram in 24 hours = \n\nGal. delivered by spring per minute x 936 x height of spring above ram \u00f7 by height in feet between ram and point of delivery.\n\ne.g. \\( \\frac{25 \\text{ gal.} \\times 936 \\times 10}{75' + 25 \\text{ (friction etc.)}} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{25 \\times 936 \\times 10}{100} = 2340 \\text{ gallons per day.} \\)\n\nThis allows the ram to be placed 10' below spring. This could be increased by lengthening the drive pipe and placing the ram further down the coulee. All possibilities have been considered only tentatively.\n\nA No.8 ram costs about $250.\n\nP.A.F.\n\nP.A.F.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the spring which has been discovered near Thunderchild Indian School and which may possibly be made available as a source of water supply I enclose herewith a Progress Report supplementary to that of October 26th prepared by Mr. Fetterly and dated the 15th instant, from which it appears that a plentiful supply of water could be made available from the spring but that the cost would be in the vicinity of between $9,000 and $16,000 according to how the work is carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEncl.\n\nJ.T.
