There has been some talk of another convention being delayed to be composed solely of farmers, as it appears some parade was caused by a journalist. It is said that the number selected to go to Ottawa, to be held at Brandon shortly. At the Winnipeg meeting, a resolution was passed to memorialize the British Government for a repeal of the Confederation Act, and such modification of it as would allow Manitoba, the North West Territories and British Columbia to get out of a new confederation of their own. It is not a very plausible scheme, but there should be a movement made from a North West point of view, it is folly to suppose that the Government will entertain it for a moment. At the time of the passage of the British North America Act, the North West was afterwards, Nova Scotia, which was strongly opposed to the Union, tried every means to prevent it, and was refused from the ballot boxes, and sent some of her ablest men to England to represent the rate Confederation, but it was of no avail. The result was \"no terms\" financially, but the bonds of union like the sea, well known to the North West, have been strengthened, and as we have taken each other for better or worse, we have no reason to complain. At this juncture, while we think it would be useless agitating for repeal or secession, we heartily approve of the action taken by the farmers of Manitoba in forming a union and sending delegates to Ottawa to present their views to the Dominion government and pray for redress\u2014and we should be glad to see their example followed by the farmers of North West, who labor under much greater disadvantages and drawbacks than ours. More could be accomplished by the farmers of North West questions, by sending a competent delegation or delegates to Ottawa during the coming session, supported by all the memorials and remonstrances that could be written.\n\nOUR MINERAL RESOURCES.\n\nQuite an interest has been created in the discovery of gold by the report of rich gold finds in the North more gap. There is no doubt that within the recesses of the Rockies there are vast mineral deposits of gold, silver, lead, and probably iron ore, which will be developed by the advance of the C. P. R. into that country, and destined for its future greatness, aided upon by agricultural productions, vast as they undoubtedly are, and as they hang, when emptied and skilled labor has been brought to bear upon its hidden mineral wealth, it will be without a doubt the Eldorado of the continent. There is no doubt that an immense immigration will be attracted to these new names of tergeminus, and the advantages and the forms which are springing up along the line as if by magic will participate in the benefits of the new era. We while, while rejoicing in the prosperity of any portion of this vast domain, we have a special interest in those parts which we believe is in store for Prince Albert, if we only have patience to wait and bide our time. It is sure to come.\n\n\"AN ARCTIC WAVE.\"\n\nOur contemporary, the Halifax, N.S. Morning Chronicle, speaks of the recent an \"arctic wave\" they had down there last month, during which the thermometer fell to a low of -19\u00b0 below zero. We call that cold weather. What would you say to 63\u00b0 below? For the last month we have never seen the higher than 35\u00b0 below zero, and yet we feel that we have our being,\" and enjoy ourselves with outdoor sports, such as curling, skating and hockey. We have always used to any climate, if we take care of himself, but the \"blizzards\" have the advantage over the North Western in the enjoyment of those delightful keen winds from off the Atlantic which we have not, but in their place the lovely \"whitewash\" thunders down from the Rockies from the blue waters of the Pacific. There is a Province which we are proud to belong to, and we trust it will be a merit to our suffering fellow countrymen in the \"little province by the sea.\"\n\nTHE C. P. R. STRIKE.\n\nThe strike which has interfered so seriously with traffic on the C. P. R. for several days now is virtually ended. The machine shops have been reopened, to the great joy of the hitherto locked-out workmen, who were finally notified yesterday of the strike; and many of the engineers, firemen and other employees along the line have returned to their homes and duties.

One day, while he was out playing, he came across a poor woman and her baby. The woman looked very sad and hungry, and Jack knew he had to help them.\n\nJack took the woman and her baby home with him. He fed them and gave them shelter. The woman was grateful and thanked Jack for his kindness.\n\nOver time, Jack became very fond of the woman and her baby. He started to take care of them like they were his own family. The woman and her baby were very happy to have Jack's help.\n\nThe story shows us that helping others can bring joy and happiness to everyone involved.

No. III.\u2014 History of the Hudson Bay Company in the Northwest Terri- tors.\n\nWe quote some extracts from a very interesting paper read by Prof. Bryce at a recent meeting of the Historical Society of Ontario. The paper was read by an employee of the North West Fur Trading Company, the proprietor of the N. W. T. Weekly Times. There are many old settlers in this district who ought to be able to furnish interesting information, so regards this paper which we would be glad to see published. We will take the lead in getting up a Historical Society in Prince Albert.\n\nThis remarkable absence of historical facts in our Winnipeg district, is well realized by Prof. Bryce, who has visited Europe, and has made a close examination of the history of the Hudson Bay Company; and he remarks, by the following: \u201cHistory is like a great sea, and its secrets must be left to be explored at the advance.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to say: \u201cHistorians are like navigators, who sail through the various waters of history, gathering up fragments here and there, and describing the ocean behind them.\u201d\n\nHe further says: \u201cIt is strange that in all parts of the world, except in this country, there is no such thing as a Divine Guide to the past, and yet our history is the most important part of our lives.\u201d\n\nPoveshugh, Prince Albert.\n\nMay 13\u2014This evening Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered a very interesting lecture at Prince Albert, in which he gave a detailed account of his experience during a tour in the Great North-West.\n\nOn Tuesday last Prof. Bryce delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, before a large audience. He spoke about the Hudson Bay Company, and gave a vivid picture of their early days.\n\nMay 21\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nMay 28\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nJune 4\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nJuly 2\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nAugust 6\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nAugust 20\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nOctober 1\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nDecember 5\u2014Mr. Leuck, Esq., delivered another lecture in Prince Albert, on the history of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nThe above series of lectures concluded with a final address by Mr. Leuck, Esq., on the subject of \u201cThe Influence of the Hudson Bay Company on the Development of Canada.\u201d\n\nMr. Leuck, Esq., stated that the Hudson Bay Company had played a very important part in the development of the Canadian Northwest, and had done much to promote commerce and industry in the region.\n\nHe also pointed out that the Hudson Bay Company had been responsible for the introduction of modern methods of trading and transportation to the region, and had helped to bring about a more prosperous and civilized life among the indigenous peoples.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. Leuck, Esq., emphasized the importance of remembering the history of the Hudson Bay Company, and the contributions it has made to the development of Canada.\n\nThis lecture series attracted a large audience, and was well received by the public.\n\nCanoeing in Prince Albert\n\nFriday morning there was a canoe race on the Assiniboine River. The canoeists started from the dock opposite the Hotel Thompson, and finished near the foot of Main Street. The weather was rather cool, but the race was very exciting.\n\nThe canoeists were divided into two teams, and each team consisted of three members. The race was won by Team A, consisting of Mr. J. H. Thompson, Mr. W. B. Thompson, and Mr. R. S. Thompson. Team B, consisting of Mr. J. B. Thompson, Mr. W. B. Thompson, and Mr. R. S. Thompson, came in second place.\n\nThe canoeists showed great skill and determination throughout the race, and the spectators were very enthusiastic.\n\nThe race was officiated by Mr. J. H. Thompson, and resulted in a very good turnout for Prince Albert.\n\nPublic Notice\n\nSaturday, July 29 \u2014Notice is hereby given that the Prince Albert Board of Trade will meet on Monday next, July 29, at 8 o\u2019clock p.m., in the town hall, for the purpose of considering the question of forming a chamber of commerce.\n\nPublic Notice\n\nSunday, July 23 \u2014Attention is hereby called to the fact that the Prince Albert Fire Department will meet on Monday next, July 23, at 8 o\u2019clock p.m., in the fire hall, for the purpose of considering the question of forming a fire department.\n\nPublic Notice\n\nWednesday, July 26 \u2014Attention is hereby called to the fact that the Prince Albert Police Department will meet on Monday next, July 26, at 8 o\u2019clock p.m., in the police station, for the purpose of considering the question of forming a police department.\n\nPublic Notice\n\nThursday, July 27 \u2014Attention is hereby called to the fact that the Prince Albert School Board will meet on Monday next, July 27, at 8 o\u2019clock p.m., in the school board room, for the purpose of considering the question of forming a school board.\n\nPublic Notice\n\nFriday, July 28 \u2014Attention is hereby called to the fact that the Prince Albert Chamber of Commerce will meet on Monday next, July 28, at 8 o\u2019clock p.m., in the chamber of commerce building, for the purpose of considering the question of forming a chamber of commerce.\nOUR GRIEVANCES\n\nThe convention of Farmers' Delegates recently held in Winnipeg has attracted great attention in the eastern press. We give a few clipped paragraphs:\n\nTHE GRIEVANCES\n\nPublicity has recently been given in the press to the grievances felt by the farmers of the farmers in the Northwest, and effort is now being made by the farmers themselves to obtain, through agitation, redress for what they consider their wrongs. The discussion of questions of this character is desirable on every hand, but there is no more justifiable and unjust treatment is meted out to settlers in the North West by either the Government or other authorities than is awarded to any rightly so entitled for similar treatment. The present movement among the North Western farmers is not a new thing; the same spirit, under various names, has been prominent in all parts of the country, has been promoted by the belief that exorbitant profits are being realized by millers, and unduly high elevator charges prevail\u2014Montreal Gazette (Conservative).\n\nNORTH WEST REPRESENTATION.\n\nThe first duty of the Dominion Parliament over the North West Territories is to provide them at least with one electoral district, as in Algoma. One member's vote would not amount to much, but his voice would be powerful in influencing action. It is impossible speaking from personal knowledge con- vince myself as to the justice of his constituents demands. The Liberal party hopes for much from the North West, and the best policy it can pursue is to advocate representation for the Territories be at once given representation in Parliament. In doing so it would strengthen the claims for the ends of equity\u2014Hamilton Tribune (Independent).\n\nNOVEMBER ADVERT.\n\nNow that success is beginning to crown their efforts, the Manitoba Farmers will do well to be very cautious and not permit themselves to be inveigled into making unnecessary promises, to sign annexation manifestoes, nor to allow party passions control them in their votes. Let them continue constant and firm in their demands for reforms without giving their fellow provinces that reason to suspect they are wavering. They must secure sufficient sympathy throughout the Dominion to compel the authorities at Ottawa to give them a fair hearing. Canadian Pacific, to concede to the inhabitants of the Prairie Province the control of their own public works, the construction of railways by whomsoever and wherever they are wanted, and the lowering of the cost of living\u2014Montreal Witness (Independent).\n\nA SECOND NORTH WEST REBELLION?\n\nIf a second North West rebellion, if it can be prevented, will make less noise than the first was, there are a great many more people in the North West today than there were in 1870, and they are people of very different temperaments. The majority of them are men who learned the principles of liberal thought in the schools of Ontario, and who have greatly retarded the settlement and cultivation of the prairies\u2014Montreal Witness (Independent).\n\nIron, Steel, Horse Shoes, Horse Nails, Bolts and Chains, Sleigh and Cutter Runners, Shafts and Tones for sale.\n\nAny variety of other articles generally used in the first-class Blacksmith Shop.\n\nCHESTER THOMPSON\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nReal Estate\n\nFOR SALE\u2014A NUMBER OF CHOICE BUILDING LOTS\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nSuitable for business purposes or residences.\n\nFor further particulars apply by letter or wire to\u2014\n\nC.

Richardson, has presented us with a complimentary address by the members of the profession practicing in Regina, which address the judge has transferred. The Leader refers to the matter.\n\nIn view of the fact that he has been called away by the legal profession, presented to His Honor, Col. Richardson, judge of the Qu'Appelle District Court, N.W.T., during the last session, and in view of his popularity appears to us to be that he makes it a rule to administer law on the side of justice, we feel justified in saying that he is entitled to receive any praise deserved to give effect to any clearly stated principle of law, he will not permit his personal feelings to be allowed to influence him in the administration of the law, as laid down by the courts, and will treat each case fairly and impartially.\n\nThe public is requested to assist in preserving the forest, and the method of tree-cutting as at present practised to the destruction of the forests, is illegal. The question should be taken by Legislative interference to arrest the progress of the evil, as all the lumbermen are equally interested in the local wants of the people who are only now beginning to settle on the fertile prairies.\n\nParties claiming wood already cut on north side of the Saskatchewan River within the boundaries of the province, must be registered and put on the official list immediately, otherwise such logs will be subject to seizure, and double dues charged.\n\nThe information given will be of assistance in the leasing of permits, or dues chargeable on the various kinds of timber cut in accord- ance with the regulations.
