Mr. Wright.\n\nThis paper is not responsible for any errors or omissions.\n\nFRIDAY, MARCH 15, 1889.\n\nThe following are among the latest batch of rumors from Ottawa:\n\n1. That Sir John will be raised to the peerage of Great Britain.\n\n2. That Sir Hector Langevin will go to London as Canadian High Commissioner.\n\n3. There will be a general election before the opening of Parliament.\n\n4. It is within the range of probabilities that Sir John will be raised to the peerage of Great Britain.\n\nSuch an act would be a fitting recognition of his long and important services to the British Empire, and there is no British statesman of today who more richly deserves that honor; the latter half of rumor No. 1 has been knocked in the head by the recent appointment of an English diplomat to Washington. With regard to next rumor, there does not seem to be the slightest foundation for it.\n\nThe Reformers are, and have been for a long time, anxious that the leadership of the old Conser vative party should pass into the hands of Sir John Macdonald. They are painfully cognizant of the fact that they cannot cope with his exalted statesmanship, and that as long as he holds the reins of power they will stick together. But the chances of witnessing the advent of a reformer will remain in the dim perspective of the future. They believe that when he ceases to lead the party it will be split up into factions and they will ride into power over its ruins.\n\nSuch is their only hope, and no doubt this rumor was fattened by the wish that all these things would happen.\n\nThere is at present no great probability that a change will be made in the leadership of the party; but if there is, no better man could be appointed to succeed Sir Charles Tupper than the present Minister of Public Works, and the reentrance of Sir Charles into the Cabinet would be highly beneficial. Sir Charles would be hailed with delight by every one. Sir John Macdonald has said that there need be no anxiety on the score of a general election taking place. He sees no reason why there should be one before 1892, and so far as the present test shows that Sir John is not going to have one until the fullness of time is ripe, simply to gratify the wishes of office seekers and others. This disposes of rumor No. 4.\n\nWe notice that some of the Liberal M.P.'s have been having their annual fling at the member for Saskatchewan in the House of Commons, and relieved themselves of their pent-up feelings by rehearsing the accusations and venefaces charges against Mr. Macdonald and the Government of undue influence in the Northwest election. Some of them, too, displayed a woeful inability to ignore, as well as a woeful disregard for, the facts. Their ignorance is inexcusable, their mendacity pardonable only on the grounds of their political faith. Mr. Mulock, member for North York, stated that he only vote Mr. Macdonald ever gave him any intimation that the Northwest was wrong when he voted to send an agent of the Government to corrupt the electorate of Saskatchewan. What could he mean? He had never heard in his party anyone say that there was any fact of the fact that Mr. Macdonald never sat in Parliament and consequently could not have voted until after the election in 1887. But facts are nothing to the Liberals.\n\nThe public should take advantage of HETZ & TWINE'S 5th Annual Grand Clearing Sale.

They deal largely in dry goods, but during the past ten days considerable have been made in it. Buy a well assorted stock is still offered, and it is the fault of the public themselves if advantage is not taken of the clearing sale prices they offer for the next week or ten days.\n\nR. C.

Lake for the purpose of hunting deer, trapping for beaver animals and trading with the Indians. They hired two men and proceeded up the river, and arrived in the end of September and prepared their winter quarters about nine miles from our settlement. They had been successful in securing a good supply of fish. Some time after the lake set fast, they started back to get a supply of provisions; it is stated they were going to our Lake. Brochu post about 200 miles farther north on the same lake. This was a most daring undertaking, as the river was very deep, dotted all over with islands and the course followed by our men is very difficult to navigate. The river is very perilous and has not been explored and there are no landmarks. No person knows where the river flows or what it contains, but the quantity seems not to be very great, so they had only two dogs to lead their whole equipment. Nothing was heard of them until a party went out trapping and found their bodies about a mile and a half from their house. It is supposed that they lost their way and wandered off into the lake for a long while endeavoring to find their home; that their provisions became exhausted and they died of starvation or exhaustion. It is strange, however, that they did not endeavor to make their way back to their dogs as one of them was alive when found and was subsiding on the carcass of the dead companion. Report says they kept their dogs with them until it was too late and they could not be saved to me and I may be able to give fuller particulars of the sad affair. I do not know the Christian names of these men nor do I know any of their relatives or friends but I shall willingly give any information I may have to any parties interested. Mr. Hamilton, the postmaster at Deer Lake, on hearing of the sad occurrence proceeded immediately to the fatal spot and buried the remains decently buried. To prevent their property being carried off by Indians it was removed to our Lake.\n\nH. BELONGER, C. P.,\nHudson's Bay Co., Cumberland District.\n\n[These men came to the Saskatchewan district from Ontario some years ago and settled near the Carrot River, where they went into farming and more especially stock raising. They were men of good character and of great reverence. Donald, the older brother, was married and leaves a wife and three small children. His younger brother, Roy, left, her former home, last fall to stay until this spring, when he was to return and take charge of the Carrot River farm, the youngest of whom was not married. They were both men who were highly respected by all who knew them. Donald was the son-in-law of that young man Stevens who died here of typhoid fever about two months ago and whose death caused great affliction among his nearest and greatest friends. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved wife and family and other relatives of the unfortunate ones.]\n\n65 AND 66 LBS. PER BUSHL.\n\nSamples of Red and White Flax Grown at Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nWe quote the following from a late issue of the Winnipeg Tribune:\n\n\"All the talk on Change this morning is over samples of red and white Flax grown at Prince Albert, Sask., and exhibited by Mr. N. Sawil. They were sent to that gentleman by Mr. A. F. Edin, who commented on the fact that the M. & N.W. R.R. the red Flax was worth $1.00 per bushel and the white Flax $3.00 per bushel. The red Flax is perfectly pure, and seems so, even to the inspectors' own eye. The white Flax is not of quality, but is not so nice to look at. It is said that the samples produced are superior to anything else in the market. An expert seed grower from Prince Albert states that the samples are really the finest he ever saw.\"\n\nThis is spring, sweet, balmy spring!
