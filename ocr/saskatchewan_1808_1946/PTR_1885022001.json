The provisions of the new law will be enforced immediately and all those who have been engaged in these illegal operations will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n\nThe Canadian Tribune says: \"The situation in the coal fields of Manitoba is now becoming so serious that it will be necessary to take immediate steps to prevent further loss of life and property. The government has already appointed a commission to investigate the conditions and to report its findings to Parliament.\"\n\nNEW DEPARTURE\n\nTHE WEEKLY GLOBE\n\nSPECIAL TRIAL TRIP\u2014TWO MONTHS ONLY 15 CENTS\n\nTHE GLOBE\n\nSPURGEON'S SERMON\n\nAddress, THE GLOBE PRINTING CO.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT\n\nMARLIN MAGAZINE RIFLE.\n\nJAMES SINCLAIR\n\nGeneral Blacksmith,\n\nRepairing Farm Machinery &c.\n\nG.
