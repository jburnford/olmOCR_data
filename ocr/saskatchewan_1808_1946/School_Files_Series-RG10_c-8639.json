This has to do with the installation of a Warm Air Heating System at Griswold. We have supplied one of our furnaces, through Messrs. Neale, Stothard & Chapman, of Brandon. Piping has been made up as per your specification and we understand will be installed in that manner by the Heating Contractor. The proper furnace has been supplied against the specification shown in your file but we are somewhat worried about the inadequate distribution of piping that is being installed in this system.\n\nThe Plan calls for a total of 1,041 sq. in. of warm air piping and 402 sq. in. of return air piping. There should not be such a large spread, as you will find that it will be impossible to deliver the amount of warm air shown with such a small amount of return air connected to the furnace. This matter, we believe, was taken up through your local office and instructions received that the job must be installed as shown in the plan. The Heating Unit cannot give the best of service unless equal distribution of air is taken from same. Therefore, we are placing ourselves on record that the job is being installed as specified, but the furnace cannot be expected to last for the normal period under these conditions. There will be times in very cold weather when the furnace will be fired to the limit but free circulation will not be possible without extra return air connections.\n\nWe have offered, on more than one occasion, to submit up-to-date free service and layouts for buildings of this nature. The main reason, as you will understand, is that we want our furnaces to give the best satisfaction possible, which in the long run is a recommendation for quality and efficiency in the heating plant.\n\nTrusting that you will accept the information given with our friendly wish that warm air heating equipment supplied to your buildings may give the best service possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLARE BROS. WESTERN LIMITED.\n\nO.J. Hatch\nManager\n\nOJH/JM\nMarch 13th, 1948.\n\nMemorandum: Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe: Purchase Order 24392\n\nPlease find herewith copies of a letter from Clare Brothers Western, Limited, Winnipeg, who supplied Stothard & Chapman, Brandon, Manitoba, with the furnace for Oak River Indian Day School, as per above purchase order.\n\nThe manufacturer's letter is self-explanatory.

Mr. Robertson, Carpenter, thinks it will take at least until the end of April to complete it, including the outside painting. Thus we would need $1000.00 more for labour.\n\nThere has been no contract let as yet for the installing of blinds throughout the building.\n\nThe plans also call for a Chemical Toilet, with inner pail. We would also need app. 18 ft. of vent pipe. 3\" galv.\n\nI believe we should get authority to purchase the living quarters furnishings. The following would cost app. $400.00:\n\nKitchen cook stove.\nTable and chairs.\nLounge and chair.\nBed, spring and mattress.\nBedroom dresser.\nDishes and cooking utensils.\n\nWe will also need a cistern hand pump, and eaves-troughing.\n\nThe building should have lightning rods. I think three should be sufficient.\n\n(signed) W. Young,\nAssistant, Indian Agency.\nOttawa, March 25, 1948.\n\nMr. W.

It may be briefly stated that the Classroom space is of prime importance and has been worked out to provide for a satisfactory distribution of the heat according to the design principles laid down by acknowledged authorities.\n\nThe Cloakrooms and Teacher's Quarters have been provided with warm air leaders and registers only. This is due in part to the difficulty in getting returns back from these rooms, and also having in mind that when the Classroom and basement space is unoccupied, at least three of the four dampers in these leaders will be throttled or shut off.\n\nUnder such circumstances, it is felt that the furnace will not be penalized, and that the system can be counted on to give the desired results if installed as shown.\n\nWe appreciate the friendly criticism received, and the foregoing reply is written in the same spirit.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMr. Hoey\nFor your information.\n\n24/3/48.\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nProposed Peguis South Day School\n\nProposed Lake St. Martin Day School\n\nOak River Day School.\n\nDuring his recent visit to the Department Mr. Indian Agent Young advised that he was completely satisfied with the work of Mr. John Robertson of Kenton, Manitoba, in erecting the Oak River School. It is therefore suggested that Mr. Robertson be approached to ascertain if he is interested in building another school for us on the same basis.\n\nIncluded in our 1948-49 estimates are one-room schools and attached teachers' residences for Lake St. Martin in the Portage la Prairie Agency and Peguis South in the Fisher River Agency. It is recommended that Mr. Robertson be approached concerning these schools. They would be identical with the one he is now finishing at Oak River.\n\nIt would require two or three months to obtain the standard bill of materials for these schools. Therefore we are trying to line up our building programme now, before there is too much contracting activity.\n\nI might add that we have found that the day labour basis of building, as adopted at Oak River, has proven cheaper than the cost plus basis contract, as used at Murdoch in the Fisher River Agency. While we have not yet the final cost...\nfigures, it is evident that the Oak River School will cost less than the Murdoch School (these buildings are identical).\n\nFrom the map it would seem evident that Mr. Robertson would be more likely to be interested in the Lake St. Martin School rather than in the Peguis School. Therefore Mr. Lazenby should advise if there is any good carpenter interested in the Peguis School on a day labour basis.\n\nBlueprints, specifications and bills of materials for the standard one-room school with teacher's residence are being sent, along with this letter to the two Agents concerned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-5, part 3)\n(b) The powder and liquid must be stirred together until all granules and solid particles disappear and the cement is soft and easily worked\u2014almost like a thick paste. Thorough mixing or working produces the correct consistency. The cement can be mixed on the back of the blackboard (Figure 4) or in an old wash basin or similar shaped pan (See instructions on bag and can).\n\n(c) Mix for only one blackboard at a time.\n\n(d) Place gobs every 12 inches in horizontal row along center of slab lengthwise and two (2) extra at each edge at joints. (Figure 4).\n\nTHE INSTALLATION OF STERLING BLACKBOARD\n\n1. Immediately slide slab into position and equalize space at top and bottom, applying pressure over cement gobs.\n\n2. Immediately put clamps in place and insert wedges over the cement gobs to hold slab in proper contact with the cement and wall. Two or three light weight clamps are sufficient for each slab, (Figure 5). Wrap the wedges in paper to protect the blackboard surface.\n\n3. Drill holes along top of blackboard every 16 to 18 inches and countersink for wood screws.\n\n4. Screw slab securely to top ground\u2014using a \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\" No. 8 flat headed wood screw countersunk, (Figure 6).\n\n5. Insert metal rustproof joint at right end to receive next slab.\n\n6. Proceed with second and successive slabs.\n\n7. When space along one wall is finished it should appear as in Figure 7. Clamps should be left overnight. One metal direction plate (for each room) must be attached to the wall adjacent to the blackboard, in a prominent place when installation is completed. These are included in the envelope with directions which is posted on back of blackboard. (Figure 11, page 4.)\n\n8. After the cement has been allowed to set at least 10 hours, (over night) take off clamps. Then place quarter round or cove mouldings at top and bottom of blackboard to complete the installation. These mouldings must be toe-nailed as tightly against the surface of the blackboard as possible.\n\n9. \"Break in\" blackboard as instructed on metal plates. (Figure 11, page 4.)\nCutting the Blackboard to Fit the Spaces\n\nPlace a straight-edge (Figure 8) or the cutting clamp on the back of the slab of Sterling Blackboard exactly where the break is desired (Figure 8). With any sharp instrument, preferably the W.C. Special rapid cutting tool or the handle end of a file sharpened, score the back surface along the straight-edge five or six times being sure to score it well at the edges of the slab. (Figure 8.)\n\nTurn the slab over and score it on the face side just as was done on the reverse side. Then with constantly increasing steady pressure bear down on the slab of blackboard to be broken off until the break occurs. (Figure 9). The slab will break true.\n\nMarking the Blackboard for the Proper Spaces\n\nStock lengths of Blackboard should be used to fill the spaces (i.e., for 12-foot spaces, use 2 six-foot slabs). Where stock lengths do not fill the space evenly, use the proper stock lengths so that the \"fill in\" slab will be no less than 3 feet long (i.e., for 12 foot space, use two 6 foot slabs; or for a 9-foot space, use one 5 ft. and one 4 ft. slab; or for 11 foot 6 inch space, use one 8 ft. and one 3 ft. 6 in. slab, etc.)\n\nThe slabs should be \"set\" into the space temporarily and the last piece cut to exact length (Figure 10). Proceed with the cutting.\n\nBreaking in and Care of Blackboards\n\nBlackboard must be properly \"broken in\" before it is used.\n\n1. With the side of a piece of crayon, chalk the entire writing surface. Avoid chalk with a glazed surface.\n\n2. Work the chalk into the surface of the board, using a good quality felt eraser for the purpose.\n\n3. Repeat Nos. 1 and 2.\n\n4. Clean the board with a soft, new cotton cloth or with a good quality chamois and your board is ready for use.\n\nCAUTION\n\nNever, never use any of the \"treated\" cloths or chamois which are advertised for use on the blackboard. They invariably contain oil in some form and their continued use will impair the efficiency of the blackboard writing surface. Do not wash the board with water or with blackboard cleaning solutions. Use only clean cotton cloths or good quality chamois free from animal fats.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\n(Aluminum Instruction Plate, Figure 11)\n\nAluminum Instruction Plate for each room is supplied free of charge with every shipment of blackboard. They are included in the envelope posted on the back of the blackboards with the Installation Directions.\n\nThey should be tacked in place in every room containing blackboard on the blackboard frame near door jamb in plain sight of the person caring for the blackboards. If enough plates (one for each room) have not been included, write for an additional supply furnished free.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nPICTORIAL DIRECTIONS FOR INSTALLING\n\nSterling\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nThese installation directions are presented in a complete and comprehensive manner to help you correctly install your blackboard; they are the result of nearly sixty years experience in the manufacture of blackboard\u2014experience which covers the installation of millions of square feet.\n\nSince the correct way to install these blackboards is also the easiest way, be sure you read these directions carefully and be sure that you understand them before you attempt the installation. Installation by other than this or the Weber Costello Ventilated System voids the guarantee on these boards.\n\nThe \"Regular Method\" of installation, described in the following pages, may be used in all parts of the United States and Canada EXCEPT IN AREAS NEAR OCEANS AND RIVERS WHERE HEAT AND MOISTURE COMBINE TO CAUSE \"SWEATING\", especially those areas in the South and Southwest within 100 miles of the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi River, the Rio Grande River, and Chesapeake Bay, but also IN ALL OTHER AREAS WITH LIKE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.\n\nIn the above mentioned areas this blackboard must be installed according to the \"Ventilated Method\" of installation. The \"Ventilated Method\" is an excellent type of installation in any climate, so if you have any doubts, write or wire Weber Costello Company for a copy of the \"Ventilated Method\" instructions.\n\nWEBER COSTELLO CO.\nPUBLISHERS OF: MAPS AND GLOBES\nMANUFACTURERS OF: BLACKBOARD \u2022 ERASERS \u2022 CHALK \u2022 ART MATERIALS\nCHICAGO HEIGHTS, ILLINOIS\n\nPrinted in U.S.A.\nThe Regular Method of Installing Sterling Blackboards\n\nAll necessary Sterling Cement for the installation of this board has been included with the shipment (one gallon for every 32 lineal feet). Additional cement can be ordered at nominal cost from the Weber Costello Company or its distributors.\n\nBEFORE STARTING WORK CHECK EACH OF THESE POINTS CAREFULLY\n\n1. Uncrate the blackboards\u2014inspecting each slab carefully. If any are cracked or broken in transit, file claim against the transportation company.\n\n2. Distribute the blackboard to each room and exact space. (Figure 2) making sure the slabs fit the spaces. (Figure 10).\n\n3. If blackboard has been standing on edge uncrated for some time it may sag of its own weight and become slightly bowed. Heavier weight clamps and larger wedges must then be used to insure perfect contact between the blackboard, cement, and wall. The clamps also should be left on the blackboard for several days.\n\n4. Inspect wall behind the blackboard.\n   (a) The wall should be a good cement plaster.\n   (b) Grounds should be set flush with the plaster. (Figure 1). If these are not provided, arrangements should be made with architect or contractor to have it done.\n   (c) The plaster must be thoroughly dry.\n   (d) If walls are painted or coated\u2014they should be scraped down the center for solid cement contact.\n\n5. Lay slab face down on a padded bench. (Made very easily by using one of the crates.) Wipe all dust and dirt off the back of the blackboard. Go over wall with a stiff brush and remove all loose particles of plaster and dust. (Figure 3).\n\n6.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nWhen you visited Brandon last, I mentioned to you the question of the repairs to our Mission House on the Oak River Reserve and you stated that this matter would be attended to but to date we have had nothing further on the matter.\n\nThe position is that these two rooms in the lower part of the Mission House were supplied free of charge to your Department for over twenty-five years as school rooms. We were glad to be able to provide these quarters but we did understand that they would be put back into shape for living quarters once they were no longer required for school purposes. You can well understand how the wear and tear of school desks and school children caused considerable delapidation which must be attended to before they will be suitable as living quarters again. We have submitted an estimate from a local contractor but would be quite willing for you to obtain your own figures or if you desire have the work done through your own Agency. We would, however, like to have this matter attended to as quickly as possible so that our Missionaries can have the comfort of the use of the house and after all, the school has been away from there since the end of last June.\n\nWith all good wishes for the New Year,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArchdeacon of Brandon.\nJanuary 17, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Oak River School,\nPortage la Prairie Indian Agency,\nProvince of Manitoba.\n\nFor several years on the Oak River Reserve, we have used the Mission House, which is owned by the Church of England, as a school. We have now erected a new school on this reserve and it will not be necessary any longer to use the Mission House. However, the Church authorities feel that we should put the building in the same condition as it was when we first started to use it. The estimated cost of renovating the building is $635.17, as shown in a copy of a letter dated September 14, 1948, from Reverend Canon I. A. Norris. (Please see letters attached).\n\nYour approval of the expenditure of the amount mentioned above for renovating the Mission House would be appreciated, as our officials feel that we should meet the wishes of the Church authorities. This building was in service as an Indian school for a number of years and no rent was paid for such use.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The power line is right up to the school and can be connected as soon as we have the building wired. The cost of this wiring is $315.00.\n\nI have taken up the matter with Mr. Pratt regarding the wiring of our Agency buildings, and no doubt this work could be done by the same firm. I am attaching copy of this letter to Mr. Pratt's letter so you will be able to talk the matter over with him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. S.

Smelts & Sons\nElectrical Contractors\n\nBrandon, Man.\n\nMr. Davis,\n\nSir,\n\nChecking over the Oak River estimate I came across two omissions:\n\n1. The inspection Department insists on school basements being wired in steel conduit (pipe). This will bring the price for the school to $300.\n\n2. The two lines to the pump houses will have to be anchored with 4\" screw anchors and steel cable at each end. The M.P.C. charge twelve dollars for each anchor labor and material supplied and I figure that we can do it for the same price. Consequently I included $48.00 for four anchors in the price of the pump house wiring.\n\n(sgd) Chas. Smelts.\nC. W.

In order that the school may no longer be left vacant we are proposing now to send a supply in the person of Miss E.J. Armstrong, 17 Pembroke St., Toronto. Miss Armstrong has no certificate, and has not taught in any public school; but she has a good common school education, is a person of good judgment and excellent character, and I think would be quite competent to do the primary teaching required at a place like Oxford House till such time as we can find a certified teacher who is willing to go. As this school has been aided by the Department I deem it but right to submit these facts, and will await the concurrence of the Department before finally deciding the case. A prompt answer will oblige, so that a teacher is to go out this summer we may take advantage of the steamers on Lake Winnipeg as far as Norway House.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.

Martin a School Teacher appointed by the Methodist Church to take charge of their work at Oxford House, in the District of Keewatin.\n\nI am not sure of the status of this School. Should be glad to know if the Department has formally recognized its existence. I placed an amount for the Teacher in the Estimates for the ensuing year and as the School seems to be very much alive I would recommend that it be duly recognized if it has not been already.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nOttawa, October 28th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant enclosing the return for the Oxford House School for the September quarter, and in reply I beg to say that this school is recognized by the Department and is paid at the rate of $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nRev. John Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nThe Methodist Church established its mission at Oxford House about the year 1842 and has continued to do its work there until the present time and must have spent about one thousand dollars per year or a total of at least 60,000.00.\n\nThere is no other Church doing Mission work there and never has been in all the years.\n\nThe population is 310 and all belong to the Methodist Church with the exception of the Pagan element which might represent one hundred people. That is to say it is safe to count as members or adherents about 200 people.\n\nThe child population numbers 156 or 88 boys and 68 girls. Of these fully two thirds are not available as pupils owing to the distance at which they live from the Methodist Mission. A large number of the people live at Jackson Bay some 18 miles distant. This was the site of the original Mission Station. Some live along the shore of the lake which is thirty miles from south to north. The possible attendance at the Mission School is about 45 and the actual attendance at present averages 23.09 in the summer season and less in the winter when the Indians retire to their houses for shelter.\n\nThere are about ten houses within a radius of two miles from the Mission Church.\n\nSchool has been conducted in the Church for some years and is being conducted there at present.\nHere as at Nelson House the School building must be constructed of logs as the rate of freight is high being $6.00 per cwt. from Norway House, and 75 cents per cwt from Selkirk to Norway House. I would also recommend that the roof be covered with mica roofing, as Shingles are an impossibility owing to the cost of purchase and transport.\n\nNails doors etc will have to be purchased at Selkirk and shipped down but logs can be obtained on the shores of Oxford Lake and not more distant than 6 or 7 miles.\n\nThey are accustomed to build houses after the old Red River type at this point logs ten feet long jointed by grooved upright posts but I cannot recommend this style for in a very few years it will bulge at the posts and fall. I much prefer the house with dove-tail corners.\n\nA school house might be built at Oxford House on the following approximate basis:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Preparing Logs        | 100.00 |\n| Sawing boards         | 100.00 |\n| Erecting building     | 200.00 |\n| Doors windows nails   | 30.00  |\n| Roofing & freight     | 70.00  |\n| **Total**             | **500.00** |\n\nThe Hudsons Bay Company will build if asked to do so.\n\nThe Missionary in charge should not be asked to do so because he is not a practical man.\n\nIt would be possible to send a practical man or men from Norway House under direction of the Agent.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Summers\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs - Ottawa\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1909.\n\nRev.

There should be three windows on each side of the building and one entrance. It has also been suggested that mica roofing would be preferable to shingles. The floor should be of dressed lumber, and the building will be heated by a stove.\n\nIn addition to the above it will be necessary to provide two closets for the accommodation of the pupils.\n\nIn view of the experience that the officials of the Hudson's Bay Company have had in the erection of log buildings in these outlying districts it is thought that nothing more than a general outline of the nature of the building will be necessary to enable them to give a figure for the cost of construction, and the Department would be pleased to have an estimate with a description at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

The same has been reached me about the middle of January, and as there has been no chance to send out yet, I have not got it away. I understand some surveyors of the N.P.R. Railway will be surveying soon, and will get it away then. In the meantime would call your attention to two or three matters connected with my work here. Have now been a long time in the Indian work, and consider myself quite at least - some little about it. When the Methodist Church disposed with my services at Wesley Boarding School upon the report of Mr. Perrin and Mr. Woodworth, I was quite satisfied to resign. What the history of that school was afterwards, and how long the administration which succeeded me, kept the school open, and with what success, you are all doubtless fully aware - at least by some extent. When the Indians brought me back to the Wesley Red School, and offered to pay me salary themselves, and the opposition I met with and labored against, being contemporaneous with Mr. Fletcham, you may not be very familiar with, and at least it matters not now. At least the Department were willing to pay my salary, and keep the school open until Mr. Perrin wrote me again 2 or 3 times asking me to come down to this district as missionary teacher. That is the reason why I am here today. Now regarding the work here I have been put very much disheartened in my efforts to teach the children, because of the lack of a decent school room and supplies.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-1, part 1)\nThese people are well disposed towards School work and would appreciate any thing done along the line of education for the young generation, and have felt so much ashamed at the lack of effort made, have sent a Deputation through the Young Men's Club. Will you please see that it is not cut down and that the activities mentioned are proceeded at once.\n\nThen in the matter of disposing of the property and that the Debt has been paid off. Have no source of any kind to sell out, but left a means of everything disposed of. Have also seen a disposition to run which we need in the best way. We have had an awful amount of sickness, and have been kept constantly out of School hours. Since last September we have had a death. Have also had charge of the Nations here for the past six months. All of these duties added to that of Missionary has pretty fully occupied my time.\n\nI have thought to ask of the Indian Dept. It is this: Would you be willing to add to our School Stationery when it reaches you 8 x 10 Writing Tablets ruled. No. 100 Envelopes. It is impossible to purchase Stationery in this Country, when I asked for three at a time, was refused. So my last request upon the grounds that they were not supplied to Day Schools. If you could favor me in this way I should feel extremely obliged.\n\nI have for the honor to subscribe myself,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Macleod\n\nOxford House Mission, Red River Settlement, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime, we are thankful to the Department for supplying envelopes and writing tablets which have come to hand also blank forms for quarterly school returns, as yet the forms of vouchers and forms for medical returns have not reached me.

The school is held in the church and the teacher Mr. Nedrie is experienced in Indian work and a successful teacher.\nExtract from report submitted by J.G. Stewart on 17th August, 1912, relative to Council meetings held at the time of Treaty trip at Oxford House\n\nRe School\n\nAt present they are using the Methodist Church as a school, but in the future the Indians are requesting that a school be built on the Reserve. The Chief and Band have consented to allow the Mission to have a strip of land on their Reserve for a Mission and a school house. Mr. Neddrie the school teacher here is a very competent and careful teacher and some of his scholars are very clever. Mr. Neddrie suggests that his holidays should be in August and part of September, as at this time of the year he has more spare time to look after the garden and school repairs and other work connected with his Mission and school. I agree with him in this matter as later around the Indians are dispersing to their various camping places.\n\nSgn. J.G. Stewart.\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 7, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report of the 17th of August, last, in which you deal with the school at Oxford House I beg to say that the Department has no objection to the teacher taking his holidays during August and part of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.G. Stewart, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nSir,\n\nI regret to have to inform the Department that owing to Mr Brisley (teacher of Oxford House) insolence and refusal to leave my home when requested to do so, I had to forcibly eject him.\n\nI would not trouble the Department with this matter were it not for the fact that Mr Brisley will do so.\n\nThe facts are these. During the winter Mr Brisley wrote a very insulting letter to me, not satisfied with this he wrote to Inspector Dunn with a view of injuring my position as Agent.\n\nAbout 9 pm on July 1st Mr Brisley called at my home and demanded in a most insolent manner, \"that I sign his quarterly school returns at once.\" I quietly asked him to call at the office on Monday morning and he could have the returns duly signed. This occurred in the presence of some friends we were entertaining in my home.\n\nLater in the evening Mr Brisley returned and again demanded that I sign the returns at once. I repeated what I had told him before, and asked him to leave the house, this he refused to do, so I proceeded to make him, he resisted and received some damage as a result.\n\nIf the Department will refer to Mr J.T. Blackford Chief Fire Ranger, Norway House. He will verify what I have said as he was a guest in my home at the time.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lazenby  \nNorway House  \nManitoba\n\nDear Mr Lazenby,\n\nIn response to your request, I am writing a short account of our Exhibition which was held on December 15, at Oxford House Day School.\n\nThis year the pupils were twenty in number. As soon as the first snow fell in October, our thoughts turned to the Exhibition, and it was the wish of the children, as well as of the teacher, that it should be bigger and better than at any previous time. There were eight girls ranging in age from six to seventeen years. Three of these had never attended school before.\n\nThe yarn was taken to the school, and from a selection of fancy patterns, the older girls made their choice, and knitted one pair of short socks, and very fine warm gloves. With extra sweater yarn, provided by the teacher, very dainty sweaters were made by the older girls. They were taught to follow directions from a book of knitting instructions. The beginners had larger wooden needles made for them by the Indian Chief. They made nice warm scarves, with a fringe of contrasting colour. They also knit warm sweaters, with elbow length sleeves, in a plain garter stitch.\n\nAs soon as the knitting was completed, two Saturdays were spent at the Mission, washing, rubbing, and boiling the colour out of ordinary flour bags. Each girl chose her own pattern from Eaton's catalogue, and work was begun. Binding of various colours, fancy pockets, and embroidery enhanced the beauty of the older girls' aprons. The younger ones made use of crayons; a picture, a warm iron; and embroidery cotton for outline stitch. They were then carefully laundered, and put away for the Great Day.\n\nImmediately dresses were begun. Again Eaton's catalogue was brought to school, and many recesses were spent, with the big heads and little heads looking over the dress section. Patterns were chosen, and from one basic pattern the girls made the necessary alterations. The teacher gave no assistance in this matter to the older girls as this was their fourth year at dress-making, and they now make all their own clothes in the latest fashion.\n\nThe beginners cut their own dresses, and were shown how to baste (Elephant steps), and then the other stitching, (Fairy steps), necessary for sewing. To help them keep their seams straight, a faint line was drawn with a pencil.\n\nNeedle cases followed, made from old felt hats. The leaves of the cases were cut from small pieces of flannelette. During this time, the older girls were busy at home during the evenings. Two rag mats had been ordered. One order had come from Winnipeg. The girls dyed the required rags at the Mission, and received Six Dollars for the finished mats. These were also available for the Exhibition, as they had learned hooking in school.\n\nIt was also decided to add a table with preserving and cooking. Both Blueberries and Raspberries had been preserved in the fall - thirty jars, to be exact. These are dated, and at the wish of the girls, left at the Mission until wanted.\nThe older girls have made Christmas fruit cakes for the past two years. These were iced, and exhibited. Also exhibited in this department were loaves of white bread, and apple pies. This work was done at night, and on Saturdays, at the Mission. One girl was so afraid that the teacher would knead her loaf bread, that she appeared at the Mission in the darkness of early morning, without having had her breakfast at home. Needless to say, with such interest, the bread was very light, and beautifully baked.\n\nAll this time too, the little boys were struggling valiantly with biscuit boxes, saved since August. Nails were carefully removed, and stored in a bottle for future use. The boys were also divided into two groups. The experienced ones showed a great improvement over last year. Their wood working vocabulary had increased, and they were familiar with the tools provided. Articles of a more useful nature were made; three-armed towel racks; fancy tie racks; match scratchers; match boxes for a table or radio; little wagons with elephants or ducks on them; rocking horses; very lovely tea-pot stands sand-papered and varnished (and subsequently wrapped and put on the Christmas Tree for the Mothers); door stops of various kinds, and one nice table. Great exasperation was expressed, because the biscuit boxes were at least an inch smaller, and much thinner than last year.\n\nAll the articles mentioned above were either painted, enamelled, or varnished. Brushes were cared for, and thoroughly washed and dried. Paints were mixed to produce different colours and the teacher had daubs of paint here and there all over her clothes. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful time for the children. Many a recess passed with everybody sand-papering, or sawing, or using the drill. They sang as they worked, the many little English songs they have learned.\n\nEverything was completed by December 14. As the teacher was busy with lessons, the two oldest girls were given permission to arrange the articles on tables and on the walls. They went around on tip-toe. Gave a final ironing to the dresses, put them on hangers, and arranged them beautifully. All articles had to be numbered. Booklets were prepared for the judges' use. Pencils were sharpened and placed inside the booklets. The following morning the prizes were tabulated, and arranged on the table.\n\nJust before two o'clock, the children washed and combed their hair. All was in readiness at two thirty, and the parents, traders, and Minister arrived on time.\n\nAn opportunity was afforded the parents to view the work. The judges were called, and examined the exhibits. Before the prizes were presented, the children sang two songs. One of the Councillors presented the prizes; he had hurried home from a long journey just to be at the exhibition. Many speeches followed. One father said \"We do not know how to teach our children how to do these wonderful things. No one else has ever done this for us. We are glad that you have come among us, and we are grateful to you.\"\n\nSo many believe that the Indian is hopeless, and yet when you hear them say \"We are grateful to you\", it makes you want to help them the more, and never give up until their dear little children have learned that with their hands to aid them, there is nothing too hard for them to do.\n\nSigned:- Ada M Scoates.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a report I have received from Mrs Ada Scoates, the teacher of the Oxford House Indian Day School, concerning an Exhibition of practical handwork, done by the pupils of the school.\n\nBrief mention was made, of the exhibition, in a letter I received from the missionary, and I asked that the teacher might submit a more detailed report, as I felt that the Department would be quite interested in having the particulars.\n\nMrs Scoates' report indicates the very keen interest taken in the school work, by both teacher and pupils, especially when so much of such work is done outside of school hours, and I feel sure that the teacher's efforts will be of lasting benefit. Mrs Scoates is, I think, deserving of great credit for her praiseworthy work.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nUnited Church Mission,\nOxford House, Man.,\nFeb. 29, 1942.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs;\n\nLast July my wife and I took over the work of Missionary and Teacher, I as the former and she as the latter, here on the reserve at Oxford House. During the past six months we have been trying to get our bearings while at the same time carrying our work to the best of our ability. More and more, however, we have come to feel our need for certain things (description of which appears below) and we were wondering if you could help us in any way. I might say that our feeling of need has become more acute and our determination to write you more resolute since we received and read some material on Indian work issued by the United States Office of Indian Affairs. Among this material were pamphlets such as Educational Service for Indians, Indians Yesterday and Today, their weekly field letter Indian Education and others with which I expect you are familiar. Among other things this material convinced us of the tremendous possibilities in the type of work in which we are engaged; but, as I have already said, it also accentuated the needs we have come to feel in our work.\n\nIt seems to us that before any plans can be laid which will be worthwhile pushing and reasonably assured of success in the realm of education for better living, certain things are required which we have not got. In brief they are:\n\n1. A knowledge of the native culture. While a great deal of this must be picked up by living in that culture, nevertheless a great deal of time and misunderstanding could be saved if material assembled by experts on the subject could be studied while the living was going on\u2014material like the Sherman Pamphlets just being published in the States. To date we both feel that we really know very little about the culture background, past or present, of the people among whom we are working; that is our first need.\n\n2. A knowledge of the exact status of the Indian in this country. Although we have a vague idea of what \"Treaty Indian\" means our knowledge of what exactly an Indian can or cannot do morally, economically or any other way is negligible. I'd imagine a copy of the Indian Act would help us in this connection; but anyway the above constitutes our second great need.\n\n3. Knowledge of the aims, objectives, and practical policies of the Government regarding the Indian. What exactly is the Indian Department trying to do for or with the Indians under its care? What policies does it advocate to those in direct contact with the Indian in order that those aims might be achieved? These are probably known to the Indian Agents but in a setup such as the one in this agency where the ones in direct contact with the people are the teachers and missionaries simply because the agency is so big, it seems advisable that they be known to the latter also so that the agent's work might be eased and greater all-round effectiveness result. This then is our third need.\n\n4. A knowledge of what projects have been undertaken elsewhere but under similar circumstances for the improvement of the lot of the Indian. For example:\n   What type of houses have been found to be best suited to Indian use from the standpoints of finances, health, etc.?\nWhat work in Indian Crafts is being done and with what success?\nWhat work in fish, game and forestry conservation has been tried? What values have been thus achieved?\nWhat agricultural programs have been executed UNDER CLIMATIC CONDITIONS LIKE OURS?\nWhat health education programs have been found to be effective?\n\nThese then are other things with which we feel we ought to be acquainted.\n\nNow then, gentlemen, can you help us satisfy the above needs? Have you any publications with which you can supply us or can you tell us where such can be obtained? We would appreciate any Help you may be able to favor us with and eagerly await your reply to this somewhat lengthy epistle.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 17, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Harvey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you seek information in respect to the cultural background of the Indians amongst whom you are labouring, the status of the Indian in this country and the policy of the Department in respect to the progress and general wellbeing of the Indian population.\n\nI regret to state that the information in respect to these matters in print here is somewhat limited, and I should add that in view of the acute paper shortage that has now developed and the limited funds at our disposal, it is not at all likely that additional pamphlets will be printed at any time in the immediate future. It is my hope, however, that the information I am sending forward will meet your needs for the time being at least.\n\nIn respect to the cultural background of the Canadian Indian, there is a book on this subject, written by Desmond Jenness, Dominion Anthropologist. This is a very bulky and very costly volume, and I hesitate to recommend it unless you are prepared to spend a great deal of time in an exhaustive study of Indian anthropology, Indian folklore, etc. There is a magazine published monthly by the United States Department of Indian Affairs at Washington, entitled \"Indians at Work\", that might prove interesting to you and to your wife and helpful in your work.\n\nThe Canadian Indian is a ward of the Government and his exact status is outlined in the Indian Act, a copy of which I am sending forward. The reports of this branch for the last two or three years will give you a fair idea of governmental policy. This policy in the main in an economic sense has consisted of the organization of fur development projects, the conservation of fur life and direct assistance to Indians engaged in agriculture by the establishment of a revolving fund, from which funds can be secured by the Indian for the purchase of farm equipment, live stock, etc. A Handicraft Section was organized 4 years ago. We are at this date marketing handicraft products through a central warehouse at Ottawa. The turnover last year amounted to approximately $25,000. Actual organization work so far has been confined to Indian reserves in eastern Canada.\n\nA health program was organized also about 4 years ago. This health program has as its immediate objective the arresting of the ravages of tuberculosis among Indians and the ultim\n\nReverend I. J Harvey,\nUnited Church Mission,\nOxford House,\nManitoba.\nate eradication of this disease. In recent years T.B. sanatoriums have been established at Coqualeetza, B.C.; Cut'Appelle, Sask.; Dynevor, Man.; Fisher River, Man.; and Manitowaning, Ont. We have a medical division in the Department with two doctors in charge. In respect to health education in the schools, we have been following somewhat closely the textbooks and general health program promoted by the provincial departments of Education.\n\nIt may be stated in a general sense that the aim of the Government is to gradually bring the Indian up to a standard of living and accomplishment somewhat comparable to that enjoyed by the average citizen of Canada in a well organized community. In the East, where this has been to some extent achieved, the result is at least partial assimilation.\n\nIt cannot be said that we have yet succeeded in establishing what one might describe as an ideal housing unit for the Indian families. Climatic conditions in the country differ widely. For example, a house suitable at Aklavit might be wholly unsuitable in southern British Columbia. Where logs are available the log house appears to be the most satisfactory from the standpoint of comfort and fire hazard. In a number of localities in Ontario Indians appear to favour small frame houses, roofed with asbestos shingles and finished with a fireproof, artificial, imitation brick.\n\nA number of worthwhile re-afforestation projects have been undertaken in recent years; hundreds of thousands of trees have been planted at the Six Nations, Muncey, Tyendinaga and a number of other reserves.\n\nWe are at this date encouraging Indians to go in extensively for what we usually describe as subsistence gardens. We are doing this in an attempt to provide the Indian with a better balanced diet and to keep down to the lowest possible figure our annual relief costs. You will be interested to learn that Dr. Orford, the Indian Agent in charge of the James Bay Agency, confronted with conditions somewhat similar to the conditions existing at Oxford House, succeeded last year in growing sufficient potatoes for a large number of his Indians and this spring informs us that he has sufficient potatoes in a well constructed root-house to provide seed to a number of bands.\n\nShould you require additional information, I want you to feel free to communicate with us again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt this week of an income tax statement for my wife, Mrs. J. Harvey (Dept. #36, P.H.#52, Emp.#1493), showing her income for the year ending Dec 31, etc.\n\nConcerning this statement there are two things we should like to draw to your attention. First, the address should be \"Oxford House\", instead of \"Turnway House\" or \"Oxford House, Turnway House\" as is always on her cheques. There are two different places in N. Manitoba. Secondly, the amount you show on your statement does not...\njibe with the amount we have received by cheque each month. My wife's cheques have each been made out for $93.32. In three months this would total $279.96. The total net income as shown by your statement, however, should be ($316.35 - 22.14) $294.21. In monthly cheques this would have been $98.07. The cheques are still made out for $93.32 so we should like to hear from you in this regard at your earliest convenience.\n\nTrusting that you will give the above matters your attention and thanking you in anticipation I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She states that there will be only about nine pupils attending in June, if the school remains open, but there would be between 30 and 40 in August. It would seem therefore advisable to change the holiday time at this school accordingly, that is, close the school May 31st, and re-open it on August 1st.\n\nIf the Department approves of this suggested change, which I would recommend, will you kindly advise me by wire.

Consequently no salary should be paid the teacher, Mrs. William Duesk, for the months of June and July, but payment of her salary should be resumed from August 1, 1944.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nR. A. Henry, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBack either in December 1941 or January 1942 you were kind enough to send me at the United Church House at Oxford House, Manitoba, a copy of the Indian Act plus considerable other material concerning Indians. You also sent me a two or three-page letter outlining the policy and aims of the Indian Department which the latter is attempting to follow out in its work with the natives.\n\nI appreciated that material very much and when I left Oxford to finish my College course, kept it for my successor in the hopes that it would be equally valuable to him. Now that I have finished College, however, I have decided to go back into Indian work.\nthis time at Cross Lake, and wish that I had kept the material you so kindly sent me.\n\nRather than send up to Alfred for the copies I left there, I was wondering if it would be possible for you, at your convenience, to send me duplicates of them all, including your letter. The reason for making this request is the same as before. I want to have as clear an idea as possible about what exactly the Indian Department is trying to accomplish and how it is going about its work, so that instead of working at cross purposes with you, the mission can cooperate to the full, thus increasing the possibilities of success.\n\nI trust that the above will not inconvenience you too much and that you will understand the reasons for my request. I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIan J. Harvey\nOttawa, May 5, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Harvey:\n\nIn response to the request contained in your letter of May 1, I am sending forward herewith certain information which I trust will prove helpful to you in your work at Cross Lake. It is unnecessary to state that, should you require additional information, you should feel free to communicate with us again at any time.\n\nIn looking over the material, I notice that there are very few references to the educational policy of the Department, and it occurred to me that you might like to have an expression of opinion on educational policy from me as you begin your new duties. Just at the moment we are finding it exceedingly difficult to secure the number of fully qualified teachers necessary to operate our schools. This condition is likely to continue for a decade at least and there is not much that we can do about it. However, I have arrived at a definite conclusion that Indian day school teachers, particularly in the outlying districts, should be members of the permanent Civil Service and that they should be employed for the full 12 month period, subject, of course, to the statutory holidays. They should qualify for superannuation and be paid a salary that would attract a large number of ambitious young men to take up this work. In other words, I have in mind the appointment, not of school teachers as such, but rather welfare and training officers. These men, working under the nominal direction of the Indian agent, should be responsible for instruction in the classroom, the distribution of relief supplies, the care of the dispensary, promotion of gardening and in fact everything relating to Indian welfare. I am convinced that\n\nReverend I. J. Harvey,\nSte. 8 - 175 Mayfair Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nnot until we have such men in charge of our schools will the Indian population respond in any satisfactory sense to our educational program.\n\nMay I express the hope that you will find your task at Cross Lake challenging and well worth while. I know of no people in Canada who have a greater claim upon our service than the 120,000 Indians committed to our care.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a report I have received from Rev. Mr. Dueck, the United Church Missionary at the Oxford House Reserve, regarding the Oxford House U.C. Indian Day School. Mrs. Dueck is the teacher of the school, and since receiving this report, both Mr. and Mrs. Dueck have visited the office, and have discussed problems regarding the school with me.\n\nThe attendance at this school, as shown by the return for the June quarter, recently forwarded to Ottawa, is keeping up very well, and apparently the pupils are doing good work.\n\nI hope to visit the school when I am at Oxford House for treaty payment this month, though the school will not be in session at that time.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nMr P.G. Lazenby  \nIndian Agent,  \nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr Lazenby,\n\nDue to the fact that there is no official inspection of the Indian Day School during teaching days, I beg leave to make this report of my observations gleaned from the visits paid by myself.\n\nThe teacher has primarily laid a heavy stress on Health and Citizenship from the beginning of the school term and now enjoys the results with a fair measure of success. Her rigid enforcement of obeying rules of cleanliness, without exception to time, place or person is seen by the desks, walls, and windows, which are scrubbed every week. The school grounds are free from sticks or stones or shrubs which may cause physical injury. However, there is a lack of playground equipment and Tag games are the only ones enjoyed. The absence of unfair fighting such as ganging up on the man who's down, is the result of vigilance on the part of the teacher, and punishment when caught in the act.\n\nEnglish has improved somewhat, and I believe it is the result of doing away with interpretation and getting the child to do as commanded in the English language. There is no Cree used on the school grounds, and beginners learn English from the games they play. Other academic subjects were taught as in any Manitoba public school, and children attending more than 175 days completed one average year's work. However, the very beginners will spend more than one year in the first grade. During the next year there will be several students in grade seven but the teacher will be limited due to the lack of textbooks for that grade.\n\nIndustrial Art was taught in school by the teacher, employing one hour a week. On achievement day the girls displayed six dresses, four aprons, eight slips, pillow cases, towels, pot holders, and numerous small articles. During the course, they were taught the care of clothes as well as washing, ironing and patching. The boys had their toys on display and other wooden articles as could be made from packing boxes and nails.\n\nAt the beginning of the term, the school was painted, on the inside, and mudded on the outside. Window panes were replaced where necessary and the floor was oiled to keep down the dust. New seats arrived in October and were immediately properly installed. Eight other seats which had been given to an Indian to repair were salvaged from under the snow and made serviceable in my workshop. A sanitary washing fountain was installed to spread the hygienic activities, to minimize the communicability of disease. Old swing poles were removed to avoid injury, but the toilets which are both hazardous and insanitary cannot be improved until the Medical Officer makes his suggestion at Treaty time. Mrs Dueck supervised the boys in the making of shutters from biscuit boxes in order to prevent window breaking during the period when school is closed.\n\nMrs Dueck and I appreciate your co-operation in conducting the activities of the Oxford House School, especially in that you have gone to the trouble of arranging the teaching term from August to May. We realize how much annoyance and extra burden is laid upon you whenever a new missionary wishes to materialize his ideas, and his successor does the direct opposite. We are looking forward to treaty time just as much as anxious as the natives. There are many problems that I am sure could be solved when viewed at close range by Dr Corrigan and yourself. I hope that I will be able to arrange a motor boat to take the treaty party to the school.\n\nI remain, Sincerely\n\nSgd Wm H Dueck\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce\nPORTAGE & DONALD BRANCH\nWinnipeg, Man., 28th August 1944\n\nComptroller of the Treasury\nDominion of Canada\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have today received your cheque No Z 058087, $91.40, in favour of O Dusek, Bank of Commerce, Acct. 36300, Portage & Donald Branch, Winnipeg, and would advise that account No 36300 at this office is in the name of \"William A.

This was done and I have received the Bank statement that the ninth school cheque number W 063005 was credited to account number 36300 under the name of William A. Dueck. I have no record of any other cheques deposited in that manner but assumed that the Bank was crediting account number 36300 with the cheques for the school term of 1944-45.\n\nMy explanation for the difficulty created is that you may have asked the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Portage and Donald, at Winnipeg, Manitoba to accept these cheques in my name under account number 36300. That is impossible as I have no account at any Bank but place my savings with those of my husbands. Therefore if you would kindly send my other cheques to the same Bank and ask them to Credit Mr William A Duecks account number 36300 with my cheques, I should be deeply obliged.\n\nI have sent an explanation to the Bank manager at Winnipeg and also to the Indian Agent at Norway House.\n\nThere is a total lack of mail service at Oxford House, the whole year round and important mail as well as other mail is either delayed for many months or goes entirely astray. It is unfortunate that the Canadian Post office cannot arrange for any regular monthly mail service, and we are at loss as to where to have you send our cheques accept that they be sent to the Bank.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. O.

When the Department arranged to send your cheque to the Bank of Commerce several months ago it was not realized that the account to which the cheque was deposited was your husband's. However, since the bank has started to return the cheques, stating you have no account, we have decided that you may follow either of the under-mentioned alternatives:\n\n(a) Continue to receive your cheque through the Indian Agent.\n\n(b) Open an account in any branch of a chartered bank in your own name and advise us and the cheque will then be sent to that account.\n\nIt is not our intention to send unendorsed cheques to any other account than one belonging to the person in whose favour the cheque is drawn.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey's letter, File 123-6-1 of the 11th October, just received today, with reference to the salary cheques of Mrs Olga Dueck, the teacher of the Oxford House U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter I also received today from Mrs Dueck.\n\nIt appears that Mrs Dueck wants her cheque sent direct to the Bank of Commerce, Portage and Donald Branch, Winnipeg, and there placed to the credit of her husband's account in the name of William A Dueck, Savings Account #36300.\n\nIf this can be arranged will you kindly let me know.\n\nP.G.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr Lazenby,\n\nI received your letter in connection with my Indian Day School cheques and wish to answer to the best of my ability.\n\nLast February I sent to the Comptroller of the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa, asking them to send the cheques to the Bank of Commerce, Portage and Donald Branch, Winnipeg, Manitoba, and to be credited to my husband's account number 36300 under the name of William A Dueck, Oxford House, Manitoba. The reason being that it was so indefinite about our mail service, and we didn't wish to have the cheque go astray.\n\nSince last September I received through the mail eight cheques numbers J 042592, Q 021176, Q 098943, S 001479, S 064500 T 069417, U 054480, V 070522.\n\nOn May 29th I received a Bank statement from the above mentioned Bank of Commerce, signed by John Shaw, Manager, that account number 36300 was credited with ninety one dollars and forty cents, of cheque number W 063005, and gathered from this that my request as mentioned had been accepted by both the Department and the Bank.\n\nSince I think it quite favourable in every respect that my Indian Day School cheques be deposited to my husband's savings account number 36300 it is my wish that it be continued for the school year of 1944 to 45.\n\nIt seems that the difficulty arose when the cheque number Z058087 was sent to be deposited at the Bank of Commerce, Portage and Donald Branch at Winnipeg, under the name of O.Dueck, account number 36300, when it actually should have been deposited in the name of William A Dueck whose account is number 36300.\n\nShould the bank refuse to accept my cheques credited to William A Dueck's account, please send all cheques c/o The Indian Agent to be held for Mrs Dueck until I can definitely state what source our mail service will be this winter.\n\nI shall keep cheque number Z 058087 as received through the Agency at Norway House, and wish to express my regret that this complication has come up.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- Mrs O.Dueck\nOttawa, January 9, 1945.\n\nMr. P.

The delay in receiving these forms is due to the fact that the Oxford House School is located in an isolated place and mail deliveries are extremely slow.

Miss Loewen is twenty-two years of age; has Grade XI standing; is a graduate of a Bible School; and is recommended by Dr. Cormie, our Superintendent of Missions.\n\nThe missionary whom we expect to send to Oxford House, to succeed Mr. W.A. Dueck, will be married before taking over the work at the beginning of July, so that, from this point of view, the arrangement should be quite satisfactory.

Dueck.\nREPORT OF TOUR OF NORWAY HOUSE AGENCY BY AIR JANUARY 7th TO JANUARY 13th, 1946.\n\nTook off for Narrows at 1030 hrs, arrived Narrows 1100 hrs. Nearly went through thin ice in front of U.C. Mission, just missed open water by few feet.\n\nInterviewed Rev. Kehler and Mr Clarke, Manager of the Hudson's Bay Company. Quite a number of women with children staying in the locality so their children can attend school. This would not be possible without the Family Allowance. I inspected the school, Miss Helen Loewen is the teacher. She is 23 years of age with a grade 9 standing. There were 14 pupils present. The building is the most dilapidated school building I have ever seen. I would like to describe it. It is an abandoned Mission House built on semi-muskeg; the classroom is 10'x 28', the walls lean in and out, the ceiling sags and the floor heaves. There are large windows on a Southern exposure. There are no blinds and the children cannot escape the constant glare of the sun. It is almost impossible to see the cloth blackboard at the far end of this 'tunnel'. The walls are 8 ft. high, none of the doors open or close properly owing to the heaving of the building. The desks are of rough lumber and rickety. The teacher's desk is a packing case, and she has an apple box for a seat. At the far end of the room there is a large stone fireplace which provides ventilation, making it the only Day School in the Agency where the air is not foul. Taking all this into consideration, I consider that Miss Loewen is doing valiantly. I gave her what advice and encouragement I could. Took off for Oxford House 1600 hrs, arrived 1645 hrs. It was almost dark.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 16, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nThe attendance at the Oxford House Indian Day School has increased to such an extent that the services of a second teacher will be required for the academic year 1946-47. The Indian Council is loaning us the Council Hall to be used as a classroom. We are ordering new desks for this building.\n\nI presume that Miss Loewen will continue as teacher of this school during the coming academic year, and the Department would appreciate it if you would nominate a second teacher. We have been allowing Miss Loewen a salary of $95.00 a teaching month during the past year, but for the academic year 1946-47 we are prepared to allow each of the two teachers salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month plus bonus of 17%. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I am myself, trying to obtain a teacher for the God's Lake Gold Mine.\n\nI would like to point out that with the exception of the God's Lake Gold Mine, there is not a teacherage in this Agency, and teachers coming in will have to find accommodation, most probably with the resident missionary.\n\nE.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr Bernard F. Neary\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 9th re the Day Schools at Oxford House. There are 2 schools in operation at Oxford House; the old one referred to as No. 1 is being taught by Mr George Donald Loewen, and the new one No. 2 which is the renovated Council House is being taught by Miss Elsie Brandt. Both Miss B and Mr Loewen called in my office on their way to Oxford this fall. I gave them documentation papers and emphatic instructions that they were to be completed and forwarded to you and that the expeditious payment of their salaries depended on the completion of this procedure. I am at a loss to know why Mr Loewen has not carried out those instructions. However I will send him the papers enclosed in your letter of the 9th ultimo with a repetition of my previous instructions.\n\nYou state that you have received no communication from me with regard to this school. On Oct 11th I forwarded to you the quarterly returns for the month ending Sept 30 for both these schools and in the column for remarks in each return was stated the date of opening and other particulars of interest.\n\nMr Phelan complains in a letter about the spate of Day School requisitions which have been going in from this Agency. I would like to point out that 6 new day schools came into operation in this Agency this fall and the sending of these requisitions was unavoidable and very necessary and I could not anticipate their opening last April. However I am circularizing all the day schools under my jurisdiction to submit requisitions to cover the school year 1947-1948 and to have them in my office not later than the 1st of February and I will forward same to you before the break-up. If I waited for the date quoted by Mr Phelan which is April 30, they would be caught by the break-up and could not reach your office until the middle of June at the earliest.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 2 January 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Oxford House Indian Day School - No. 530\n\nIn memorandum of Sept. 26, 1946, you were advised of the appointment of Miss Elsie Mary Brandt as teacher of this school.\n\nDue to the increased attendance, it was found necessary to appoint a second teacher by the name of Mr. George Donald Loewen who began duties on Sept. 1, 1946, at a salary of $125.00 a teaching month. We have not yet been able to obtain the T.D. 1 Form and Staff Questionnaire from him due in part at least to the remote district in which the school is situated.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue a cheque to him for the amount due from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31, 1946, and consider him as single without dependents.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, January 3, 1947.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nWe have received your letter of December 16.\n\nUnder the circumstances, as explained in paragraph one of your letter, there is little else that could have been done to impress upon Mr. Loewen the importance of submitting the necessary forms. However, we will try to have the Treasury Branch issue his cheque without the income tax and staff questionnaire forms.\n\nUnfortunately, the quarterly returns had not reached here before our letter of November 9 was sent to you.\n\nYour proposal concerning the requisitions seems a very sound one and we will anticipate their early receipt. We would appreciate it if the books listed in volume 1 of the School Bulletin were ordered. We will endeavour to send north also to these schools any other new books which might be adopted in the meantime.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Inspector E. Scott Bateman's Report, dated February 11th, 1947, regarding Oxford House Day School #1. Original on file 1-1-6\n\nFile 123-6-1\n\nMr. Loewen is unskilled and inexperienced and the work being done in the school is a direct reflection of this. Student progress is poor in all branches.\nOttawa, February 27, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Bateman:\n\nI have received and carefully read your reports on school inspections at Oxford House and Split Lake. I hope to be writing to you in the near future concerning the new schools we intend building in your inspectorate this year.\n\nBy now the school supplies ordered for Oxford House should have reached there. We arranged for the books to reach Ilford by January first. The Northern Transportation Company was requested to handle them by tractor train from there. The Basic Readers of the Curriculum Foundation Series were being supplied to these schools. Thirty-six desks were ordered from Moyer's in Winnipeg and our records show that these were delivered to Inspector Hamilton in Winnipeg on January 4 and that they too were shipped to Ilford for onward routing by tractor train. It is unfortunate that all these supplies have not yet arrived to alleviate conditions at these schools.\n\nWe are writing to Dr. Dorsey of the United Church concerning Mr. Loosen and to Bishop Lofthouse about Reverend Mr. Cosley. You will be receiving notification in the near future of the new teachers' salary scales which we intend taking into effect on the first of September, 1947, and which it is hoped will attract a better class of teacher into our day schools.\n\nI appreciate your frankness in submitting these reports and feel that they will do much to bring about a needed improvement in the education of the Indians of your inspectorate.\n\nB. Scott Bateman, Esq.,\nInspector of schools,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-1, part 1)\nWe will arrange to have forwarded to you cheque covering your inspection expenses.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 27, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nAttached as appendices are the reports received from Provincial School Inspector B. Scott Bateman on his recent inspection of the two rooms at Oxford House.\n\nWe have a large stock of school supplies and 36 desks now on their way in from Ilford by tractor train to these schools. This should help to alleviate conditions insofar as school supplies are concerned.\n\nHowever, I would draw your attention particularly to the Inspector's report on Mr. Leven. In the near future we expect to announce our new teachers' salary scale and it is hoped that with the more attractive salary offer we can place qualified teachers in these schools. We do appreciate your efforts in keeping these schools open during these difficult war years.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

The Indians were getting plenty of fish and meat, and were on the traplines. We have two schools at this point, which are situated three miles apart. One is taught by Mrs. Reynolds and the other by Mr. Reynolds, the Missionary, who are both permit teachers. Mrs. Reynolds had 50 pupils on the roll and 28 in the class at the time of my visit to the school.\n\nWhen I visited the school taught by Mr. Reynolds it was early in the morning and the children were just starting to arrive. These are fairly old buildings, but in fair condition, as they have recently been whitewashed and cleaned up.\n\nLighting in both schools was very poor. This is a point where we intend building a new school next year.\n1. Name of School: Oxford House No.3\n\n2. Agency: Nelson River\n\n3. Type of Day School (including Plan No.):\n\n4.

S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nJR/MO\nEnclos.\nOttawa, June 1, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nGod's Lake Indian Day School,\nOxford House Indian Day School,\nChesawwin Indian Day School.\n\nThe above three schools are included in our building programme for 1949-50. It is our intention to follow the identical plan for these three projects. Due to transportation difficulties, we arranged to ship in, by tractor train during the last winter, complete bills of materials for God's Lake and Oxford House. These materials are now on the ground at the sites selected for these schools.\n\nThe materials for Chesawwin, which is on Cedar Lake in The Pas Superintendency, are now being ordered by the Departmental Purchasing Agent and will be shipped by barge from The Pas in the near future.\n\nMr. Regional Supervisor Davis has been approaching contractors who specialize in construction work in Northern Manitoba. As a result, he has been able to obtain the following labour tenders for the construction of these three schools:\n\n| Contractor          | God's Lake | Oxford House | Chesawwin |\n|--------------------|------------|--------------|-----------|\n| K. Sabinson        | $5,000.00  | $6,000.00    | $ -       |\n| Matthews Construction Co. | $5,900.00  | $5,900.00    | $5,900.00 |\n| Ener Brothers      | $6,800.00  | $6,800.00    | $6,400.00 |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-1, part 1)\nIt would seem evident that we can eliminate immediately the highest tenderer, namely Emery Brothers, of Flin Flon, Manitoba.\n\nGod's Lake\n\nAt God's Lake, Mr. Sabiston's tender is the lowest and I feel it should be accepted. Mr. Davis has some doubts about Mr. Sabiston as a contractor but we have investigated his ability through Indian Health Services. Mr. Sabiston was employed by them last year and I attach a letter from C. J. Connolly, Supervising Engineer, of Indian Health Services, concerning his ability. I would recommend that the Minister approve the acceptance of his Labour Tender for the erection of this school in the amount of $5,000.00.\n\nOxford House\n\nThe lowest of the three tenders is that of the Matthews Construction Company, of The Pas, Manitoba, and I have prepared a draft submission to Council for your consideration. A contract has recently been let with this company for the erection of the Nelson House Indian Day School, by authority of P.C. 2497 of May 17.\n\nChamawwin\n\nThe lowest tender for the erection of this school is again that of the Matthews Construction Company of The Pas, Manitoba. Therefore, you will find a joint submission to Council covering both the Oxford House and Chamawwin projects.\n\nDirector.\n\nEmel.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 1, 1949.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.\n\nRequesting authority for the provision of one-room Indian Day Schools on the Oxford House Indian Reserve, in the Norway House Agency; and on the Chisasibi Indian Reserve, in The Pas Indian Agency, both in the Province of Manitoba, and for which funds are provided in the 1949-50 estimates.\n\nTwo extra copies of Order-in-Council are required.\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT it is immediately necessary, and funds are provided in the 1949-50 estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, to complete the erection of one-room Indian Day Schools on the Oxford House Indian Reserve, in the Norway House Indian Agency, and on the Chassawin Indian Reserve, in The Pas Indian Agency, both in the Province of Manitoba;\n\nTHAT it is essential that educational facilities be provided for the Indian children on the Oxford House Reserve and on the Chassawin Reserve;\n\nTHAT Section 36 of the Public Works Act, Chapter 166, R.S.C. 1927, provides in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any works are to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the Minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such works except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest ..........\";\n\nTHAT the building materials for these schools have already been purchased and have been shipped by tractor trains to the sites of both schools;\n\nTHAT, due to the very isolated situation of both these Indian reserves, there are few builders or contractors in the area, nor are outside contractors interested in tenders if invited as aforesaid, as they have all the work they can do in their own localities;\n\nTHAT, as the result of enquiries made by our field officials, we have been able to obtain the following labour tenders for the erection of these buildings:\n\n| Contractor                        | Oxford House | Chassawin |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Matthews Construction Company, The Pas | $5,900.00    | $5,900.00 |\n| Elmer Sabiston, Winnipeg          | $6,000.00    | -         |\n| Emery Brothers, Flin Flon         | $6,800.00    | $6,400.00 |\n\nTHAT the lowest tenderer, namely the Matthews Construction Company, of The Pas, Manitoba, has building crews\nin this region and is known to be a satisfactory and reliable contractor. This tender covers all transportation and boarding costs and is felt to be fair and reasonable.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the erection of the Oxford House Indian Day School by the Matthews Construction Company, of The Pas, Manitoba, at the price of five thousand nine hundred dollars ($5,900.00) and of the Chassonain Indian Day School by the Matthews Construction Company, of The Pas, Manitoba, at the price of five thousand nine hundred dollars ($5,900.00), this being the most suitable arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried on to completion in order to provide educational facilities for the Indian children on these reserves in time for school opening in September.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nJune 10th, 1949.\n\nThe Dominion of Canada General Ins.

Progress Construction New Schools in Agency.\n\nOxford House School, No. 1 has been completed, with the exception of installation of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nGod's Lake United Church School is also completed, with exception of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nWhen these chimneys arrive it will be only a matter of hours to install each one.\n\nI made a final check on God's Lake United Church School on Oct. 17th.\n\nThis building has been completed sufficiently to legalize payment to the Contractor.\n\nHowever the finishing was an extremely hurried job and reflects no credit to the man concerned.\n\nThe living quarters especially are very poorly painted and finished, the cupboard doors do not fit and the paint has just been slapped on.\n\nIn the Main Glass Room, the small windows on the North side are fitted with Butt hinges, these hinges were not countersunk; when the windows are closed it leaves an eighth of an inch gap.\n\nThe Contractor was told about all this by the Assistant Agent at God's Lake and agreed to rectify it, however it was not done as apparently the main idea was to get finished and get back to town.\n\nUnfortunately, the Contractor had left when I made my final inspection. The whole finish shows a definite lack of interest. In my opinion this man should not be given any further Contracts with the Indian Department.\n\nAttached please find Final Progress Report.\nNo. 3 Joint Recommendation by Mr. Grafton and myself on New Schools Next Year.\n\nThere are no further reserves in this Agency that would warrant a joint school, due to the lack of Non-Treaty children.\n\nNo. 4 Report on New Teachers.\n\nTo date I have only met Miss M. Rahn of God's Lake United Church School, she appears to be doing well and seems to be quite efficient.\n\nI see no signs of teachers for Oxford House schools, No. 1 & 2, nor for Split Lake.\n\nCould I be advised as to when these teachers may arrive?\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the Quarterly Return ending Sept. 30th, 1949, submitted by this Agency. Under the heading \"Schools & Education\", reference is made to a Permanent School at Shoantown.\n\nI would appreciate your comment on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H.

I have expended my jurisdiction in this matter. I must ask you to pardon me, but as the matter was a small one, and as we were in urgent need of these tables, our school equipment being at the most primitive, I took the responsibility of having the lumber manufactured, and made the tables myself.\n\nOf course if you think I have done wrong, and cannot issue a deduction in the amount, I will have to pay the bill out of my own slender salary.\n\nThere is a man here who gives considerable trouble, beating his wives. The Chief, Councillors, and myself went on Tuesday and gave a last warning to one of them, a young fellow named Wood, who seems to be walking in the footsteps of his father in this matter. I understand you warned the old man when you were here. In the meantime, have sent to Ottawa for a copy of the Indian Act, and if we have any further trouble will communicate with Mr. Calvert. Perhaps hopes we have considerable sickness here among the people but are doing our best in every way to help them, with the means at our disposal.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nJohn W. Reddick\nSir,\n\nI have received from the Rev. John Niddrie of Oxford House the enclosed bill but as I had no authority to issue a voucher covering the amount and as the work done was not ordered by me, I send to you for direction in the case.\n\nI also enclose Mr. Neddrie's letter in which he gives full statement of his case.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 17, 1910.\n\nRev.

Although no authority was given for this expenditure it is considered that it was necessary and you may submit a voucher in the usual way, when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

He also asked with very considerable emphasis for a resident doctor.

Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of October 4th, last, in which you deal with the erection of a school-house at Oxford House I beg to say that, as you have been advised in connection with the Island Lake reserve, the Department is not disposed to erect permanent buildings at these points until such time as the surveys are made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Simmons,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe model also require 10 Settlers, and 10 Hard Forks, in the event of you planting out request against the Castle.\n\nOne thing we are very much in need of, and really cannot get along without is 30 lbs. which faces for Pet. Gasoloid. We cannot manufacture lumber for the building of our houses without them, and we trust you will regard their request favorably.\n\nWe also need a box of Carpenter tools in the very worst way. If we could be most thankful if you could help us out in this matter as well as 12 lbs. of Pet. Gasoloid. We also need 20 Spades and 20 Grab Hoes. We were told that so Bushely a Potatoes had been sent to us last year, about 350 lbs. packed up, and when these were divided up we only had about 6 or 8 Potatoes each. This however when wanted, grew very well.\n\nWe want to ask if you can give us some more Potatoes again, and also some Garden seeds also next Spring. We had not sufficient nuts sent us last time, and are still about 30 short.\n\nNow Sir. Our request may seem very large to you, but please recollect that we have one! Come into Treaties and have nothing to go on with, and furthermore, this is an annual requirement, that is we will not have opportunity of making a collection again until December Packet 1911 goes out.\n\nHope you will understand matters, and do your best to help us.\n\nWe are Your Most Respectfully,\n\nChief - Jeremiah Chubb\n\nCouncillor\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Last spring when Mr. W. Lemieux was here making peace parleys, I asked him if the government would build us a school at Oxford House, and he promised to call your attention to this fact. Since then we have not heard anything more, and we are now anxious to know if you will build us a schoolhouse, and send us a teacher. We are at present using the church for school purposes, and we doubt that this is a good thing.\n\nWe also asked Mr. Lemieux about a doctor\u2014a great number of our people are sick, and we have many deaths, and a number of lives could be saved if we had a doctor here. Our nearest doctor is at Norwood House a distance of nearly 200 miles away. If we had a doctor who made his home here at Oxford, he could easily attend to the needs of our people as also the God Lake Band, as well as Slave Lake, both of which are within reasonable distance.\n\nWe also asked Mr. Lemieux if the government would supply us with some cattle, as they have done to the other Reserve. That is some of the Coco River and Bull River also. We would like to know what your disposition is in the matter.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 1, 1911.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of December 24th signed also by Councillors Chubb and Mattaway in which you ask for the erection of a school building for the Oxford Lake Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not disposed to undertake the expenditure necessary to erect permanent buildings until such time as survey of the reserve is made and the Indians are located. You will readily understand that until this work is done it is not possible to intelligently locate a school building which would be without doubt within the reach of the majority of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChief Jeremiah Chubb,\nOxford Lake,\nKeewatin.\nSir,\n\nI beg to send in the following report of the burning down of the Mission House at Oxford from the Revd J.W. Niddrie Missionary and School Teacher for that District?\n\nHe reports as having lost everything, all the I.D. Supplies Destitute, all his own personal effects, and all the Missionary Society's belongings, which he considers as a very heavy loss to the Mission.\n\nThe Revd Mr Niddrie has asked me that a period of two months be granted him for getting out the necessary building material for a new school, and he has also asked that the School Grant be continued for this period or longer as he desires the time.\n\nIn consideration of his long services amongst the Indians out west and here, I heartily recommend that this be granted by the Department to Mr Niddrie to enable him to get his school going again. In the mean time the school is out of operation till a new building is erected.\n\nI would also recommend that an ample supply of provisions be sent from here to help him on in the work of building a school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo advising the Department of the destruction by fire of the mission buildings at Oxford House.\n\nAs you are aware the church building, although occupied for school purposes was the property of the Church Pending a survey of a reserve, the Department is not prepared to incur any expenditure in the erection of a school building in the way either of material or the supplying of provisions as you suggest. In order, however, to give the missionary and teacher an opportunity to put up another building that may be used for school purposes, or making other suitable arrangements, a salary will be paid for a reasonable length of time not to exceed two months.\n\nYou will be good enough to advise the missionary to the above effect and as soon as you are made aware of the arrangements it is intended to make you should inform the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

I believe the school there is in bad shape and should be renewed; the question to consider is whether $3000 is too much money. The building, of course, will have to be built of logs, which, I understand, are available. The matter of flooring and roof boards would have to be arranged for, either by having them brought over from Cross Lake where there is a saw-mill, or brought in from Selkirk. In either case it will be an expensive matter. The shingles would certainly have to be brought in from Selkirk. I will get more information before the time for building arrives.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM INDIAN AGENT WM. GORDON, NORWAY HOUSE, MAN., Dated Sept. 22, 1924.\n\nSince the reserve location has been decided upon at Oxford House, and a site chosen for a day school, and as the present quarters are unfit for school purposes, and the average attendance at school is good, I would recommend that a building be erected at this point, for school purposes.\nOttawa, January 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Gordon and the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals have urged the Department to erect a day school at Oxford House. The Methodist Church have conducted a day school quite regularly at this point for many years. In September Mr. Gordon wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"Since the reserve location has been decided upon at Oxford House, and a site chosen for a day school; and as the present quarters are unfit for school purposes and the average attendance at school is good, I would recommend that a building be erected at this point for school purposes.\"\n\nIn this connection I would refer you also to your No. 207-7B of October 9th, last. Other than this, the Department has had no correspondence with reference to the best method of arranging for the erection of the building. It is proposed to provide funds, which will be available the first of the fiscal year, for this purpose. There is an item in the present draft of the Estimates of $2,500.00. Please advise the Department what steps you propose to take.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant #123-6-5 informing me that Mr. Indian Agent Gordon and the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals have urged the Department to erect a day school at Oxford House.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when Mr. Agent Gordon was here last Fall, I discussed with him the question as to how we should go about building this school. He informed me that Oxford House was a very inaccessible point but that logs could be taken out during the winter for the purpose and that the lumber etc. would have to be sent out from Selkirk.\n\nI dealt with this matter fully in my letter to you of the 9th October. I am now taking it up again with Mr. Agent Gordon, asking him what it would cost to take out the logs, and I hope to have a reply in a short time. As a matter of fact, I have taken it upon myself to instruct him to have the logs taken out before the logging season is over. I have asked him if it is possible to get the required boards and shingles in the district, as I have an idea that there are some portable mills near Oxford House from which we could procure lumber. I will report to you fully when I get this matter in shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nFurther to my letter of the 31st January last with reference to the erection of a Day School at Oxford House. I have received a letter from Mr. Wm. Gordon stating that he is making a trip to Oxford House to ascertain whether or not pit sawn lumber can be procured and at what cost. Upon his return to the Agency he will furnish me with a report. In the meanwhile he asks for the sum of $100.00 to cover preliminary expenditures, and I would ask the Department to be good enough to furnish an accountable cheque for that amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 3rd, 1925\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the proposed school at Oxford House, I may say that the logs are being taken out, dressed and hauled onto the site. The cost will be $1.00 each for the 24' logs, and $1.40 to $2.00 for the 30' logs.\n\nThe cost of freighting lumber from Selkirk to Oxford House will be between $100 and $125.00 per M., and as we will have in the neighborhood of 5000 ft., you will see it is going to be quite an expense. However, I am satisfied that the building 30 x 20 can be completed and lined inside with V-joint, and placed on a stone foundation within the amount stated in your letter, viz: $2500.00.\n\nI shall be glad if you will send me a further accountable cheque for $200.00 on receipt of this letter. I asked for $100.00 last week which has not yet been received. This will make $300.00 in all.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Stevens, Esq., Teacher of the OXFORD HOUSE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, on File 123-6-2.\n\nFor 19\u00bd days during this quarter school was closed because of there being no wood. The only reasons anyone seems to have to offer are (a) There were no men to bring wood (b) The Chief is no good. Now, as it is only about two hours work to bring a load here, any of the men could have brought wood, for there always were one or two around. As to the chief, if the people didn't intend to bring wood, the chief could not have made them anyway. As it is, the chief's position is made very burdensome for these people believe that \"He who is greatest among you shall serve you\". The only people around here who are living up to their promises are the old ones. Attendance is very low because of the time when school was closed. While school was in session, attendance was good.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nOn the March quarter return of the Oxford House Indian Day School which has recently reached the Department, it is noted that the school was closed for 19 days during the quarter owing to lack of wood. The teacher further states that the reason for this was that the chief did not arrange with any one to supply the wood required.\n\nIf you have an opportunity, the Department considers that it would be advisable to point out to the chief the necessity for having wood supplied to the Oxford House School ahead of time so that there may be no occasion for closing the school for the same reason as it was found necessary to close it during the March quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Leonard Bacon, B.A. of Oxford House, whose wife is the teacher at the Day School there. This letter deals with the question of supplying some provisions which would be necessary in order to provide the school children with a hot meal at noon. When I was at Norway House this summer this matter was discussed and it was discovered that in a number of the schools this arrangement had been in operation for some years. Our workers feel that Oxford House is just as needy in this regard as schools on other missions and I would urge upon the Department the wisdom of making it possible for Mr. and Mrs. Bacon to care for the children in this way. They have proved themselves to be self-sacrificing workers during the past year and I am sure their usefulness would be greatly enhanced if the Department makes this plan possible. It is suggested that a grant be made of:\n\n40 pounds of cocoa,\n100 pounds of sugar,\n300 pounds of beans,\n200 pounds of rice,\nand a few cups, plates and spoons.\n\nYour favorable consideration to this request will be very highly appreciated by,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barnes\n\nAB: NEF\nOttawa, August 26, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, requesting that the Department grant the supplies mentioned by you for the purpose of providing a midday lunch to the pupils of the Oxford House Indian Day School. In reply I have to say that the Department is today authorizing Mr. Indian Agent Gordon, of Norway House, to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the quantity of food supplies considered necessary, also a few cups, plates and spoons.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Cocoa, 200 lbs. Beans,\n100 \" Sugar, 150 \" Rice.\n\nYou may also purchase 18 granite cups, 18 granite plates and 18 inexpensive spoons. After the purchase has been made, you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. An account, in triplicate, properly certified, should also be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the freighting of these supplies to the school.

Even now I do not always have enough seats for all. If all the children would come to school, they would have to come to school in two or more shifts. Better still, if we got a new school and two teachers.\"\n\nPlease let me have your comments regarding the above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr. P. Phelan\n\nRe: Oxford House U.C. Indian Day School\n\nI have to hand your letter of March 29th 1946, wherein you request my comments regarding statements made by the teacher Miss Loewen. I sent in a report of a tour of this Agency dated 15 January 1945 under file 21-A which states in part as follows:\n\n\"The school building should be condemned. It is of logs, the ceiling is only 7' from the floor and there is no ventilation. This girl 'Miss Evelyn Loewen' has to walk nearly 3 miles to and from school each day and the weather was around 40 degrees below zero. The Attendance is good.\"\n\nWith regard to Miss Loewen's statement, it is quite correct. She has far more children attending than she can cope with under existing conditions. The building is 20' x 30' with a 7' ceiling and there is absolutely no provision other than the doors and windows for ventilation and with the present overcrowding, it is ideal for the propagation of tuberculosis. It is the opinion of the writer, that as a school building, it should be condemned. There is no teacherage and the teacher who boards at the Mission House, has to walk 3 miles to and from school over rough and exposed country in all kinds of weather. There are enough children of school age on this reservation to warrant the building of 2 day schools and 2 teacherages.\n\nThe last time I was in Oxford House, which was March 9th and 10th, the school was so overcrowded that I instructed Miss Loewen to divide all the children of grade 3 and under into 2 groups and alternate them in half day periods.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 17, 1946.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba,\n\nI have your letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the Oxford House School.\n\nIt is evident from your letter that a new school is required, but owing to conditions over which we have no control it is not possible for us to provide a new building this year. Is there any building on this reserve that could be rented, temporarily? If so, we would be prepared to pay rent for it and would even spend a reasonable amount of money to put it in a habitable condition. We would be prepared also to provide the salary for a second teacher.\n\nWhen preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1947-48, attention will be directed to the necessity for new schools on this reserve.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nAttn: Mr Bernard F Neary\nRe: Oxford House Day Schools\n\nIn reply to a letter received from Mr Phelan d/17 May 46 in which he suggests that I locate a building at Oxford House that could be used temporarily as a day school and he further states that the Department would be prepared to pay rent and would even be prepared to spend a reasonable amount of money to put it in habitable condition and further that the Department is prepared to provide the salary of a second teacher.\n\nWhile having treaty at Oxford House I made investigation. The Indians of that band are prepared to lend us their council house for a year to be used as a day school. This building would require a certain amount of work before it could be used for such purpose, 40 pieces of Beaverboard or Plywood 4' x 8' estimated cost $50.00, 3' x 12' of rough lumber $30.00 per ft., 25 lbs 2\" nails, 15 lbs 4\" nails, 10 lbs 1\" chingle nails, 1 window - 6 light 10' x 12', size of glass 2' x 3' 1/2\" estimated cost $2.50, Labor $60.00. The cost of freight from Norway House at $5.00 per cwt would be approximately $95.00.\n\nThe rough lumber I can provide from the Norway House Mill, the other material will have to be purchased from outside and if this expenditure is approved, in order to save time it would be appreciated if the other materials were purchased through Inspector Hamilton's office, Winnipeg. The beaverboard would have to be cut into 2' x 4' sections and tied in bundles so that it could be stowed in canoes and carried over portages.\n\nThere is an oak table and a chair in this building which would do for the teacher, a blackboard could be borrowed temporarily from the existing day school. 30 single desks would be required, 10 large, 10 medium, and 10 small. This building is the same size as the present day school at Oxford House. I have a capable man to look after the work of conditioning this building. This second school is urgently needed on this reservation and if this project is approved I would like to know as soon as possible as there is not much time to get it in condition by Sept 1st.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 16, 1946.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Oxford House Indian Day School. It is noted that the Band is prepared to loan the Council House for the academic year 1946-47. The approximate cost of the material, including freight, would be $238.00.\n\nIt is noted that you can secure the rough lumber from the Norway House mill. Inspector Hamilton is being requested to purchase the other material in Winnipeg and forward it to you.\n\nThe Purchasing Branch is being requested to secure 30 single desks.\n\nI am communicating with Dr. Dorey with a view to securing a second teacher.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPlease Quote File 15-A\n\nNorway House, Manitoba\n2nd September 1946.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. B.F. Neary\n\nI do not know if the two teachers for this academic year have arrived at Oxford House. The Council House, which is to be used as the 2nd Day School is not yet reconditioned. The 40 pieces of Beaverboard 4' x 8' and the window have not been received. I have written Inspector A.G. Hamilton about this and have asked him if it is possible to hurry the material along.\n\nExchange of correspondence with Oxford House involves weeks and months. To visit this reservation by canoe would take two weeks the return trip and I do not know when I will have the opportunity to fly there. The only rapid communication I with Oxford House is by H.B. Co radio when it is working. It is all rather difficult.\n\n(Signed) E.B. Goodman\n\nE.B. Goodman\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 10, 1946.\n\nMr. A. G.

I quote his reply:\n\n\"Am having lumber whip sawed suitable for desk and benches for Oxford House School. Have stated prices to be paid for labor have instructed United Church Missionary to pay for same with store orders. This procedure cheaper than shipping lumber to Oxford House this late date. Request from you keg for two and half inch.\"\n\nIn a letter received October 16th Mr. Goodman writes as follows:\n\n\"The second day school at Oxford House is operating in the Council House. They have 37 children attending and they have no desks. The purchase of desks for this school has been authorized and I believe you were requested to purchase same but were unable to do so. If you can purchase the desks prior to January 1st would you please do so and have them sent to Ilford where they can go in by tractor via Johnson Transportation Company.\"\n\nMoyers advise me they expect a shipment of model W chair desks late in December. There will be sizes:\nNo.1 - Large - No.3 - Medium - No.5 - Small.\nI might say the date of arrival is uncertain and these may arrive too late to ship north.\n\nPerhaps the seats could be secured in the East by the Purchasing Agent and shipped to arrive in Ilford.\nc/o Johnson Transportation Company not later than January lst.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to securing desks for the Oxford House School.\n\nManufacturers of desks in this section of the Dominion will not guarantee delivery under three or four months. It would then require additional time for the transportation of the desks from Ontario to Ilford, Manitoba.\n\nIn view of this situation, it is felt that you should place the order with Moyers branch in Winnipeg as if you can secure them by the end of December, it will not take so long to have them reach Ilford from Winnipeg.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-5, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr Bernard F Neary\n\nRe: Oxford House Indian Day Schools\n\nOn the 17th May 1946 I received a letter signed by Mr Phelan in which he requested me, when preparing the estimates for this Agency for the fiscal year 1947-8, to draw the attention of the Branch to the necessity for new schools on this reserve.\n\nThey have 1 old log school here which is entirely unsuitable and antiquated and the 2nd school this year is being conducted in the patched up Council House. It is requested that 2 new schools and 2 teachers residence be built this year, or that the building of them should commence this year. Owing to the geographical location of Oxford House, it will be impossible to do anything until next winter and all the building material necessary could be shipped in by tractor and building could commence the spring of 1948.\n\nAny buildings erected on the inland reservations would have to cover a period of 2 years for the reasons above mentioned.\n\nFor the health and well being of the children of this reservation, it is absolutely essential that the new schools be erected as soon as possible, and it is requested that this matter receive your serious consideration.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Inspector B. Scott Bateman's Report, dated February 11th, 1947, regarding Oxford House Day School #1. Original on file 1-1-6\n\nFile: 123-6-5\n\nThe condition of the building is very poor. The building is old, built of logs, and lined with V-joint. The lining is warped, buckled and shrunk, and the loss of heat through the walls and ceiling must be very great. The building was cold, and most of the younger students were blowing on their hands in an effort to warm them. Snow on rubbers under the stove had not melted by recess. Outside wraps were all worn in school.\n\nI understand that the fires are started in the morning by a child from a neighboring home and frequently the fire is not lighted until 15 minutes before school is called. It is therefore impossible for the school to be warmed up until after dinner.\n\nThe caretaking is done by the teacher. It is not well done. The school is not attractively decorated. There is little attempt on the part of the teacher to make it attractive. In spite of the teacher's best efforts, it would not be possible to create inspirational surroundings in such a building.\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, February 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th inst., with reference to the Oxford House Indian Day School. We also received report recently from Inspector Bateman in which he remarks on the bad condition of the present school.\n\nIn preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, we were confronted with a very large number of requests from all parts of Canada for new schools. We could only provide for some of them this year and as far as your Agency is concerned, the following amounts are provided in the 1947-48 appropriation.\n\nJack River C.E. Teacher's Residence $3,500.\nCross Lake U.C. School and Teacher's Residence combined $8,000.\nIsland Lake R.C. School and Teacher's Residence combined $8,000.\n\nIn other words, there is an amount of $19,500. provided for new school buildings in your Agency during the coming fiscal year.\n\nOwing to the information supplied in the second and third paragraphs of your letter, we would like to know if the conditions at Oxford House apply also to Cross Lake and Island Lake. If so, it might be possible to purchase material for Cross Lake, Island Lake and Oxford House from the $16,000. available. I presume it will be easier to erect the teacher's residence at Jack River.\nWe will be pleased to hear further from you offering any suggestions you consider necessary.\n\nIn the first part of this letter we referred to report from Inspector Bateman. One of his statements was that the fire in the school is started in the morning by a child from a neighboring home and frequently the fire is not lighted until fifteen minutes before school is called. As a result, it is impossible to heat the school before noon.\n\nThe Department feels that this condition, at least, could be remedied and we are prepared to allow a reasonable amount for the balance of this winter for someone who will light the fire much earlier in the morning so that the building may at least be warm when the children arrive at school.\n\nBernard T.

Neary\n\nI have received your letter of Feb 26/47 file 123-6-5(W.T.1) re building of schools and teacherages in this agency, with particular reference to para 4.\n\nThe conditions which apply at Oxford House apply also at Island Lake, but not at Cross Lake. If building material is available it will be possible to have it shipped in from Winnipeg to both Norway House and Cross Lake.\n\nIt is physically impossible to build a school and teacherage at Island Lake within the 1947-8 fiscal year owing to the transportation difficulties. I would therefore like to suggest that the $8,000.00 allotted for the R.C. school and teachers residence be spent this summer in acquiring material for Oxford House and Island Lake. This material could be collected and stored at Ilford and sent in by tractor next winter and a similar appropriation next year could be used for the building of the schools and residences.\n\nThere are considerable storage facilities at Ilford. The warehouses belong to the God's Lake Gold Mines and I believe are rented by Mr Johnson of Johnson Transportation Co. I will wire him to ascertain if he will warehouse the material we send in during the summer.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: School Building Program\n\nOn March 18th I wrote Mr. Goodman and attached is a copy of my letter together with his reply.\n\nI have made extensive inquiries regarding experienced working foremen but to date without success. There is plenty of work in Winnipeg for experienced carpenters and, generally speaking, they do not wish to leave the city. I found no one sufficiently interested to even ask the probable wage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nMr. E. B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nThe Department in the 1947-48 estimates have requested funds for the erection of the following:\n\n1.

One room school and residence - $8,000.00\n\nThe Department would like to know how best this building programme can be carried out. Is there anyone in that country who would take this work on a contract. If not, is there a capable builder who could be hired by the day to supervise? If this is possible is there enough local labor to work under proper supervision?\n\nOttawa is anxious to obtain the information as to how best these buildings can be erected and your early reply, in duplicate, will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Indian Day Schools\n\nReference your 123-6-5 (W.T.)\nApril 3rd 1947.\n\nI wish to recommend the building of 2 schools and 2 teacherages on this reservation as the settlement is strung out for miles along the shore of Oxford Lake and the placing of a 2 room school in the centre would impose a considerable hardship on the children living at either end. Two schools could be placed so that no child in this community would have too far to walk. I also recommend that a teachers residence be built for each school.\n\nI would appreciate having the plans of a 2 room school and a 1 room school. The plan I submitted to you for the proposed U.C.

It will be necessary, therefore, to include in your estimates for next year the construction of two standard combined one room schools and teachers' residences at this reservation. It is suggested that you either call them Oxford House No. 1 and Oxford House No. 2 or apply some local name to the second school so that they can be readily differentiated.\n\nAs it will be almost impossible to have a Surveys and Engineering Official go into Norway House to actually locate these schools, it will be necessary for you to carefully investigate the sites on which they can be situated. In this regard may I say that we hope to have Major Clark, our Educational Survey Officer visit your Agency in late August or early September.\n\nWould you please advise a date which would be most suitable for you to visit with him the schools in your Agency and to formulate together a plan for a future building programme required by your Indians.\n\nWe have forwarded to you a plan of the combined one room school and residence. It is hoped to have the two room school plan completed by the end of this month when one will be sent to you.\n\nBernard F.

Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n18th ultimo, the Department approves you chartering\nan aircraft in order to fly Mr. Clark around the\nNorway House Agency. He will arrive at Norway\nHouse on September 6th.\n\nAnother copy of the plans and specifications\nof the one room day school and teacher's residence\nwent forward to you on July 31st.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, 6 Augst, 1947.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Goodman:\n\nNow that I have orders to be at Norway House on September 6th, I am considering how to get from Winnipeg to Norway House. The question may be answered more easily if you can tell me now the place from which the plane which you have been authorized to charter will start. If the plane is to come from The Pas, I could get there before it starts for Norway House, provided you can tell me well in advance whose plane it is and when it will start; similarly I could join the plane leaving from Winnipeg. If neither of these courses is possible, I shall have to take the extra time to come north on the S.S. Kenora.\n\nAlthough the tourist season will be practically over by that time, the last wave of prospectors and trappers may use up all the hotel accommodations and so I am requesting you to ensure that in advance. To cover all eventualities, I shall bring along a sleeping bag.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nOxford House Indian Day School\n\nPurchase Order 19944 -\n\nIn attempting to speed up delivery of supplies for the above school, we wrote directly to the Dominion Lumber and Fuel Company in Winnipeg. We have now received an answer from them reading as follows:\n\n\"Replying to yours of the 5th, re the above, this order was all shipped in June with the exception of the doors, door frames and combination doors and the hinges. We have been tied up on the supply of these items but we propose to ship them early next week, thus completing the order. We propose shipping the outside doors, door frames and combination doors, 2/8 x 6/8 instead of 2/10 x 6/10. We think that this will be satisfactory in a building of this kind and feel that we should complete the order instead of waiting for the 2/10 which may hold the order up further. If this is not satisfactory, kindly let us know by return airmail.\"\n\nWould you please advise, by telegram, if the above arrangement is satisfactory, so that we can advise the fuel company.\n\nBernard Z. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\n#2 Indian Day School - Council House Oxford House\n\nAs you may recall we acquired the loan of this Council House for a period of 1 year provided we did some repairs and improvements on it. These improvements were carried out. At a meeting of the band held 5 Jul 1947 I requested the band to loan us the Council House for another year as there was no immediate prospect of building a new school. This they were willing to do provided the Department shingled the roof of the building, the roof leaks badly and this repair is urgently needed. I told them that this would be done.\n\nIt will require 50 bundles of shingles @ $2.50, 22 lbs shingle nails, and $50.00 for labor. May I have authority to go ahead with this project - I can supply all the material locally. An Accountable Advance of $175.00 is requested.\n\nE.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6242, file 530-5, part 2)\nOctober 27, 1948.\n\nMr. F. M. Hughes,\nIn charge, Indian Agency,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nOxford House Indian Day School.\n\nYou will recall our recent conversation in Winnipeg with regard to the day school construction program in your agency for the 1949-50 fiscal year. The program falls into three main phases:\n\n(a) The construction of a day school or day schools at Oxford House.\n\n(b) The construction of a teacherage at the Island Lake R.C. School.\n\n(c) The moving of a building from the God's Lake Mine to God's Lake Narrows to replace the old school at present in use there.\n\nYou will receive separate letters concerning projects (b) and (c). I am anxious to settle in the near future as to whether we will build the usual type of day school at Oxford House or whether we will erect prefabricated buildings.\n\nI understand the following situation exists at Oxford House:\n\nThere are two schools in operation at present:\n\n(1) Oxford House No. 1. This is in the old building situated near the nursing station. I am informed that the nursing station has been built with extra accommodation for the teacher of this school. This would\n\n(copy sent to Mr. Davis)\nmean that a school without a teacherage would be required to replace the old building presently used. Unfortunately, we have no bill of materials prepared for a standard one-room school without a teacherage. Because of other more urgent work being done by our Architects and Engineers, it is most unlikely that we will be able to prepare such a bill of materials see some months to come. It may therefore be necessary to consider the purchase of a prefabricated building (without a teacherage) at this point.\n\n(2) Oxford House No. 2 Indian Day School. This school is being conducted in the renovated council house. My information is that it is some distance from the first school but I have no details. Unfortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds have never completed the annual day school teacher's report as required (see March 1948 issue of the Indian School Bulletin). As a result, our information on the situation at Oxford House is very poor.\n\nIt would seem that a standard one-room school with attached teacher's quarters would be required at this point. This school would be identical to that being constructed now at Island Lake, for the United Church Mission area. We do have a bill of materials for such a building and we could arrange to ship in these materials during the coming winter. However, in view of the fact that we may have to order a prefabricated building for Oxford House No. 1, you may want to consider the provision of a prefabricated building also at Oxford House No. 2. These buildings would differ in that Oxford House No. 1 would have no attached teacher's residence.\n\nFinally, there is the possibility that a two-room school would serve this area better than two 1-room schools. Unfortunately, we have no exact details as to the distances involved and therefore it will be necessary for you to make a recommendation concerning this.\n\nWe will anticipate a reply from you covering the points raised above.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSUPT. OF INDIAN EDUCATION.\nNorway House, Dec 14/48.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter 123-6-1 (E) of Oct 27/48 with reference to building program for new schools this coming year.\n\nOxford House I.R. as you know is being taken, or is already taken out of this Agency but I will give any information I can that might be of help to the Department and the new Supt at Ilford.\n\nIn my opinion two separate schools should be built at Oxford otherwise many of the pupils would have too far to walk. Your information re No. 1 school is correct excepting that I doubt very much if we can depend on getting accommodation for the Teacher at the Nursing Station. If Mr & Mrs Reynolds intend staying at Oxford for another year or two then no residence need be built at No.1 school as Mr Reynolds teaches there and his wife teaches No.2 and they both live in the United Church residence. During Mr Neary's visit to Winnipeg the question of material being manufactured at Island Lake sawmill for these schools was mentioned. This cannot be done for a 1949 building program as the lumber would have to be made during 1949 and freighted to Oxford & Island during the winter of 1949-50. If, as stated, these buildings are to be provided in 1949 then possibly prefabricated building would be better.\n\nWith reference to a building to be moved from God's Lake mine to God's Narrows, I reported nothing suitable but Mr Davis states that there is one near the lake which I possibly missed or thought was Occupied. It might be well to have the Supt from Ilford look over these buildings and make his recommendations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. M. Hughes,\nActing Supt.\nDecember 21, 1948.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nGod's Lake Narrows Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 207-4B of November 15\n\nImmediately your letter was received here, we began to prepare an outline design for a one-room Indian Day School with attached teacher's residence which could be erected at a lower cost than the present building.\n\nThis building will not have a full basement and will be heated by stoves and not by a furnace. It should, therefore, be much easier to erect and will serve our needs in the more northerly areas, where it is often difficult to put in a full foundation.\n\nI have been advised by our Chief Architect that he expects the first set of these plans to be ready about the middle of January. I hope that I will have a chance to show them to you during your visit here. A bill of materials is also being prepared so that we can order the necessary building supplies for both God's Lake Narrows and for Oxford House. In the meantime, we would appreciate full shipping instructions for the supplies to be forwarded to Mr. Bennett at God's Lake.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Hughes\nColonel Neary:\n\nOxford House Schools:\n\nPhoto No. 1, looking west (9 A.M.) shows the east side of the original (No.1) school, and the front door of the recently built nursing station. The lake is just to the right, down a high bank.\n\nPhoto #2 shows interior of school. A ventilator which should be properly covered is marked \"*\". The former agent, Mr. E.B. Goodman, began some repairs which as of Dec. 10, 1949 were incomplete. Note the new heater not installed. This school is usable.\n\nA more urgent replacement is indicated in Photo #3 (of the Council House) which we borrow for school purposes. My previous report is on the closed file of 530-5 (123-6-5).\n\nWhen travelling conditions overland are at their best, there is about 1\u00bd to 2 miles to walk from one school to the other. At certain seasons a marsh causes one to take a roundabout route said to require almost an hour's walk. No.2 school is West of No.1.\n\nA two-room central school is not the present answer. School accommodation is requested in the No.2 area and should be built in the area (or not far therupon) indicated in red in photo #3.\n\nOne teacher could board at the nursing station and one at the mission (U.C.) house\u2014the photographer is standing about fifty yards west of the mission house for photo #3\u2014if non-teaching missionaries should occupy the mission.\n\nC.J.

I have spoken to\nDr. Best, our Superintendent of Home Missions\nconcerning this and he was in favor of the\nuse of this ground for this purpose.\n\nMr. Goodman may not at the time of\nchoosing the site have thought of using this\npiece of property. The playground is ready and the\ngardens can be easily expanded.\n\nI am very much in favor of getting the school\nand playground away from the homes of the Indians\nas much as possible.\n\nThe present mission house and old warehouses\nbehind are being torn down and taken away this\nyear, so that the buildings are well separated but\nnot too far apart. Hoping that this will meet\nwith your approval; 2 remants -\n\nP.S. Cheque arriving fairly soon, thanks.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nH.M. Reynolds.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Materials have been ordered and we hope to have them sent to Oxford House by winter freight.\n\nRecently we received a letter from Rev. H.M. Reynolds, suggesting that instead of erecting the building on a site previously proposed, it be built on a section of the United Church property. Attached is a rough sketch of your property at Oxford House, and in his letter, Mr. Reynolds suggests the school be built on the present site of the building marked \"Teacherage\".\n\nWe have no objection to this but we would like to be able to obtain title to the piece of land on which the school is erected. Colonel Neary is absent from the office this week, but will be back on Monday and if it is possible to have your reply by that time, we would appreciate it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nOxford House No. 2 Indian Day School, Manitoba.\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 13-491 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Mr. J.

We are anxious to secure part of the said \"Methodist Mission\" for Indian school purposes and assumed that the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada were the owners, but they have advised that in so far as they are aware they were never given title, their occupation being at pleasure only.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I would be pleased to have you advise whether your records show title to the Methodist Mission land as being in the Crown Dominion and if so, whether part thereof could be made available to this Branch for school purposes with the consent of the aforementioned Board of Home Missions.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nLB/MC\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: North American Lumber & Supply Co., Ltd.\nAddress: 120 Royal Bank Building\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\n\nDATE: March 16, 1949\nSERVICE: To building material for Oxford House Indian Day School\nAMOUNT: $6852.5h.\n\nPurchase Order No.: 36731\n(Allot.516-13-991)\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Indian Day School\nOxford House No. Indian Day School\nRef. your 200-4A of April 2\n\nWe have checked our files to ascertain the number of days for which we paid Mr. McRee in constructing the Little Grand Rapids School. In erecting a prefabricated building there, it took him 106 days. It will presumably take him just as long, if not longer, to erect these two schools, and he will probably need a larger working force. Therefore, there is every possibility that with a large daily labour bill, board bills and transportation expenses, his tender will exceed the $6,000.00 figure quoted by Mr. Sabiston.\n\nWill Mr. McRee submit a firm tender for the erection of this building? If not, then we feel that a time limit of 100 days should be placed on each of these projects, otherwise the Department will be paying a daily board and labour bill of about $50.00 a day while these carpenters take their time over completing the school.\n\nWould you please discuss both the firm tender figure and the time limit with Mr. McCrae and advise us as soon as possible concerning the decision reached.\n\nBernard F.

The Indians were getting plenty of fish and meat, and were on the traplines. We have two schools at this point, which are situated three miles apart. One is taught by Mrs. Reynolds and the other by Mr. Reynolds, the Missionary, who are both permit teachers. Mrs. Reynolds had 50 pupils on the roll and 28 in the class at the time of my visit to the school.\n\nWhen I visited the school taught by Mr. Reynolds it was early in the morning and the children were just starting to arrive. These are fairly old buildings, but in fair condition, as they have recently been whitewashed and cleaned up.\n\nLighting in both schools was very poor.

In order to eliminate the necessity of having two contracts, you will note that I have consolidated both projects into the one form. Please have Mr. Sabiston sign the three copies and return them here for signature by the Deputy Minister. Two copies will then be returned to you, one for Mr. Staunton's files and one for the contractor.\n\nProgress Payments:\nPlease note particularly article 3 (b) detailing the payment of progress claims. A separate claim will have to be made on each project even though the contract covers both schools. If you wish me to send two $5,000.00 accountable advances to Mr.\nStaunton I will so arrange. You will recall the delays at Peguis No. 1 last year with the payment of these progress claims. It would be even more difficult at Nelson River to arrange the sending of the money to Mr. Sabiston and I think it could best be handled by our local Superintendent.\n\nI am attaching a number of these progress payment forms and an extra copy of my letter so that both can be sent to Mr. Staunton with your additional instructions. The authority to be quoted on the form is P.O. 3392 of July 6, 1949, and separate claims must be submitted for each project.\n\nYou can notify the non-successful tenderers of the acceptance of Mr. Sabiston's bid, which was the lowest submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Attendance Indian Children York Factory School.\n\nTen children are attending at the present time. This attendance will probably rise to Twenty in the near future, as families are expected to move in from Port Nelson.\n\nNo. 2. Progress Construction New Schools in Agency.\n\nOxford House School, No. 1 has been completed, with the exception of installation of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nGod's Lake United Church School is also completed, with exception of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nWhen these chimneys arrive it will be only a matter of hours to install each one.\n\nI made a final check on God's Lake United Church School on Oct. 17th.\n\nThis building has been completed sufficiently to legalize payment to the Contractor.\n\nHowever the finishing was an extremely hurried job and reflects no credit to the man concerned.\n\nThe living quarters especially are very poorly painted and finished, the cupboard doors do not fit and the paint has just been slapped on.\n\nIn the Main Class Room, the small windows on the North side are fitted with butt hinges, these hinges were not countersunk; when the windows are closed it leaves an eighth of an inch gap.\n\nThe Contractor was told about all this by the Assistant Agent at God's Lake and agreed to rectify it, however it was not done as apparently the main idea was to get finished and get back to town.\n\nUnfortunately, the Contractor had left when I made my final inspection. The whole finish shows a definite lack of interest. In my opinion this man should not be given any further Contracts with the Indian Department.\n\nAttached please find Final Progress Report.\nNo. 3 Joint Recommendation by Mr. Grafton and myself on New Schools Next Year.\n\nThere are no further Reserves in this Agency that would warrant a joint School, due to the lack of Non-Treaty Children.\n\nNo. 4 Report on New Teachers.\n\nTo date I have only met Miss M. Rain of God's Lake United Church School, she appears to be doing well and seems to be quite efficient.\n\nI see no signs of Teachers for Oxford House Schools, No. 1 & 2, nor for Split Lake.\n\nCould I be advised as to when these Teachers may arrive?\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the quarterly Return ending Sept. 30th, 1949, submitted by this Agency. Under the heading \"Schools & Education\", reference is made to a Permanent School at Shantown.\n\nI would appreciate your comment on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H.

Day School.\n\nWe will be able to supply all the dimensioned lumber, including plain lumber sheeting, which includes two by four's; two by six's; two by eight's, etc., for the above mentioned school.\n\nWill you please advise me of the amounts that are required for the school, which I presume is under plan 888A, and I will make arrangements to have the lumber shipped by Johnson Transportation Company when they are hauling in freight. We will get a reduction on this hauling as it would be a back-haul on their return trip.\n\nI am making arrangements to have the cement mixer, which is now at Island Lake, shipped to Oxford House for use in the Spring.\n\nThe cost of this lumber will be approximately $35.00 a thousand, f.o.b. Island Lake.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n19 December, 1949.\n\nMr. R. S.

As requested in your letter, I am sending herewith three copies of the standard bill of materials for plan 288. This will provide an identical school to Oxford House No. 1, erected this summer.\n\nIf you would have the items which can be provided by your sawmill removed from this bill of materials, we will take immediate steps to have the Departmental Purchasing Agent order the other materials. In your letter you should also give complete shipping instructions via Johnson Transportation Company or other firm.\n\nI presume that the deletion of the lumber will take only a short while and would like to place the requisition in the hands of the Purchasing Agent before the first of January.\n\nBernard F.

This is due to the fact that these items can be secured next summer from the government sawmill at Island Lake.\n\nWe are requesting 270 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10.

The second is from Vulcan Iron works and is for three tubes for the large boilers. One tube sprang a leak cutting off that boiler but with the help of the local blacksmith and tinsmith, the engineer was able to install the new tube and keep the boiler in working order. We thought it advisable to have a couple of new tubes on hand in case more tubes should give out and we would have the material to go ahead at once and make the boiler serviceable. This latter expenditure was unauthorized but an emergency.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Viz:\n\nGeorge Crane, Red Earth Reserve; an Indian of John Smith's Reserve. Age 27. Married. Trained in an Indian Day School. Very imperfect in English. Never taught before. A very crude specimen. Mr Hines should be censured for sending out a man like this. Would recommend that he be retained until the thirty of June next as he cannot very well get out before that time on account of family. Travelling, from the first of November till the Middle of May is a great hardship in the Pas Agency.\n\nAlbert Smith, Big Eddy School. Treaty Indian of John Smith's reserve. Age 27, married, trained at Emmanuel College. Very uncouth. A slightly better specimen than Geo. Crane. I make the same recommendation as in the former case.\n\nIsaiah Badger, Moose Lake reserve. Treaty Indian of John Smith's Reserve. Single. Educated at Battleford Industrial School. This is a much better than the other two, and may do fairly well. He had only been teaching a few days so I could not judge much of his work. Would recommend that he be retained for the present.\n\nFrank Baker, Chemawawin Reserve. An Englishman single, age 31 years. Promises well: think he will soon tire of his job. Very enthusiastic at present. Would recommend that his services be retained for the\nthe present.\n\nI hope shortly to make a general report on school matters in this Agency.\n\nI have the Honor to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sdg) S. R. Marlatt.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ. A. J. McKenna,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nSir,\n\nThe practice has been followed of appointing teachers for Day Schools in the Pas Agency on the recommendation of the Anglican Church authorities. Archdeacon MacKay usually made the nominations; but during his absence they were made by Rev. Mr. Hines. It occurred to me that persons were put in charge of Day Schools who were really not competent, and on certain nominations being made by Rev. Mr. Hines in June I advised him that temporary appointment of his nominees would be made, but retention of their services would be subject to action upon the report which I asked the Inspector to make. I now send for your information copy of the report of the 28th instant from Mr. Inspector Marlatt. You will observe that he considers Geo. Crane and Albert Smith, two Indians engaged as teachers, incompetent, and recommends that their services be dispensed with on the 30th June next. I think the facts produced by the Inspector justify his recommendation and I concur in same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Sup't. General.\n\nThe Assistant Commissioner forwards a report from Inspector Mariatt who states that two of the teachers employed by the Anglican Church authorities in the Pas Agency are incompetent and he recommends that their services be dispensed with on the 30th June next.\n\nI think the Department would be quite justified in acting on Mr. Mariatt's report and I would suggest that the Commissioner be authorized to advise Archdeacon MacKay accordingly, and at the same time inform him that it expects that the qualifications of the teachers they employ should be sufficient for the requirements of the schools; and if they cannot secure a better class of teachers the Department will have to consider the advisability of taking over these schools under its own control.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nAt the band meeting held last summer on the Pas Reserve, and on various occasions since, the Indians have brought up the question of a Day School on the reserve just across from the Town. I mentioned the matter to the resident Anglican Clergyman Mr. Fraser, and he agreed to try and find a house which could be rented for the purposes of a school, but no suitable building could be found, and there the matter rests. The school Trustees of this Town are now completing a new school for the junior classes, on the English Church Mission property, close to the river and just across from the reserve. I have made an arrangement with them to take into this school, say 16 of our Indian children at a charge of $2.00 a month for each child, and subject to the endorsement of the Dept. of Indian Affairs. I have not mentioned this as yet to the band, and will not do so till I receive a reply to this communication.\n\nThere is a halfbreed settlement here and there will be quite a number of Non Treaty Indian children going to this school, that belong to these people. It may be necessary to help a few of our Indian children in the way of stockings and mitts, and perhaps caps, and I would recommend that a sum of say $50.00 be placed at the disposal of the Agent here for that purpose if required.\n\nThere are about 70 children on this reserve of school age and no school in operation, and the prospects of getting a teacher for the Big Eddy school for the winter are not bright, as there is no place there where a white teacher can get board.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 12, 1912.\n\nE.D.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in reference to the admission of the Indian children on the Pas Reserve to the white school in the town of The Pas.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay for the tuition of these children at the rate of $2.00 per month for each of the school months based upon the average attendance. If these terms are satisfactory to the school you may make arrangements for the admission of the children at once.\n\nIf there are any of these children whose parents are destitute and cannot reasonably be expected to buy clothing for them, the agent may purchase a very limited quantity and forward the accounts to the Department for payment. I may state, however, that it is not the policy of the Department to supply articles of clothing of this kind, unless in such cases where parents cannot be reasonably expected to do so themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

This is not mentioned in the Acting Secretary's communication, but you will be good enough to make it clear that this is one of the conditions of the payment of this grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. J. Jackson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, Ontario, March 17, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nOn December 4th last the Department concluded an arrangement whereby the children on The Pas reserve were to attend the school in district No. 1635 Saskatchewan, payment for their tuition to be made at the rate of $2.00 per month, based on the average attendance. The Department would be pleased to know whether the children are taking advantage of this arrangement at the present time, and if so, to what extent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nM.R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of 17th inst. No. 117558-1 regarding the children on the Pas reserve attending the Public school in the Pas town: I beg to say this attendance is far from satisfactory. So far only eight have attended and their attendance has been very irregular. They began attending school after the Christmas holidays, and are still attending as above stated.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nOttawa, April 8, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in reference to the attendance of Indian children at the public school in The Pas.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets to learn that conditions are not satisfactory and will be pleased if you would use your endeavours to have a better attendance of these children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to Dept. letter No. 117558/1 dated 8th inst. I beg to say that I will endeavor to get a better attendance at the Pas Public School, of the Indian children of the Pas Band.\n\nAt present, many of them are away with their parents on the spring hunt. They will be back soon after rat season closes, which is on 15th May, when a better attendance will be obtained. At present the breaking of spring has suspended attendance altogether, the bridge not being finished for traffic purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa. Can.\nSir,\n\nAt the same meeting mentioned in my letter No. 362/113 it was resolved by Chief Constant, seconded by Norman Lathlin, Councillor, and carried by all the male members of the band, a large majority of whom were present, to petition the Department to build a day school on the reserve, immediately opposite the town of The Pas.\n\nDiscussing the matter among themselves at their meeting, the various speakers pointed out that the Department had promised to build a day school for the education of their children, when they moved from the south side of the river. Further notwithstanding a Boarding School is to be built at the Eddy, a day school will be needed, as all their children cannot be admitted, as other reserves will also send children to this Boarding School. Their younger children will need to be taught at a day school near home, while the elder ones will be admitted into the Boarding School. They further protested against permitting their children to attend the white school at The Pas. They were not approached in the matter when the arrangement was made, and it is strongly against their wishes.\n\nIn this respect I would strongly recommend that a day school be built for these people. The present arrangements of the Indian children attending the Pas Public School is looked upon with disfavor by the Indians. Personally I am not in favor of the arrangement.\nThere is always a certain clash among the two classes. The white children look down upon the Indian children, and being very sensitive by nature the Indian children do not like to attend the white school. It would therefore be to the interest of the Indians to have a day school on their reserve. The missionary in charge of the Protestant mission here says they stand ready to supply a teacher for the school. In the meantime I think a building could be rented for the purpose of holding day school, until a school house could be built.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa. Can.\nOttawa, July 16, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo in reference to the establishment of a day school on The Pas Reserve opposite the town of The Pas.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted you state that a building can be rented for school purposes. I have to ask you to be good enough to report, giving information as to the kind of building, size, also whether the furnishings of the old school are available and the amount of rent that would have to be paid. The Department also wishes to have some information as to the qualifications of the teacher whose services the Missionary states are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLe Pas, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-1, part 1)\nReferring to Department letter No. 117558/1 dated July 16th in connection with a school for the Pas Band opposite the Pas town, I would say that I have obtained a house which will be suitable for temporary quarters. The house is now in process of repairs, and by the time I get authority from Ottawa, it will be ready for school purposes. The rent will be $60.00. The building is built of logs. 16 x 16, with a ceiling 8 ft. high. The building will be well fixed, for winter, so that it will be warm and comfortable. The material and furnishings of the old school are all available.\n\nThe teacher had in view by the Church of England is an elderly English lady, and although not holding a certificate, has a good general education, and is qualified to teach an Indian School. I am personally acquainted with the lady, and I am sure she would make good.\n\nI would further urge the Department to erect a building on this reserve for school purposes. It is absolutely necessary. The boarding school now building will not house all the children of school age here, as many others will be admitted from other reserves. It is therefore essential that a day school be built on the Pas reserve, at the point opposite the town of The Pas, as this point would be central; and children from Carrot River settlement could also attend.\n\nI hope therefore that the Department will take immediate steps to build a Day School as the build-\ning temporarily used will not be suitable for any length of time. Regarding the school, I am expressing the desires of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa. Can.\nOttawa, August 25, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in further reference to the re-opening of the day school on The Pas Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to give this school a trial in the building that you have made arrangements for and will pay the rental asked, viz.- $60.00 per annum. You may have the material and furnishings of the old school removed to this building as soon as possible.\n\nWith regard to the teacher you should have given the Department her name and some more definite information respecting her qualifications. However, she may take up her duties immediately upon receipt of this communication, if the building is ready, and a salary of $400.00 will be allowed. You will be good enough to give her the necessary instructions.\n\nIn regard to the new building the Department is not prepared to undertake its erection at once, as it will be dependent upon the attitude of the Indians towards this school. There will be sufficient accommodation in this building for a time at least, unless there is a much better attendance than when the school was in operation before. The matter of erecting a new school will, however, be kept in mind for next year's estimates.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to Department letter No. 117558/1 dated 25th ultimo, I beg to say that the Indians of this Band are very much pleased at the Department granting them a school on their reserve. The house is now nearly completed and the school furniture will be moved over immediately. Mrs Nicholls' instructions have been given, and the school will be started at an early date.\n\nMrs. Nicholls is an elderly widow, of very staunch character. Being personally acquainted with her, I feel sure she will make good. While not possessing any written certificate, she is, judging from other teachers in this agency, above the average, and on a par with the best of them educationally. The missionary in charge here, Rev. Fraser, also strongly recommends her, so that I felt no hesitancy in recommending her to the Department when I did.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nWill you kindly advise me if it is customary to distribute biscuits to non-treaty children, attending day schools on Indian reserves in this Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Can.\nOttawa, October 28, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st instant I beg to say that all children attending the day schools in your agency should share in the distribution of biscuits.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nI beg to enclose herewith Mrs Nichol's resignation as teacher of the Pas Day school. I would recommend that the Department accept this resignation, as Mrs Nichols will not make a success of teaching.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. R. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nReferring to the latter part of Department letter No. 117558/1 dated August 25th, 1913, regarding the Pas School, in which it was intimated that \"the matter of erecting a new school will, however, be kept in mind for next year's estimates.\"\n\nIn estimates for 1914-1915 I estimated for $1600.00 for a new school building. This was the estimate which was \"kept in mind.\"\n\nThe town of The Pas has three school buildings which they are selling, as they are erecting a large brick school. These smaller buildings are available for purchase now, and will be vacated in February. I have made enquiries, and the secretary was authorized by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees to offer me one building for $800.00. I may say two of them are sold. The one remaining is a new building used about a year, and built of fir. It is a bargain at $800.00 and should be bought for the Pas Reserve. We could not erect a building for $800.00. I would strongly advise the purchase of this building. I think the daily attendance of this reserve would justify the purchase, as the building used is wholly inadequate for school purposes.\n\nThis building is 36x24 ft. Mr. Wm. Armstrong will move it across the river for $150.00. This is an approximate figure. He says it may not cost so much.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Bird, at present assisting at the Mackay School, has been recommended for the position by the church authorities.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the temporary appointment of Mr. Bird as teacher of this school and he will be paid a salary at the same rate as the former teacher received, viz.\u2014$400.00 per annum. You will be good enough to furnish the Department with full information as to Mr. Bird's age, qualifications, experience, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. W. Macdonald, Esq.,\nActing Indian Superintendent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Department letter No. 117558/1 April 19th. I beg to state that Mr. Bird is 30 years of age. He has been teaching at the MacKay Boarding School, has no teacher's certificate but is well educated and studying for the Ministry. After school hours he is to act as Rev. Mr. Frazer's assistant. He tried to enlist but was rejected on account of poor eyesight.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst.

D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. L. Macdonald, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nWith regard to The Pas Day School I beg to report that this School has been closed since Miss Chambers left. Mr. Bird was appointed by the Department for this School but owing to the shortage of help at the McKay School they have been unable to release him from there, so it will be necessary to have another teacher appointed.\n\nMiss Grace Bagshaw has been recommended by the Church Authorities but I have been unable to get in touch with her so far but would like authority from the Department to instal her as teacher on her return if she will accept the position.\n\nIt is pretty hard to get Teachers for The Pas Reserve Day Schools at the present salaries, as unless you get a girl living at home such as the above it is impossible to live on the salary, as they get no dispensing allowances on these reserves and both the day schools have a fair attendance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 15, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant stating that the Pas Day school has been closed since Miss Chambers left, as Mr. Bird, who was appointed by the Department, was unable to leave the Mackay School, owing to the shortage of help there, and that Miss Grace Bagshaw has been recommended by the church authorities for the position.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if Miss Bagshaw will accept this position, you may place her in charge of the school and she will be allowed a salary at the rate of $400.00 per annum. Kindly advise the Department whether Miss Bagshaw accepts the position or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. L.

The attendance has dropped away, and it has been simply impossible ever since I have been in the Agency, for them to keep wood supplied for the School, and during the last quarter, the School has been closed approximately two weeks for want of wood, and about the only way that it could be done would be to buy wood for the School, and deduct it from the Annuity Money, of the Indians interest.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir.\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 28, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the resignation of Miss Grace Bagshaw as teacher of the Pas Day School is accepted.\n\nThe Department approves of your recommendation that this school remain closed for the present.

I informed him at the time as you quote in above letter that the previous salary for same position was $400.00 per year and he said he would start the school and let the Department name the salary. Mr. Thomas is in receipt of gratuity from army at present, but when this stops he will have a hard time to live on a $400.00 salary as he has a large family. The position is worth much more than was formerly paid, but I do not wish to remark on this as it would criticize policy of the Department and I do not wish to do this in any way. However, if the Dept. could see fit to offer about $45.00 per month to Mr. Thomas, I do not think it would be paying too much, and it would satisfy him.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Kindly inform him accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith report of teacher of Day School of The Pas, on The Pas Reserve.\n\nThe teacher is a returned soldier Robert Thomas and he has had his hands full since he started the school as the children had been free from school for a long time. I get more chance to visit this school than some of the others and I can report a good improvement in the children already.\n\nThe teacher was reported to me some time since for using liquor, and I have an idea the report was correct. I had him called into the office and gave him a pretty straight talk, and he has promised to keep sober.\n\nThe school has only been open since Easter holidays, but I hope the Department can see fit to pay the teacher for the whole quarter. He has done his school work honestly.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst Deputy & Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 8, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing the June quarter return of The Pas Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for $106.50, being the salary of Robert Thomas, the teacher, for forty-three days, is being sent him. Mr. Thomas only began duties on the first of May and, therefore, the Department cannot pay him a full quarter's salary.\n\nIt is hoped that the teacher's conduct in the future will not give any cause for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that the Pas Band have asked me to request the Department to purchase a building opposite the town here for purpose of using it as a day school in place of the building at present being rented from Mr. McGillivary. The people state that the present school is too small for the number of pupils that are attending it.\n\nI am only advising the Department of what is asked, but do not wish at this time to recommend that purchase be completed, as if the present teacher does not hold his position the attendance will soon slacken off again and the present arrangements would then be ample. The teacher is a good one but I am afraid he will not last long on account of his liking for liquor; I have him at hand just now but think it only the calm before the storm.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 26, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, in which you state that the Indians of The Pas Band request the Department to purchase a building opposite the town for the purpose of using it as a day school, in place of the building at present being rented for that purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot comply with this request at the present time, as it considers that the present arrangement should be satisfactory to meet the educational requirements of this band.\n\nYour remarks regarding the teacher are noted, and it is hoped that his conduct will give no cause for complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst.

I have reported him several times for drinking but this time have suspended him pending orders from the Department. I would recommend that he be let out of the service as it is impossible to keep him sober.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

This man's services were discontinued last summer on account of his behaviour. Since that time Thomas has kept sober and he has given his promise to the Indians and to myself that if he receives the appointment he will act decently in the future. Under the circumstances, I will be obliged if the Department will see fit to re-appoint him as School Teacher at this place, as he is a first class school teacher.\n\nIf this is allowed, I would be obliged if the Department will wire me their answer and what salary to offer Thomas.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Salary five hundred dollars and bonus if continued\".\n\nThe Department has, upon your report that this man has given his promise to the Indians and yourself that his conduct in future will be satisfactory, decided to re-appoint him. His retention in the position will, however, depend entirely upon the success with which he meets in his work and the way in which he conducts himself upon the reserve. Any further breach of sobriety will lead to his dismissal, and you will be good enough to inform him accordingly.\n\nHis salary will be at the rate of $500.00 per annum and the bonus, if it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools during the present fiscal year. The continuance of the bonus will depend upon the action taken by the present session of Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nJ. W.

I am not sure whether it's 2 returns or 3 that have to be made out, but should it be 3 kindly send one back for copy and blank return. The reason why school was open for 51 days was I did not get appointment before the 13th April.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMemo for Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith report of school teacher for The Pas Day School for quarter ending June 30th, 1920.\n\nThis man started work on the 13th April last, and has taught 51 days during the quarter. As he did not begin at the exact time to draw a quarters salary he will probably have a deduction from full rate, but if the Department allows full time he has promised to open the school in summer holidays to make up the difference. This man has his pay assigned to Burton & Salter, The Pas, as I have already notified the Department.\n\nThe school is in very backward condition due to the absence of teachers over long periods.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that during my absence paying Treaty, that Robert Thomas, School Teacher of The Pas Indian Day School was convicted of being drunk in the Town of The Pas.\n\nReferring back to former correspondence regarding this man, it will be seen that he was given a chance to go straight, however as he cannot keep his word, I recommend that he be discharged.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 28, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, in which you inform the Department that Robert Thomas, teacher of The Pas Indian Day School, was convicted of being drunk in the town of The Pas.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to the conduct of this man, the Department cannot consent to his remaining as teacher, and you will be good enough to inform him that his services are no longer required.\n\nYou should endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to succeed him, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the holidays, on or about the first of September, next. The name, age, qualifications and experience of any applicant for the position should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department. Kindly give this matter your prompt attention and endeavour to secure the services of a suitable teacher in time to re-open the school.\n\nThe salary of Mr. Thomas was paid in full for the June quarter, last, and he also received the amount of the bonus due for the same quarter; cheques for which were sent, under Power of Attorney, to Burton & Salter, The Pas.\n\nIf he has been teaching any period during the month of July a return should be forwarded showing the attendance, days taught, etc., in order that any balance of salary due him can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Scott Esq.,\nSuperintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir:\n\nAt our annual midsummer meeting held on the above Reserve it was decided that a school (day) was very badly needed. It is a great pity to see so many children of school age playing around on the Reserve and not being able to go to a school as the McKay Boarding School is always full. It cannot take half of the children who would like to go to School. It was therefore urgently placed before the Chief and Council to do their utmost and write to you for the school required. There are over fifty children of school age on this Reserve who are not able to attend school. We trust that you will give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nWe have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nChief: Antoine & Constant\nCouncilor: Patrick & Constant\nPeter Bignell\n\nR.

These people are very anxious to have a School constructed and operated on the Reserve close to the Town of The Pas. This matter has already been taken up with the Department by myself, but is held up on account of a report which the Department is awaiting from Commissioner Graham.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt., General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nEnclosure (1)\nOttawa, August 8, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a petition signed by the Chief, two of the councillors and a number of the Indians of The Pas Band, in which they request that a day school building be erected on the reserve, for the benefit of the Indian children for whom accommodation cannot be provided at the McKay Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter was previously brought to the attention of the Department in the fall of 1920. We requested Mr. Commissioner Graham to furnish a report regarding this matter, but no reply was received from him. I may say that we have no funds available from this year's appropriation for the purpose of erecting a school building on The Pas Reserve. This matter will be noted for our next year's Estimates, and will receive due consideration when they are being prepared.\n\nWe are again requesting Mr. Commissioner Graham to forward a report containing his views regarding the request now made by the members of the band to have school facilities provided for their children. You may inform the Indians that this matter is receiving the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, August 8, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of November 17, 1920 No. 205-14A, in regard to Mr. Inspector Jackson's recommendation to build a new day school at The Pas, on a site opposite the town.\n\nA petition has now been forwarded by Mr. Agent Waddy, signed by the Chief, two of the councillors and a number of the Indians, urging the necessity of providing educational facilities for those children on the reserve who cannot be accommodated at the McKay Boarding School. They state in the petition that there are over 50 children of school age on the reserve, who are not able to attend school.\n\nI may say that we have no funds available from our appropriation for Indian Education for the present fiscal year for the purpose of erecting a suitable building. This matter could, however, receive consideration when next year's estimates are being prepared.\n\nIn your letter above referred to, you stated that it was your intention to visit The Pas and take up this question with the agent, and that you would report to the Department. I shall be pleased to receive your views concerning the request of the Indians for the erection of a building, and any recommendation you can give as to the number of children that will have to be provided for. The size of the building required and whether teacher's living quarters would have to be arranged for should also be stated by you. I shall be glad to have this information before the estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

I expect, however, to be able to visit The Pas before the winter sets in and will then be in a position to give an intelligent report on the question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI suggested to Bishop Floyd that he urge establishment of school at Pas Reserve. There are nearly 50 children across river from the town. A large school & residence is needed.\n\nPovesh, Band funds (Caf 75189)\n\nR.W.\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince the election of the new Chief, Patrick Constant and several councilors in December 1923, to form the new council for The Pas Indian Band many matters of vital importance to the future welfare of the Band have been taken up and discussed by them.\n\nWe know that the usual way of getting matters of outstanding importance before your department is through the local Indian agent. We are not going over his head at all in taking the matters we wish to discuss, up direct with you, as we have already talked them over with Mr. J. Waddy, who suggests that we write you personally in reference to the matter of day school education of the children on the reserve.\n\nAs we think your department must undoubtedly know, because your department is responsible for the condition that has obtained, there has been no day school in one section of the Pas Reserve for the past three or four years. In this district there are today, running around, idle and uneducated, some fifty-five children of school age, who are deprived of educational facilities in every way shape and form. There is not now, nor has there ever been a day school building in this section of the reserve. For the short time that a day school was conducted in this district some years ago an old tumble-down shack was rented and used for the purpose. It was entirely unsuitable and was torn down because it was useless for any purpose. This we would like to say, was before Mr. Waddy became the local Indian Agent, and was a matter which should have concerned and interested his predecessor, which apparently it did not very much. This however, is a matter of ancient history, and nothing can be gained by discussing that phase of the question any further.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-1, part 1)\nThe question for immediate consideration is the remedying of this deplorable, and we think inexcusable condition of affairs, which has been allowed to exist for so long in reference to the important matter of the primary education of the children on this section of the Pas reserve to which we have just referred.\n\nA special meeting was called by the New Chief for Jan. 17th. to discuss this matter. It was felt by the Council that this condition could not be tolerated any longer, and upon the suggestion of the Chief, it was unanimously agreed that we should without delay write direct to the Indian Department to ask them to at once erect a suitable school building, centrally located to accommodate all the school children in the district. It was also decided to ask the department to erect an extra, and separate building for the purpose of the children having their noonday meal because of the long distance many of them would have to go to attend the day school.\n\nThere are very many arguments we could submit in favor of the granting of our most reasonable request, but we feel that your Department will at once realize the need for the school building we ask to have erected and they must know without our saying so that there is nothing more important to the people of the Pas Reserve, as also to all the people of the province as a whole than the matter of a secular education for the children. Our children, some fifty-five of them are today, on the Pas Indian reserve deprived absolutely of a chance to get an education. We want this state of affairs corrected as soon as possible and we most respectfully wish to draw the attention of your department to it, feeling sure that you will without delay take this matter up with us and the Indian agent, Mr. Waddy and that we will soon have the school we so much need.\n\nWe wish to thank you in anticipation of your immediate attention to this important matter, and we have the honor to be,\n\nYour Humble Servants,\n\nChief\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-1, part 1)\nOttawa, Jan. 29, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the communication of the 21st instant, which was signed by yourself and several councillors of the Indian Band on The Pas Reserve. I have noted that you are urging the establishment of educational facilities and in reply I have to inform you that the Department has lately given your needs serious consideration. Bishop Lloyd of the Anglican Church and the Superintendent of Indian Education have recommended that a two-roomed school, with residence facilities for the teachers, be provided as soon as funds can be found for the purpose. There are many pressing claims on Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education and it is unlikely that public moneys can be secured for the building activity during this calendar year. I have learned that about $75,000 capital is to the credit of your Band and school facilities could be provided as soon as the building season commences this year, if the council see fit to vote, say, $7,500 for this purpose.\n\nPlease discuss this matter with Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, to whom I am writing today, and he will explain to you the Department's wishes in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Patrick Constant,\nIndian Reserve,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, Jan. 29, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Bishop Lloyd has urged the establishment of a day school for the Indian children on The Pas Reserve, which is across the river from the town. The Indian Band also has petitioned the Department and I am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of my communication of today's date to Chief Patrick Constant. If a properly conducted day school of two classrooms, with residence facilities for the teachers, would in your opinion be a success, please urge the Chief and the Councillors to pass a resolution, authorizing the Department to take $7,500 from their Capital Funds (at present $75,189) for the purpose of erecting the necessary building.\n\nThe Estimates for 1924-25 have been prepared and I regret that it is too late to include an item for The Pas Day School. If the Band are not willing to authorize the use of their Capital Funds in this connection, the erection of a combined school house and residence will have to stand over for at least a year.\n\nPlease give this matter your serious consideration, and when you are acquainting the Department with the result of your deliberations with the Band, you should make a recommendation as to not only the needs but also the best means of satisfying them. If this Indian settlement across the river from the town of The Pas is more or less permanent, the Department would give favourable consideration to the scheme.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean Esq.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of Jan. 29th, 24, in reply to our letter regarding Educational Facilities on The Ias Reserve, your file no. 128-7-1.\n\nYour communication addressed to me has been discussed informally among the members of the Council and it becomes my duty to reply.\n\nWe note that Bishop Lloyd has been interested himself on our behalf, and has recommended that a two-room school with residence space for teachers be built. We are pleased to know this as it is in line with our request of recent date.\n\nWe note also what you say in regard to our trust fund of some $75,000.00. You say \"School facilities could be provided as soon as the season commences this year, if the Council see fit to vote, say $7,500.00 for this purpose.\"\n\nSpeaking personally, I do not see that we are under any obligation to vote any money for the purpose you suggest in your letter, for the reason that by treaty made with many bands, of which the Ias Band is one, your department agreed to maintain schools for Indians on reserves, supply ammunition and twine annually to a stated amount, also implements and cattle, from the funds of the Department.\n\nThe fact that our having a private, or trust fund in the Bank to our credit does not enter into the question at all. That is a purely private or personal affair with the Band, and we are only a little more fortunate in being so situated than other bands, at which of course we are very much pleased.\nWe think that Your Department has been very negligent in the matter of providing educational facilities for the children on the Pas Reserve inasmuch as some 55 or more children have been denied an education altogether for four straight long years on our Reserve, just because there was no school building and no teacher provided by your Department as you were and are under a legal and a moral obligation to do.\n\nWe wish again to repeat our request that your department provide adequate school facilities for the children on the reserve, this summer without fail, and from the general funds of your Department, as we think you are obligated by treaty to do.\n\nAt your request we are taking this matter up with our Indian Agent, Mr. J.W. Waddy at once, and we trust there will be no difficulty or delay in this important matter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sirs,\n\nYour Humble Servant.\n\n[Signature]\nChief.\n\n[Signature]\nSec'y.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to yours of the 29th ult. No. 128-7-1, rega rds The Pas Day school, I beg to state that I took this matter up with The Pas Band Indians.\n\nThese people absolutely refused to allow any of their trust monies to be used in assisting the school. I enclose a letter which they have written in regard to this matter.\n\nUnder the circumstances I recommend that the whole question be allowed to stand over for another year.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

I have noted that the Band have refused to authorize the Department to take the necessary funds from their Capital Account.\n\nYou may inform our petitioners that the need of their reserve will not be overlooked when our Estimates for 1925-26 are being prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOct 9/1924\n\n15. The Pas.\n\nThe conditions here have been a public scandal for some time. The Indians say the Department promised them a school with two rooms for two teachers, and a teacher's residence separate from the school. There are fifty-five children at this end of the reserve from seven years of age upwards running wild. This school is urgently needed and should be proceeded with at once. The site ought to be central, near where we have built the Church of the Messiah, viz. the village end of the reserve.\n\nBishop Saskatchewan's recap of interview.\nEXTRACT FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S LETTER, No.205-7B,\nDATED OCTOBER 8, 1924.\n\nUnder Buildings and Repairs for Day Schools, I have struck out the first two items asking for expenditure for school and teacher's house on The Pas Reserve. The Agent points out in his letter that if a day school is built, it will be harder to find pupils for the Mackay Boarding School, and I agree with his remarks.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM INDIAN AGENT J. W. WADDY,\nTHE PAS, MAN. His No. 2913 -128, Dated Sept. 20, 1924.\n\nPage 13 shows a large increase in school buildings. The Pas Reserve is asking again for a day school near the reserve. My idea is slightly different to that of the church authorities and the Indians who ask for a large two-roomed school. If this is built it will take away children from the Mackay School. I have difficulty all the time to keep up the numbers at this place now, the Indians have excuses of all sorts why they should not send the children to school, and at the same time they ask for more accommodation, and will probably have new excuses why they should not send the youngsters to it when it is built. It principally depends on the actions of the teacher, they are all human and at times they annoy the Indians, with immediate results on the school attendance. I would consider a small school sufficient at first, made so it could be enlarged if successful.\nOttawa, November 7, 1924.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the advisability of establishing a day school for Indian children at The Pas, Man., I have to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Waddy considers such activity would hurt the enrolment at the Mackay Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, when forwarding his estimates, refused to ask for a classroom and teacher's residence for this point, on the grounds that the Mackay institution was for these children. If Your Lordship has an opportunity of discussing this question with the Indian agent and the principal of the school, I should be grateful if you would do so and let me have a further expression of your wishes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAstd. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. N. Lloyd, D. D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nFor some years, Church and Department representatives have urged the establishment of a day school on The Pas Reserve. Mr. Inspector S. J. Jackson, in 1920, recommended that a day school be built at an early date. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, whose recommendation was sought, was quite in favour of such a programme. The Department wrote to you on November 10, 1920, asking for a recommendation.\n\nThe question was brought to your attention again under cover of August 8, 1922. Please note your file 205-14 A.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan visited the Department in 1923 and urged the establishment of a two-roomed school and residence. The Department also received a petition from the members of the band. No funds were available, however, and the matter was not referred again to your office.\n\nIn October, last, the Bishop of Saskatchewan wrote in part as follows: \"The conditions here (The Pas) have been a public scandal for some time. There are 55 children at this end of the reserve, from 7 years of age upwards, running wild. This school is urgently needed and should be proceeded with at once. The site should be central, near where we have built the Church of the Messiah, viz., the village end of the reserve.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Indian Agent Waddy was sending in his estimates for the coming fiscal year, he wrote in part as follows: \"The Pas Reserve is asking again for a day school near the reserve. My idea is slightly different from that of the church authorities and the Indians, who ask for a large two-roomed school. --- I would consider a small school sufficient at first, made so that it could be enlarged if successful.\"\n\nIn the light of these facts, I should be pleased if you would make a recommendation with reference to the provision of a combined day school and teacher's residence at The Pas. At the present writing, there is in the draft Estimates for Indian Education, 1925-26, an item of $4,200.00 in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, file No.128-7-1, in which you make reference to the Day School and teacher's residence at The Pas, and also in which you quote the remarks of the Bishop of Saskatchewan with regard to the necessity for this school. I beg to say that I will have this matter thoroughly gone into by Inspector Christianson, who will visit this point next month after my return from Alberta.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWe the undersigned Chiefs of the various Indian Reserves Tributary to The Pas, in convention assembled at Chief Patrick Constant's house on The Pas Reserve, during Christmas week 1924 hereby resolve as follows, in regard to the matter of public school education on the different Indian Reserves:\n\nI - That a better qualified class of teachers be at once provided to teach our Indian children. This because many of the teachers are only lay-teachers and have no regular teacher's certificates to qualify them to teach in public schools. This situation applies to all reserves.\n\nII - That in the matter of the much needed and many times asked for public school building and teacher to provide any education for some 50 or 60 children who have been deprived of all educational privileges for the past four years or more on the town end of The Pas Indian reserve, we very much deplore this condition of affairs, and ask the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, to at once remedy the situation as the regulations of the Department and the Indian treaties require day schools to be established where needed and a secular education provided for Indian children everywhere.\n\nIII - That the views expressed by certain Indian Agents to the effect that the day school in localities where boarding schools are in existence conducted under the management of religious or other bodies, are unnecessary and interfere with the efficiency of those institutions in the matter of attendance and so the day school might be dispensed with altogether, as for instance the case referred to in clause #2 above are entirely wrong, and any Indian agent advocating such a thing has not the interests of the Indians in his agency at heart.\n\nIV - That a copy of this resolution be sent to the Indian Department with the urgent request that the questions referred to in clauses I and II be given their immediate consideration.\n\nSigned By: [Signature]\nChief of The Pas Indian Reserve,\n\n\" \" Cumberland \"\n\" \" Red Earth \"\n\" \" Shoal Lake \"\n\" \" Moose Lake \"\n\" \" Cedar Lake \"\n\" \" Split Lake \"\n\" \" Nelson House \"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the resolutions relative to education, signed by yourself and other chiefs upon the occasion of your meeting at The Pas in December last. I note that you recommend better qualified instructors and the establishment of a day school on The Pas Reserve.\n\nIn reply I wish to inform you that the Department is continually effecting improvements in connection with the instruction in Indian day schools. Our aim is to have all these institutions staffed by professionally qualified teachers. In this connection, I might state that the different churches which nominate some of the workers are cooperating with us.\n\nThe Department is aware of the need for a school and teacher's residence on The Pas Reserve, and Parliament is being asked this session to vote funds for the purpose of erecting suitable buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

When Mr. P. H. Gentleman, who has taught for the past few years at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School, was in Ottawa en route to England, he was somewhat in doubt concerning his plans for the future. Because of his wife's health, he was not prepared to return to Grand Rapids, and, as he was unable to see Your Lordship, he urged Mr. Ferrier to place before you his application for a transfer to The Pas Day School.\n\nMr. Gentleman, since the beginning of his incumbency at Grand Rapids, has given faithful and good service as far as the Department is aware, and I am prepared to approve of his appointment to The Pas School if Your Lordship nominates him for this position.\n\nI have Mr. Gentleman's Old Country address, and, if Your Lordship will telegraph me as soon as your plans are settled for The Pas School, I will direct a cablegram to him. I note that the Rev. Mr. Fraser is to be in Prince Albert on the 16th instant.\n\nI have not heard from Mr. Commissioner Graham as to the probable date the new building at The Pas will be ready for occupation and for classroom activity.

Rural Dean Fraser, and I also know pretty well the mind of the Indian Agent there, and I think for several reasons it would be better to have Mr. Gentleman appointed to the School being re-opened at Big Head's in the Fort A La Corne district. I understand this is now either ready or will be in the near future, and it would be certainly better for Mr. Gentleman on account of the reason of his leaving Grand Rapids, viz: Mrs. Gentleman's state of health.\n\nThis re-opened school at Big Head's is within easy driving distance of a well equipped up-to-date hospital in Melfort, and is not a great distance from Prince Albert itself. There is no doubt Mr. Gentleman has done well as a Teacher in Grand Rapids, and he ought to do equally well in re-opening this school at Big Head's, which has been closed for so long.\n\nI would therefore nominate Mr. Gentleman for Big Head's School, but will not write to him until I hear from you in the affirmative, and if you agree that this suggestion is wise, I should be glad if you would cable him to that effect.\n\nBelieve me to be\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nJ.D.

Mr. J. Humberstone is in charge, and has 30 pupils on the roll. The children are arranged in the following grades:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 8      |\n| II    | 7      |\n| III   | 5      |\n| IV    | 5      |\n| V     | 5      |\n\nThere were 21 present on the day of my visit. The attendance here should be better as the children live quite close to the school and only in cases of sickness should they be absent. I instructed the teacher to notify the Agent of any delinquents, and Mr. Lowell assured me he would check up on the matter and have the pupils sent either to the day school or boarding school. The children are not making any rapid progress and there appears to be little change from year to year in the grades. It is impossible to understand what they say when reading, and they are very backward in answering any oral questions. Their writing and other book work is fairly good.\n\nThe classroom was well aired and clean. The school building is in good repair, although badly in need of exterior painting. During the past year a small storehouse was added.\n\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActg. Deputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTHE PAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nstorehouse has been erected at the rear of the school, which is used for wood and storing of supplies. I do not know on whose recommendation this building was erected. Wood sheds are not provided in this northern country, as a general rule, and the biscuits could quite well have been stored in the classroom.\n\nThe teacher's residence is in fair repair, but too small. This fact I have pointed out on several occasions, and I think the money spent for the shed could have been used to better advantage in adding an extra bedroom to the residence.\n\nNo mid-day lunch is provided at this school, but biscuits are issued at noon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nTHE PAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nthe coming year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

In addition to the lessons, Mr. Humberstone attempted to have the children sing, but this was a miserable failure and resulted in a solo by himself.\n\nI approached Mr. Humberstone when the children were dismissed, and asked him what progress he considered he had made during the past six or seven years, and his reply was \"very little\". On the occasion of each of my previous visits I have pointed out to Mr. Humberstone his weak points and hoped that on my return visit some improvement might be observed. This, however, has not been the case and I regret very much to report adversely concerning his work.\n\nI have always watched closely the personal appearance of our teachers and the home conditions under which they live, feeling that both should be a good example for the Indians. Here, again, I regret to report that such is not the case, and in many ways Mr. Humberstone has adopted the Indian idea, rather than giving to the Indian the ideals which we, as white people, hold. The school is situated across the river from the town of The Pas and I am quite sure if it were placed in charge of a competent teacher, we could expect work almost on a par with that carried on in the white schools.\n\nI would recommend that the Department take this matter up with the Bishop in charge of the district, with a view to having a new appointment made.\n\nBoth the school and residence are badly in need of exterior painting and a certain amount of interior decoration should be carried out during the coming\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nThis school is in charge of Mr. John F. Humberstone, with 32 pupils on the roll. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n- Grade I - 13\n- II - 4\n- III - 6\n- IV - 5\n- V - 4\n\nThe average attendance for the December quarter was 22.36. Although these children are arranged in their various grades, I am of the opinion that all are graded too high. The pupils are poor in reading and, in fact, in all subjects except writing and drawing. The discipline is very lax. The children lounge in their seats and, if standing to read, either stand on one foot or lean against the seat or wall, as the case may be. They are indifferent when spoken to and I noticed that it was necessary for Mr. Humberstone to tell practically each child in the class to take out his reader as the general instruction given to the class as a whole was not observed. The children were fairly well clothed, but untidy in appearance, their hair being uncombed. I spent some little time in the classroom and was thoroughly disappointed in the work carried on by Mr. Humberstone. When reading, it is necessary for the teacher to continually come to their aid and Mr. Humberstone, in many cases, uses the Indian word, a practice which I do not consider is good. The pupils are also allowed to speak Cree.\n\nDr. Harold W.

Mr. Horsefield might obtain the appointment as teacher in The Pas Day School, to succeed Mr. Humberstone.\n\nMr. Horsefield taught at Grand Rapids, and I am informed his services were unsatisfactory. He also taught at the Big Eddy Day School and while there we had occasion to complain as Mr. Horsefield closed his school without permission in order to carry out his work as Missionary at outside points. The Pas Day School is an important school and in securing a change of teachers I was hopeful of obtaining the services of someone who would produce marked results.\n\nIt was also intimated that Mr. Horsefield did not care to reside in the Department house, but preferred to live in the Town of The Pas. I think the Department should insist that our house be occupied by the teacher in charge of the school.\n\nMy information in connection with this matter is only that gathered in conversation, but I thought it well for the Department to know, should Mr. Horsefield be nominated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

We are pointing out to His Lordship the objection there would be to accepting the nomination of the Rev. Mr. Horsefield. When a nomination is received, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

Humberstone, who was retired as from the 30th ultimo.\n\nIn this connection I have to say the Department is informed that the Rev. Mr. Horsefield, who formerly taught at Grand Rapids, might obtain the nomination as teacher of The Pas School. When Mr. Horsefield taught at Grand Rapids, his services were not entirely satisfactory. He taught also at the Big Eddy Day School, and, while there, complaints were received that he closed the school without permission in order to carry out his work as missionary at outside points.\n\nThe Pas Day School is an important school, and it is hoped that, in making a nomination, the services of a qualified teacher will be obtained, one who will be able to produce marked results at this point. It has been intimated, further, that, should Mr. Horsefield be appointed, he would not care to reside in the Department's house but prefers to live in the town of The Pas. It is considered that the teacher appointed should occupy the house provided.\n\nI am drawing the above matters to Your Lordship's attention, in order that you can give due consideration when nominating the services of a teacher for The Pas Day School. I should be pleased if Your Lordship would forward a nomination, stating full particulars as to name, qualifications, experience, etc.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If there is any heavy household equipment which you consider it might be advisable to have remain in the residence for the use of Miss Searle and future teachers, the Department is prepared to consider paying for such articles of furniture on receipt from you of properly certified accounts in duplicate.

These buildings, it appears, are absolutely necessary for school purposes, as the old buildings are useless.\n\nThere are seven schools in this Agency, and the only building fit for occupation is the one at Big Billy. He also suggests the construction of a new school building at the Pas Reserve, at a cost of $1800. This building, according to Mr. Harlatt's idea, should be large enough for two teachers, one of which is provided for already at a salary of $300 a year. The old building in this case is of no further use. The $1800 will cover costs and building. As regards the salary for the other teacher, Mr. Harlatt thinks that the North West Government would be willing to provide a teacher, as a number of half-breed children resident on the reserve will attend the school. For the five buildings which it is proposed to rent the department will, of course, have to supply desks, etc., which can be done from the regular vote without anything being placed in the estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-5, part 1)\nMr. Marlatt, in another report, of the 14th December, suggests the appointment of two Farming Instructors in the Portage la Prairie Agency, one to be stationed on the Roseau River Reserve and the other on Swan Lake Reserve. The person at Roseau River recommended by Mr. Marlatt is a half-breed resident on the reserve, and his services, Mr. Marlatt says, can be obtained for $200 per annum; and the other is a resident on the Swan Lake Reserve, and can be secured for $240 per annum. Mr. Marlatt considers that these farmers should be paid by an assessment on the products of the Indians of 10%, which would be funnelled here to an amount for the purpose. In this way it is thought that they would soon become more than self-supporting.\n\n475 bushels of seed wheat will be required for the reserves in the Portage la Prairie Agency, for which no provision has been made in the estimates.\n\nMr. Marlatt, as you are aware, suggests that Mr. Martineau be transferred to Portage la Prairie and that he receive a salary of $1800 instead of $1000 as at present. The estimates already provide $200 for office rent; and as there would be no office rent at Portage la Prairie, there would be really no increase in this case.\n\nAs regards Mr. Reater, no provision was made in the estimates by the Commissioner and Mr. Marlatt is strongly of opinion that his services should be discontinued and the work of his agency done by Mr. Martineau.\nMr. MacLatt is very desirous that a primary Kindergarten outfit should be furnished each of the schools in his Assembly, and he thinks that this might be done at a cost of about $14 or $15 for each school, and he considers that the result would be much more satisfactory if this were done.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nMr. Scott\n\nPlease let me know as to what you consider will be necessary to make provision for in Supplementary Estimates.\n\nIf Mr. Maclellan's suggestions can be carried out.\nTo further provide is necessary for the funds to carry out their purposes. Concerning so far as the schools are concerned, we can provide the language outfit, the rent of the churches, and the $1200.00 for the new school without trouble.\n\nThe new building should be completed before June 30th. Can doubtless be done if the lumber is ordered at once - we have $400.00 in...\nfor a school building at\nRatton in this year's Estimates.\nWe will need that in the\nS.E. any $380.00 for the\n475 bush Wheat (say 80 cwt\neach). As regard the\npayment of the instructions at\nSeven Lake and Rossman River,\nthe former band has funds\nand can pay $400.00 for\none year, though to be\nmade when the crop is\nsold. The Rossman Band\nhas funds but cannot\nbear the expense at\npresent. However if any\narrangement could be made\nfor the instructor to wait\nfor his pay until after\n1st July it ought be man-\naged so the sale of the\ncrop in the fall of next\nyear would replenish the\nfund -\n\n[Signature]\n\nAct\nOttawa, 16th March, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to request that Mr. Agent Hallett of the Pas Agency be immediately instructed to close the contract with the Reverend Rural Dean Hines, of the Dauphin Mission, The Pas, for the renting of churches for school purposes at the following points:\n\n- Grand Rapids,\n- Chemawawin,\n- Moose Lake,\n- Red Earth and Shoal Lake.\n\nThe rental agreed upon is $40 per annum each.\n\nThe Agent should also be instructed to take occupancy as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\n\nJ.

The materials for this building and the contract for its erection will have to be made at Prince Albert.\n\nAs the funds for this building are provided for in the Estimates for 1897-98, no time should be lost in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\n\nJ.

Kernaghan completes, so far as I know, the bills for materials etc. For this building, the amount I asked for, and which you kindly authorized was $1200, with a verbal understanding that, if necessary, $1500 might be used.\n\nThe accounts for material etc., and the $450 advanced for transportation and wages now aggregate $1321.58. I fear that $450 will hardly be enough for transportation and wages and I have the honor to request that a Cheque be sent me for a further sum of $178.42, (making $1500 in all) which I can take out with me when I visit this Reserve on the 12th of August, and pay with it any outstanding accounts remaining unpaid. I regret very much that the building is likely to exceed my estimate; I did not think the building of scows and transportation would cost so much. I might add that Mr. Agent Courtney has taken down the River with him 30 school desks for six of the Agency Schools, and also a number of other things that are not rightly chargeable to this a/c but it would be hard to separate them. Owing to the low stage of water in the Saskatchewan, Mr. Courtney was unable to make a start from Prince Albert until the 9th inst., being detained nearly a month on this account.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I instructed Mr Agent Courtney to issue vouchers for all outstanding accounts, the reason for the estimate being exceeded is largely accounted for by the cost of transportation of material from Prince Albert to the Pas. I had been very much misinformed in regard to it, the cost of the building should be credited with the sum of $200, for transportation of 100 school desks and other articles not pertaining to the building which will reduce the building to an actual cost of about $1900. I handed over the advance of $178.42 received in your letter of 22nd of June, No 137269 to Mr Agent Courtney with instructions to account to you direct of all expenditure made by him.\n\nI trust that you will honor all proper vouchers made by Mr Courtney in connection with this building, had I been on the ground personally I would have stopped operations pending further instructions when the $1500 was exhausted but as Mr Courtney had no instructions to this effect he naturally completed the building.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept' of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Rev.

J. Jackson on the Pas Indian Day School, August 12, 1920. Original on 117558-6\n\nThis school is in a very poor condition at the present time owing to there having been no regular school for the year before the June quarter. The building is a poor one about 15 x 20 and in poor condition.\n\nRobert Thomas was educated at a college in Prince Albert for 3 years and 3 years in Battleford Indian School with Principal Matheson. He has taught for 8 years and is 43 years of age. He was at the front in France for over 2 years and has acquired a taste for alcoholic liquors.\n\nThere are so many children on this reserve that the boarding school cannot accommodate them. A new school 20 x 36, 11 ft. ceiling should be built opposite the Pas town at an early date. I would recommend that Agent Waddy be asked to get a tender from Councillor Patrick Constant for a new school. It would be built of the lumber that is now being cut at their own mill and from their own logs and should have a stone foundation.\n\nS. J. Jackson,\nOttawa, August 19, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson, in a report to the Department on his recent inspection of The Pas Indian Day School, states that the building in which the school is conducted is in very poor condition. He states that there are so many children on this reserve that the boarding school cannot provide accommodation for them and recommends that a new school building 20 x 36 feet, 11 foot ceiling, be erected opposite the town of The Pas at an early date. He also recommends that Councillor Patrick Constant be asked for a tender for the erection of such a building and that it could be built of lumber that is now being cut at their own mill and from their own logs and that the building should have a stone foundation.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state your views concerning the erection of a new school building and forward an estimate of the cost of the same. Kindly give as full particulars as you can concerning the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to tender as follows on the building 20x36 to be used as a school-house on the Pas Reserve:\n\nBuilding to have a cement foundation, walls to be 12 feet clear inside, building to be shingle-roofed two coats of paint to be applied on the outside, two coats inside, two coats on the roof, six windows and one door, with porch. Building to be solidly constructed throughout and foundation to be well banked up. All material used in the building is included in my tender, as well as all labor used in the construction of the building. The price is also to include the construction of two small closets and all hardware in connection with erecting the building.\n\nThe Department may pay for any material I purchase for this building and deduct same from total amount of my tender.\n\nFor constructing this building complete, that is, per the above, I tender the price of $1469.00\n\nYours truly,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nHowever, as this matter means quite a large expenditure, I do not desire to have it rushed, and the Department might wish to submit it to Mr. Inspector Jackson as he has had quite a lot of experience in these matters and perhaps can suggest some alteration before signing any agreement.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\u2014 Re letter #117558/5 of the 19th August, in reference to constructing a school on the Pas Indian Reserve, near the town of The Pas, I have the honor to state that I have gone into this matter with Councillor Patrick Constant, of the Pas Reserve, and explained to him just what is desired.\n\nI enclose a letter from him tendering on the contract I allowed for 12 foot walls, with an addition of two feet to the height by building the ceiling across the room two feet up from the top of the walls as we require all the air space possible.\n\nI explained to Councillor Constant that the building is only under consideration, and that it may not be erected, and he understands this. At the same time it might be advisable to put it up immediately if for no other reason than that the cost of materials is still going up, and a school is urgently required at this point. Some material will have to be purchased as the Indians have only got rough lumber, and I have placed an item in the contract covering such purchases. I drew up a rough plan with a list of material required and helped Constant to figure out the cost, so he should not have any complaint later on. At the same time I did not overlook the interests of the Department. If the Department wishes the building to be constructed as per the tender I would like to be advised by wire, so as to get the cement in immediately.\nOttawa, 26th October, 1920.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to voucher No. 44 in favour of Messrs. Brown & Moors forwarded under cover of your letter of the 11th June, 1919, for supplies for the Day schools in your Agency; I beg to state that the quantities purchased agree with the number of articles asked for in the estimates for 1919-1920, which included equipment for a school at Cumberland. As, however, the school has not been re-opened I have to request that you will state what disposition was made of the articles intended for the Cumberland Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nJ.W. Waddy Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson recommended that a new day school building be erected at The Pas on a site opposite the town. The present building is rented from an Indian at $80.00 per annum. It is in very poor condition and too small for the purpose. The Inspector states that there are so many children on this reserve that the boarding school (Mackay) cannot accommodate them. He recommended that Agent Waddy be asked to get a tender from Councillor Patrick Constant for a new building, as he has a mill and can supply the lumber from his own logs.\n\nThe Agent now forwards a tender which he received from Patrick Constant, who offers to erect a building 20 by 36 feet and to supply all the material required and do the work at a price of $1469.00, and, if the Department purchases any of the material, the cost is to be deducted from the above amount.\n\nThere are 85 children of school age on The Pas Reserve, all of whom are Anglicans. Of this number 46 are in attendance at the Mackay Boarding School, which has its full enrolment, leaving a balance of 37 for whom day school accommodation has to be provided.\n\nThere is no doubt that a new day school is urgently required on this reserve and should be built in the near future. We are now paying $80.00 per annum rent, which represents a capital expenditure of nearly $1400.00 at 6%. The tender received is $1469.00 and for this amount the Department would have a building large enough to accommodate all the children who would attend and it would be better adapted and more central than the present rented building. It is probably too late in the season to have the work done this fall, but\nbut I would recommend that funds be provided in the next year's estimates and that this work be undertaken next spring. However, I shall be pleased to be informed as to what reply to make to Mr. Agent Waddy.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The present building is rented from an Indian at $30.00 per annum. It is in very poor condition and is too small for the purpose. The recommendation received was too late in the season to take any immediate action thereon, and I should be very glad if you would look into the question of the advisability of constructing a building on this reserve, and report in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to letter 117558/5 of August 19th last, and to my answer of the 20th September enclosing tender of Patrick Constant for erection of a day school for the Pas Band, near the town of The Pas, Man.\n\nThe Indians are holding a meeting on January third next, and ask me if it will be possible to get an answer from the Department by that date, as they wish to have the school built, and wish to find out the decision of the Department.\n\nThere are so many children of school age in the vicinity that something should be done to educate them.\n\nI would be obliged for some information on the intentions of the Department by the date mentioned above.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in reference to the tender which you forwarded in August for the erection of a day school for The Pas Band near the town of The Pas, Man.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter was referred to Mr. Commissioner Graham, who was asked to look into the question of the advisability of constructing a building on this reserve. Mr. Graham replied that he had in purpose the intention of visiting The Pas and that he would take this question up with you and report to the Department at a later date. The Department is, therefore, not in a position to come to any decision in the matter until a report is received from the Commissioner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, January 23, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nFor some years, Church and Department representatives have urged the establishment of a day school on The Pas Reserve. Mr. Inspector S. J. Jackson, in 1920, recommended that a day school be built at an early date. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, whose recommendation was sought, was quite in favour of such a programme. The Department wrote to you on November 10, 1920, asking for a recommendation.\n\nThe question was brought to your attention again under cover of August 8, 1922. Please note your file 205-14 A.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan visited the Department in 1923 and urged the establishment of a two-roomed school and residence. The Department also received a petition from the members of the band. No funds were available, however, and the matter was not referred again to your office.\n\nIn October, last, the Bishop of Saskatchewan wrote in part as follows: \"The conditions here (The Pas) have been a public scandal for some time. There are 55 children at this end of the reserve, from 7 years of age upwards, running wild. This school is urgently needed and should be proceeded with at once. The site should be central, near where we have built the Church of the Messiah, viz., the village end of the reserve.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Indian Agent Waddy was sending in his estimates for the coming fiscal year, he wrote in part as follows: \"The Pas Reserve is asking again for a day school near the reserve. My idea is slightly different from that of the church authorities and the Indians, who ask for a large two-roomed school. - - - - I would consider a small school sufficient at first, made so that it could be enlarged if successful.\"\n\nIn the light of these facts, I should be pleased if you would make a recommendation with reference to the provision of a combined day school and teacher's residence at The Pas. At the present writing, there is in the draft Estimates for Indian Education, 1925-26, an item of $4,200.00 in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nKindly send me an accountable advance cheque amounting to $1000.00 for labour in connection with the combined day school and teacher's residence at The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Among the tenderers was a man, a Mr. Tallion, who some years ago was a resident of The Pas, but is now a farmer in Marcellin, Sask. He is not a resident nor is he on the voters list, and still he was allowed to tender and, being the lowest, got the contract. The local men are now up in arms. They rightly think that only local men should have been allowed to tender.\"\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, June 11, 1925.\n\nW.

It is thought that Dustbane would be more satisfactory for the purpose. However, you may supply a small quantity of oil or Dustbane as considered by the teacher and yourself to give the most satisfaction.\n\nYou may, also, arrange to have the plaster repaired around the chimney and engage the services of a carpenter to make a few necessary repairs.

P. Humberstone who holds his Second Class Professional and was appointed by the Church of England.\n\nThe roll called for 31 pupils and on the day of inspection, I found 22 present, 14 boys and 8 girls. The grades range from 1 to 3 and the children appeared well along in their studies. Mr. Humberstone has certainly succeeded in getting these children to talk and they can be heard clearly from any part of the room.\n\nThe school is of the improved type and I understand is quite comfortable during the winter.\n\nThe children were well dressed and clean.\n\nMr. Humberstone takes keen interest in his work and appears to be getting results.\n\nThe residence in connection with the school is a four roomed cottage with a very small basement. Mr. Humberstone pointed out that he had no place to use as a store room as the house only had four rooms with no back kitchen. The washing machine and tubs must either be in the kitchen or cut under the trees. An outside kitchen could be erected quite easily and at small cost. The present combined kitchen and dining room is not supplied with any cupboards. A work table should be built along one wall with cupboards above, which would greatly help Mrs. Humberstone in her house work.\nYou will note what the Inspector says regarding the lack of cupboard space in the residence at The Pas Day School. We might, with your authority, arrange to have the cupboards and table which the Inspector suggests built.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 14, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your No. 205-11 of the 7th instant relative to the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of The Pas Indian Day School, I beg to say, with regard to the Inspector's remarks as to the lack of cupboard space in the residence, that you may arrange to have cupboards and a work table installed in the present combined kitchen and dining room. It is noted that the Inspector states a work table could be built along one wall, with cupboards above, which would greatly help in the carrying out of the housework.\n\nPlease keep the expense in having the cupboards and table built as low as possible, forwarding a certified account in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

P. Humberstone, who was in charge of this school when I last inspected it, resigned to take up other work, but I found him again in charge on this visit.\n\nThe school register calls for 31 children and 22 were present. The grades range as follows:\n\n- Grade I - 13\n- Grade II - 7\n- Grade III - 6\n- Grade IV - 5\n\nThese children spoke out quite freely when questioned, and I found their voices carried much better than those of the children at the Big Eddy School.\n\nI do not consider the discipline good as the children speak out at any time and do not hesitate to get up and walk after anything they require. I checked this up.\nTHE PAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThis up and instructed the Agent, on his monthly visits, to see that this condition was improved.\n\nThe school building was fairly tidy, but the windows were all closed and the air very depressive. I pointed out to Mr. Humberstone that these windows must be kept open, and instructed the Agent to have the outside windows put on with hinges so that plenty of fresh air may be obtained.\n\nThe school building and the teacher's residence are badly in need of painting and this work should be done, if possible, during the coming year.\n\nI was not impressed with the appearance of Mr. Humberstone's residence, but he explained that the house having only 4 rooms and a small basement gave him no place to use as a storeroom and he was obliged to leave things out in the yard and on the verandah which otherwise might be stored away. A lean-to 12 ft. wide built on the rear of this house would provide for another bedroom and kitchen and could be made good use of by the present family.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, in a report on his recent inspection of the Pas Indian Day School, states that he did not consider the discipline good, as the children speak out at any time and do not hesitate to get up and walk after anything they require. He also states that he requested you to see, on your monthly visits, that this condition was improved. You should take this matter up with the teacher with a view to improving the discipline.\n\nThe Inspector states that he authorized you to have the outside windows put on with hinges, so that a supply of fresh air could be obtained. It is presumed that you have attended to this matter.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the school building and teacher's residence require painting next year. You should bring this matter to the attention of the Department early next Spring, stating the work you would advise be carried out and the approximate cost of same, also how you would propose having the labour carried out.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that a lean-to, 12 feet wide, should be built on the rear of the teacher's residence to provide a bedroom and kitchen, also storage facilities. I shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding this matter, stating whether you would recommend the erection of a lean-to, and, if so, the approximate cost of having the work completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I may say that amounts have\nbeen provided in the Estimates to meet these\nexpenditures.\nTHE PAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe school is supervised by Mr. Humberstone, whom I found to be greatly interested in his work, and anxious to have the children make progress.\n\nThe roll calls for 28 pupils, 10 girls and 18 boys. The average attendance for last quarter showed 22.5, and up till the present in this quarter, 17.72. This school is well located and there is really no excuse why the attendance should not continue to be good.\n\nThe children were tidy in appearance, but some were poorly clad, and I noted a number with wet feet. The weather had turned very mild and as some were wearing moccasins without rubbers, this could not be avoided.\n\nThe grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 11     |\n| II    | 4      |\n| III   | 5      |\n| IV    | 4      |\n| V     | 4      |\n\nThe work\nTHE PAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe work examined was well done, but the children do not speak out well, and it is almost impossible to hear their voices across the room. I understand from Mr. Humberstone that when he is alone with the pupils, they speak out much better, and I have no doubt such may be the case as some of the children are very shy. Drill and singing is also taught, and I found the children did very well in this respect.\n\nThe school building needs exterior painting, and the walls inside are in need of kalsomining as they have become badly smoked. The teacher's residence is also in need of painting outside. This house is very small, having only two bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. An addition across one end would allow for two more rooms, which are needed, as at present there are seven in the family, five children and Mr. & Mrs. Humberstone. The addition would make possible three bedrooms, a kitchen, dining room, and living room.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-5, part 2)\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR J.S. PEACH,\nDATED DECEMBER 16, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nPAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 128-7-6.\n\nThe pump is broken and pupils have to\ncarry water from the river - a considerable distance.\n\nA larger supply of wood should be kept on\nhand or a cheap wood shed provided. The small pile\nof wood is easily covered with a slight fall of snow.\nOttawa, January 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection in December, last, of the Pas Indian Day School, states that the pump is broken and the pupils have to carry water a considerable distance from the river. He also states that a larger supply of wood should be kept on hand, and a woodshed provided.\n\nRegarding the pump, I have to request that you will arrange to have same placed in a good, serviceable condition as soon as possible. Should any new parts be required, you may purchase same, but all costs in having the pump repaired should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYou might furnish a report regarding the erecting of a woodshed of an inexpensive type, giving particulars as to the size you recommend and the approximate cost, including material and labour, when consideration will be given to authorizing having same erected next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. Tweddell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nFebruary 3rd, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your 128-7-5 of the 19th instant, I beg to say that I have, as instructed, today visited The Pas Indian Day School and examined the pump and well. I find that the reason the pump-handle breaks, is that the well freezes at the bottom at the cylinder, so that it is useless to have the handle repaired at present.\n\nI would suggest that it be left till spring, and that the well be properly covered in at the level of the ground, so that it will not freeze below.\n\nThe well is only about 24 ft. deep. A floor could be put in, say 4 ft. or so from the top of the crib, which would prevent the frost from going further down.\n\nThe pump is an old wooden one. Fixing the handle is a matter of a few minutes, to bore another hole for the eye-bolt which pulls out when the pump freezes.\n\nHowever should you wish to have the well fixed at once I shall be pleased to have it done.\n\nI presume the well is frozen to the bottom.\n\nIn regard to the wood-shed, I would suggest a building about 14x16-8 ft., walls of ship-lap and shingled, with a light cement foundation to keep the sills from rotting. I do not think a floor would be necessary. Such a shed could be built at a small cost, and if required I could submit a figure for the material and labor.\n\nIn regard to the wood supply, there is a good supply, all sawed up, at the present time. It is always a difficult matter to get the Indians to supply wood. They expect to be paid for it and I contend that they should at least supply school wood free. As you know they never want to have a supply of anything ahead.\n\nI trust this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, February 9, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, reporting on the condition of the pump at The Pas Indian Day School and also regarding the building of a woodshed.\n\nWith reference to the pump, it is considered that, as suggested by you, the carrying out of any repairs and placing the pump in good condition should remain over until weather conditions permit next spring. When considered timely by you in the spring, you may arrange to have the well properly covered in at the level of the ground, to prevent freezing. It is noted you suggest that a floor be put in about four feet from the top of the crib in order to prevent the frost from going further down. You may have this floor installed, and, if a new pump is required, you may arrange for its purchase and installation. In making the repairs to this well, please see that all costs are kept as low as possible and you should render certified accounts, in the usual manner, covering the expenditure incurred. Please bear this matter in mind, and, early next spring, have the well placed in a satisfactory condition to prevent freezing.\n\nRegarding the erection of a woodshed, I have to request that you will submit an estimate of the cost of the material and labour in building a shed of the type and size as mentioned in your letter. When this information is to hand, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the purpose can be provided to have the shed built next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. Tweddell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nFebruary 16th, 1931\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 128-7-5 of the 9th instant, re The Pas Indian Day School, I beg to say that I shall have the pump fixed at the first opportunity in spring.\n\nRe the woodshed, I herewith list below prices received on the material and labor.\n\n| Item                          | Price   |\n|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Cement, lumber, door, sash and shingles | $115.30 |\n| Nails, lock & butts           | 2.35    |\n| Labor                         | 21.00   |\n| **Total**                     | **$138.65** |\n\nThe above prices are on a shed 14x16-8ft.walls., with a cement foundation, shingled roof and shiplap walls.\n\nI trust this will meet with your approval, and awaiting your further orders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst, Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, February 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required in building a woodshed at the Pas Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have this work carried out when weather conditions permit next Spring. The shed should be of the size and type mentioned by you. It is considered that it would be satisfactory if the sills were placed on cedar posts instead of cement, and the cost would be less. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed. A good, strong lock or padlock should be placed on the door.\n\nAfter the shed has been erected to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the materials and labour in having the work carried out. The Department will expect you to see that all costs are kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.-P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G.

The exterior is very much\nin need of paint; in fact, most of the old paint has\npeeled off.\n\nThe pump house should be repaired at once.

The lumber is off the rear of the building, leaving it open to the dogs and small stock roaming around the reserve. If this is not repaired, the water will become contaminated and, sooner or later, the pump will be broken.

These should be renewed or before long the seats will fall apart. A good man could make all necessary repairs in four or five hours.\"\n\nProvided the expenditure does not exceed the amount mentioned above, you may arrange to have Inspector Hamilton's recommendations carried out at once.

There are 28 on the roll and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 14     |\n| II    | 4      |\n| III   | 3      |\n| IV    | 4      |\n| V     | 3      |\n\nThe children are fairly well along in their grades and are making progress. The epidemic of measles necessitated the closing of school for several weeks and this interfered greatly with the work. There is no comparison in the discipline and general management of this school now and when taken over by Miss Wright. It has improved even beyond expectations and much credit is due the teacher for her sincere and earnest work.\n\nThe children were well dressed and clean. Their hair was neatly combed and apparently free from vermin.\n\nI noticed that all the seats were occupied and the school was clean and in a tidy condition.\n\nThe school building appears much neglected. A number of boards should be renewed on the outside wall, due largely to decay. All siding should be re-nailed and the exterior painted. The paint put on at the time of erection.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTHE PAS INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nof erection has entirely disappeared and the building presents a weather beaten appearance.\n\nThe school residence outside is almost as bad as the school and should be painted. The interior is in fair condition. Miss Wright has taken excellent care of the furniture and it is almost as nice as when supplied two years ago.\n\nI consider the school under excellent supervision and the children are making progress.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, July 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, in a report on his recent inspection of the Pas Indian Day School, states that the school building appears much neglected. He states that a number of boards should be renewed on the outside walls due largely to decay. All siding should be renailed and the exterior painted.\n\nI would request that you furnish an estimate of the cost of the repairs required to the school building; also an estimate of the cost of the exterior painting of both the school building and teacher's residence. When we have this information, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be allowed for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Man.,\n\nJuly 29, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 128-7-5, dated the 18th instant, I beg to advise that it will cost about $30.00 to make the necessary repairs to the school buildings and $70.00 to paint the school building and the teacher's residence. I would be pleased to have authority to do this work right away so that it can be done during the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 6, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $30 in making the necessary repairs to the Pas Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared at the present time to authorize the expenditure required for painting the exterior of the school and teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The work was done with Indian labour and in every way appears satisfactory.\n\n\"The teacher's residence now looks worse than ever. This house should be painted on the outside as soon as possible, and the interior should be redecorated. It is many years since any expense has been incurred for decoration and the house is gloomy, dark and cheerless.\n\n\"The well pump is not working. I would suggest that a good pole fence be erected so as to keep stock away. The repairs to the pump and other work should not entail much expense, perhaps $10.00 or $15.00, and I would suggest this be carried out as soon as possible.\"\n\nPlease let me know the approximate cost of painting the teacher's residence.\n\nYou may arrange for the repairs to the pump and also have the pole fence erected as suggested by the Inspector. It is noted that the total cost of this work will not exceed $15.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-5, part 3)\nThe Pas Schools - In so far as the two schools on the Pas reserve are concerned, we have one-hundred per cent of them Toxoided and Vaccinated. The increase in attendance with the coming of the Family Allowance has given me a great deal of satisfaction. While no doubt you have the figures, I am taking the liberty of giving you a copy of the average attendance as given me by Mr. Waller for his school across the river.\n\nAverage attendance December quarter 1941 - 14.75\n\" \" \" \" 1942 - 15\n\" \" \" \" 1943 - 12\n\" \" \" \" 1944 - 15\n\" \" \" \" 1945 - 29.9\n\nand during the actual month of December, after some checks had been stopped for irregular attendance, the daily average arose to 32.\n\nMr. Lovell's firmness, backed by the Department, is beginning to get results. If this is continued (and I am sure it will be) in ten years we will have a generation which speaks English. At it now is the only ones who know English are those who attended McKay School. English amongst the younger ones was sadly disappearing.\n\nAs to be expected the two schools are now overcrowded and, as I am primarily interested in the health of these children, it seems to me that a few comparatively minor changes would make a considerable improvement. Would suggest the removing of the partition which gives a porch inside the school proper. This would give us a considerable amount more floor space and the advantages of a porch could be obtained by building one on the outside of the door. While I have not actually been up there, my information is that there has been no attempt made to insulate the ceilings of these buildings. I think that they could be much more comfortable by the use of sawdust. Both schools are short of seats. It might be possible to have these made locally.\nOttawa, 2nd February, 1946.\n\nMr. Samuel Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nIn a recent letter received from Dr. R.F. Yule, he writes as follows:\n\n\"As to be expected the two schools are now overcrowded and, as I am primarily interested in the health of these children, it seems to me that a few comparatively minor changes would make a considerable improvement.

These partitions could be taken out, but I do not think it would be a great advantage, as we would have to build porches on the outside of the school, which in all probability would have to have a separate heating unit.\n\nI intend to include in my estimate for 1947-1948, an estimate for increasing the capacity of these schools without tearing out these partitions. I would suggest that an addition be built at the rear of these schools, which could be made a permanent structure.\n\nAs regards insulation in the ceiling, these schools have two coats of lath and plaster, and very few cracks, and I am not altogether in favor of having sawdust used for insulation in a school building, where there are a lot of children, as this sawdust would be bone dry, and would create a fire hazard. I think this situation could best be handled in other ways, even by the use of heavy building paper in between the joists upstairs.\n\nRegarding doing any work at the present time, it would be practically impossible as we would have to close the school, and I respect their request that this matter be allowed to stand in abeyance until the summer holidays, and I will go into this matter thoroughly in my estimate next year, for 1947 to 1948.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

The toilets - To quote Mr. Bateman \"the toilets present a disgusting appearance, the seats and floors being littered with faeces, and the odor being very oppressive\".\n\nMr. Waller is evidently doing an efficient job as a teacher, but the cleanliness of the toilets at his school would leave very much to be desired.\n\nWould you suggest to Mr. Waller (a) that he appoint weekly toilet monitors and hold them strictly accountable for the cleanliness of the toilets (b) that he himself inspect them daily, and, if there is any filth at all, that the monitors be responsible for cleaning it up at once.\n\nAs this monitorship is rotated weekly, it will soon be found that all students become concerned about the cleanliness of the toilets.\n\nBernard F.

Yule, M.D.,\nMedical Supt., The Pas Agency, for January 1946.\n\nRe: Norway House Trip\n\nOur Provincial regulations call for 15 sq. ft. of floor space and 200 cubic ft. of air space per pupil. These figures were given me by Mr. Goodman at Norway House, who had obtained them directly from the Provincial Department. On my return I checked our schools on The Pas Reserve, which are identical in size and layout. These schools are 21 x 23 x 10 with an additional 7 x 21 x 10 porch, (this porch being under the main roof). The cubic space would thus allow 24 pupils, or, if the porch were included, 31 pupils. The square foot space would allow 32 pupils or, with porch included, 42 pupils. To comply with the regulations the ceiling should be 3 feet higher. In other words these buildings would require a 13 foot ceiling to bring the cubic air space in line with the square foot space. Even with these schools I think there is enough space between the ceiling and roof to fill these requirements. However, independent of this, by the removal of the partition and the installation of proper desks, conditions can be materially improved. These schools are cold and should be insulated and it should be done before the fall term opens this year. Of course, with the removal of the inside partition a porch would have to be added. These schools have a registration of 38 and 34 respectively.\nExtract from Report of Robt. F. Yule, M.D.,\nMedical Supt., The Pas Agency, dated October 1, 1946.\n\nDAY SCHOOLS - PAS AGENCY\n\nIn my January 1946 report an extended reference was made to our two day-schools on The Pas Reserve. There is also a suggestion put forward providing at least a partial remedy of present conditions. The work and cost involved would be nominal. However, our schools have re-opened for the fall term undecorated, overcrowded and unventilated. Schools, especially Indian schools, should set a standard for roominess, brightness and cleanliness. Our schools do none of these things. While I am on the subject I may say that in my opinion schoolrooms should be painted, not kalsomined.\nOttawa, November 1, 1946.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nPas Indian Day School\n\nOn July 8 we wrote to you on similar file, concerning the conditions discovered by Inspector of Schools Bateman when he visited the above school. At that time you were asked to submit an estimate as to the cost of carrying out certain repairs at this school. To date there is no record of any letter having been received from you concerning this matter. We have now received a report from Dr. Yule, Medical Superintendent of the Pas Agency, in which he states as follows:\n\n\"However, our schools have re-opened for the fall term, undecorated, overcrowded and unventilated.

But the situation as it stands at the present time is this:\n\nThe provincial government have a school in this vicinity which has not functioned for a number of years. The School Inspector for this area approached me with a scheme to build a big joint school in this area, to take care of half-breeds and Indians. I had his assurance that this was taken up with the Minister of Education for Manitoba, and through him, with our Department. If this scheme is successful, any work that I did on these schools would be simply a waste of money. I interviewed the Inspector a few days ago, and he assured me, \"off the records\", that there had been some agreement with the Department in Winnipeg and Ottawa, whereby one of our schools would be enlarged to take care of the half-breeds, and the Department of Education would see that the school at Moose Lake would be enlarged to take care of the Indians in that vicinity. Up to the present time, I have had no official word, but I have hesitated...\nrecommending any work on these schools, until I have been notified that the arrangements had been made, as I do not want to spend money without having a beneficial result.\n\nI do not think that Dr. Yule knows anything about the arrangements or any discussions regarding this scheme. Consequently, he reported this in his monthly report. Labor is very scarce, and material is very hard to procure at the present time, but the cost to do these schools would be approximately $150.00 each, that is, to wash the kalsomine off, and paint. If, under the circumstances, the Department are willing to go ahead and re-decorate these schools, I will endeavor to have this done in the Christmas holidays.\n\nTrusting that this is the information that you require, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nSL/FH\nOttawa, November 30, 1946.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the condition of the day schools in The Pas Agency, particularly the Pas Indian Day School.\n\nEarly in April, 1947, you should make a recommendation regarding the repairs and decorating that you consider are necessary at each of the schools in your Agency. The matter will then receive careful consideration and any work authorized can be done during the Easter or summer holidays.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion with officials of the Department of Education of the Province of Manitoba with regard to providing schools that would be attended by both Indian children and half-breeds. It is hoped that building materials will enable the projected joint school in your agency to be constructed next summer. However, we will know definitely by next April and can then decide our future plans. I enclose an extra copy of this letter in the event that you might wish to pass it to Dr. Yule, M.D.\n\nBernard F.

Enrollment is thirty-eight.\n\nAs an emergency measure I recommend that you authorize the removal of the cloakroom partitions, increasing the length of the room by six feet.

This letter authorizes you to purchase the wood required. You may also purchase a reasonable quantity of Dustbane.\n\nMr. Clark reports the classroom overcrowded and states the condition could be remedied if the cloak room partitions were removed increasing the length of the room by six feet.

Law,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nThe Pas Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Moffat's report on Mr. Waller is quite satisfactory. In his General Comment, Mr. Moffat makes the following comments:\n\n\"I am glad to note that toilet paper, a basin, soap and paper towels have been placed in the school as requested in my report of last year. However, the school well has gone dry so that the benefits that should have resulted are largely lost due to lack of water. Mr. Waller secures his own water by hiring a car to bring it from the town. It is suggested that steps should be taken to deepen the well or if this is not feasible to take other means of assuring an adequate supply at the school.\n\nThe girl's toilet is in such poor repair that it is impossible to use it properly. As a result it is in a filthy condition. New and larger toilets should be built. I have suggested to Mr. Waller the advisability of checking the condition of the toilets regularly and of encouraging pupils to put them to proper use.\n\nA number of students were sitting on boxes. Six new desks should be made available.\n\nThe plaster on the ceiling is broken in one or two places, especially near the chimney.\n\nThe removal of the partition at the back of the room has added considerably to classroom space. Even with this improvement, the room is quite crowded.\"\nIf enrolment increases it would seem advisable to consider the building of a new two-room school in the near future. When such a building program is undertaken, I would like to see space and equipment made available for teaching practical arts such as shop work for boys and home making for girls.\n\nYou are authorized to have another toilet constructed at a cost not to exceed $100. It is presumed that we will have a report from you with regard to the water situation.\n\nYou are aware, of course that when Major Clark visits The Pas that he is to investigate the possibility of erecting a two-room school next year. Would you please submit a requisition for the desks required stating the number of small, medium and large sizes wanted.\n\nWe are sending Mr. Waller four dozen large envelopes for use by the children in taking their report cards home.\n\nBernard F.

He prefers to use town water for drinking purposes and uses creek and snow water for cooking. Therefore, we request authority to purchase two ten gallon enamel pots with lids, and taps at bottom at $14.95 each. One for the teacherage, and one for the school. Mr. Waller says he will keep town water in these pots.\n\nRegarding the plaster on the ceiling of the school, we would like to have this ceiling replastered, but do not know just what balance is left of our 1948-49 appropriation. Our 1948-49 estimates asked that $500.00 be set aside for repairs to this school. Please advise.\n\nWhen Major Clark visits this Agency we will discuss the possibility of enlarging the school playground by approximately four acres, and also pick a site for the new school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

(RG 10, Volume 6242, file 531-5, part 3)\nThe PAS\n\nA residential school was formerly operated by the Anglicans at The Pas. This burned in 1933 and the children were moved to the Elkhorn Residential School. It has now been necessary, due to the age of the building, to remove some of these children from the Elkhorn School and we are therefore faced with the need of providing dormitory facilities again for the Indian children scattered along the railway line between The Pas and Churchill. I would recommend that an Educational Survey Committee be established to visit this area and to report as follows:\n\n(1) The educational facilities which should be provided for Indian children of the Anglican faith in the area.\n\n(2) If the provision of day schools is recommended, where should these be situated and of what type?\n\n(3) If a residential school is recommended, where should it be located and what pupil accommodation should be provided?\n\n(4) Other specific facts and comments concerning the educational facilities presently provided and recommendations concerning co-operation with the Provincial Authorities.\n\nI would recommend that this committee be composed of the following members:\n\n(a) G.A.F. Clark, Educational Survey Officer, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\n(b) Inspector of Schools nominated by Provincial Department of Education. (We have in mind either Mr. H.P. Moffat, Public School Inspector, The Pas, Manitoba, or Mr. Grafton.\n\n(c) An Anglican Missionary, appointed by the M.S.C.C.\n\nAs funds are not provided in our appropriation this year for the construction of a school or a unit of a school at The Pas, I feel that this educational survey could be carried out in September, 1949.\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nDuring the conversation that we had on your last visit to Brandon, I gathered that there is a proposal for the erection of a new school on the Devon Mission and I presume that this will be one with living quarters attached. I do not know, of course, whether the present school, of which Mr. Sam Waller is the Teacher, would still be in use, but if this is to be replaced, we would, as a Diocese, like to have the opportunity of considering the purchase of the residence and perhaps even gaining possession of the school building.\n\nOur present residence for the Missionary is so situated that in the winter he is completely isolated and we find that with the visiting required at the Sanatorium and at The Pas Hospital, it is essential that he should live close to the highway and thus be able to use a car. For some time we have been considering the possibility of moving our house close to where Mr. Waller lives, but if you no longer would require this house as living quarters, it might be more economical to consider obtaining this instead of moving our present one.\n\nWhile I realize, of course, that some time may elapse before a new school and living quarters are built, I felt it would be advisable to inform you concerning this matter so that if changes are made, our application may be on file.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nArchdeacon of Brandon.\nMarch 9, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION.\n\nThe Pas - Proposed Two Room School.\n\nMr. Waller is a bachelor of fifty-five years of age. He is a keen amateur anthropologist and nature lover and may not take kindly to sharing the teacherage with someone who does not share his enthusiasm. I can well imagine there are several teachers who would not like to live with a collection of pickled biological specimens. Besides, his status as a Welfare teacher probably involves his receiving visits in his quarters from the Indians and others.\n\nI would remind you of the existence of another house close to the teacherage. This was formerly a nurse's residence and an attempt was made some time ago to obtain it for, I think, the Agency Interpreter. The Missionary, perhaps, might be regarded by Indian Health Services as an acceptable tenant.\n\nMr. Superintendent Law may now have worked out some ideas for town-planning on the Reserve and I would suggest that he be requested to furnish the Department with a large scale diagram such as we have obtained for the File Hills Reserve. On this diagram he may indicate his choice of a new school site. He may also send us any information he may be able to obtain concerning Mr. Waller's desire for the locale of his future service with the Department and also his reaction to the prospect of sharing the teacherage.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nMarch 2, 1949.\n\nDear Archdeacon Norris:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 24th.\n\nWe hope to proceed with our building plans at The Pas either this year or next year. I cannot tell you at the present time whether it is our intention to close the old school entirely or to keep it functioning in addition to the new school which we plan.\n\nHowever, I note that you are interested in the old building and will draw this situation to the attention of our Educational Survey Officer when he returns from James Bay next week. He visited The Pas recently and will be able to advise me further as to our need for the old building.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe Ven. I.A. Norris, B.A.,\nArchdeacon of Brandon,\nBrandon, Man.,\n\nBFN/HM\nMemorandum:\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION.\n\nThe Pas - Proposed Two Room School.\n\nMr. Waller is a bachelor of fifty-five years of age. He is a keen amateur anthropologist and nature lover and may not take kindly to sharing the teacherage with someone who does not share his enthusiasm. I can well imagine there are several teachers who would not like to live with a collection of pickled biological specimens. Besides, his status as a Welfare teacher probably involves his receiving visits in his quarters from the Indians and others.\n\nI would remind you of the existence of another house close to the teacherage. This was formerly a nurse's residence and an attempt was made some time ago to obtain it for, I think, the Agency Interpreter. The Missionary, perhaps, might be regarded by Indian Health Services as an acceptable tenant.\n\nMr. Superintendent Law may now have worked out some ideas for town-planning on the Reserve and I would suggest that he be requested to furnish the Department with a large scale diagram such as we have obtained for the File Hills Reserve. On this diagram he may indicate his choice of a new school site. He may also send us any information he may be able to obtain concerning Mr. Waller's desire for the locale of his future service with the Department and also his reaction to the prospect of sharing the teacherage.\n\nC.A.F.

Neary\nSupt. of Education.\n\nReplying to your letter of March 18th, file\n531-1 (E), in connection with proposed two room Indian\nDay School, The Pas, Man.\n\nDuring Mr. R. S. Davis' visit to this Agency\nlast week I showed him the site which I thought most\nsuitable for the new school, and he agreed with me. He\nstated that it is the Department's intention to build a\ntwo roomed school with teachersage, manual training and\ndomestic science rooms, plan #891, with electricity and\nrunning water, if possible. I am sending Mr. Davis the\naddress of Mr. G. A. Muir, the engineer in charge of\nthe Manitoba Government Telephone system work in this\ndistrict. They are taking electric wiring for their own\nuse across the river to their building on The Pas Reserve.\nThere is a possibility that we might hook on to their line\nabout 300 yards from our new school, which is circled on\nthe map I am forwarding to you. The electric line and\nnew school are marked in red.\n\nIf this location for the new school is approved\nI would like to be advised as soon as possible so that I\nmay obtain authority from Mr. Davis to start digging for\nwater on this site. I have been unable to locate a well\ndigger in this district, so it may have to be done by hand.\n\nHoping this is the information you require.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Law.\nSupt.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education.\n\nReplying to your letter of June 27th, file 531-5 (E), in connection with The Pas Indian Day School.\n\nFor the past six weeks, weather permitting, I have had men digging a well on the site chosen for The Pas school. It has been extremely difficult digging as the soil is very hard clay. There is no well digging equipment in The Pas, or vicinity. So far they are down about 40 Ft., and are just starting to get a small trickle of water. There is about two Ft. of water in the bottom of the well, but I want to be sure that we have sufficient water supply before finally deciding on the site. This is the reason I have not advised you before in this connection. I will wire you immediately, as soon as we have sufficient water supply.\n\nI will secure a Band Resolution, and forward this to the Dept. of Reserves and Trusts, as soon as the site is definitely decided upon.\n\nIn connection with No. 1 in your letter, Northern Mail is the correct name of The Pas paper. I would also suggestion we advertise in the Flin Flon Miner, Flin Flon, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Law\nSupt. Indian Agency.\nJuly 6, 1949.\n\nMr. R.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nFurther to my letter of June 29th in connection with your file 531-5 (E), The Pas Indian Day School.\n\nBefore leaving on my Treaty trip I instructed the office to wire you when sufficient water was obtained at this well, but on my return August 1st I found that they still had not obtained a good enough supply.\n\nAt the present time they are down 55 Ft. and there are two boulders at the bottom that will have to be dynamited. We have stopped the work for the present as we have over expended the sum of $300.00 allowed for this purpose. In order to obtain sufficient water the rocks will have to be removed, more cribbing put in, and possibly a little more digging. When this work is completed I am sure we should have sufficient water to supply the school. It will cost however, another $300.00 to complete this work.

Neary.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWell - Indian Day School, The Pas.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter received from Superintendent Law of the Pas Agency, in connection with the above mentioned subject.\n\nMr. Law suggests building the school before water is located. However, I am not in agreement with him in this matter, as I feel we should have water before building. The Indians have wells on lower ground, which is about 300 yards or more from the school site. These are shallow wells and have plenty of water. I feel that we should dig a well on the lower ground, while water cannot be secured at the present site, I feel reasonably certain we can get it. Will you please advise me in this connection.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAttention: Mr. B. F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nIn connection with the digging of a well for the proposed two room day school on The Pas Reserve, your file 531-5 (E). I regret the delay in advising you further, but I have just returned from my holidays.\n\nUp to the present time $600.00 has been spent on this project. We are down 75 Ft., through clay, with no change of soil. This is about 30 Ft. below river level. There is some seepage but I am not positive that there would be sufficient for the school. There is approximately 6 Ft. of water in the bottom of the well, but some of this would be rain water. There has been a cave in at the bottom, which I think is due to seepage, and in time will possibly increase the flow of water into the well, therefore I do not think we should go to the expense of digging another well at the present time, when I can not give any assurance that sufficient water would be obtained.\n\nI would like very much to have the school built on this location as there is sufficient room for a playground, we would be able to obtain electricity, it is far enough from the highway to be safe for children playing near the school, and it is centrally located on the Reserve.\n\nWould it be possible to proceed with the construction of the school at this location, under these circumstances. If this well does not have sufficient water another well can be dug about 50 yards from the proposed site of the school in lower ground, water from this well, if obtained, would of course have to be carried to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Mr. Carter furnished the required information, and he was informed that the Department was unable to erect a new school on the reserve then, as owing to the war, the funds at its disposal were limited, and he was told that so long as the war lasts they should arrange to transport their children to the two existing schools.\n\nOn referring to the blue print sent Mr. Carter I find that the Indians are located along the Fisher River, running for a distance of about fifteen miles through the reserve, which is twelve miles long. There is one school about two miles from the northern boundary of the reserve and the South Peguis School is about two and a half miles from the southern extremity of the reserve and the two schools are about twelve miles apart by the road.\n\nIt is the wish of the Indians to have a central school for the accommodation of about thirty children, all living within a mile and a half of the proposed site. There would\nwould still be enough children available for the other two schools, as there are about 135 children of school age on the reserve, and this would give about fifty children each for the north and south schools.\n\nThe Indians of this reserve are permanently settled on their locations and need a third school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

T. D. Conlin of Fairford, who, previous to entering the ministry, was a professional teacher in England and formerly taught at the Shoal River Indian Day School, has been appointed as teacher and missionary at Oak River.

T. D. Conlin to carry on the work of teacher to replace Miss Havard. The Department will continue salary to Mr. Conlin at the same rate as was allowed Miss Havard, namely, $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. It is presumed that Mr. Conlin will be prepared to take up his duties as teacher when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on or about the first of September, next.\n\nIt is noted that Miss Havard has been offered and has accepted the position as teacher at the new school on the Peguis Reserve. Her appointment as teacher of this school, which is known as the Peguis Winter School, is approved. Her salary will be at the same rate as was paid her at Oak River.\n\nMr. Agent McDonald, Griswold, is being informed of the approval of the Department of the appointment of Rev. T. D.

Havard, the former teacher on the Oak River Reserve, as teacher of the Peguis Center Indian Day School. The Church authorities state that they have corresponded with you regarding this matter and that Miss Havard has accepted the position.

Sanderson has called in reference to the teachership of the new school on the Peguis Reserve known as the Peguis Centre School and has advised me of your conversation in connection with the suggestion that his son Machray Robert Sanderson be nominated for the post.\n\nMr Sanderson mentioned that it might be thought his son would be too young to be granted this position, but, as Machray would be quite close to The Halfway where I should be able to see him daily and his father the Revd M. Sanderson would be also in a position to advise and admonish him I do not think age should be a serious obstacle to his appointment.\n\nI have known Machray for the past nine years and can truly say that he is a good manly youth of splendid character and promise, and I have great pleasure in making recommendation that he be appointed as teacher of the Peguis Centre School.\n\nI feel quite sure that you will also speak highly of him and you will know his attainments better than myself.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nTo His Grace\nArchbishop Matheson,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nReferring to your letter No. 499840 of the 17th ultimo relative to a teacher for the Peguis Centre School, I respectfully beg to state that I am in receipt of a letter from the Venerable Archdeacon Thomas of the Church of England advising me that Miss R Havard has finally refused to accept the post of teacher in the above named school.\n\nIf no other person has been nominated for this position I beg to recommend that Mr Machray Robert Sanderson, son of the Revd M. Sanderson, the present incumbent in the Peguis Reserve, be given the office with the same remuneration as was offered Miss Havard.\n\nHe has attained to matriculation in Arts in the Manitoba University and is a student of St John's College, Winnipeg.\n\nHis age is 16 which may be considered too young for the post of teacher, but he is very manly and reliable and with the supervision that can be given him I do not think there will be any cause for concern on that score.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter I have written to the Archbishop of Rupert's Land and shall be glad to have a reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, September 15, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant enclosing a copy of a communication which you forwarded to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, in which you recommend that Macray Robert Sanderson be appointed as teacher of the new school on the Peguis Reserve, known as the Peguis Centre School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the applicant is very young for the position, the Department will approve of his appointment temporarily, pending the results which he attains in the work as teacher, providing it is satisfactory to His Grace. As he has no professional qualifications the salary allowed will be at the rate of $500.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. If this is satisfactory you should inform Mr. Sanderson that he should take up his duties as soon as possible. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department of the date on which he begins work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O., Man.\nOttawa, September 15, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Agent Carter recommends that Mr. Macray Robert Sanderson, the son of Rev. M. Sanderson, the present incumbent on the Peguis Reserve, be appointed as teacher of the new school which has recently been completed on the Peguis Reserve, and known as the Peguis Center School. He is only sixteen years of age, but has attained to matriculation in Arts in the Manitoba University and is a student of St. John's College, Winnipeg. The Agent states that Sanderson would be quite close to The Halfway, where he would be able to see him daily, and his father would also be in a position to advise him, and that he does not think his age should be a serious obstacle to his appointment. The Agent has referred this matter to His Grace, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land.\n\nAs it has not been found possible to secure the services of a teacher and the building is ready to open, the Department is approving of the appointment of this young man temporarily, his retention in the position to depend upon the success with which he meets in the work. He is being allowed a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum, with bonus additional, and he is to begin duties as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

I, however, did not draw his attention to your letter 116953-1 of the 17th ultimo, under cover of which I was informed that Miss R. Havard had been previously appointed as teacher of the school in question; but that I have not been notified by the Department of the cancellation of this latter appointment.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, October 7, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the appointment of Machray Robert Sanderson as teacher of the new school on the Peguis Reserve I beg to say that, as stated by the Agent, it was not possible to obtain the services of another teacher at the time. His appointment is only temporary and it is hoped that a qualified teacher will be obtained in the near future by the church authorities to carry on the work.\n\nI may say that Miss R. Havard, who was first offered the position, did not wish to go to the Peguis Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

In view of the fact that this bonus cannot be allowed him, in lieu thereof, his salary will be increased to $650.00 per annum from the date on which he began duties.

Saunderson, father of this young man, has written to me to the same effect.\n\nThe quarter ending the 30th September, is known as the \"short\" quarter, as during this quarter the prescribed statutory mid-summer holidays are given, and it is possible that some deduction may have been made from the quarter's pay for that reason. This young man is student in St. John's College, he is personally defraying the cost of his course, and this apparent loss has inconvenienced him in meeting his expenses. His college record is very fine.\n\nI promised the Archbishop and the father that I would make prompt inquiry about this matter, with a view to having it adjusted, if there has been some mistake, such as is claimed.\n\nI have written to Mr Agent Carter for the particulars of the voucher today.\n\nI would like to be able to convey information to those who have made inquiry, as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOTTAWA, January 30th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to a balance of salary claimed to be due Machray R.

R.T.F.\nOttawa, January 9, 1925.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that the Church of England missionary and the Indian agent living on the Peguis Reserve are extremely desirous of arranging for the education of their children locally. The Department has been asked to arrange, if at all possible, for the services of a well qualified teacher at the Peguis Centre School. I am corresponding with the Provincial Authorities, with a view to securing their assistance because of the nine white children who are living on the reserve. Your Lordship will remember you informed me that Mr. Packer, the teacher of the Peguis South School, has not been giving satisfaction. Would it be possible to transfer Miss Stapleton, the present incumbent at Peguis Centre, to the South School and arrange for a well qualified successor for the coming academic year? Miss Stapleton has been doing good work and, no doubt, would handle the South School satisfactorily.\n\nI should be grateful if Your Lordship would give this question your serious consideration and make a recommendation to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. W. Thomas, D.D.,\nBishop of Brandon,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, January 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am informed that the Indian schools on the Peguis Reserve are placed in your inspectorate and, as a problem has arisen, I am writing for your recommendation if you have already visited the schools in question or for your attention and recommendation if you have not made the inspection to date.\n\nAt the Peguis Centre Indian Day School a Miss Stapleton has been teaching with more or less success since 1921. She is not on particularly good terms with either the Indian agent or the Anglican missionary, both of whom have children of school age. These gentlemen consider her unsatisfactory as a teacher and heretofore they have seen fit to undertake heavy expense to make other arrangements for the schooling of their children. I wish to secure your advice on two definite questions: First, would the Provincial Department entertain a request to establish a school for the nine white children who are living on the reserve? Secondly, are the services of Mr. Packer, the teacher of the Peguis South School, so unsatisfactory that the Department would be warranted in asking for his resignation? We could then, with the approval of the Church of England authorities, who nominate both teachers, arrange for the transfer of Miss Stapleton to the South School where, no doubt, she would do good work as she is well liked by the Indians, and then secure a well qualified teacher for Peguis Centre, to whom the white parents would be glad to send their children.\n\nI should be grateful if you would supplement your inspection reports by a letter to me in respect to the above. If you see fit to spend extra time on the reserve because of this problem, I shall be glad to arrange for added remuneration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames Tod, Esq.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nAshern, Man.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, January 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI understand that the Rev. Mr. Mitten and yourself are not satisfied to send your own children to Miss Stapleton, the present teacher at Peguis Centre. I discussed this question with Archdeacon Thomas, who mentioned it to me last summer; but we were unable to arrive at a happy solution of the problem at that time. I am now writing to the church authorities and to the Provincial Department of Education, with a view to making some changes, and I want certain information which you can best give. Do Mr. Mitten and yourself live close to the Peguis Centre School? Would any financial loss or other hardship be suffered by Miss Stapleton if she were moved to the Peguis South School as successor to Mr. Packer, whose services are not very satisfactory? Is the teacher's residence at the South School in as good condition as her present home? Please consider this letter as confidential for the time being and let me have a full statement relative to these questions at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Stevens, who is interested.\nof the Chief and Council, asked for his removal.\n\nI hardly know at the present moment whether His Grace desires me to continue my active connection with the Indian Day Schools in his Diocese, and on that account together with the fact that Peguis is not a Mission within the Diocese of Brandon, I have, as aforesaid, sent your letter to him. I believe however that it may be arranged for me to have charge of the Indian work in the Diocese of Rupert's Land in addition to that within my own. But in any case the information here given may be of service to you.\n\nI am, with warm regards,\n\nEver sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ferrier Esq.,\nSupt of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nMy dear Mr Ferrier:\n\nI have turned over your letter of recent date respecting the proposed change in the Centre Peguis School, to the Archbishop. It comes within his jurisdiction and in all probability he will attend to the matter himself.\n\nFor your own information, however, let me say that the matter is a very delicate one and that the removal of Miss Stapleton will cause much dissatisfaction amongst the Indians. She is beloved by her pupils and held in high esteem by their parents. I was in the Reserve last Sunday, paid a visit to the Centre School on Monday and found everything most satisfactory. Unfortunately, there exists a feeling of antagonism towards her on the part of the Missionary and the Agent, or to be more correct on the part of their wives, and this is the root of the whole matter.\n\nThere is a misleading inaccuracy in the mention of 9 white children for whom local education is required. The Agent has two, the Missionary six, but of the latter two are being educated in St John's College School at the expense of the Church, one is being educated by the wife of the Teacher at North Peguis, also at the expense of the Church, and two are under school age.\n\nWith regard to Mr Packer, the Teacher at the South Peguis School, the Indians at a recent meeting...\n17th January, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Fernie:\n\nThe Bishop of Brandon, who, at the end of 1924, relinquished his position of General Missionary for my Diocese and has, therefore, no further connection with the work, has handed me your letter regarding the Peguis Centre School. This is the first intimation which I have had of any wish to have Miss Stapleton removed from the position in which she has given and is giving the utmost satisfaction to all concerned. Frankly, therefore, I cannot say that I would be favourable to removing her to the South Peguis School.\n\nI am at a loss also to appreciate the necessity of securing a certificated teacher for the Centre School for the sake of any white children in the vicinity, as I cannot recall a sufficient number of such children to justify it. As you perhaps know, I am Chairman of the Provincial Advisory Board, and while the question of a joint arrangement between the Federal and Provincial Departments has been talked over in the interests of the North Peguis School, where one of our Provincial Schools is in the vicinity, the question of any joint arrangement for the Centre Peguis School has never come before us.\n\nI have heard at different times that Mr. Packer of the South Peguis School was not giving entire satisfaction, and if the Department is not satisfied with his work, I feel\nthat a change should be made, but for many reasons I am confident that the removal of Miss Stapleton would create a very delicate situation.\n\nHoping to hear further from you, and with kindest regards, I am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter #136-6-II of the 9th inst., with reference to the Rev. Mr. Mitten's and my own children not going to Miss Stapleton's school.\n\nWith reference to the first question, the Agency Residence my home is one and a quarter miles from the school. Mr. Mitten's home is a little better than two miles.\n\nQuestion No. 2.\u2014 Miss Stapleton has done some improvements at the Centre Peguis School. 1st, she has erected a hen house with approx. an outlay of between $20.00 & $30.00. She also built a small log storehouse, value $12.00 to $15.00.\n\nThe house at the South Peguis School is not as good as the house at the Centre School. In fact the house at the South School has practically got beyond its usefulness. The sleeping quarters were built by the present teacher, Mr. Packer, on skids, and if he was leaving he no doubt would take it with him.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nM. McCuish\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.T.

I have received a letter from Mr. Commissioner Graham's office making inquiries about repairs to this residence, and if the repairs referred to are carried out, which amounts to approx. $100.00, and a farther expenditure of $70.00 for a lean too kitchen.\n\nThis building would be equally as good as any teachers residence on the Peguis Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nM. McCuish\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.T. Ferrier Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nINSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\nMANITOBA\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have visited the Indian Schools on Peguis and Fisher River Reserves and am now able to reply to yours of Jan. 9th.\n\nThe difficulty on Peguis Reserve comes from the fact that there are seven or eight white children whose parents are resident on this Reserve, and who have to be sent to Winnipeg or elsewhere to be educated. These children are quite young and their parents are experiencing much worry and concern owing to serious and costly illnesses having interrupted the course of their education. If the teachers on the Reserve were qualified there is no reason why these white children should not attend school on the Reserve for a few years until they are better fitted to leave home.\n\nAll the teachers on the Peguis Reserve are earnest, hardworking, and conscientious but not one of them is a qualified, certificated teacher. Two of them, viz., Mr. A.H. Tucker in charge of the South school and Mr. C.R. Harbord, in charge of the North school, have a real system of teaching which they are following with much success. The weakest teacher on this Reserve, measured by actual results, is Miss W.M. Stapleton in charge of the Central school. This is the school at which some of the white children might attend and the fact that it is the weakest one is the kernel and cause of the whole trouble. Miss Stapleton would do well in a Kindergarten or a school of Primary Grades. She seems to have no definite aim or system beyond the work of the first two or three grades and her work falls away from this point. I do not wish to be unkind but I must report conditions as I find them if my report is to be of any real value. I do not wish anything that I may say in this report to be used for purposes of dismissal against Miss Stapleton as she is a fine young woman of excellent moral character, pleasant in manner, neat in dress and habit, kindly in disposition and a conscientious worker, struggling courageously in a not too pleasant environment to make a living for herself and her two adopted children. Miss Stapleton is not to be blamed for this condition of affairs; she tries her best and does a great deal of hard work but she lacks the academic and theoretical training necessary for a successful teacher. Speaking without prejudice the blame rests with the system which appoints unqualified persons to positions where their work is exposed to an inspection which must disclose all its defects.\nThe real solution of the difficulty would be to secure a qualified teacher to teach the white children of the Reserve. I believe that it would be better for the white children to be taught by themselves not from any feeling of superiority but because the educational presentation must differ, the rate of progress must differ, ideals and standards of life must differ; these and health considerations make separate work advisable.\n\nAt present the Anglican missionary obtains a considerable educational grant which pays board and tuition fees for his children in Winnipeg or elsewhere. Why could not that grant be paid to secure a qualified teacher to live on the Reserve and teach his children at home where they could be at all times in the parents charge? It would be possible to secure a qualified teacher for say $600 per annum. This means 10 months teaching. It would be no difficult task for the Indian Agent and the Missionary to obtain a satisfactory building in a locality that would satisfy all. I believe the grant now paid amounts to about $500. The Indian Agent and other white people who might wish to have children educated would have to make up the balance of the salary unless a Special Grant could be obtained from the Dominion Government for this purpose. I know that the grant which the Missionary receives comes from the Anglican authorities over which your Department probably has no control but a recommendation from your Department to the Anglican authorities might assist in securing the change.\n\nThere is little hope of assistance from the Provincial Government in the matter of establishing a school on the Reserve but if it were established with a qualified teacher in charge working under the Regulations of the Dept. of Education of the Province there would then be grounds for asking for the Legislative Grant of 75\u00a2 per day paid to schools by the Provincial Government.\n\nI would recommend that future nominations and appointments of teachers to Indian schools be made from persons who are qualified teachers for the Province in which the school is situated. Teachers holding Third and Second Class Professional Certificates may now be secured for from $750 to $800. It is quite possible to obtain a qualified teacher of the requisite religious denomination so that the Church work will not suffer and the education of the children will be much benefitted.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to say that the schools of the Peguis and Fisher River Reserves are the best Indian Schools that it has been my pleasure to inspect. The Department of Indian Affairs is to be congratulated on the success which is attending their efforts to educate the Indian children on these Reserves.\nA very important factor in the good work being done on these Reserves is the Indian Agent, Mr. McCuish. He has the welfare of the people in his charge very much at heart. He has introduced two valuable innovations into the schools of these two Reserves during the last two years, viz: the Boys & Girls Club Fair, which encourages industrial and educational achievements among the children of these schools, and the introduction of hot lunch material and equipment into all schools in his Reserves. I had the pleasure of his company on my tour of inspection and I found him to be unfailingly kindly, considerate and fair-minded. I am sure that his work and influence must be productive of much good to the people who live on the Reserves under his control.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6243, file 532-1, part 1)\nOttawa, March 20, 1925.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to thank Your Lordship for your letter of January 15th, with reference to the education of the white children on the Peguis Reserve. I awaited a special report from the public school inspector before making any suggestions, and that is why my answer has been so long delayed. I am recommending to Mr. Indian Agent McQuish that a special school for white children be established at some suitable point, that the church grant for the education of the missionary's children be applied towards the expenses, that the Indian agent contribute his share of the costs, and that the Provincial Department of Education be approached and requested for the grant of 75\u00a2 per diem.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have before me now a special report by Public School Inspector James Tod, of 361 Balmoral St., Winnipeg, and I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent McGuish informing him that there will be no changes made at the present time in the Indian schools of the reserve. I am suggesting to our local representative that the Rev. Mr. Mitten and himself use whatever grants are provided for the education of their own children for the establishment of a school for white children only. They will, no doubt, have to provide supplementary funds and could approach the Provincial Department of Education for a per diem grant of 75/.\n\nThe public school inspector informs me that, measured by actual academic results, Miss Stapleton is the weakest teacher on the reserve, but that she has other qualifications which make her services quite desirable. Mr. Tod urges that in future only professionally qualified workers be employed at the day schools. His remarks concerning Mr. Packer, of the South Peguis School, make me hesitate before suggesting that he be replaced. There is system to his pedagogy and considerable success has attended his efforts.\n\nWith best regards, I am,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have now before me a report by Mr. Public School Inspector Tod in this connection and a communication from His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land. There appear to be good and sufficient reasons why we should make no change in our teaching services at the three Peguis schools at the present time. I have given much thought to the best solution for the education of the children of the Anglican missionary and yourself. I believe that you would do well to start a small day school for white children only. The grant which the church allows Mr. Mitten for the purpose of educating his children should be supplemented from his own pocket and from yours and you could apply to the Provincial Department of Education for the per diem grant of 75\u00a2 with some hope of success.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that Mr. Tod speaks highly of your efforts in connection with the Indian schools in the agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have written to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, who is interested in this question, and to Mr. Indian Agent McGuish, recommending that the Anglican missionary and the Indian agent establish a school for the education of their own children and apply to the Provincial Department of Education for the per diem grant. I note your remarks with reference to the three teachers on the reserve, and I realize that professionally unqualified teachers should not be appointed to Indian schools in communities of this kind. I am pleased to learn again of the helpfulness of Mr. Indian Agent McGuish and have informed him that you have spoken highly of his work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I note what you write in regard to the qualifications of Miss Stapleton and also Mr. Packer. I may add that I have no desire to have Mr. Packer removed if he will so conduct the School as to prevent complaints coming to me. With kindest regards, I am,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter #136-6-I of March 20th last, which was a reply to my letters of Jan. 16th & 22nd last, with reference to the teaching service at the Peguis day schools, as they affect the education of the white children on Peguis Reserve, or to be more to the point, my own children, and the children of Mr. Mitten the missionary on this reserve.\n\nI have delayed acknowledging receipt of the above letter until Mr. Mitten had something definite from His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, along the lines suggested by you in your letter, and I am very sorry to say that Mr. Mitten has been unsuccessful in getting any concessions from the Anglican Church towards establishing a white school on Peguis Reserve.\n\nI wish to thank you for the consideration you have given this subject. Considering the method of appointing teachers, it puts the officials of our Department in an awkward position, even though action was justified, and after close on three years associations with the schools of this Agency I am satisfied that a change in the Centre Peguis School, from an educational standpoint, and from the Indian Children's standpoint, is long past due.\n\nI have no personal quarrel with Miss Stapleton, she is enthusiastic, and as a church worker, she has few equals, but as a teacher she has missed her calling, she is unable to control the children in the school, as it costs more to keep this school in windows than the other two schools on Peguis, Fisher River, and Jackhead combined. There are more seats broken, and destroyed in this school, than all the other schools combined.\n\nThe most advanced Indians in my Agency live in the Centre School district, still we find that when pupils get into grade IV it required from three to four years to get them into grade V, simply because the Church of England use their power and privilege granted them of nominating a teacher to pension off their broken down missionaries.\n\nPersonally I am labouring under the great handicap of not having a school education past grade III, and it is my wish that my two boys have a better opportunity for schooling than I have had. This I am duty bound to give them, which I now find I am unable to do, while Indian Agent in this Agency, as I have been very unfortunate with my oldest boy, the only one yet who has attended school, as after coming to Fisher River, I sent him to the Maison Chapple School in Winnipeg. After being there a small time, he contracted Small-Pox. I next sent him to the boys school or St. John's College in Winnipeg, but he was taken down with Pneumonia. I next sent him to Marble Ridge School, when he had to come home with a severe attack of whooping Cough. I will not likely be in the service of the Indian Department, to see the great results that will follow, but I hope the day is not far distant, when the Dept. of Indian Affairs, and they only, shall say, who shall, and who shall not, teach our schools.\n\nThe older Indians' habits are formed, and for better or worse there will be very little change, and the success, and advancement of our Indian race lays with the school children of today, and the generations still unborn. I have found the children of this Agency respon...\nvery kindly to proper guidance. I very much appreciate Mr. Insp. Todd's appreciation of my humble services in connection with our Indian day school. This branch of my work is the greatest pleasure I have.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The salary we will allow will depend upon the qualifications which the teacher engaged possesses. When we have your nomination and particulars regarding qualifications, you will then be informed as to the salary allowed. I shall be pleased if Your Grace will nominate a teacher for the Peguis Centre School at your early convenience, in order that the appointment can be approved and the teacher engaged will be ready to take up duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

However, I shall do my best, though I am just about leaving for my vacation. Miss Stapleton gives such a gruesome account of the flooded conditions of the school premises that I fear that nobody will care to take the position. I may add that she left most reluctantly and only on account of the water around the building and premises generally. She contends that unless some draining scheme is put into operation it will not be possible to occupy the buildings.\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

She is highly recommended by her inspectors.\n\n(2) Miss Fairservice, who at one time taught an Indian Day School at Norway House but who in recent years has been teaching in one or two of our Indian Residential Schools. Her record is thoroughly good in every respect.\n\n(3) Miss Bird, daughter of Dr. J. R. Bird, resident medical officer on the Reserve.\n\nAll these hold Second Class certificates, but I cannot certify as to whether the last named has had any teaching experience or not. Mrs. Hamilton and Miss Fairservice are both willing to occupy the building and live on the spot. Miss Bird prefers to live with her parents at the Agency, about a mile from the School. While I shall be favorable to the appointment of any one of these, I am more confident as to the experience of either Mrs. Hamilton or Miss Fairservice, who know the character of the work they will be going to.\n\nHas Mr. Harbord definitely relinquished the school at the north end of the Mission?

Sir:\n\nIn a recent report from Mr. Agent Templeman, Hodgson, he recommends an exchange of teachers in the Peguis South and Peguis Centre Indian Day Schools. He states that Miss Lee, teacher of the South School, is advanced in years and is deaf, and that there is a large attendance of pupils. He considers that she would perform better service at the Centre School, where the class is smaller and there are more younger pupils. Agent Templeman also states that Miss Wright, teacher of the Centre School, is performing excellent services; is very interested in her work and has the confidence of her pupils. He considers that she would be more suitable to teach higher grades and recommends her transfer to the South School.\n\nI shall be pleased to have Your Grace's concurrence in the exchange of these two teachers for the next school year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Rev.

It is noted that you consider it would be in the interests of the work if Miss Wright, teacher of the Peguis Centre School, was transferred to the Peguis South School, and that Miss Lee, teacher of the last named school, be transferred to the Centre School. You will be advised later when we have the approval of His Grace for the transfer, which, if made, would take effect from the beginning of the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

This school is not as difficult as the South School, and the Department is hopeful that you will be able to give good service there next year. Miss Jennie Wright, formerly of the Centre School, is being transferred to the South School.\n\nHis Grace and Mr. Indian Agent Stevenson have been informed of this transfer. Salary will be allowed at the same rate as last year, viz.: $90 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Ellen Lee,\nTeacher,\nPeguis Indian Reserve,\nHodgson, Man.\nOttawa, July 18, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 10th ultimo, concerning the South and Centre Indian Day Schools on the Peguis Reserve. The Department has decided to transfer Miss Jennie Wright to the Peguis South School, at a salary of $100 per teaching month. Miss Ellen Lee will take over the duties at the Centre School, at her former salary of $90. The Department is telegraphing to Miss Wright at her Winnipeg address and has asked her to inform Miss Lee if she knows her present whereabouts. I am writing to Miss Lee to her address on the reserve, and I should be grateful if you would see that she is informed, if you know her summer address.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. A. Stevenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson,\nMan.\nI received your notice & my transference to the Central School, on my return home, receipt it.\n\nI was stunned on learning the reason from the Archbishop, and cannot understand what kind of a report you have had about it, as my deafness is not of so serious a nature as to interfere with my work; I can hear easily, plain articulation, & it leads me to insist on that, on school.\n\nThe children have made great progress, are interested, and I like them very much, & am very sorry to leave.\nI have had a very happy six months, as I have got to appreciate the people & children, and my luxurious, well appointed house, and I trust my work at the Central will convince you of my ability to teach.\n\nI remain Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEllen Lee\nPEGUIS CENTRE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is taught by Miss Ellen Lee. At the time of my visit there were something like 18 on the roll. The work of the children was fair, and I believe Miss Lee is quite a capable teacher. She, however, is labouring under a great handicap, as she is getting very hard of hearing. Last year she was in the South School, and I am of the opinion that it was a very good plan to move her to Centre School, as the work is much lighter, not having the same number of children to handle. The buildings are in first-class shape here, both the school and teacher's residence having been built in the Fall of 1926.\nPEGUIS CENTRE DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nfrom 1 to 3. I spent considerable time in this school, and I would say that Miss Lee is a fairly good teacher, but she has one handicap - she is very hard of hearing, and I think is gradually growing worse. However, Miss Lee is still doing good work, and takes a great interest in her school and the children. I have no fault to find with the work of the children here.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspect.\nPEGUIS CENTRE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is taught by Miss Ellen Lee. There are good buildings here; the teacher's residence is a bungalow of the same type as I have outlined at the Peguis North Day School, and was erected two years ago. The school is also a frame building and was erected at the same time. It is a little smaller than the North School, but is sufficiently large enough to take care of the children who attend.\n\nThere were 27 children on the register. At the time of my visit, which was a stormy day, there were 20 present, 14 girls and 6 boys. The grades taught are\nI regret to report the teacher Miss Ellen Lee is quite deaf, therefore the general progress is handicapped.\nOTTAWA, July 29, 1932.\n\nMost Rev. Sir:\n\nThe Indian Agent at Hodgson, Man., reports that he visited the Peguis Centre Indian Day School last month and found that the progress being made is not satisfactory, due to the fact that the teacher, Miss Ellen Lee, is quite deaf.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be in the best interests of this school to have a competent teacher in charge, and if it is at all possible to make a change for September 1st, the Department would appreciate such action being taken. I shall be pleased to have Your Grace's nomination in this regard.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMost Rev. I. O. Stringer, M.A., D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land has advised the Department of the resignation of Miss Ellen Lee as teacher of the Peguis Centre Indian Day School. His Grace has nominated the services of Miss Jennie Wright, a former teacher, to succeed Miss Lee. The Department is approving of the appointment of Miss Wright, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10 percent for the current fiscal year. His Grace is being requested to inform Miss Wright and to arrange with her to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nI have to request that you will give Miss Wright any assistance you can in her work and in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Lavender, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nSir:\n\nI have received a copy of Mr. G.W. Bartlett's report in connection with his inspection of Peguis Centre Day School, Fisher River Agency.\n\nIn the \"General Remarks\", he suggests that the teacher be asked to make a list of pupils likely to require clothing for the winter, so that the agencies dealing with this work may have time to deal with such cases before winter sets in.\n\nI do not know if Mr. Bartlett mentioned this fact to Mr. Clarke, the Indian Agent, but I am of the opinion that it was only discussed with the teacher. If such procedure were to be carried out, we would run into a large amount of expense and I doubt if it would greatly improve the attendance. The Peguis Indians are fortunately situated and able to maintain their families equally as well, if not better, than many of the other bands of Indians throughout Manitoba. It would appear as though Mr. Bartlett was not familiar with the circumstances and therefore did not realize what his recommendation would involve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nPeguis Centre Indian Day School\nFisher River Agency\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the above school, which was inspected February 26, 1941:\n\nMiss A. Clarke is in charge, and is doing splendid work. There are 21 pupils enrolled, and on this date 15 were present. The average attendance for December was 18.93. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 10     |\n| 2     | 4      |\n| 3     | 4      |\n| 4     | 2      |\n| 5     | 1      |\n\nThe exercise books showed progress and the work was neatly set down. The pupils are alert, and Miss Clarke has the ability to keep her pupils interested and happy. The children were clean but none too well clothed.\n\nThe interior walls are badly smoked and very gloomy. Someone should be employed to wash the school ceiling. The exterior of the school and residence should be painted this summer. These buildings have not been painted for years and present a disgraceful appearance. The lumber is deteriorating due to weather conditions and lack of painting. A flag is also needed for this school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nK. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to submit the following report on the schools in the Fisher River Agency, inspected during the week of November 17, 1941:\n\nPEGUIS CENTRE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\n\nMiss Alice Clarke is the teacher in charge. She is qualified and understands Indian children. There are 25 pupils enrolled, and 15 were present. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade 1 - 16 pupils\n2 - 4 pupils\n5 - 3 \"\n6 - 2 \"\n\nThe children were alert and apparently keenly interested in their work. They speak out clearly and all book work was neat and tidy. The children were clean but none too well clothed.\n\nThe school is in good condition. The teacher's residence has about 8\" of water in the basement. This water has been pumped out several times but comes in again within 24 hours. This trouble arose after the well was drilled at the school over a year ago. It not only keeps the house damp but apparently is affecting the cement wall as the foundation at one corner is crumbling badly. It looks as though the gravel used in the wall was not free from clay and probably this is why the water has caused it to crumble. It is perhaps too late now to carry out the repair work necessary, but certainly the matter should be attended to next spring.\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the Centre Peguis School, inspected June 18th, 1943.\n\nMiss Alice Clarke is the teacher and she is doing good work. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 12     |\n| 2     | 7      |\n| 4     | 4      |\n| 6     | 5      |\n| 7     | 1      |\n\nThere were 17 present. Some families have left for fishing and some have gone to work in wood camps, consequently the attendance is low.\n\nThe school foundation has cracked some at two corners and there are signs of crumbling. It might be well to have this repaired when the foundation is being built for the school residence. I understand this building is to be placed on a new foundation and the work is to commence shortly. I found the school yard very wet and if the school residence could be moved across the road we would have a much better building site. The land drains to the road and to the river. This land is claimed by one of the Indians and it would perhaps not be possible to get his permission. We would only need about a 60-foot frontage off the one end of his lot. The lot at that point is perhaps 200 feet deep. That is from the road to the river is 200 ft.\n\nI would suggest Mr. Clarke be advised to investigate the possibility of obtaining the new site and report at once as I understand Mr. Gow intends starting work on the residence early in July.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nJune 30, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G.

All the pupils were well dressed and clean in appearance. They appear to be well along in their respective grades and steady progress maintained.\n\nThe interior needs decorating and if possible this should be painted this coming summer.\n\nLast summer both the school and residence were painted outside.

We are prepared to open two new classrooms if we can obtain a teacher for each of them. I would therefore appreciate it if you would give this matter your immediate attention and let me know as soon as possible if there is any possibility of securing two teachers. The new teachers would be under the direction of the teachers at present engaged at these two schools.

The teacherage has been occupied by the clerk of the Indian Agent and consequently the teacher has been forced to obtain accommodation elsewhere. This situation becomes more difficult now in view of the fact that we require two teachers for the School. I would be glad to know if there is any possibility of arrangements being made so that the teachers can occupy the teacherage from September 1st next.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJuly 17, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Clerk's House - Fisher River.\nYour file 21-136, July 10/46.\n\nI called on Mr. Vance yesterday and discussed with him the possibility of obtaining a house.\n\nHe stated he had already exceeded his quota and saw little chance of supplying us a complete house before 1947. Many of the houses under construction are without plumbing and electric wiring. Flooring is scarce and it is almost impossible to get nails.\n\nMr. Vance suggested it might be advisable to put the basement in this fall and be ready for building early in 1947.\n\nIf this suggestion were followed we would need to decide:\n\n1. What type of house we intend building.\n2. A definite plan must be selected.\n\nI might state that basement walls for a prefabricated house might not prove suitable for other construction, therefore, a definite decision must be made.\n\nIt might be advisable to ask Mr. Lazenby to try and arrange accommodation for the two teachers either at the hospital or nurses' home and leave the building program until 1947.\n\nSGD.

Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Clerk's House - Fisher River\n\nAccording to a letter just received from Inspector Hamilton, there is no possibility of securing a prefabricated building as a Clerk's residence at the Fisher River Agency this year. There is a scarcity of flooring, plumbing and electric wiring and it is almost impossible to get nails. The North American Buildings could not provide a house before 1947.\n\nI have asked Inspector Hamilton to write to you on this subject and to take up with you the question of providing accommodation for the teachers either at the hospital or the nurses' home as it would appear that the Clerk will have to occupy the house built for the school teacher until such time as a building can be erected for the Clerk.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 24, 1946.\n\nMr. P.J. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Hodgson, Manitoba,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Most Reverend L.R. Sherman, Bishop of Rupert's Land, in which he states that he is experiencing difficulty in obtaining two teachers for the Peguis Centre School, in view of the fact that the teacher's residence is occupied by the clerk.\n\nI understand the situation. Apparently, it is not possible to provide a residence for the clerk at the present time.\n\nIs there not a possibility of securing suitable accommodation for two teachers if they were appointed? Is there any building that might be rented for the purpose. An immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 14, 1946.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.,\n\nWith reference to the Peguis Centre School, Most Reverend L.R. Sherman, Bishop of Rupert's Land has nominated Miss Annabella Stranger as second teacher.\n\nI understand that Miss Stranger is an Indian.

Neary's letter, File 136-6-1 (W.T.1) of the 24th July, I beg to say that to date I have been unable to make any arrangements for the accommodation of the two teachers for the Peguis Centre School. The former teacher, had a room in the nurses' residence, and cooked her own meals there. At that time, however, we had not a full staff of nurses. By August 22nd, we will have a full staff, and I do not know what room there will be then, if any. The matron of the hospital is at present on her holidays, and until she returns, about August 17th, I will have to leave discussion of the matter in abeyance. Apart from the nurses' residence, there is no other building of any sort available where the teachers can be accommodated.\n\nI have been writing to Inspector Hamilton in this matter also, and after I have had opportunity to discuss the matter with the hospital matron, I will write further.\n\nP.G.

The hospital matron has now returned from her holidays, and on further discussion with her and the doctor, it seems impossible to accommodate any teachers at either the nurses residence or the hospital. There will be a full staff of nurses occupying the home when another nurse arrives tomorrow, August 22nd. At the hospital, (where there is an increasing number of patients), the help there is now occupying all the available space. Apart from the above mentioned, there are no other buildings within reasonable distance of the school, where teachers could make a home. I may also say that even if living at the hospital or the nurses residence, the teachers would have over a mile to walk to school every day. Miss Alice Clarke, the previous teacher used to do this, and enjoyed it, but all girls are not like that, and I have my doubts that they might stay very long, having to do that walk every day in all kinds of weather. This is an unfortunate situation, but I have done the best I can in the matter, but without any success. Will you please advise me what the Department decides to do regarding the two teachers that have been appointed for this school.\n\nUp to the present time, I have not been advised of any appointment made for any teachers at the Peguis South School.\n\np.t.o.\nIf it should be decided, in view of the foregoing, that the Peguis Centre school will have to remain closed, might the two teachers that have been appointed to this school, be given the Peguis South school, where there is a teacher's residence available.\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 26, 1946.\n\nDear Archbishop Sherman:\n\nWith reference to your previous communications nominating two teachers for Peguis South school I regret that living quarters are not available for them at this point.\n\nThe Department allowed the Clerk to use the teacher's residence in the hope that we would be able to construct a residence for him during the summer of 1946-47; however, it has been found impossible to do so.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we are advising Indian Agent Lazenby to place Miss Annabelle Stranger and Miss Kathleen Jeffrey at the Peguis Centre School for the coming academic year 1946-47. There is living accommodation for them at the Peguis Centre School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Reverend L.K.

However, an estimated 60 rural schools in the province will be unable to operate because of the acute shortage of teachers, Deputy Education Minister A. B. Ross said recently.\n\nMr. Ross pointed out that the teacher shortage is not a situation peculiar to Saskatchewan alone, but that most of the other provinces in the Dominion are having similar difficulties.\n\nThe plan, which was worked out by government officials and the principals of the normal schools in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon, provides that rural schools with enrolments of 13 or more will be staffed with normal school students. If student teachers are still available, schools with enrolments of 12 will also be staffed.\n\nSchools which are unable to secure the services of normal school students may adopt one of two alternatives. They may arrange to have their students attend one of the nearby schools already staffed with teachers; or, arrange to have lessons supplied through the government correspondence school. The department of education will pay all costs of supplying courses and of having them marked by competent instructors in the correspondence school.\n\nIt is expected that students attending the college of education may be available on or about May 1, for those schools still without teachers. In such cases, arrangements may be made at the discretion of the local school board to have the school in operation during the summer months.\n\nCoolican Takes Over Swift Current Post\n\nREGINA.\u2014P.

Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 26th instant, enclosing a letter from Miss Stapleton, Teacher of the Peguis Centre Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department has instituted a change in the method of paying day school teachers. In the past four equal quarterly payments were made - in the future we will pay at the end of each quarter, but on the basis of the teaching months. Heretofore Miss Stapleton has received, in addition to the bonus, four payments of $152.50 during the year. Her salary for this year will be paid as follows:\n\nEnd of September quarter ....... $ 65.\n\" December \" ........ 125.\n\" March \" ........ 125.\n\" June \" ........ 125.\n\nin other words, on the basis of $65 per teaching month.\n\nI wish to assure Your Grace that I realize this may work a hardship, this fall, on the teachers who have to arrange their personal finances with care, and I have instructed that advances on the December and March quarter earnings be made whenever a teacher intimates a difficult situation because of lack of funds. A cheque for $100 is being directed, under today's date, to be deposited to Miss Stapleton's account at the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Winnipeg. This advance will be deducted from her salary for the December and March quarters.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of this letter, which can be directed to Miss Stapleton, under cover of Your Grace's. Her communication, also, is attached.\n\nI am,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl.\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.

In this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Approval granted appointment Miss Wright teacher Peguis Centre School. Arrange with her to begin duties early date.\"\n\nThe salary allowed her will be at the same rate as was to be allowed if she taught at the South School, viz. $90 per teaching month.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher's residence at the Centre School is ready and that there are enough furnishings on hand so that the teacher can take up residence. You have already been authorized regarding obtaining the furnishings for the residences at both the Centre and South Schools.\n\nPlease advise the Department of the date on which Miss Wright begins duties at the Centre School.\n\nWe are informed by His Grace that he expects within a few days to nominate a teacher for the Peguis South School.\n\nH. Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson,\nMan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

His Grace recommends that, as it was through no fault of her own that she was unable to commence teaching on her arrival, salary be allowed her. The Department will allow Miss Wright salary from the date she arrived at the school, and I shall be pleased if you will inform her accordingly. When she prepares a return for the current quarter, it should be definitely stated thereon the date upon which she arrived to take up duties. It is hoped that the building at this point will be ready by the beginning of the new year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.

II71-II72 submitted for materials for the erection of the Peguis Centre School and teacher's quarters.\n\nThese two vouchers exceed the estimate as sent you for the whole work and is an error on my part, due to the continual advance in materials and labour. My figure of $1500.00 submitted upon the yearly estimate last fall would have been closer to the correct cost.\n\nI have stopped the work on the Peguis Centre school pending your further instructions as the Indians will not work for less than .50\u00a2 per hour as those who have any knowledge of carpenter work have been receiving that sum during the past winter at Hodgson.\n\nLumber could not now be bought for the price shown upon the above vouchers and dealers refuse to quote, stating that they are not safe in giving any figures on anything they have not in stock.\n\nWith muskrats selling at $5.00 and $6.00 each, the Indians treat with contempt any offer of work at .30\u00a2 per hour. It would perhaps be as well to obtain offers from the Indians to complete the work required to erect the school and teacher's quarters for a stated sum.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant\n\nY.H.

The Department is unable to make this order direct, as you have not given shipping directions.\n\nIn reference to the box stove and stove pipes required I have to request that you will obtain prices from a number of dealers and purchase a suitable stove and the necessary pipes for the school from the firm quoting you the lowest price. You should forward proper certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for this purpose, with the quotations received by you from the various dealers whom you asked for a price.\n\nYou should give these matters your early attention, in order to have these supplies at the school when it is ready to open.\n\nYou should also take steps to secure a properly qualified teacher and, if such is secured, the Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 during the period it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.

It would appear that twenty single adjustable desks with fronts and rears for the same were obtained, instead of the type of desks you were authorized to order and the price charged therefor is very much in excess of that asked for the double desks.\n\nBefore this account can be paid it will be necessary for you to furnish full explanations as to why you did not carry out the Department's instructions.

It means milking outside in all weathers at present. I do not think it would mean much expense for there are plenty of logs lying idle at the Indian agency here (cut for families that did not come up from Selkirk.) We are also urgently needing a well. This spring the whole river ups & downs for a mile on other side of us.\nis now fenced off from us. \u2014\nAnd we are the only ones\nliving this side of the road\nwithin that distance. \u2014 And\nit means our cow will be\nfound a mile North or South\nof us in her search for water\nnight & morning \u2014 when we\nwant to milk her. \u2014 And for\nourselves it is a great labour\nto have to carry up sometimes\nas many as fifteen pails of\nwater from the river on\nthe other side of the road,\nto water the garden & washing\nday. \u2014 And when we do get it\nit is very muddy, as\nit is a clay bank trodden down\nby the cattle, nearest to us.\nBesides one does not like\ntrespassing on the kindness\nof a neighbour, \u2014 for ourselves\n+ the school children to be always going thro' his fence to fetch water. Besides it is scarcely safe for the smaller children to be playing down there, midday & recess times out of my sight, on the pretext of getting a drink of water.\n\nWe have gone to much expense already over the place here; for we were obliged to build a lean-to of rough lumber covered with black paper at the expense of $50 dollars. For a summer kitchen, as the tiny shack of 14 x 18 feet got too hot to have the kitchen stove in, in summer, & we were so cramped for room, we had to have meals in the\nSo had to build. I don't think we can afford to do any further to it. But lined & ships - slaped, it could be made a pleasing permanent addition to this tiny residence for winter use too.\n\nAlso we were told by the temporary agent that it was up to the teacher to provide for the inside fencing when the school fence was put up. So I had to pay 4 dollars more for a load of fence poles to have my garden fenced off from the play ground. And as the Indians employed by the agent said he had finished all he was told to do. When he had put a heavy tripole for a gate. I had to pay him to put a small gate from the\nroad into the playground, as I could not myself scarcely lift out the heavy loops every time I wanted to go in & out. So I was sure the little children could not do it, but would climb the fence every time. So naturally the small gate I paid for is used by the school children all the time. And as a pole fence is useless to keep dogs & chickens off a garden, on which we have spent much time & labor in order to have vegetables next winter, I had to go to a further expense of ten dollars for two rolls of wire to protect the garden. The children's gardens are unprotected in this respect & have to take their chance. But I see that the south\nSchool on this Reserve has both a barn & a lean-to to the Teacher's residence there. There is no cellar either, so we two women are doing our best to dig one, but it is hard work\u2014digging & carrying out a pailful of earth at a time. But we will have to have one to store our winter supply of potatoes etc. & to keep our milk & butter in the well we have dug so far towards it, right now, this hot weather.\n\nTrusting the I.D. may see their way to helping us.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Deaconess) W.H. Stapleton\n(Teacher)\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose a letter which I received from Miss Stapleton which speaks for itself. I really think that her request should be granted, especially in the matter of a well and a small stable for her cow. When I visited the Reserve the other day I found that these teachers are doing exceedingly good work, and that the attendance, especially at the North and Central schools, is better than it has ever been in the past. The children, also, appear to be greatly interested in their work.\n\nNow that we have good teachers in these schools it is most important that we should do all in our power to retain them, and they cannot be retained unless they have comfortable quarters. As a result of my experience as Chairman of the Provincial Board of Education I find that it is essential, in the foreign districts, to furnish quarters which are satisfactory. Hoping that your Department will take up the request favorably, and with kindest regards, I am,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, June 26, 1922.\n\nMost Reverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 19th instant, enclosing a communication from Miss Stapleton, Teacher of the Centre School on the Peguis Reserve, in which she requests that a small stable be erected and a well drilled.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that we are requesting Mr. Agent McGuish, who has been recently appointed to take charge of the Fisher River Agency, to furnish an estimate of the cost of building a stable and drilling a well and any other work which the teacher desires to have carried out in order to make conditions at this school as comfortable as possible for her.\n\nThe Department is aware of the need of wells at all the schools on the Peguis Reserve, but, owing to the cost involved, we have been unable to provide the amount necessary to have the work done. We will, however, do our utmost to have a well drilled at the Centre School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the teachers on the Peguis Reserve are doing good work, that the attendance is better than it has ever been in the past and that the children are beginning to take more interest in their work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMost Rev. S.P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 26, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land has forwarded a communication to the Department from Miss Stapleton, Teacher of the Centre School on the Peguis Reserve, in which she requests that a log stable be erected. She states that it is necessary for her to keep a cow to provide milk, and that a stable or barn is needed. She further states that she does not consider the putting up of a suitable stable would entail much expense, as there are plenty of logs lying idle at the agency, which could be used for the purpose.\n\nI have to request that you will state the cost of having a small log stable erected and if there are any suitable logs on hand which could be utilized. The Department is anxious to provide this building, in order that the teacher can keep a cow during the coming winter. It is considered that a barn or stable, suitable for the purpose, could be erected at very little expense, having in view the utilizing of the logs which the teacher states are available.\n\nMiss Stapleton also states that a well is urgently required, as facilities for obtaining water from the river are most unsatisfactory. The question of providing wells for each of the schools on the Peguis Reserve was under consideration by the late Agent, Mr. Carter, but owing to the expenses involved in drilling them, no action was taken in the matter. I have to request that you will furnish your views as to the best means of having a well drilled at the Centre School, and state approximately what you consider the cost would be. Please state if a well drilling outfit is available and if tenders could be obtained from a number of persons having this equipment for the drilling of a well. You should give as full information as possible regarding the best method to be used in having a well drilled.\n\nThe teacher further states that she has gone to much expense in having a lean-to put up for a summer kitchen. This was built of rough lumber, covered with black building paper, and she states it should be ship-lapped, which would make it a permanent addition to the residence. Please state what it would cost to complete this lean-to; and, if Miss Stapleton can furnish itemized accounts in duplicate, covering the amount she herself has expended, the Department will consider reimbursing her for the expenditure she has already incurred. If she can furnish these accounts, you should certify and forward them to the Department, when consideration will be given to the payment.\n\nM. McCuish, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent\nThe Halfway P.O.,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6243, file 532-5, part 1)\nIt is further stated by the teacher that the fencing which has been done is not satisfactory, and that she had to spend an additional amount of $10.00 for 2 rolls of wire to protect the garden. I will be pleased if you will inquire into this matter and submit a report as to what should be done so as to furnish protection for the garden at this school. Any other repairs required by the teacher, so as to make the conditions at this school comfortable should be stated, and the approximate cost of the work should be given.\n\nI have to request that you will visit this school at an early date, inquire into all the above matters and furnish the Department with a full report, stating your views as to the best means of having any work which you would recommend carried out, and the approximate cost of the same. We will expect an early report from you regarding these matters.\n\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land is being informed that you have been requested to report on the above matters mentioned by the teacher in her letter to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter #136-65 of June 26th, I wish to report that I visited Miss Stapleton at Centre School Peguis Reserve & inquired into the various different matters mentioned in your letter.\n\nRe the Stabel twelve feet wide sixteen feet long seven feet high using an eight foot rafter by using the logs & shingles, which we have on hand at the Agency leaving the sheathing on roof & nails to be bought in town the stabel completed would cost approximately eighty five dollars work included.\n\nRe well for School Centre School Peguis \"I quite agree with Miss Stapleton that a well required, at this School, there is only one well drilling outfit in this district, owned by one Mr. Beards at Fisher Branch his price is four dollars per foot he finds everything the only basis I can take for an estimate of the cost would be from the well here at the Fisher river Agency is one hundred & fifty seven feet deep at four dollars per foot would be six hundred & twenty eight dollars.\n\nRe lean to for Summer Kitchen to complete this building I would recommend shingling the walls using the shingles from this Agency which it would take about two & a quarter thousand with an additional ten dollars for fever board & would make a very comfortable building Miss Stapleton will furnish limited amounts in duplicate covering the amount she herself has expended.\n\nRe lean fencing I inspected the fence mentioned & find the ten dollars for the two rolls of chicken wire was required to protect her garden from dogs & cattle belonging to the band on this reserve.\n\nThe plaster of the School building needs repairing in a few places which could be done at the same time as the School stable is being done.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOTTAWA, July 25th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, furnishing an estimate of the cost of building a stable at the Peguis Centre School.\n\nIt is noted that by using the logs and shingles which are on hand at the Agency, and purchasing the sheeting for the roof and the nails required, this stable could be completed at a cost of approximately $85.00. I have, therefore, to request that you will make the necessary arrangements to have this stable erected. It should be of the dimensions mentioned by you, viz: 16' long, 12' wide and 7' high with an 8' rafter. You may purchase the sheeting for the roof and the nails required. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers, and the material required over and above that on hand should be purchased from the dealer quoting the lowest price.\n\nRegarding the drilling of a well, I beg to say that, owing to the cost involved, we are unable to authorize this work at the present time. Our funds for Indian education are limited, and have been assigned, and we will have no money available for the drilling of a well. The teacher will have to arrange to obtain the water required from the river.\n\nRegarding the building of a summer kitchen to the teacher's residence, I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work carried out. You may use the shingles required, which are on hand at the Agency, and you may purchase any other material required, in order to complete this summer kitchen and make a satisfactory job of the work. It will be necessary to obtain competitive prices in making all purchases of the material.\n\nYou should arrange for competent labour in the erection of both the stable and the summer kitchen.\n\nThe plaster in the school building should be repaired when the other work is being done.\n\nWhen all this work has been completed, you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material required, as well as labour returns, in duplicate, for the labour employed. You should also attach a memorandum showing the names of the firms asked to quote a price and the prices quoted.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher will furnish accounts,\n\nM.

BARTLETT, PROVINCIAL SCHOOL INSPECTOR, ON HIS REPORT OF INSPECTION OF THE PEGUIS CENTRE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 136-6-6.\n\n\"Floor unsupported. Very shaky. This is a comparatively new building and should be in good condition. Interior should be finished in light color on account of the light requirements.\n\nI would once more urge the value of \"family\" drinking cups, and two towels for each family of pupils, as tending to prevent the spread of skin, mouth, and eye diseases, and inculcating hygienic ideas\".\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham in a letter dated January 4/23 commenting on the Inspector's remarks, states:\n\n\"The Inspector draws attention to the fact that the floor is unsupported and shaky, and points out that the building is comparatively new. He suggests that the interior painting should be of a lighter color. I think the flooring and the painting should be done next Spring; nothing can be done at the present time.\n\nThe Inspector refers to family drinking cups and two towels for each family. This was referred to in the reports on the other schools in this Agency and should be carried out\".\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inclose herewith Requisition received\n\nThe teacher Peguis Centre School, for school supplies.\n\nThis school has A good hard wood floor I can not recommend laying A new one on top.

A football will be ordered and forwarded from here.\n\nYou may purchase an inexpensive ladder of sufficient length to reach the roof of the school building. No undue expenditure should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the cost of the ladder.\n\nRegarding the floor, I beg to say that Mr. Bartlett, Provincial School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of this school, states regarding the conditions of the school building, as follows:\n\n\"Floor unsupported. Very shaky. This is a comparatively new building and should be in good condition. Interior should be finished in light color on account of the light requirements.\"\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham, in forwarding this report, states that the floor should be repaired and placed in good condition and the painting done next spring. We note that you do not recommend laying a new floor on top of the present one, but that supports are required. As soon as weather conditions permit you should arrange to have posts with proper supports placed under the floor, in order to prevent it springing. We note that you estimate this work at $10. This matter will be left in your hands to have the necessary repairs made in the spring, and the work should be done as cheaply as possible.\n\nYou should also furnish a report as to the cost of having the interior painted a lighter color and if it is decided to have this work done it can be carried out at the time the repairs to the floor are being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6243, file 532-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor Copy\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters 136-5-5 of the 15th inst., letter 136-6-5 of the 16th inst., and letter 136-4-5 of the 17th inst.\n\nIn reference to improvements to the North, Centre, and South Indian Day Schools on the Peguis Reserve, and in reply would recommend that Mr. Inspector Bartlett's recommendations as to improvements at each school be adopted as I am unable to offer any suggestions for any further improvements.\n\nReferring to the floor of the North School acting on instructions contained in letter 136-4-5 dated Dec 14th 1922 I had a new floor laid in this school, for which the voucher was issued on Jan the 4th.\n\nFor making the alterations to the windows in the North School I would estimate the cost at twenty dollars and for washing and whitewashing the ceiling at seven dollars, with reference to the South School for laying new floor, washing and whitewashing the ceiling and rearranging the windows at forty dollars; the Centre School estimated cost of supporting the floor, washing and whitewashing the ceiling at fifteen dollars; the windows in this school are also on the North and the South which has the same evil effect as in the other schools, and I would recommend that the North windows be closed up, and an additional window be put in the South side. For the ceilings in all the three schools I would recommend whitewash in preference to paint for the work can be performed better by an amateur than painting, also it would be cheaper to give it a fresh coat each year, at the same time the interior is being whitewashed. Any new material required for any of the above work with the exception of lime and nails can be furnished from stock in store at the Agency.\n\nAs the South School is the most urgent I beg to suggest that this work be done during the Easter Holidays.\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of letter 136-5-5 of the 15th inst. referring to towels and drinking cups for use in the Indian Bay Schools this suggestion is well taken, and with the co-operation of the teachers this should prove very beneficial, and I have more than once remarked to the teachers that the single towel and drinking cup was an up-to-date disease risk. I have asked all our local stores for tenders on 8\u00bd dozen cups and 8\u00bd dozen pairs of towels. All of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. McCuish,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 7, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the improvements required to the schools on the Peguis Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the Centre School, it is noted that you estimate the cost of supporting the floor, washing and whitewashing the ceiling would be approximately $15.00. You may take the necessary action, during the coming Easter holidays, or as soon as weather conditions permit, to have the floor put in a good state of repair by placing proper supports underneath. It is considered that the ceiling and the interior of this building should be whitewashed. The windows on the north side may be closed up and an additional window put in on the south side of the building.\n\nAll the above work should be completed as cheaply as possible. We note that you can supply all the materials needed, with the exception of the lime and nails. These, you may purchase and have delivered, also, if necessary, a window frame and glass for the window on the south side.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, for the expenses incurred at this school, separately from any work performed at the other schools. Also, in your correspondence in future each school should be dealt with in a separate communication.\n\nWe note that you are calling for tenders for the supplying of drinking cups and towels, as recommended by the Public School Inspector. When these have been purchased, please arrange to have them delivered to each of the schools on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. McCuish Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Halfway P.O., MAN.\n\nJ.

W. McLean\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter #136-6-5 of the 4th inst., with reference to the requisition from the Peguis Centre School of the 20th ultimo.\n\nThe screen doors and screen windows, two hoses, two rakes and two rolls of chicken wire will be purchased and delivered to the school.\n\nThe school garden has been ploughed.\n\nThe teacher informs me she would rather calcalmine inside the house herself, than be bothered with a man. The approximate cost, therefore, would be 5 or 6 dollars for calcalmine and brush.\n\nThe cost of digging the vault and erecting an outside closet, by supplying the material from the Agency would be for labour and nails, approximately $7.00. I would recommend that this be allowed.\n\nI do not feel justified in recommending the outside of the residence be painted, for the reason, that the residencies of the other two teachers on the Reserve, are not painted. There has been more money expended on improvements at the Centre School, than the other two schools combined during the past 10 months and the repairs to the Fisher River Day School are going to be a heavy drain, on the funds for Indian education, this year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst.

It is noted that by supplying the material from the agency, the cost of the labour and nails would be approximately $7. You should arrange to have this work done at an early date.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the painting of the teacher's residence cannot be approved at the present time, owing to the expense required to complete repairs at the other schools in the agency, and this work will have to stand over until next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Kindly advise me as to this as soon as possible, as the time is getting short, especially for plowing a garden.

In connection with requisitions for school supplies, I have to inform you that these should be forwarded by you to the Department direct. It is not necessary that they should go through the office of the Indian Commissioner.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity of garden seeds which you consider necessary.

Regarding the ploughing of the school garden, you should arrange to have this done as soon as possible, not only at this school, but at any of the others in your agency where it is required. It is considered that this work should be done by some of the Indians, without charge, as it is in the interests of their children that a garden be conducted.

She states that she has advised the medical officer as to the attention that should be given in each case.\n\nMiss Brandon recommends that a drum be attached to the stove pipes in each of the schools on the Peguis Reserve, as this would provide a more regular and even heat and would greatly assist in getting the rooms heated and keeping them in that condition. If you consider that the arrangement suggested by the Nurse would be of benefit in keeping the schools warm, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a drum for the stove pipes in each school.\n\nMiss Brandon has also suggested that, if possible, a hot drink be provided to the pupils of each of the schools during the noon hour, especially during the severe cold weather, as so many of them come from a distance. If the teachers will arrange to prepare and serve a hot drink, and if they have facilities for doing so, you may purchase a small quantity of cocoa, tea and sugar, also 1 dozen granite-ware mugs and a large saucepan for preparing the cocoa. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and you should purchase the quantity of materials required in the preparation of the hot drink sufficient to last for each school during the balance of the winter or until the end of April, next, only. Please consult the teachers as soon as possible and, if they will prepare and serve this hot drink, you should purchase the supplies required. The children could, no doubt, bring any milk required from their homes. The Nurse states that the pupils each carried a noon day lunch which was quite a credit to the Indian parents.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear later as to the arrangements you have been able to make regarding the serving of a hot drink at noon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

In September, 1926, I wrote to Regina for authority to carry out mudding and whitewashing of all schools but letter was overlooked at the Commissioner's office and, when authority was received, the winter had set in and it was then too late to carry out the work.\n\nI have gone over the building thoroughly and beg to recommend that it be sheeted inside with V-joint. The seating will be required only on the walls as the school has already a V-joint ceiling. It will require approximately 1500 ft. of V-joint and the cost of this material will be about $90.00. It will also take about 500 lineal feet of 1 x 2 firing on which to nail V-joint, cost of which will be about $10.00. The wall on one side of the building is buckling slightly and I would further recommend that this be strengthened by placing a 4 in. tim rod across the building. The total cost of all this work inclusive of labour will be in the neighbourhood of $200.00. May authority be granted to have the work carried out?\n\nWith reference to the statement of the Inspector that the school is not kept in a tidy condition, I beg to advise that this is no fault of the teachers. The care and arrangement of school furniture is good and the school is well scrubbed once each month. The dilapidated condition of the walls and the chinking falling out on the floor contributes towards giving the schoolroom an untidy appearance. In addition, the school is situated close to a swamp and, during the greater part of the present spring, the school grounds have been under water.\n\nI would also recommend that V-joint be painted white after it is put on, that the outside of the school building be re-chinked and whitewashed, and that toilets be moved and new vaults dug. An additional $25.00 will cover this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs Indian Agent,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the repairs required to the Peguis Centre School building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the interior walls of this building sheeted with V-joint, and the wall which has buckled strengthened by placing a 3/4\" tie rod across the building. The V-joint should be painted white after it is put on, and the outside of the building rechinked and whitewashed. The toilets should be moved to another location and new vaults dug.\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of all material required after obtaining competitive prices if possible, and you should make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should also arrange for the labour in having the work done, and you should see that it is performed in a satisfactory manner. This work should be carried out during the present summer holidays, and when completed, you should forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of all material and for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I would refer to your letter of the 27th ultimo in which you state that, as the school is situated close to a swamp, the grounds have been under water. I have to request that you will state whether it would not be possible to provide drainage facilities for the school premises. You should state the best arrangements to carry out regarding the drainage and the approximate cost of any work which you would recommend be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Templeman, B.M.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nSir,\n\nRe Drainage,\nPeguis Centre School.\n\nReplying to your letter #136-6-5 of July 12th past with reference to drainage of the grounds of the Peguis Centre School, I beg to advise that I have delayed action in this matter for the reason that, up until the present, the condition of the ground rendered it impossible to work with a team and scraper in digging the necessary ditch to drain the grounds. To carry off the water will take a large ditch and digging by hand would be an expensive operation.\n\nI have had Mr. Patterson, Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Branch, who is up here on the matter of drainage possibilities of the Peguis hay meadows, survey a ditch for drainage of the grounds at the Peguis Centre School and take the necessary levels. The ditch will require to be 600 ft. long, this distance being the full length of the fence on the north side of the school property, with an average depth of 3.3 ft. and, at its eastern end, will be a hand dug lateral following the eastern fence of the school property the length of which will be determined when water is flowing through the land ditch. The southern side of the school property is on high ground, therefore, it will not be necessary to dig a ditch on that side.\n\nThe ditch will be 8'6\" wide at the top and 2' wide at the bottom, giving an average width of 5.3' for the purposes of calculation of yardage of soil to be excavated. The cubic yardage is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.3 \\times 5.3 \\times 600}{27} = 385.4 \\text{ cu. yds}\n\\]\n\nequals 385.4 cu. yds for purpose of estimate of cost.\n\nI would estimate the cost at about $20 per yard which would make the total cost approximately $80.\n\nThe ground is now dry and fit for working and I would recommend that the work be carried out as soon as possible. Without this ditch, there will be trouble from flooding every spring and after all heavy rains. Drainage will also remove the unpleasant stagnant odour from the swamp which permeates the school buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Winestock, Hodgson, Manitoba, for material for repairs, painting, etc., Peguis Centre School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 136-6-5 dated Ottawa, July 6, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nSir,\n\nRe Repairs - Peguis Centre School.\n\nReference your letter of authority of July 6th past, I beg to enclose herewith the undernoted vouchers covering the abovesated expenditure incurred under the quoted authority:\n\n| Voucher No. | Description          | Amount |\n|-------------|----------------------|--------|\n| 165         | Lumber, paint, etc.   | 103.30 |\n| 168         | Labour               | 67.50  |\n| 169         | Labour               | 21.75  |\n| 170         | Labour               | 15.60  |\n| 171         | Sundry Expenditure   | 21.50  |\n\n$229.65\n\nIn detail, the work carried out on the school was as follows:\n\nA dado, 4 ft. high, was built around the walls of the school with quarter-round at bottom of dado and 4 x 4 cove and 3 in. ledge at top. It was the original intention to sheet the whole log wall with V-joint but, in view of the fact that upper logs were very uneven in surface and would require to be reshingled before putting on V-joint - a slow and expensive task - it was decided that the dado was preferable. The intervening log wall between the top of the dado and the ceiling was well chinked and whitewashed. Seven window frames were taken out, resawn and repaired and replaced and also two door frames. Two blackboards were also reframed. A part of the floor was taken up and new floor supports were put in and floor relaid. Posts of the ceiling, which was falling, were re-nailed. A platform was built at the end of the school for the teacher's desk, the size being 6 x 16 feet, and a cupboard was also built - size 1\u00bd x 4 x 6 for books and school material. Posts were palced on outside walls of building and a truss rod from these posts across the inside of the school - this to prevent further buckling of the log walls. All broken school desks were repaired and exterior of building was resmeled and whitewashed. Interior woodwork was painted - pearl grey with darker shades of grey on mouldings and window and door frames. Interior of school porch was also painted. All toilets were moved and repaired and new vaults dug and these together with stable, were well whitewashed. In addition all weeds and grass was cut on the enclosure surrounding the school.\n\nI may say that the dado has made a considerable improvement in the appearance of the school and I would recommend that the interior of the Peguis North and Peguis South Schools be improved in the same manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman, Indian agent.\nOttawa, October 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a voucher covering the cost of the repairs to the Peguis Centre Indian Day School, and stating in detail the work carried out at the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the accounts submitted by you have been paid. The Department is pleased with the work that has been done.\n\nWith reference to your request that the interior of the Peguis North and Peguis South Schools be improved in the same manner, I beg to say that this work will have to stand over until next spring, as there are no funds at the present time to carry out these repairs. You may draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, when consideration will then be given to authorizing you to have the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

On the last 150 feet of the ditch \u2014 the upper inlet portion \u2014 water was struck at a depth of 1 foot and the ditch was dug on this portion to a depth of only 18 inches. The stickiness of the soil and the difficulty in cleaning scrapers at this depth made the task a slow and difficult one and would have incurred considerable expense. Under these circumstances, I stopped the work. I anticipate that, when the snow melts in the spring, the force of water running in the upper portion of the ditch will cause considerable cutting and increase its depth. I have left a number of ridges in the upper portion to cause rapids when the water runs, which will, I think, have the effect of causing considerable cutting.\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, given a dry fall, the ditch can be deepened\u2014 if necessary, and the lateral dug. In any case, the ditch as it is at present, will have the effect of keeping dry that portion of the ground in the vicinity of the residence and school which has always in the past been a swamp.\n\nI may inform you that the above-stated ditch is that shown by Mr. Paterson, Engineer of the Water Power & Reclamation Branch, Department of the Interior, on his plan accompanying report on drainage of the Peguis Hay Meadows, marked as 3B in Area No. 3.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The\nroll called for 24. I believe the attendance at this\nschool is much improved and I have no doubt that with the\npresent teacher, we will see a still further improve-\nment.\n\nThe grades are all low, from 1 to 3.\nHowever, the children appeared well along in their work.\nThe reading was fair, spelling and arithmetic good. Their\nexercise books were tidy. I believe these children will\nshow advancement under Miss Fairservice.\n\nThe children were quite well clothed and\nwere all clean, with their hair nicely combed. They were\nvery respectful and the discipline was excellent. All\nchildren were kept busy, whether up in class or otherwise.\n\nThis school is built of logs and each year\nrequires a great deal of repair. It was nicely white-\nwashed and consequently appeared quite cheerful.\n\nThe residence provided for the teacher might\nwell be called a \"shack\". There are only two rooms habit-\nable in the winter. The lean-to additions are of little\nuse, even in the summer, and certainly do not add to its\nappearance. I believe a new residence could be built quite\nreasonably.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nPEGUIS CENTRE SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nreasonably, and it would certainly be an inducement to hold a good, qualified teacher. At present this house needs painting outside, but I think it a mistake to put any further expense on such a building.\n\nMiss Fairservice has recently come to this school. She is a qualified teacher with experience and certainly appears to understand her work. I believe we will see good work carried on and I have no doubt, when next inspected, the results from Miss Fairservice's efforts will be evident.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., December 12th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Fisher River Agency, which were visited by Mr. Inspector Hamilton in November.

Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nSir:\n\nRe: Well - Peguis Centre School.\n\nIn the Estimates for the present Fiscal Year I placed an item of $200.00 for the purpose of drilling a well at the Peguis Centre School. This well is essential as, at present, the Teacher has to get her drinking water from the river or from the old well on the property.\n\nThe old well on the property is only about 20 ft. deep and contains only surface water, which is unfit for use. Even with boiling, it still tastes of the swamp. Water from the river is also unfit to use without boiling.\n\nThe cost of this well will be in the neighbourhood of $200.00, the price per foot being $2.00, inclusive of casing.\n\nMay authority be granted to proceed with this work?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant in which you recommend the drilling of a well at the Peguis Centre School, I beg to say that the Department is today writing Mr. Commissioner Graham, as it has been suggested that a new classroom and teacher's residence are required. As soon as we have Mr. Graham's reply, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nOttawa, September 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of May 3lst, last, in which you were informed that the Department was favourably disposed towards the erection of a teacher's residence and new classroom at the Peguis Centre Indian Day School. No reply appears to have been received from you in this matter, and the Department is now in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent stating that a new well is essential as, at present, the drinking water can only be obtained from the river or from the old well on the property. Before making a decision in this regard, the Department desires to have your reply to official letter of May 3lst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, No. 136-6-5, in connection with the erection of a teacher's residence and class-room at the Peguis Centre Indian Day School. I might say that this matter was discussed with the Deputy Superintendent General when he was here and it was decided to go on with the building, and both the South and Centre teacher's residences are under way as well as the Centre School. These residences are bungalows of the same type as were built last year at Lake St. Martin and Little Saskatchewan for the teachers there and will cost in the neighborhood of $2,600.00 each. The school is the same type as that being built at Brokenhead and will cost about $2,000.00.\n\nIn my letter of August 6th, 203-11A Gen., asking for an accountable cheque, I advised you that there were two Day School and two teachers' residences being erected in the Fisher River Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, September 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 203-11A Gen. of the 20th instant, relative to the erection of a teacher's residence and classroom at the Peguis Centre Indian Day School, the new day school at Jackhead and the teacher's residence at the Peguis South School.\n\nRegarding the well required at the Peguis Centre School, I beg to say the Department will leave this matter in your hands. If you consider that it is necessary to have a well drilled, you may arrange to have the work carried out, keeping all costs as low as possible. Mr. Agent Templeman, in a communication dated the 6th instant, states that he estimates the cost of the well will be in the neighbourhood of $200. The price per foot, including casing, would be $5. He states, further, that the old well on the property is about 20 feet deep and contains only surface water, which is unfit for use. The Agent is being informed that this matter has been left in your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, September 26, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the drilling of a well at the Peguis Centre Indian Day School, I beg to say that this matter is being referred to Mr. Commissioner Graham.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Templeman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nSir:\n\nFurther to my letter No. 203-11A Gen. of even date, in reply to yours of the 17th instant No. 136-6-5, in the closing paragraph of your letter you state that you have had a letter from the Indian Agent at Fisher River stating that a new well was essential at the Centre School. I might say that if a well is required there, there is also one required at the North School, as the same conditions exist at both places, that is, the teachers are using water out of the river. If there is money available during the fiscal year, you might let me know and I will make the best possible arrangements to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 3rd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 203-114 Gsm. of the 20th ultimo, relative to the drilling of a new well at the Peguis Centre School.

I am sending the best of these desks to the Peguis North School to replace broken and worn out desks at that school and would recommend that a complete new outfit of pupil's desks be supplied for the new school at Peguis Centre.\n\nI would very strongly recommend that these desks be steel support instead of cast iron. There is no danger of steel being broken like the cast iron and steel desks are practically everlasting.\n\nI would suggest the supplying of new desks for a seating accommodation of 30 pupils and would recommend that desks supplied be either Christie's Steel Adjustable Desk & Settee or Christie's Steel Movable Chair Desk. With these desks, only two separate sizes are required to cover pupils of all ages from 7 to 15 years, a decided advantage, and, in addition, no fronts or rears are required as in the case of the usual stationary desk. The cost of such desks would be as under-noted:\n\nIf Adjustable Steel Desk & Settee\n15 only desks & settees #62 @ $15.75 = $236.25\n15 \" \" \" \" #63 @ $15.50 = $232.50\n\nIf Steel Movable Chair Desk\n15 only Desks #112. @ $13.50 = $202.50\n15 \" \" \" #113 @ $12.50 = $187.50\n\nCosts are F.O.B. Hodgson.\nThe number of pupils on the Register at the Peguis Centre School at the present time is 25, and, for the present, seating accommodation for this number would be sufficient. Seating accommodation for this number would be 12 only No. 62 and 13 only No. 63, total cost, $390.50, or, if Chair Desks preferred, 12 only No. 112 and 13 only No. 113, total cost, $324.50.\n\nI enclose herewith illustrations of the desks specified. It may be possible to procure suitable desks from the E. N. Moyer Co., Ltd., or the Western Seating Co., of Winnipeg at figures lower than those of Christie's, Brandon, but I have no catalogue available from either of the first-named firms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. Desks must be single individual desks as double desks are not used in Provincial Schools.\nOttawa, October 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, relative to the desks required for the Peguis North Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not supply adjustable desks to Indian day schools. The type of desk we supply is the single school desk, non-adjustable. These desks are manufactured in the following sizes:\n\nNo. 1 for Adults,\nNo. 2 = Pupils 15 to 18 Yrs.,\nNo. 3 = 12 to 14 = ,\nNo. 4 = 10 to 12 = ,\nNo. 5 = 7 to 9 = ,\nNo. 6 = 5 to 7 = .\n\nIt is considered that approximately 25 single desks should be sufficient considering the enrolment at this school. Please furnish the Department with information as to the sizes and number of each size of desk required as per the above. It is advisable that each row of desks in the classroom be of the same size, with a front and rear seat. If the desks are arranged in four rows of six desks, with a front and rear seat, this would provide seating accommodation for 28 pupils. When we have the information asked for, prices will be obtained here and the order will be placed. Please also state whether a teacher's desk and chair are required, as, if so, this equipment should be ordered at the same time as the school desks. You should also give full shipping directions.\n\nPlease give the information asked for at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Tempheman, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6243, file 532-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nKindly send me a further advance of $2000.00 in connection with day school and two residences for teachers on the Peguis Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRe Pupil's Desks,\nPeguis Centre School.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th instant with reference to pupil's desks required for the new Peguis Centre School - not the Peguis North School as stated in your letter, - I beg to advise that, based upon the ages of the children on the School Register at the Peguis Centre School, the following desks will be required.\n\n1 row of six desks Size No. 5 - Ages 7 to 9.\n1 \" \" \" Size No. 4 - Ages 10 to 12.\n1 \" \" \" Size No. 3 - Ages 12 to 14.\n1 \" \" \" Size No. 2 - Ages 15 to 18.\n\nwith front and rear seats providing for accommodation of 30 pupils. With reference to these front and rear seats, I beg to recommend that the front seats be on the Size No. 5 desks where the smaller pupils will be close to the teacher and that the rear seats be on the size No. 2 desks.\n\nYour letter states that four rows of six desks will provide accommodation for 28 pupils, whereas, to my figuring, this will provide seating accommodation for 30 pupils - 6 pupils in each row complete with seats and desks, a total of 24, and 6 front seats without desks, making a total of 30. If front desks only supplied, without the attached seat, seating accommodation will be for only 24, unless the rear seats provide an additional row of seating for 6 pupils.\n\nWith reference to adjustable seats, I might mention that all desks in the old Peguis Centre School were of the adjustable type. I would again very strongly recommend that metal work on desks be of steel instead of cast iron.\n\nWith reference to desk for teacher, one will be required, the old desk being broken in places and very shabby in appearance. Desk of the sanitary type, similar to Christlie's, Brandon, No. 12 or No. 11, would be most suitable. No chair is required, a new teacher's chair for this school having been supplied in 1927.\n\nThe above furnishings should be shipped as soon as possible by Can. Nat. Rly. prepaid addressed to me at Hodgeson, Manitoba.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3lst ultimo, relative to the school desks required for the new Peguis Centre Indian Day School and stating the sizes required.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that it would save time in the securing of these desks if you arrange to obtain prices and purchase same. You may, therefore, obtain quotations, F.O.B. nearest shipping point to the school, for the number of each size of desk and front and rear seats as mentioned in your letter, sufficient to accommodate 30 pupils. You may obtain prices for the supplying of desks having steel castings. It is considered, however, that the single school desks, non-adjustable, would be satisfactory. You may also, at the same time, obtain a price for the supplying of a teacher's sanitary desk of a type similar to Christie's No. 11. You should ask the following firms and any others whom you wish to quote:\n\nWestern Seating Co., 179 Bannatyne Ave., Winnipeg,\nE. H. Moyer & Co. Ltd., - Winnipeg,\nCanada Seating Co., 911 McArthur Bldg., Winnipeg,\nChristie School Supply Co. - Brandon.\n\nYou may place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nPlease obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner, and send to the Department for payment. The vouchers should be accompanied by the quotations which you received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH.

Paget.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe wish to acknowledge with thanks your letter of December 28th with reference to desks purchased for the Centre School on the Peguis Reserve, Hodgson, Man.\n\nWe felt quite sure that the attitude of the Department would be as outlined in the last paragraph of your letter, and also that you would quite appreciate our attitude in writing you frankly in this connection.\n\nWe will be pleased to have a further report from you when you have received a reply from your local Indian Agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. N. MOYER COMPANY LIMITED\n\nGeneral Manager.\nSir,\n\nRe Desks - Peguis Centre School.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th instant with reference to complaint by the E. N. Moyer Co., Ltd., Toronto, that the desks purchased by me recently for the above-named school were not all Canadian manufacture and in reply to your query in the closing paragraph thereof, I beg to advise that the desks in question were purchased from the Canada Seating Co., of Winnipeg and the standards of these desks are of plate steel.\n\nUnder authority of your letter of November 8, 1925, I called for tenders from all firms named by you thereon, specifying that desks must have plate steel standards. The E. N. Moyer Co. of Winnipeg quoted on their New Empire Desks, stating that these were not plate steel but semi-steel. You will understand that semi-steel means that a part of the standard, the greater part which takes the stress, is of cast iron. I have referred to the Britannica and can find no trace of a material known as semi-steel, in fact, from what I read, it is not possible to blend cast iron and steel. It is apparent, therefore, that semi-steel consists of cast iron and steel joined as separate entities.\n\nMy reason for recommending plate steel desks is, that, the experience with semi-steel or cast iron standards in the schools at this Agency is that they are too easily broken. Practically every standard on the old desks at the Peguis Centre School, which were of cast iron, was broken and two of the standards of New Empire desks supplied for the Fisher River Day School are already broken. Plate steel standards may, under great stress, be bent but it is practically impossible to break them. In view of the fact that we have at this Agency desks supplied by the E. N. Moyer Co. last year on which the standards are already broken, which desks are identical with those quoted by them recently, it is apparent that these standards are inferior to plate steel.\n\nI do not know whether the standards of the desks supplied by the Canada Seating Co. are of Canadian or United States manufacture. There is no mark on the standard to show where they are made.\n\nIf these standards are made in the U.S. as claimed by the E. N. Moyer Co. and the standards on the desks quoted by them are of equivalent durability, they have a right to contention. If, however, as happens to be the case from experience with their product, their standards are inferior as regards durability, I do not see that they have a right to contention.\nI might mention that, as I received no instructions in your letter of November 5th to specify desks of Canadian manufacture, your letter simply stating that I was to place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price, it never entered my head to specify Canadian manufacture.\n\nI give hereunder quotations received from the various firms asked to tender:\n\nItems: 1 Teacher's Sanitary Desk; Plate Steel Pupils Desks - 6 Single Desks No. 2; 6 No. 3; 6 No. 4; 6 No. 5; 6 Rears No. 2; 6 Fronts No. 5.\n\nWestern Seating Co., Winnipeg. $336.50\n(Globe Steel Desks - Distributors for the Globe Steel Furniture Co., Waterloo, Ontario, so the standards may possibly be of Canadian Manufacture)\n\nE. N. Moyer Co., Ltd., Winnipeg. $246.30\n(New Empire Desks - Semi-Steel or Cast Iron Standards - Lowest tender, but not accepted for reason that standards were not steel)\n\nCanada Seating Co., Winnipeg. $279.85\n(Plate Steel Desks. This company are official Distributors for the Saskatchewan School Trustees Assoc. This tender was accepted, it being the lowest for steel standard desks.)\n\nChristie School Supply, Ltd., Brandon. $300.00\n(Plate Steel Desks. Pamphlet accompanying their tender shows that standards are made in the U.S.)\n\nI might mention that the Canada Seating Co. stated in their letter that the steel desks they supplied were the same as those supplied recently to the Indian School at the Hobema Agency.\n\nI beg to state that the desks supplied by the Canada Seating Co. are of excellent quality. I have given the steel standards a good test and would say that these will last indefinitely and that we will have no more trouble with broken standards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

The matter of making the ceiling a foot higher and removing the partitions between the schoolroom proper and the entrance walls might be considered.\"\n\nIt is really hard to understand an intelligent School Inspector making comments of this kind. The taking away of the walls would throw the doors right open into the classroom and there would be no vestibule. This, of course, is impracticable and you would not find a school in the provinces of Manitoba or Saskatchewan built on these lines. With regard to the suggestion that the ceiling be made a foot higher, there is no necessity for this; the ceiling is now 10 ft. high, which provides ample air space. This school, and five others like it that were built by the Department, were not put up without giving every consideration to the requirements. As a matter of fact, the plans were borrowed from the Department of Education for this province and the buildings were erected on exactly the same lines as the plans submitted called for. Were not these plans sent down to you-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\ndown to you for perusal, not in connection with this particular school, but before we started to use them? I would say that there is no reason at all for making any change and I should like to impress upon the Department very strongly the fact that we would not put up a building without giving the question of air space full consideration. If you will refer to the last report written by Mr. Kirkpatrick you will note that there were only 14 children on the roll at the time of his inspection, so with that number they had twice as much air space as the children have in our modern schools anywhere. When this school plan was decided upon it was figured that it would look after the requirements of thirty children, and it will be a long time before there will be thirty pupils at this school, judging from the number that have attended Day School on this reserve in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Templeman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nSir:\n\nReference charges on the attached Voucher No. 42 - $18.60, I beg to advise that, during the past winter, a fire broke out in the residence of the teacher at the Peguis South School. Miss Wright, the teacher, was ill in bed at the time and it was some time before she could obtain assistance in putting out the fire.\n\nThe cause of the fire was condensation of creosote in the stove pipe at the elbow where it goes through one of the partitions. The elbow was filled up with the creosote from the wood and this caught fire and the heat from the pipe ignited the ten-test around the thimble, burning ceiling above and a large hole through partition between rooms. The stove pipe runs the full length of the building and it is a difficult matter to prevent formation of creosote from the wood. Stove pipes are now taken down twice per month and cleaned out, which will prevent any fire in pipes in future.\n\nRepairs were executed and the brick casing surrounding the stove pipe, where it enters the partition, was made larger. An asbestos covering was placed in aperture and ten test was cut clear of thimble. There is little danger of fire in the future. Material for repairs, ten-test, panel strip, asbestos, nails, etc., had to be obtained from Winnipeg. The freight bill is attached hereto but I have not received invoice for material although I have twice asked for this.\n\nIn this connection, I would recommend that Pryene Fire Extinguishers be provided set in brackets in each schoolroom and in each teacher's residence on the Peguis Reserve. As there are three schools and three residences on the Peguis Reserve, six of these extinguishers would be required, together with a reserve supply of solution for refilling.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

Templeman, Indian Agent at Fisher River, in connection with the drilling of a well at the Peguis Centre School, regarding which I would refer to Department authority 136-6-5, dated 3rd October last, and my letter on the subject dated 22nd October. The vouchers are as follows:\n\nNo. 28 - Robinson Alamo Limited $18.90\nNo. 29 - H. Templeman .95\n\nMr. Templeman offers an explanation in regard to these expenditures by stating that after the well had been drilled water flowed over the top, and, notwithstanding authority given him last November to purchase a pump, he did not do so, stating he was advised to wait in order to determine from the nature of the flow what style of pump was required. He therefore plugged the well, but in February apparently the pressure of water removed the plug and the purchases, which the vouchers represent, cover additional material that he procured to hold back the water until the spring. These were expenditures, of course, which should have been included in the estimates for the last fiscal year, and, as the transaction took place in February, it is not understood why Mr. Templeman did not submit them before for payment. As I have previously mentioned, he is lacking in business capacity, and should long ago have reported the situation.

However, when I opened it up I found that the water was about four feet below the level of the ground and a pump would be necessary, so I have taken the liberty to order the pump and necessary fittings. This is the same kind of pump as is installed at North Peguis School and gives perfect satisfaction.\n\nHoping that this is in order, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. A.

I had Mr. Seebach put in the pump and build a platform, put a sleeve on the well casing where it was leaking about four feet below the level of the ground. The pump is now working though the water is very muddy, but I think it will clear up later on, unless there is a leak in the casing far in the ground.\n\nI would recommend that his account be paid as the price is fair and just.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.
