Make sure they get enough sleep and eat a balanced diet. Encourage them to read and write, and help them develop their talents and interests. Remember, a happy child is a healthy child.\nCHRISTMAS\n\nThe Times wishes its readers and the public generally a happy and merry Christmas. It trusts that for those dear ones who have been deprived of a time of enjoyment, match may happen unalloyed with any pain or sorrow.\n\nThe Christmas season is emblematic of happiness, and while there are many who are blessed in that respect, many others may be others who are not so fortunate. There is no apparent poverty in our midst, but it may exist, and at this season of the year especially it is the privilege, nay, the duty of those who are circumstantially able to minister to the wants of the needy and help to make their Christmas as happy as possible.\n\nChristmas is celebrated by all branches of the Christian Church as the birthday of the Saviour. Various names have been given to this festival. Our own \"Christmas,\" comes nearest to the German \"Christfest.\" The Romance language contains the word which the French designate as \"No\u00ebl,\" a word which was used as a cry of joy and was sung during the eight days preceding Christmas.\n\nThe Welsh name is \"N\u00f4l-gwyl,\" which is from the words \"noel\" in Irish Christmas. We collect \"Nol-liga\" from Natalie, and we have to search \"Yule\" and the modern \"Jind\" from Jules, to be merry.\n\nAs commemorating the birth of Christ it is a religious festival. But in the popular application, its religious character has given place to one of a social and charitable nature. It is the feast of good fellowship, with a religious sanction. Nowadays, although the form of Christianity, it has become practically the feast of Santa Claus\u2014the patron of children. Christmas has been kept from the earliest times as a period of rejoicing. In the first three centuries of our common era, the feast of the Saturnalia, prior to the later days of the Roman Empire that fest developed into a low debauch, and in order to counteract the evil tendencies of the Saturnalia, religious observances were sought to rise of heathen festivals and to render them subservient to the cause of religion. In Britain there were other modifications; to the reformed Saturnalia were added first some of the Druidical rites and later some of the ceremonies of the ancient Germans and Scandinavians. Of these were the turning of the yule log and the superstitions of the mistletoe bough, both of which have survived in England.\n\nOur able contemporary the Regina Journal, in its issue of the 6th inst., has an excellent article on non-denominational education, which will certainly not fail. The separate school system is an unspeakable injustice and should be wiped out; there is no good reason why Protestant and Roman Catholic children should not attend the same schools. Religious instruction should be kept out of our common public schools and only secular branches of knowledge taught. In such a case there could not possibly be any excuse for the existence of separate schools and the home circle should be sufficient means of imparting religious instruction. The Bible might very properly be kept out of the public schools, let it be taught by the church and the family. This is more difficult, and at the same time important question than this to grapple with, but we feel that it should be taken hold of and solved if a solution can be found, and we believe with the feeling that the secularists, instead of wasting time on such less important questions, shall devote a portion of their time to a consideration of this vital question. As we cannot settle it here, our attention may have been called at Ottawa.\n\nGO TO AGNEW'S FOR Stoves Stoves Heating Drums Stovepipe Coal Oil T.J.

MACDUGALL\nTHE BAZAAR.\n\nThe bazaar held last night in aid of the funds of the St. Albans Band was one of the most successful affair of the kind ever held in Prince Albert. Mr. J. A. Jackson kindly placed his residence at the disposal of the band, and no better place could have been found for the purpose; the store, although not quite finished, was nearly filled up with articles of all kinds and the walls decorated, while the rooms in rear of the store served admirably as a kitchen and refreshment-room.\n\nA very large and varied number of musical and fancy articles\u2014the result of the labors of the St. Albans Ladies Aid Association\u2014were offered for sale at very reasonable prices, and to our ready purchasers in the good people of Prince Albert, who came in considerable numbers throughout the afternoon and evening in large numbers. The bazaar was opened at one o'clock by Mr. Jackson, who made a short speech appropriate to the occasion.\n\nThe ladies of the Association acted as stewards and judges from the results of their labors, and although some of which their work disappeared, they were in every respect a success as such. Refreshments were served throughout the evening from which a good sum was realized. The P. A. C. Band attended at the evening and played some selections in a very creditable manner.\n\nWe understand that the net proceeds of the bazaar will be about $170.\n\nAfter dinner the ladies of the band and of the young people took advantage of the presence of the band and the fine music and indulged in much social dancing.\n\nPeople are very highly pleased with the bazaar on the ground that they are helping charity, but that the charge cannot hardly be called high. The bazaar was held in this town; in every case where it was held it was to buyers and very often more than twice what was charged at the door of St. Albans Church on the occasions which attracted their effects and which we well deserved.\n\nDUCK LAKE.\n\nThe settlers of this district will meet Mr. Mitchell, our member of the District Assembly, next week, and it is expected he will be given a dinner here. He is expected here on Sunday week.\n\nLast week while Anderson was bringing in the new mill machinery one of the axes broke under the boiler. Mr. Anderson had to return to Troy for a new one.\n\nA very successful school examination took place here yesterday.\n\nA meeting of the Board of Mr. O. Nolin, was held on Tuesday last. The object being to appoint Mr. Buteche a delegate to Ottawa in the interests of the Metis. Only five members present.\n\nAmong those interested at the Duck Lake house this week were: Messrs. J. Clark, W. H. Smith, Mr. J. W. Cox, well of Chief's Committee, Richey, Mr. Lacombe; J. Lovell and J. McIntosh, of Fish Creek; Mr. Qu'Appelle; Louie, Peterman, Lovell, Mr. J. M. Causeur, Mr. Willsburgh and Rev. Monsignor Buteche.\n\nOn the Wednesday Mr. W. P. Taylor, son of J. Pools of the Ridge, near Prince Albert, was accidentally shot at Rosser's settlement by Mr. Buteche. It appears that two guns were discharged in attempt to kill a steer. Peter Taylor loaded one with blank and the other with live. On the following day Walter Taylor, aged fourteen years, and young Pools, on returning from some work, went to where the animals were kept. When Peter Taylor picked up the shorter one, cracked it when it went off killing young Pools in the face. He tried to save his life and died within a short time. At the instant no evidence could be elicited as to who loaded the gun. It is said that young Pools did it himself. The body was taken to Rafflewood where it was interred in the English Church cemetery.\n\nWeather fine and cold.
