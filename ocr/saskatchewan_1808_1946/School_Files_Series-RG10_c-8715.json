Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alberta.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, July 10, 1940.\n\nAttention: Education Branch\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian School.\n\nThere are certain repairs and replacements that are necessary at this institution and some work that should be done if funds are available. May I be permitted to enumerate?:\n\n(1) The upright water heating boiler has been leaking badly for the past month but it was kept in use until the school closed. The tubes have been rolled three times but are now beyond repair as they are leaking from the sides into the firebox; there is no alternative but to retube it. This boiler is a necessity and unfortunately is costly to keep in condition because of the soda and alkali in the water. No doubt the proper thing to do would be to install a water softener - but the initial expense is considerable. I inquired of the local steam fitter, L. Michael, and he states that he is prepared to take down the boiler, retube it and erect it again for the sum of $160.00.\n\n(2) The ashes from the big furnaces must be removed by buckets which are hauled to the surface with a windlass. The existing buckets have been in use for ten years -- there are two. They are now absolutely beyond repair and for some months every scheme has been tried to improvise a method of removal, but to no satisfaction. A pair of heavy iron buckets, with strong blacksmith iron handles, can be secured for about $25.00.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n(3) The shaft, pinions and cogs of the Delco pump engine over the second well at the school have been cut by the sand and alkali water until they are so bad that they should be replaced. It is anticipated that these will cost about $20.00.\n\n(4) It has been the policy at this school to do a certain amount of interior painting each summer and the Department has supplied the material. A very good job has always been done and I would recommend that authority to purchase the following paint and painting material be granted, if funds are available:\n\n- Spar Varnish 5 gals.\n- Shellac 2 gals.\n- Inside White 5 gals.\n- Inside Ivory 5 gals.\n- Russet Brown 4 gals.\n- Battleship Grey 2 gals.\n- Black Engine Enamel 2 gals.\n- Boiled Linseed Oil 10 gals.\n- Turpentine 10 gals.\n- White enamel 2 gals.\n- Three inch Brushes 2\n- One inch Brushes 2\n- Lamp Black 5 lbs.\n\nIf authority for the above is granted, it would be appreciated if it was not delayed, so that work can proceed immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nG.

BAILEY\n\nI attach account in favour of L. Michael, Gleichen, Alta., for $199.52. Of this amount $129.52 covers the cost of materials purchased. The reasons for authorizing this expenditure are as follows:\n\n1. The armature of the 1 H.P. Delco electric motor on the pumping plant burnt out and had to be replaced immediately.\n\n2. The Delco pump on the main well filled with water and the bearings and pins burnt out. These had to be supplied immediately.\n\n3. Heavy winds during the latter part of April played havoc with the tar and gravel roofs and in order to avoid damage to the interior of the building the roofs had to be repaired at once.\n\nThe coding is as follows: 758-76-10-691.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSupplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\".\n\n**Invoices already received.**\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                      | UNIT | TOTAL   |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|------|---------|\n|          | Repairing Roof, motor, & pump at the Old Sun Residential School - Childen, etc. |      |         |\n|          | Repair roof                                      |      | 125.60  |\n|          | Repair motor                                     |      | 30.40   |\n|          | Repair pump                                      |      | 30.00   |\n|          | Labour and parts pump & pressure tank            |      | 9.00    |\n|          | As per Invoice dated July 1949                    |      | (109.60)|\n|          | Voucher No. 178 - Blackfoot Indian Agency        |      |         |\n|          | Old Sun Res.

BAILEY\nPurchasing Agent\nGleichen, Aug. 8, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JULY\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nAll children were on holidays but both institutions were visited. At the Crowfoot school an inspection was made of the heating plant which has been in use for some 30 years and needed repairs badly. I am pleased to say that authority has been given for these repairs to be done and it is expected that the plant will be in good working order when school opens.\n\nThe same condition, only on a smaller scale, existed at the Old Sun School, this work is now done. The crops at both schools is very good; at the Old Sun a good crop of Alfalfa is being harvested while at the Crowfoot the Rev. Father Riou purchased about 80 tons of prairie hay from the Indians to augment the feed which he will harvest off the farm.\n\nG.H.

Welfare and Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal has today given me the information that the appropriation for Old Sun Residential School for the present fiscal year is $1200.00, covering repairs and equipment. If such is the case, there are immediate requirements:\n\n1. Paint and painting material, as per the attached list, which should not exceed $125.00; labour to be supplied by the school.\n\n2. An amount not exceeding $750.00 should be provided to purchase building materials for a workshop. This institution must have some place to carry out the program of training as outlined by Mr. Doucet. They now have a qualified woodwork instructor on the Staff but there is no place to carry on instruction. During the visit of Mr. Doucet various schemes for providing accommodation were considered working or the assumption in all cases that suitable land was available. The writer was requested that a disused four-room Indian house might be moved to the school for the purpose; though such a building was not the best, it would be better than none. However, now that there appears to be an amount set aside in the estimates sufficient to supply the materials for a proper workshop it does not seem to suggest itself to move the old building, which would require a foundation and repairs amounting to two or three hundred dollars, and then never be the proper place to carry out a full course of training. If the sum of $750.00 can be supplied with which to purchase building material, it will be excellent training for the pupils of the school to erect a proper type workshop, under capable supervision.\n\nAs something must be done immediately, and as the estimates for the fiscal year 1942/43 must go forward at once, please advise by wire or Air Mail whether or not the foregoing expenditures will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 22, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th instant and have noted your recommendations. We are sending the list of your requirements, as stated in your requisition, to the Purchasing Agent.\n\nWith regard to the erection of a new workshop, valued at $750.00, it is believed that this is not desirable at this time. It is considered that the unoccupied house with the adjoining barn, agreed upon at the time of Mr. Doucet's visit, would prove quite satisfactory. The Department is prepared to approve an expenditure not to exceed $200.00 for the foundations and repair of the above-mentioned building.\n\nWe would like you to proceed without delay to the preparation of the foundations for the building and then to its transportation. We wish to have this building ready as soon as possible, in order that the children may not be delayed in their training.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alberta.\nOttawa, September 10th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to advise you that the fire insurance for a risk of $80,000.00 on the \"Old Sun\" Indian Residential School near Gleichen, Alberta, will expire on October 1st, 1941. You are asked to inspect this property with a view to ascertaining as to whether or not the present risk is for a proper amount.\n\nYou are to place the renewal of this insurance with T. H. Beach, Gleichen, Alberta, for a term of three years. The policy should contain a clause to the effect that in the event of loss by fire payment will be made to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nHave the Agent submit his account in triplicate to you, upon which you will please forward it to the Department covered by your voucher also in triplicate for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Furnaceman L. Michael of Gleichen was brought in and on investigation it was found that part of the firebox and assembly were burned out and the fire was coming directly into the oven.\n\nOwing to the possible delay in getting repair parts I instructed Mr. Michael to make what temporary repairs he could. This he did by putting in ordinary bricks and fire bricks over the burned out portion. The bread can now be baked without much burning if the baker is careful to move the loaves about. However, this is not baking properly and as soon as possible permanent repairs should be made. Mr. Michael has submitted some data and plans which I submit herewith.\n\nFor your necessary action, please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H.

It is noted that you have made temporary repairs but I understand from your letter that the articles mentioned by Mr. Michael will be required soon.

MICHAEL GLEICHEN ALTA., for PLUMBING REPAIRS ETC. AT OLD SUN SCHOOL.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. ESTIMATES dated 1941/42.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nAttention: Superintendent Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe drainage system of the residential part of the Old Sun School has been blocked and waste water from the roof and laundry of the residence has been running into the basement. I made an inspection with the local plumber and found no other way to get at the trouble but to chop holes in the concrete floor. The first hole, based on experience from former similar trouble, did not make it possible to clean the drain and further cutting is being done in the direction of the disposal system. So far, the pipes wind around with many elbows, rises and dips, but it is expected that it can be eventually cleaned.\n\nThe foregoing is mentioned so that you might realize the difficulties encountered and the likely cost of around $30.00 in clearing this. As it was an emergency I instructed the plumber to go ahead.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nGHG:R\nOttawa,\nMarch 18, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI attach the under-mentioned accounts for which I should appreciate your issuing purchase orders:\n\n1. Account of $65.85 covering cost of lumber and material purchased from the Crown Lumber Company for the workshop at the Old Sun Residential School. In order to provide proper accommodation for the vocational work at this school we had an old building moved from one section of the reserve to the school property. It was necessary to renovate this and the Agent was authorized to purchase the necessary material in order that the building might be completed at the earliest possible date.\n\n2. Account of $170.60 in favour of L. Michael. You will note from the account that these were small expenditures made from time to time during the past year in order to keep the building in proper running order.\n\nThe coding is as follows: 756-76-10-\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your voucher No. 524 amounting to $170.60 in connection with plumbing repairs at the Old Sun School. I note that this expenditure was incurred from time to time throughout the past year. However, it now amounts to a considerable sum and it will be difficult for us to explain to the Purchasing Branch why authority was not obtained previous to the expenditure being incurred. It is possible that the school staff is not as careful of the equipment as might be expected.\n\nThere seems to be a considerable amount of labour which could have been done by some member of the staff. You will realize, of course, that it is difficult for us to obtain money for this work, owing to present conditions, and consequently staffs of Indian residential schools are expected to co-operate in every possible way in keeping expenditures low. I note from your letter of the 3rd instant that there will be a further expenditure of $30.00 for labour. I trust that it will not exceed that amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n| DATE   | ARTICLE                                      | FOLIO | CREDIT | DEBIT | TOTAL |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|\n| Dec 4  | 30\" No. 20 Trim Cement                      |       |        | 450   |       |\n|        | 12 Pipe Bends                               |       |        | 240   |       |\n|        | 2 Closet Balls                              |       |        | 20    |       |\n|        | Labour & Hours                              |       |        | 800   |       |\n|        | 1 Labor & Hours                             |       |        | 400   |       |\n|        | 1 Reverse Snap Bowl with Spud               |       |        | 1260  |       |\n|        | 1 Closet Spud                               |       |        | 30    |       |\n|        | 1 Closet Spud                               |       |        | 240   |       |\n|        | 1 Damper 3/8\"                               |       |        | 140   |       |\n|        | 1 Damper 3/8\"                               |       |        | 60    |       |\n| Jan 9  | 4 Joints 7\" pipe                            |       |        | 990   |       |\n|        | 1 Labor & Hours                              |       |        | 100   |       |\n|        | 2 Floor Flange                              |       |        | 900   |       |\n|        | 4 Closet Balls                              |       |        | 100   |       |\n|        | 4 Closet Balls                              |       |        | 100   |       |\n|        | 1 Closet Bowl with Spud                     |       |        | 1250  |       |\n|        | 4 Rubber Gasket                             |       |        | 50    |       |\n|        | 4 Closet Balls                              |       |        | 400   |       |\n|        | 7 Hours Labour                              |       |        | 700   |       |\n|        | 4 Closet Balls                              |       |        | 330   |       |\n|        | 2 Closet Flanges                            |       |        | 60    |       |\n|        | 6 lbs Putty                                 |       |        | 300   |       |\n| March 2| 3 Hours in Sewer                             |       |        | 150   |       |\n|        | A McDonald 1/2\" sewer                       |       |        | 200   |       |\n|        | 1/2\" sewer                                  |       |        | 75    |       |\n|        | 5 lbs Iron                                  |       |        | 100   |       |\n|        | 1 sack cement                               |       |        | 600   |       |\n|        | A McDonald time 8 hours                     |       |        | 8970  |       |\n\nTerms Cash\n\n8 per cent interest charged on overdue accounts.\n\nEstimates given free.\nGleichen Alta.

Account of $88.85 covering cost of lumber and material purchased from the Crown Lumber Company for the workshop at the Old Sun Residential School. In order to provide proper accommodation for the vocational work at this school we had an old building moved from one section of the reserve to the school property. It was necessary to renovate this and the Agent was authorized to purchase the necessary material in order that the building might be completed at the earliest possible date.\n\n2. Account of $170.60 in favour of L. Michael. You will note from the account that these were small expenditures made from time to time during the past year in order to keep the building in proper running order.\n\nThe coding is as follows: 758-76-10-\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return voucher 33 issued in favour of L. Michael.\n\nThe second item on the account reads -- \"Bake oven repairs $130.90\". More detailed information will have to be supplied regarding this item, showing the manner in which the charge was reached. Details will also have to be supplied for the second-last item on the account reading -- \"Repairs to 2 H.P. motor $11.50\". Incidentally it is noted that the account is larger than the authority given in official letter of February 24, but I presume that this is due to the fact that repairs were made to the pump.\n\nOn reviewing the account I may say that it appears from this distance that Mr. Michael's charges are inclined to be rather high.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nCalgary, May 22nd, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor McGill,\n\nRe: Visit to the Blackfoot Indian Hospital and the two Residential Schools\n\nOLD SUN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nAt the Old Sun School, they have a large drier which they have very little use for, and the Matron stated that she would be glad to trade it for a mangle. If the Department would purchase this School a mangle, the drier could be shipped to the Blood Hospital, where one is badly needed.\n\nW.L. Falconer, M.D.,\nAsst. Superintendent of Medical Services.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, May 26, 1942\n\nAttention: P.A. Hoey, Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould it be possible to state what funds are available during the current fiscal year for development and repairs at the Old Sun Residential School?\n\nOf immediate necessity are: (1) Motor Jack and repair to barn pump. Recently this was temporarily repaired at a cost of $30.00 and this will be repeated if the unit is not properly equipped. The estimated cost of this is $80.50.\n\n(2) The Principal brought to the attention of Inspector Schmidt the desirability and need of a water tank and pump for a vegetable garden. It is noted that the estimated cost of this is $217.00 and that it requires a galvanized tank and 350 feet of pipe. The Blackfoot Coal Mine will have the pipe and possibly a pumping unit for sale very shortly as a larger unit is being installed there. It is doubtful if the galvanized tank could be purchased now and I believe this unit would be more efficient. The whole thing could be purchased for considerably less than the amount estimated.\n\n(3) Paint, to the value of $125.00, is also required so that it may be applied during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa,\nMay 30, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, the following expenditures are authorized at the Old Sun School:\n\n1. Motor jack and repair to barn pump -- estimated cost $84.50.\n\n2. Purchase of water tank and pump for the vegetable garden -- estimated cost $217.00.\n\nIt is noted that you can secure a suitable pumping unit from the Blackfoot Coal Mine.\n\nWith regard to the paint, it is doubtful if, under present conditions, this can be secured, but you should forward a requisition stating the quantities and colours required and the matter will be submitted to the Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nMay 26th 1942\n\nOld Sun School\n(Work Shop) Aug 27/41\nSleicher Alta\n\nIn account with W.A.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention: R.A. Hoey, Supt. Welfare and Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to report that the tar and gravel roofs on the Old Sun School have been leaking badly in various places. In company with the Principal and local Tinsmith I inspected the building today; the walls of the residence, the two senior dormitories and the senior classroom which where recent rains had seeped through and discolored them. The Principal said that the water was so bad in these parts of the building during a sharp shower on the 13th that the pupils had to get out of bed and mop it up. On inspecting the roof, the flashing appeared to be in excellent condition but the tar had melted and considerable run away down the drain leaving the paper with very little gravel or tar on it in spots.\n\nNone of us have had enough experience with tar roofs to know exactly what the condition is nor where the leak might be and this letter is written to ask authority to secure the services of a capable roofing contractor to inspect it. The name of L.D. Reggin, of the Reggin Roofing and Metal Works, Calgary, was suggested. This is a dependable firm.\n\nThis matter is considered urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nGHG:R\nAIR MAIL\nOttawa, September 17, 1942.\n\nRe: Repairs to Roof - Old Sun School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and to state that you are authorized to have a representative of the Reggin Roofing and Metal Works, of Calgary, inspect the roof of the above-named school and submit an estimate of the repairs that may be urgently required. It is scarcely necessary to add that this work should be undertaken at the earliest possible date.\n\nIn the estimates of this year the sum of $800 was set apart for repairs, painting, etc., at the Old Sun School. Of this amount approximately $625.00 has been already spent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alberta.\nAttention: R.A. Hoey, Supt. Welfare & Training\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Old Sun School roof\nYour File No. 104-1-5.\n\nIn reply to yours of the 17th ultimo, I have to report that I immediately contacted Mr. Reggin of the Reggin Roofing and Metal Works and at his first opportunity he made an inspection of this roof.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of his report. In conversation with him, he was surprised to see such a poor job and asked if it wasn't a bonded roof. He intimated that such would be the only guarantee of a proper job being done and certainly the job which he inspected had not been properly done.\n\nThe cost of re-roofing is very large and it is realized here that it will possibly be very difficult to raise sufficient funds to do it at this time. There has been no real damage done by the leaking so far.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nGHG:R:enc\nOttawa,\nOctober 9, 1942,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing report regarding the roof at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. I note that the cost of a new roof is estimated at $2610.00. It is not possible for the Department to consider any such expenditure at the present time. In reviewing our files I find that an expenditure of $199.52 was made for this roof in July, 1940. The work at that time was done by L. Michael. Presumably whatever was done at that time has kept the roof in fairly good condition until the present time. While I realize that patching the roof may not be entirely satisfactory, the funds at our disposal will not allow us to incur any heavy expenditure. If you believe that repairs to the amount of $200.00 would be of any assistance, authority is granted for an expenditure of this amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOctober 20, 1942.\n\nMr G.H. Gooderham  \nIndian Agent  \nGleichen, Alta\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to your letter of October 14 we appreciate the fact that the Department may not feel like spending this amount of money at the present time. We have always taken the position that it is far better to secure a job which we know will give satisfaction than to carry out repairs unless conditions warrant doing the repair work.\n\nThere is no doubt that a certain amount of repairs would give some results, but would not be a job which could be guaranteed, as with patch jobs we simply undertake to do the best we can under the circumstances.\n\nIf it is your wish, we would be pleased to carry out repairs in the prominent weak spots to the best of our ability, and as far as we deal this type of work warrants, in order that there may be a degree of satisfaction along with it.\n\nIf you would like us to undertake this work we would be glad to make arrangements in the very near to do so.\n\nIf you wish to carry out repairs, we would like you to have the caretaker chip off a couple of pieces of pitch from the roof and send them in to us, in order that we might test the material, as the writer has seen so many roofs that he is not certain which type of material was used; whether it is pitch or asphalt, and for repair work we use the same quality material.\n\nAwaiting your instructions in this matter.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nReggin Roofing & Metal Works\n\nL. D. Reggin.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Oct. 22, 1942.\n\nAttention: Supt. Welfare and Training.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th where authority was given to spend an amount of $200.00 on repairs to the Old Sun School roof, I beg to report that I immediately communicated with Mr. Reggin and asked him what could be done for this amount. I am attaching hereto his reply.\n\nIf I interpret this correctly, there is no guarantee that the roof will not continue to leak. These roofs do not give any trouble in the winter time when it is frozen and dry and any loose snow can be shoveled off prior to a thaw. It is my recommendation that nothing be done at present, providing the roof can be properly repaired in the spring. The cost would then be included in the estimates for the fiscal year 1943/44.\n\nAwaiting your instructions, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nGHG:R\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the roof of the Old Sun School and, from the information contained in your report, it appears undesirable to incur an expenditure. However, it is not possible for me, at the present time, to make a definite promise that even next year we will have the amount in our appropriation that would be necessary to make a complete job.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.H.

The total allowed was $301.50.\n\nMr. Micheal has submitted an account to cover this of $221.03. The pipe for the system has been supplied from the Blackfoot Indian Coal mine - 360' of 2\" pipe valued at $90; no account has been submitted for this.\n\nThe balance of the voucher represents repair work which Mr. Micheal has done at this institution and amounts to $90.65.\n\nThe whole is submitted for payment please.\n\nGHG/B\n\nIndian Agent.\nG.H.Gooderham.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, April 1, 1943.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing voucher No. 498.\n\nOn reviewing this voucher it is found that all the items mentioned in your letter of May 26, 1942, had been purchased two months before. It would be appreciated if you would let me know why this information was not contained in your letter to which reference has just been made. When issuing the authority given in official letter of May 30, the Department was under the impression that the purchases had not yet been made.\n\nWith reference to the account for $90.65, covering the cost of repair work, there is an item of November 4 reading \"Labour on Dairy Sink $6.00; bolts 40\u00a2; gasket 20\u00a2.\" Is the Department to understand that a charge of $6.00 was made for labour in installing material costing 60\u00a2? What has been said regarding the November 4 item applies also to the charges of November 5 and November 10, also November 26. A full explanation regarding the apparently heavy charges for labour will be necessary before payment of the account can be made.\n\nMore detailed information will be necessary regarding the item of $28.00 for repairs on November 22. In the case of all items regarding labour, it will be necessary to show the number of hours the workman was employed and the rate per hour. This applies also to the account of February, 1943.\n\nI am returning both these accounts in order that the necessary explanations may be supplied. I would appreciate receiving your reply at the earliest possible date, in order that, if it is decided to pay the accounts, cheque may be issued from the 1942-43 appropriation.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference yours 104-1-5 of the 1st instant and attached voucher number 498.\n\nNone of the items mentioned in my letter of May 26, 1942 were purchased until the dates stated in the accounts submitted by Mr. Micheal; these were either in the latter part of 1942 or early in 1943 as you will note.\n\nIn regard to the pump-jack, Mr. Micheal had great difficulty in securing it and when it arrived was so busy on other jobs that he did not get it installed. It must be repeated that your authority of May 30, 1942 exceeded the amount expended and furthermore the amount of repairs of $90.65 is just equal to the value of pipe (the property of the Blackfoot Indians) for which no charge has been made.\n\nNow with regard to the repair account for $90.65 I report as follows:\n\n(a) All walls in the Old Sun School are metal lath and plaster; when constructed fittings were attached to walls by screws in wooden plugs. In time these dried out and heavy sinks could not be maintained in place. This was particularly true in the Dairy and to remedy this defect bolts have been put through the wall from another room, with plates to anchor them. The wall used in this case, is solid brick and it took some time to drill necessary holes; the material used, as noted, was negligible but skilled labour was required as there was neither skilled labour nor necessary tools in the institution.\n\nOVER.\n(b) The rate of pay in all cases, where not formerly indicated, were $1. per hour. This may seem a lot but Mr. Micheal is an excellent mechanic and wastes no time.\n\n(c) In regard to repairs to a 2 H.P. motor - This is part of the return unit of the heating system. The unit was installed the year following construction of the school, as the heating system was defective. This motor carried a heavy load for 10 years then ceased to function until repaired. The repairs were satisfactory and as the motor is an absolute necessity for heating the institution, the cost was considerably less than replacement.\n\nIndian Agent.\nC. H. Gooderham.\nOttawa,\nApril 8, 1943.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to your voucher V 498. When the account was first submitted we considered that a number of the articles had been bought in February, 1942. It is now noted from your letter that these were not supplied until February, 1943.\n\nWhen we wrote to you on May 30 we were under the impression that the supplying of the items mentioned in your letter of May 26 was urgent and consequently we gave authority for local purchase. If we had been aware that it would take nine months to secure the articles, we would have complied strictly with purchasing regulations and had the Purchasing Branch secure them.

Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter checking up our correspondence with you with regard to the Old Sun School roof, we believe that our quotations as given at that time would still be in order, and we feel that the complete job would be the more economical.\n\nHowever, under the circumstances, there is no doubt that some repair work could be accomplished that would give you considerable service, and the only fair way to both parties to handle this type of repair work, would be on a material and labor basis, so that if you are allotted a certain amount, we would be only able to carry out repairs to the extent of that amount.\n\nIf it is necessary to have any fuller information in this regard, I would have to make a trip to Gleichen to go over this roof again.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of both previous letters from you files and trust that we may hear from you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nREGGIN ROOFING & METAL WORKS.\n\nCOPY\n\nL.D. Reggin\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMay I refer you to correspondence in regard to the roof of the Old Sun Residential school, particularly to your letter of the 9th of October, 1942, file 104-1-5, when you stated that the department was not in a position at that time to make a large expenditure in repairing the roof but was prepared to spend $200, if it would do any good.\n\nAs you will now realize nothing was done to the roof; the past spring was dry and there was no damage from moisture. In fact, the roof had been forgotten. If there is a very rainy season it is feared that there will be considerable damage done to ceilings and walls.\n\nAs a consequence, I took it upon myself to ascertain if there was any way that this could be repaired at less cost and tendered the Reggin Roofing Company, Calgary. On inquiry, we found that this firm was the only one that could supply the necessary material so I communicated with Mr. Reggin again.\n\nAttached is a copy of his reply, which indicates that he has nothing further to recommend than in October, 1942. I also, by chance got talking to a representative of an oil and paint company, who sells a lot of plastic roof cement which is used extensively on the cheap construction roofs that are flat and not waterproof. I attach hereto a letter from the manager of the C.C. Snowden Co. with regard to the material. The cost would be only one-fifth of the bonded roof but it certainly would not be so durable.\nIt is not known how reliable this roof cement is but it is known that it is almost impossible to get the right ingredients for the bonded roof and the labour to do it.\n\nSomething should be done to this roof before fall and this information is submitted for your consideration.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham.\n\nP.S. I just learned that the plastic roof coating is used on rubberoid roofing which has perishable and may not be any value on a tar and gravel roof. It would therefore appear that the mentioned product would be useless on this job.\n\nM.F.\nOttawa, July 13, 1943.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with further reference to the roof of the Old Sun School.\n\nWe have carefully considered the two proposals and are not altogether satisfied with either of them. In the case of the Reggin Roofing Company, we have not the money in the present year's appropriation sufficient to carry out their suggestion. I note from your letter that you are not altogether satisfied that the suggestion of the C. C. Snowdon Estate would prove satisfactory. Under the circumstances, I am submitting the matter to the Surveys & Engineering Branch, with a view to having one of their officers visit the school and report.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, July 13, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Residential School,\nBlackfoot Indian Agency, near Gleichen, Alberta\n\nLast fall, the Indian Agent wrote that the condition of the roof of the above noted school was not satisfactory and at that time forwarded the attached tender from the Reggin Roofing & Metal Works. As their tender involved an amount of $610.00, which was not available in our appropriation, no work was done.\n\nI am today in receipt of another letter from the Agent, in which he recommends that the roof be repaired. He has consulted the Reggin Roofing & Metal Works again and they consider that their previous quotation should be sufficient. The agent also secured a quotation from the Estate of C. C. Snowdon. I attach this for your information.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would have one of your officers inspect this roof at the earliest possible date and let us know what he considers should be done. For your information I may say that in the current year's appropriation we have an amount of $600.00 for repairs and improvements to the Old Sun School. Consequently, if sufficient repairs can be made to put the roof in a reasonable condition, without incurring the heavy expense outlined in the quotation from the Reggin Roofing & Metal Works, it would be much easier for this Branch to handle the expenditure.\n\nIf your officer interviews Mr. C. P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, he can make arrangements for reaching the Old Sun School.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 20th, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Residential School,\nBlackfoot Indian Agency, near Gleichen,\nAlberta.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of July 18th, Mr. C.

Wardle,\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJuly 22, 1943.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 6th instant and official reply of the 13th instant, regarding the Old Sun School, I am now advised by the Surveys & Engineering Branch that Mr. C.M. Walker, Supervising Engineer of the Engineering & Construction Service at Banff, has been asked to make an inspection of the roof of this school as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference yours of the 22nd instant, file 104-1-5, Mr. W.H. Snelson of the Engineering and Construction Service, Banff visited this Agency on the 27th when he made a thorough inspection of the roof of the Old Sun Residential School.\n\nEvery possible assistance was given to him by this office and the school staff and you should receive a well considered report from the Banff office in due course.\n\nIndian Agent.\nG. H. Gooderham\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nOn a recent visit to the Old Sun Residential School the upright water heating boiler was found to be leaking. The plumber and a man who is capable of moving and rolling the tubes was immediately contacted and it was learned that the services of this man could be secured now, but maybe not later. The cost of this work will not exceed $25. If done now and I took the liberty of instructing him to do it. If left it would possibly be much more costly and the work would have to be done when the school is full of pupils.\n\nTrust this meets with your approval.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, you may expend an amount of $25.00 in repairing the water heating boiler at the Old Sun Residential School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJuly 2nd, 1943.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of advice today from our representative Mr. Posey who had the pleasure of calling on you this week in connection with the roof cement required to repair the Indian School. According to his estimate it will require 300 gallons to complete the job and our special price to you is $1.50 per gallon less 10% on this quantity.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith a descriptive circular which will give you a very good idea of the material benefits that may be derived from the use of this Semi Plastic Cement.\n\nYou will also note that we handle a Heavy Plastic cement which is used to patch any cracks or crevices in the roof as well as for sealing up the flashings around the chimney and around the sides of the building should this be necessary. Should you require any of the Heavy Plastic we would recommend that it be allowed to set for a couple of days before applying the Semi Plastic cement over the entire surface of the roof.\n\nThis Material is easily applied, being semi liquid in form and requires no heating, and we will be pleased to supply you with the necessary brush for the purpose of application as this eliminates a considerable amount of labor. Our Semi Plastic cement sets to a hard rubber consistency that will not peel, chip or crack. It expands and contracts as the temperature varies, and properly applied should give you a roof as good as a new one.\nThe price of the Heavy Plastic cement is 16\u00a2 per pound less 10\u00a2.\n\nI think you will find the information contained in the circular enclosed will tell you anything that you may wish to know, but if there is any further information you require we will be only too glad to be of service to you. We can make shipment promptly and sincerely trust that we may have the privilege of being favored with your valued order. You may rest assured that you will get a finished job that you will be pleased with, not only for this year but for many years to come.\n\nWith kind regards, and thanking you for the courtesy extended our representative when he called.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nESTATE OF C.C.

One coat will usually seal small holes caused by rust pitting and reliven the surface, adding many years to its service.\n\nTHIS IS a super-roof material but it will not accomplish the impossible. It is a \"real roof coating\" that will go a long way toward helping you reduce your roof troubles to a minimum. Our Semi-Plastic Asbestos Roof Coating is made of tested heavy bodied waterproofing oils, combined with Canadian Asbestos Fibre. The finished product is of a consistency thin enough to be applied with a brush or spreader, but thick enough to effectively stop leaks caused by rust pitting in the roof or by the drying out or weathering of other types of roof surfaces. Semi-Plastic Asbestos Roof Coating can be used on practically any type of roof surface with success assured (wood shingle excepted) if proper care is used in its application.\n\nHEAVY PLASTIC ROOF CEMENT is made heavy enough to apply with a trowel. It is used principally for patching cracks and breaks in roofing of all kinds, for flashing along fire walls, around chimneys, skylights and vent pipes, for mending leaks around rain-spouts, copings and valleys and for lining old rusted gutters\u2014in fact, HEAVY PLASTIC ROOF CEMENT can be used wherever leaks occur or repairs are needed. As it sets, a tough film forms over the surface, protecting the material underneath and keeping it soft and pliable. It will adhere to any surface without cracking, bulging or breaking loose. It will expand and contract with changes in temperature.\n\nHEAVY PLASTIC ROOF CEMENT is always ready for use\u2014needs no heating or thinning, never settles in the package and needs no skilled labor to apply it. Keep a quantity on hand for emergencies. It is good economy and a wise precaution.\n\nLet us show you how quickly and easily your roofing problems can be solved by using SEMI-PLASTIC ASBESTOS ROOF COATING.\nCOPY\n\nREGGIN ROOFING AND METAL WORKS\n\n117 - 11th Avenue West,\nCalgary, Alberta\nOctober 5, 1942.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Old Sun School Roof\n\nAs requested by you, I inspected this roof and found that the gravel covering in many places was never properly applied, leaving many bare spots along the wall and out on the roof, and there is no doubt in my mind that you will continue to have trouble with this roof until it is repaired.\n\nWith such a good structure as you have here, it would seem that the most economical policy would be to have this building re-roofed with a regular 20 Year Bonded Roof. This would be a more satisfactory and cheaper job than anything else we can suggest.\n\nWe submit for your information a quotation on a 20 Year Bonded asphalt and gravel roof (or pitch and gravel) whichever is available under present government restrictions. This along with complete reconditioning of flashings and the replacing of the broken lead connections to vent pipes, and the renewing of all sumps, in fact a complete reconditioning job, would cost $12,610.00.\n\nWith regard to the possibility of simply repairing, we would point out that it would be necessary to take up considerable of the existing flashings and apply new portions of roof along the walls, and also to check over the entire roof to find all weak spots where the paper is now practically destroyed, and repair these. It would be almost impossible to give a figure on this repair work. It would be done on a straight time and material basis, as one would have to figure altogether too high to try and cover many of the spots which may not be seen until a thorough work over of the entire roof is carried out.\n\nWe still feel that even though this roof is repaired, it would not be a satisfactory job, as compared with the replacing of the existing roof.\n\nTrusting this information may be of service to you, we are,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nREGGIN ROOFING & METAL WORKS,\n\n(Sgd) \"L. D. REGGIN\"\nDr. McGill:\n\nMr. Mills' opinions concurred in.\n\nWill you kindly advise us of your wishes in this matter. Copies of letters from Reggin Roofing & Metal Works and the estate of C.C.

For his information Mr. Walker was furnished with a copy of the report submitted to Indian Affairs Canada by the Reggin Roofing and Metal Works of Calgary under date of October 5th, 1942, which embodied their estimate of $2610.00 for work they considered necessary at that time.\n\nWe are now in receipt of Mr. Walker's report dated the 29th ultimo, which confirms comments by Mr. Reggin in his report of last October regarding the felt and gravel roof, namely that:\n\n(a) Insufficient pitch has been applied to the whole roof when it was being laid. At many points the felt is completely bare of pitch and gravel, and the several thicknesses of felt are improperly bonded to each other.\n\n(b) Gravel used on the roof, is of the pit run variety, and has apparently never been screened. It contains silt and loam in far greater proportions than could be considered wind deposited and is not bonded by pitch to the felt.\n\n(c) The felt has blistered, and in many places has cracked open, admitting water.\n\n(d) Galvanized iron flashings have pulled loose from their horizontal wall joints and require soldering at their vertical joints.\n\n(e) Roof hoppers require resetting and in some instances should be replaced.\n\nAfter consideration of the above it is our opinion that the only satisfactory and economical method of rectifying the existing roof condition of the school, would be to remove all of the existing roof covering, and replace it with a new 4 ply felt and gravel\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nroof, carrying a 20 year bond. Flashings should be removed reset, and where necessary replaced. A new wood cant strip should be installed, providing a 45\u00b0 slope between horizontal roof deck, and vertical surfaces of parapets, chimneys, curbs or other projections.\n\nThe work should be carried out by contract, after competitive prices have been obtained, and should be based on a specification by this Service. Further the laying of the new roof should be supervised by this Service.\n\nIt is estimated that the total cost of the work including supervision and contingencies will approximate $2800.00 exclusive of any damage to the roof deck, the extent and cost of which can only be determined when the upper covering is removed.\n\nThe enclosures which accompanied Dr. McGill's memorandum are returned herewith.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncls.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 3, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Residential School, Blackfoot Agency, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nI have your memorandum of August 26, in connection with the above. The question of this expenditure was discussed this morning with the Chief Executive Assistant. Your memorandum refers to a report made by Mr. Walker.\n\nOn July 28 we received a letter from Indian Agent Gooderham reading, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Mr. W.H. Snelson, of the Engineering and Construction Service, Banff, visited this Agency on July 27 and made a thorough inspection of the roof of the Old Sun Residential School.\"\n\nBefore making a recommendation to the Minister, Mr. Jackson would like to have Mr. Snelson's report.

Walker, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nBANFF, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Old Sun School roof, Gleichen.\n\nWe regret that we were unable to meet your Mr. W. H. Snelson when passing through, but from the information supplied us by the foreman, Mr. Keen, we are of the opinion that your idea might be a very good one. We are, therefore, pleased to submit the following:\n\nScrape the existing gravel clear from the paper, thoroughly sweep, and apply a poured coating of hot pitch, embedding gravel in the same, for the sum of $7.00 per square. This price is submitted with the understanding that you would supply, at the job, any gravel that is necessary, in addition to that which has been removed. Also, that necessary patches on existing roof would have to be extra, as we are unable to be certain how many weak spots we might find, and these of course, should be renewed.\n\nWith regard to the edge of the roof, we are of the opinion that this should be re-flashed with at least three plys of 15 pound felt, mopped into position, and coated before graveling of the roof is undertaken. This would give you a renewal of the edges at all points and would cost approximately 30\u00a2 per lineal foot, using 18\" widths.\n\nWe trust this information may be of service to you, and assure you that we may be called on to go into the matter further with you at any time.\n\nVery Truly Yours,\n\nREGGIN ROOFING & METAL WORKS\n\n(Sgd) \"L.D.Reggin\",\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Residential School,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of the 25th ultimo, in connection with the inspection of the roof at the above and as discussed with Mr. Founder by our Architect, attached is a copy of an estimate from the Reggin Roofing and Metal Works of Calgary, forwarded under cover of Mr. Walker's letter of August 7th and based on repairs as suggested in alternative recommendation (B) of Mr. Snelson's report dated July 29th last.\n\nThe roof plans of the school show that approximately 110 squares of roofing would require treatment which on the basis of the Reggin estimate would consist of:\n\n(a) Removal of existing poor gravel,\n(b) Recovering existing roofing with pitch,\n(c) Applying gravel in hot pitch,\n\nAt the estimated cost of $7.00 per square, the above would amount to $770.00. It would further be necessary to flash 1350 feet of roof perimeter at the tendered price of 30\u00a2 per lineal foot, amounting to $405.00.\n\nThe total amount involved therefore, would be $1175.00 exclusive of any repairs or replacements to existing felt surfaces; resetting, replacing or repairing any metal cover flashings and the possible additional amount of gravel required over what could be salvaged from the poor material now in place. These latter items can not be estimated until work is undertaken, but would increase the cost considerably.\n\nIn view however of Mr. Snelson's report on the existing condition of the roof, it is not considered advisable to carry out repairs to the present covering; but rather a new roof should be laid as recommended in our memorandum of August 25th last.\n\n(Sgd) T.S.

This also happens to the walls along the south side of the girls' dormitory room and water has leaked down along the lighting fixture in the centre of the room. Some leakage was also noted in the boys' dormitory room at the south end of the main building and also in the chapel which occupies the top floor of the west wing of the building.\n\nAll gravel roofs on main building were carefully examined. The appearance of the tar and gravel on the roofs indicates that over much of the area -\n(a) the pitch originally applied to the top of the paper did not stick.\n(b) the gravel applied was pit run and not properly cleaned and screened.\n\nIn many places there is no covering above the paper whatever. In other places there is a layer of fine sand and loam next to the paper, then a half inch layer of pitch mixed with fine sand and gravel above the fine material. This fine material has no pitch in it and prevents a bond between the gravel and tarpaper. All roofs have the appearance of a bad job. There are numerous cracks through the pitch and here and there these cracks extend through the paper permitting the entrance of water.\n\nCold or wet weather may have prevailed during the time the coat of pitch and gravel was being applied. The entire roof areas, in my opinion, contain far more fine silt and loam than could have been expected to have been deposited by wind blown dust.\n\nThe roof drains here and there should be reset and in places renewed. Pitch has run down and plugged some of them.\n\nThe flashing appears to be in good condition throughout but in places has become loose from the bricks and in other places needs to be resoldered at the joints. Leaks have developed here and there under the bottom of the flashing which is not bonded to the roof at bottom but extends out over the edge of where paper and brick meet, somewhat like an awning.\n\nRecommendations\n\nPatching in a general way is out of the question as it would be very difficult to determine where to patch as there are cracks in the gravel and pitch everywhere.\n\nI would recommend:\n\n(A) That all of the old gravel and pitch roof be removed and a new built up roof carrying a twenty year bond be laid. If possible asphalt is to be used in the new roof in preference to pitch.\nShould lack of funds for this work make it impossible to lay a new roof as recommended above, then I would recommend that the leaky roofs be repaired in the following manner.\n\n1. All loose gravel, earth, sand and silt to be entirely removed from the roof to be repaired by means of square mouth shovels, wire brooms, and brushes so that no loose or unstuck material whatever remains on the built up paper of the roof.\n\n2. When clean the roof is to be well mopped with R.C.400 asphalt at the rate of .4 gallons per square yard, heated to a temperature of not less than 175\u00b0 and then coated with washed and screened gravel that will pass a one-half inch screen and to be retained on a No. 4 screen. Additional roofing paper to be applied where necessary to extend from the present roof paper up under flashing to a proper bond with the edge of brick parapet walls.\n\nThis treatment to extend over & cover the entire area between parapet walls of any and each roof that is repaired. Care is to be exercised that the hot asphalt penetrates and seals all cracks in the old roof surface.\n\nOne or other of the above recommendations should be carried out immediately in order that the leaks be stopped before the fall school term commences.\n\nAny of the above work recommended should be done by a first class roofing firm only. I consider it out of the question to attempt any of this work with a day labour force as we would not have the proper equipment nor could we secure sufficient experienced labour.\n\n(Sgd) W. H.

Apparently there is some misunderstanding on your part as to this expenditure. You state in your memorandum that the Surveys and Engineering Branch recommend a new roof and that the cost involved would be the above sum. If you will refer to the memoranda you forwarded, and which are returned herewith, you will observe that Mr. Snelson in his report of July 29th makes two recommendations:\n\n1. that the old gravel and pitch roof be removed and a new built up roof carrying a twenty-year bond be laid;\n2. or if funds should be lacking to carry out this work, he then recommends that the leaky spots be repaired by removing the loose gravel and then applying the necessary asphaltic material, at the same time applying additional roofing paper where necessary to extend the present roofing paper under the flashings. The cost to carry out this alternative recommendation is estimated to be $1175.\n\nYou will observe that both the Surveys and Engineering Branch and the Roofing Company, who have also quoted on the alternative recommendation, strongly recommend that a new roof should be laid rather than do the repair job. It has also been noted that the estimated cost of $1175 to carry out the alternative recommendation is not the total cost as the contractors clearly state that the Department would be expected to pay extra for any additional gravel that is required and for the necessary patching on the existing roof. It is suggested that these extras might increase the cost considerably.\nMr. Snelson has pointed out that the roof on this building has the appearance of a bad job. Will you please advise when the roof was laid and who performed the work and what was the cost. Is it the original roof that was on the building when it was first constructed.\n\nIf you will refer to Mr. Pounder's memorandum of the 21st instant you will note that the Roofing Company submitted a quotation on October 5, 1942, in which they definitely recommended a new roof rather than repairs.

Items included in the Estimates were not urgently needed and furthermore were difficult to get. If, however, the roof could not be done, requisitions for some of these items will be submitted.\n\nFortunately it has been a very dry summer and fall but should the weather turn wet later in the year or early next spring considerable damage will be done at the school.

The school management is willing to forgo any expenditures in this regard this year if the new roof is installed.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, October 16, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Residential School,\nBlackfoot Indian Agency, Alberta.\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Pounder's memorandum relating to the roof of the above-noted school, dated September 21, 1943.\n\nThe authority has now been secured from the Minister for the construction of a new roof at this school. It is noted that this roof will cost approximately $2,800.00, exclusive of any damage to the roof deck, the extent and cost of which can only be determined when the upper covering is removed. It is our intention to have the amount of money necessary for this construction sent forward to you at once.

T. LANGDON\n\nFOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\n\nAPPROVED BY THE TREASURY BOARD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Water Supply at the Old Sun Residential School\n\nAbout two weeks ago there was a noticeable decrease in the amount of water pumped from the two wells which supply this large institution and in the last week the supply decreased to a point where it was impossible to carry water to the upper floors even when no water was used in the laundry.\n\nMr. Snelson of the Engineering Branch, Banff was here inspecting the roof of this school and the situation was discussed with him. It was agreed that the water level must be lowered and an examination of the pump and equipment must be made.\n\nThe services of the local plumber, L. Michael were secured and he has today pulled the pipe of the smaller of the two wells and has found a broken pipe and worn cylinder leathers. Repairs are now being made and this well will be producing again tomorrow.\n\nThe larger well will be the real problem. Mr. Snelson is fully familiar with this one as he was called in a few years ago when it was found necessary to reduce the size of the casing and the cylinder. In recent months rods have been broken and this could be caused by air replacing water, or in other words, the water level had dropped and the unit continued to pump. The well is supplying some water; the plant is shut down and only operates at intervals for a few short hours.\n\nAt present there is 2\" cylinders on this pump and there is only one size smaller - 15/8\". It is possible that the pump could be operated continually with this smaller cylinder.\nAs this was considered an emergency I authorized Michael to order the cylinder. The total cost of repairs, parts and labour to the two wells will amount to about $50. It is hoped that this will be approved.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham\nOttawa,\nNovember 26, 1943.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to the water supply at the Old Sun Residential School. It is hoped that the action you have taken will result in a reasonable supply of water being obtained. The expenditure incurred, namely, approximately $50.00, is approved.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Old Sun School\n\nTwo Y Boiler Blow-off valves are urgently required for the heating plant at this institution. The present valves are leaking and one so badly that the steam boiler is not used.\n\nIt is hoped that these can be secured in Calgary and it is believed that the cost will run between $20. and $25 each. Have advised a steam fitter to order same and would ask that authority be given for this expenditure.\n\nIndian Agent,\nG. H. Gooderham\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1943.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, the Department approves your action in securing new valves for the boiler at the Old Sun School. It is noted that these valves will cost approximately $25.00 each.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH NOVEMBER, 1943.\n\nAgriculture:\n\nVery little was done on the farms and many of the Indians had moved to winter quarters, or the coal mine, or to work off the reserve. Some grain was delivered under the quota system to Railhead and some feed was hauled to the stock camps. A large quantity of feed was cut and hammer-milled at the hospital farm, Farm B and Farm 4 feed lots.\n\nFeed & Water:\n\nOwing to the mild weather, large sloughs and the river were open. Some work was done on farm wells and a few wells in the river flats were put down or deepened. At the Old Sun Residential School, the water supply was low and conservation measures had to be employed to look after the needs of this institution. It is believed that the very dry season has lowered the water level, especially shallow wells. There is no suffering from the lack of water.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: New Roof, Old Sun Indian Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nIn correspondence dated the 4th and 11th instants, we have been advised by Mr. Walker that work on the above has been completed at the Contractor's tendered price of $2848.00. Mr. Walker advises also that there was no work which necessitated issuing an extra work order, that operations have been carried out in accordance with the specifications and that the work has been accepted on behalf of the Department, as satisfactory in every respect.\n\nWhen the tender of the Reggin Roofing and Sheet Metal Works of Calgary was accepted, we anticipated that it would be necessary to issue an extra work order, covering replacement and repairs to materials in the roof deck which would not become evident until work started. Our memorandum to you dated the 3rd ultimo dealt with funds to be provided by the Indian Affairs Branch for the work; but rather than the $3000.00 we understood would be made available, only $2800.00, the amount of our Architect's preliminary estimate, was actually transferred. While no funds were necessary for repairs to the roof deck, it will be necessary to request the transfer to this Service, of an additional amount of $48.00 before the contractor's certified account, now in our hands, can be paid.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

These toilets are needed; the cost of replacement and repairs will amount to about $35.00.\n\nThe main pumping plant needed new washers and the sewerage system from the laundry was plugged. As these required immediate attention, I instructed L. Michael to go work on them. The pumping plant is fixed, but as yet the stoppage in the sewer has not been located; the cost of this work should not total $20.00 and may be much less.\n\nWould authority be given to replace the toilets please.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nG.H. Gooderham\nOttawa,\nFebruary 11, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $35.00 for replacement of two toilets and repairs to the tanks at the Old Sun Residential School. We also approve an expenditure of $20.00 for necessary repairs to the main pumping plant and sewage system.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRE: Old Sun Res. School Septic System.\n\nOn the 8th, I inspected the disposal plant at Old Sun School at the request of the principal. I found that it was plugged and the source of the trouble was not visible. He had endeavoured to clear by the usual methods with schoolboy labour but with no results. Sewage was backing into the school, therefore some immediate action was necessary.\n\nThe services of two good Indians was secured and they started digging around the various tanks and then along the pipe line. They worked the balance of the week and got it sufficiently operative to clear the school.\n\nAnother inspection was made today after consultation yesterday with the local plumber, L. Michael.\n\nThe large chamber had been uncovered, we found the sewage is partly solidified and it must be bailed out before the system will operate properly again. Also found quite a few 6\" and 8\" glazed tile broken; these must be renewed before the line is covered in again.\n\nMade arrangements for the purchase of 40' of 8\" and 20' of 6\" tile from Medicine Hat and the Indians are proceeding to clear out chamber.\n\nThe cost of the tile and replacing by a competent man will be about $50.00 and it is estimated that the labour will cost $150.00, therefore the total cost will be $200.00.\n\n(OVER)\nThe system was installed in 1930; water plus tar, sand and gravel off the big roof has slowed up the action of the plant and existing conditions had to be dealt with as quickly as possible. It was only today that the actual condition was known. Trust it was in order to proceed.\n\nCould an accountable cheque of $150.00 be air-mailed to pay for labour? These workmen will not wait for their wages. They receive 50\u00a2 per hour.\n\nG. H.

An accountable cheque for $150 will go forward under separate cover. The school management should examine this plant at regular intervals and avoid the condition that recently occurred there.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON BLACKFOOT INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1944.\n\nSchools;\nBoth schools were inspected and found in good order.\nAt the Old Suns, the septic system gave a lot of trouble but has now been cleared and should operate properly for some time. Classes are large at this institution and the two teachers have a lot to do. A Graduates' dinner was attended; ex-pupils are showing definite improvement in their organization and the manner in which such affairs are carried off.\nAt the Crowfoot School there is a vast improvement in the appearance of grounds and buildings. Class-rooms are not so crowded as there are 3 classes and 3 teachers. Pupils are bright and cheerful and we'll put one room up against anything in this Province for singing - they're good. At both schools, well prepared farm land has been cropped and good gardens planted. These farms and gardens are good examples for the Indians.\n\nG.H.

He cannot retain helpers and works night and day over a large district.\n\nIndian Agent\nG.H.

All was on good cultivated irrigated land and exceptionally good.\n\nThe crop at the Crowfoot School is good and the garden fair. Only routine work is carried on at these institutions while many of the staff and all pupils are on holidays.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPlease be advised that the fire insurance risk of $30,000.00 carried on the Old Sun Indian Residential School, Blackfoot Indian Agency will expire on October 1, 1946.\n\nAs the insurance being carried is of a substantial amount I shall be pleased to be advised with whom this insurance should be renewed. The present policy is carried with Mr. T. H. Beach, Insurance Agent, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nThis property is in the Electoral District of McLeod, Alberta.\n\nDirector.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOffice of the Deputy Minister\n\nMemorandum to: Dr. McGill\n\nIn reply to your memoranda of September 1st with regard to insurance, please be advised that:\n\n$5,000 carried on the Agricultural Hall, Village of Ohsweken, Six Nations Indian Agency, which expires on October 11th, should be renewed with Mr. D. Thorburn of Brantford, Ontario.\n\n$2,800 carried on the Granary, Blackfoot Reserve, which expires on October 18th, and the insurance on the grain to be stored in the Granary, should be renewed with Mr. T.H. Beach, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\n$60,000 on Old Sun Indian Residential School, Blackfoot Reserve, which expires on October 1st, should be renewed with Mr. T.H.

Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nPlease be advised that October 1, 1944 is the expiry date of the fire insurance risk of $80,000.00 carried on the Old Sun Indian Residential school, Blackfoot Indian Reserve.\n\nThis is band property and while it is desired that the Indian investment in the property should be protected I have to ask that you please bear in mind that the coverage should not exceed the proper insurable value. Please examine the premises with the view to determining whether or not the present risk can be properly reduced.\n\nRenewal of this insurance is to be made by Mr. T. H. Beach, Insurance Agent, Gleichen, Alberta. The assured should be described as \"His Majesty the King in the Right of Canada.\"\n\nThe Insurance Agent's account covering the premium should be submitted to the department for payment under cover of your voucher, along with the new policy or renewal certificate.\n\nD. J. Allen,\nSuperintendent, Reserves and Trusts.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe paint supplied by G. F. Stephens Co., on purchase order #2613 to the Old Suns Residential School, the Principal requested me to see it and to inspect a wall on which some of it was used; I did so.\n\nThis paint was not making as good a job as another brand which the painter used. It appeared to lack body. The manager of the Calgary branch of Stephen's was phoned and asked if first quality paint was supplied. He said it was.\n\nThis is brought to your attention as it is our belief that this paint is not so good as some other brands which have been used.\n\nThe school authorities are supplying all the labour and contend this paint will take much longer to apply and more paint will be used than if a better paint was purchased.\n\nI do not profess to know much about paint but I pass on this information for consideration when placing future orders.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this branch from Indian Agent Gooderham. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you state that the paint supplied by G.F. Stephen's Company to the Old Sun Residential School appears to lack body and is not wholly satisfactory. I am sending forward a copy of your communication to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for his consideration.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\n\nI wish to acknowledge and to thank you for your memorandum of the 14th instant, (file 104-1-5) and Mr. Gooderham's comments re quality of paint supplied by G.F. Stephens & Co., for the Old Sun Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta, on purchase order #26113.\n\nWe appreciate the necessity of purchasing good paint, and welcome reports from the various Indian Agents regarding the quality of the product supplied for the various buildings under the jurisdiction of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nTo facilitate most complete investigation of Mr. Gooderham's complaint, I would suggest that he arrange to forward to the undersigned for testing purposes a one-quart sample of one or more of the colours. This sample should be thoroughly mixed and truly representative of the product supplied.\n\nFor purposes of comparison, it would be appreciated if you could arrange to secure for us the comment of the Principals of two or more other Western Indian Residential Schools regarding the quality of paint recently supplied by the same company. These might include the Crowfoot School (P.O. 26174) and the Muscowequan School (P.O. 26064).\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nWMV/HC\nOttawa, September 18, 1944.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a memorandum received by this Branch from the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could, without too much inconvenience, send forward a quart sample of one or more of the colours, for testing purposes.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen. September. 19, 1944\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nHerewith voucher covering insurance Policy premium for Old Suns School together with Renewal No.6521.\n\nIndian Agent\nG.H.Gooderham\nOttawa, February 11th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nYou will know that when Old Sun Residential School, on the Blackfoot Reserve, was destroyed by fire in June, 1928, that it was impossible to rebuild at that time until the Blackfoot Indians consented to loan $90,000.00 from their interest account to enable the work to proceed. The Department paid $40,000.00 from Appropriation and $50,000.00 from the funds of the Blackfoot Band, with the expectation that this money would be returned to the Band account. Owing to financial stringencies the money has not been returned to the account and it is considered that the Indians' interest in the building should be protected by placing fire insurance thereon.\n\nAccordingly it has been decided to place $40,000.00 fire insurance on the building itself in which the Indians have an interest, no insurance on the contents. You should consult Mr. C. A. McKinnon, Insurance Agent, of Drumheller, Alberta, to have this insurance placed on the building for $40,000.00. You should be able to give Mr. McKinnon full particulars as to the construction of this building which is considered fireproof. There is also water provided in case of fire and other precautions taken and it should be possible to secure a low rate of fire insurance on such building. It is advisable that the Insurance Agent himself should go over the building to determine the class of risk on which he is placing the insurance. The policy should be made to read that loss, if any, is payable to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and be forwarded here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SIG) A. F. MACKENZIE\n\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nGleichen, Alta.\nSeptember 6, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 31st ult., I enclose herewith the petition which the Blackfoot Indians signed in connection with the building of a new school.\n\nThe petition was taken around the Reserve by the Revd. Mr. Gimney at the request of the Chiefs. Before he did so, he asked me if it was in order and I stated that I could see no objection. The Chiefs and some of the Indians who are Protestants approached me at the same time and stated that in their belief, the Members of the Band would be glad to ask the Department to loan sufficient money from Band Funds to erect the school, provided it could be built this year. The petition was completed and handed to me by Mr. Gimney on August 4th.\n\nThe Indians want a school and at that time (July) were afraid that the children might be sent to other schools. Even if a school could not be provided during the present school year, I am satisfied that the Indians are prepared to advance necessary funds to proceed with construction in time to allow occupancy in the fall of 1929.\n\nIt is hoped that Day-schools can be started by October 1st at the latest. If the Indians keep their promise, the pupils of Old Sun's will continue school work as usual. Health conditions will be watched and the Church authorities have supplied considerable clothing from other points for the children of the poor parents who cannot purchase necessary clothing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa\nAugust 31, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nI am under the impression that both Archdeacon Tims and Dr. Westgate informed me there was a largely-signed petition of the Blackfeet, urging the Department to replace the Old Sun's Indian Residential School at once and asking that Band Funds be loaned for this purpose until such time as reimbursement could be made from Parliamentary Appropriation. Please let me know the facts of the case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(SIG.) DUNCAN C. SCOTT\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nOn the recent visit of Mr. McCrimmon to Calgary, the matter of the Blackfoot Band loan of $80,000.00 to assist in paying for the Anglican School erected on this reserve in 1925/30 came up for discussion.\n\nIt ran in my mind at the time that there was correspondence with Deputy Superintendent General, Duncan C. Scott. On referring to files, the attached are copies of letters. The petition is on file but nothing further.\n\nThe renewal of the insurance at October 1st, 1944 brought this to mind.\n\nFor your information, please.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n| DATE       | DESCRIPTION                                      | FOLIO | CHARGE | CREDIT | BALANCE |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Sept 19    | To Balance Account Rendered                      |       |        |        |         |\n| Oct 1      | Franklin Fire Police 6152                        |       |        |        |         |\n|            | Rat Old Sun School                               |       | $680.00|        |         |\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n| DATE       | DESCRIPTION                                      | FOLIO | CHARGE | CREDIT | BALANCE |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Oct 1      | Esanpulin Exe Policy 6152                        |       |        |        | $680.00 |\n|            | Re: Old Sun School                               |       |        |        |         |\n\nTo Balance Account Rendered\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506A\n\nTREASURY ONLY\n\nPay to: T.

Plant and equipment was checked and necessary repairs, additions and replacements made, where possible. Painting and cleaning was done.\n\nAt The Old Suns there are a number of changes in staff. This is the only Anglican school in Western Canada, with a full staff and they look a capable lot. The farm at this school was badly hailed but a good crop of feed has been harvested including native hay and alfalfa. Some grain is being threshed and the garden will supply requirements.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe Old Suns Res. School Water Supply.\n\nThe supply of water to this institution has been below normal for the past three weeks.\n\nThe Principal and staff checked plant to the best of their ability and increased the air pressure with the aid of a motor unit from the Agency; there was only temporary improvement and for some days the pressure has been low and water can only be supplied in limited quantity to the basement and ground floors.\n\nIt is feared that the water level and supply in one of the wells has dropped and possibly the table is lower in all three wells. However, there is nothing to substantiate this surmise until the plants are thoroughly checked. I have therefore secured the services of two mechanics to pull pipe and check all plants. They are not the men usually employed as their services are not available.\n\nThe situation can be very serious but it is hoped all available water in the two wells connected to the main building will be saved when the plants are in perfect running condition. If not, will authority be given to get Mr. Snelson of the Engineering Branch, Banff, to inspect it, please.\n\nG. H.

I trust that the situation will not prove as serious as it might and that a further supply of water will be available. I am requesting the Surveys & Engineering Branch to authorize Mr. Snelson to go to the Old Sun School, if requested by you.\n\nR.A.

Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alberta, in which he states that the lack of water at the above-mentioned school is causing some concern. The Agent is still hopeful that sufficient water will continue to be available. However, if further difficulty arises he would like to be able to have Mr. Snelson come to the school. It would be appreciated if you would authorize Mr. Snelson to visit the Old Sun School, provided he has such a request from Indian Agent Gooderham.\n\nDirector.\n## LOUIE HONG\n\n**Statement**\n\n- Dry Goods, Saddlery, Groceries, Meat Market\n- Hardware, Coal Oil, Gasoline, Oil\n- \"We also Operate a Modern Cafe\"\n\n**Cluny, Alta., Sept 30, 1946**\n\n| Date       | Description          | Charge | Credit | Balance |\n|------------|----------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Sep 6      | 42 C Cold 3x12       |        |        | 350     |\n|            | 6 C Cold 3x10        |        |        | 50      |\n|            | 6 C Belt 3x8         |        |        | 40      |\n|            | 3 B Clothing 12      |        |        | 360     |\n|            | 5 Small Belt 4       |        |        | 200     |\n|            | 1 Box Wood Screws    |        |        | 65      |\n|            | 1 B Clothing 12      |        |        | 180     |\n|            | 2 Thin Belt 8        |        |        | 370     |\n|            | 8 C Belt 4x24       |        |        | 15      |\n|            |                      |        |        | $16.50  |\n\n---\n\n**Library and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada**\n\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506A**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to **LOUIE HONG**\n\nAddress: **GLUNY ALTA**\n\n\"EDUCATION\"\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1944 | TO:                                          |        |\n| Sept. | General hardware supplied to Old Sun         |        |\n|      | Indian Residential School                    | 16.50  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Old Suns Residential Boarding School - Staff Quarters.\n\nHerewith a copy of a letter from the Principal asking for furnishing to equip bedrooms for new staff.\n\nIn 1930, rooms were equipped for all staff; later, a nurse was added and the Principal found some equipment for her room.\n\nNow he is asking for a general assistant, male, and a general assistant female. These additional staff are needed and if granted by the M.S.C.C., bedrooms must be equipped for them. It is presumed that this would be done by the branch?\n\nRegarding the staff sitting-room, we can think of no better place to put some comfortable furniture, if the branch falls heir to it, than in a residential boarding school; the work is monotonous and surroundings drab.\n\nRe piano - Since this instrument is an integral part of every boarding school (or should be), it is hoped it can be supplied.\n\nG.

We increased by one some time ago and in order to accommodate her I had to equip one bedroom with children's furniture. I need this now so I am without the necessary beds and furniture for three rooms. Could you please ask the Department for authority to purchase the following articles to equip these rooms:\n\n3 Steel beds with springs - 3'x7'13\" - walnut finish.\n3 Mattresses - 6'x3'3\" - spring filled.\n6 Pillows.\n2 Dressers with mirrors - walnut finish.\n2 Wash stands - walnut finish.\n6 Occasional arm chairs.\n3 common bedroom chairs.\n\nOur Staff sitting room is also very inadequately equipped. We have only three wicker arm chairs and a wicker settee for two. These are by no means comfortable and only accommodate five out of the twelve staff members. Our ladies work much harder than most people in ordinary jobs and need some measure of comfort in their off hours. Would you please ask for authority to purchase:\n\n2 Chesterfield sets complete. (2 couches & 4 arm chairs)\nThe best kind to get for an institution like this would be some like we have in officers messes - leather and substantial. There should be a number of these available now.\n\nA number of our children are now taking piano lessons and we have no piano in the school. At present I am lending one of my own for this purpose. Can you also bring this to the notice of the Department and ask them to provide us with one.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSIG. JOHN W.

At the present time we feel that it is undesirable to purchase new chesterfields etc., as the cost of these is quite high and it is difficult to obtain good quality. There should be considerable furniture available from Air Force stations in the near future. However, we will not obtain these free of charge, as all service equipment is being handled through the Crown Assets Allocation Committee and we have to make some payment.\n\nRegarding the piano, it is often possible to obtain a good, second-hand piano at a very reasonable cost.

I enclose voucher for $180.00 covering the cost of the furnishings purchased by Inspector Schmidt and also enclose his letter of the 7th instant, which you might return. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 758-76-12-415.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReference your letter No. 104-1-5 of the\n4th ultimo, authorizing the purchase of furniture for\nstaff rooms at the Old Sun Indian Residential School,\nBlackfoot Agency, I beg to enclose herewith Calgary\nVoucher No. 91, amounting to $180.00, in favour of\nthe Dominion Furniture Store, Calgary.\n\nI looked at samples at the following places\nin Calgary, viz., Hudson's Bay Company, T. Eaton Company,\nLtd., and Neilson Furniture Company, but did not find\nany suitable chairs, those on hand being either high-\npriced, easy chairs (Chesterfield style) ranging in price\nfrom $30.00 upwards, or cheaply-finished chairs, without\nsprings, which I did not consider suitable for the pur-\npose, i.e., a Staff living room. I also called at\nBrock's (Western) Company, Ltd., Wholesalers, but they\ndid not have a dresser or a suitable chair on hand.\n\nThe six (6) occasional chairs which I pur-\nchased from the Dominion Furniture Store, at an average\nprice of $19.50, are very good, well-finished, with\nspring-filled cushions, and I know they will be appreci-\nated by the School Staff. The two (2) dressers, which\nI purchased at a cost of $27.50 each, were also sold\nto me at a reduced price. (This firm are preparing\nto put on their February sale.)\n\nWash-stands are no longer being made, and there\nare none on hand. I had in mind buying two 4-drawer\nchests in lieu of these, but could not get any under\n$25.00 or $30.00 each, so I decided not to buy same,\nbut instead, to allow more money for a better type of\nchairs.\n\nC.

T. Robinson, a boiler man, was employed to repair it. He could only do a temporary job as the tubes were old and many were beyond re-rolling. It was kept in use till the middle of June when it would no longer hold water.\n\nCranes Ltd. was contacted and fortunately had sufficient long length pre-war tubing to renew this unit. This was ordered with a gate valve to replace a leaky one connected with the large water line to the main heating boilers.\n\nThen Robinson and a helper were employed to retube it and put in new connections. The whole is now as good as new.\n\nThe work is well done and the time includes the early repair work. The cost appears to be high but the services of qualified men are now at a premium.\n\nThe Vouchers are submitted for payment.\n\nG. H.

H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\n/HMo/enc.\nOLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(Church of England)\n\nGleichen,\nAlberta.\n\nPrincipal: J. W. House, B.A., L.Th.\n\nAugust 17, 1945.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nBlackfoot Reserve,\nGleichen,\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nI am enclosing estimates for 1946 - 1947. You will note that I have transferred item 3 - Pig Pen - from 1945 - 1946 estimates to next year because it is impossible to get lumber for building and the price is out of all reason.\n\nThe money thus saved from this year's authority could be far more profitably spent in things which could be procured from the War Assets Corporation - the following:\n\n1. Piano\n2. Flat work ironer - 4 ft. electric.\n3. Bread Cutter\n4. Potato Peeler\n5. 30 cwt. stake body Truck\n6. Jeep\n7. Two Chesterfield Suites - leather.\n\nRe the piano and chesterfield suites, I wrote you on December 8, 1944 and the Department replied December 26, 1944 asking us to draw this to their attention in the present fiscal year when they hoped to be able to furnish them.\n\nThe other things are suggested in order to meet the greatest problem in Indian Schools - that is spending so much time in chores that there is little time for real instruction. All Indians complain about this and we know their complaints are justified by fact, yet the Schools cannot do anything about it if the Department will not provide labour saving devices.\n\nIn this School five children work four days each week trying to get clothes and bedding ironed. One hundred hours per week heating and pushing old fashioned pad irons. The whole lot could be done in a few hours with a good four foot electric flat ironer.\nBread cutting for each meal takes three girls half an hour with knife and bread board. That is a total of 3\u00bd hours lost every week in just cutting bread.\n\nThree girls spend all of every morning peeling potatoes and cutting and cleaning vegetables\u2014a total of nine hours per week per child.\n\nMost of this could be eliminated with proper machines. The Army provided these things in their camps and it would be the course of wisdom for the Department to do the same for Indian Schools.\n\nThe reason for suggesting a thirty hundred weight truck and jeep is that our farm is one and a half miles away from the school. We waste two hours every day going to and coming from work. With an average of five boys and a farm instructor this means a loss of twelve hours every day. It also means very many hours spent in farming that would not be necessary if we were properly equipped.\n\nWould you please find out if authority is granted for painting the barn. It was in 1945-1946 Estimates but I have not heard anything about it. Paint is procurable and all our buildings are beginning to look shabby.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSigned JOHN W. HOUSE\n\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Residential Boarding Schools.\n\nWhen consideration was given to Estimated requirements in 1946/47, the principals stressed the need of labour saving equipment.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. House, Principal of the Old Suns Residential School was asked to put his suggestions in writing. Attached is his letter.\n\nI concur with him in all he says about need of labour saving equipment in boarding school kitchens and laundries.\n\nFor your consideration, please.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 30th August, 1945.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant enclosing copy of letter which you received from the Principal of Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is prepared to purchase a Flat Work Ironer, however, we would like to know the voltage and frequency of the electric current which will be used. If possible quote the catalogue number of some firm or any other information that will assist our Purchasing Branch in securing the equipment.\n\nThe Department also recommends the purchase of a piano. I have noted the Principal's arguments in connection with the purchase of a Bread Cutter and Potato Peeler but I am doubtful if we can obtain approval for the purchase of these two items.\n\nWith reference to the request for two Chesterfield suites, please let me know if these are to replace an old suite or are they intended as a new issue.\n\nRegarding the truck and jeep, this equipment is not purchased by the Department. It has always been purchased by the school management from their own funds. It is possible they may be able to secure this equipment from War Assets Corporation but frankly we have not had any success yet in securing equipment in this manner. However, in view of recent changes in the war situation, it is possible more equipment will be available shortly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Plant Repairs - Old Suns Res.

We would recommend, therefore, that the Canadian Simplex Ironer specially made for institutional flat work be installed. This is made in two sizes - 50\" wide and 56\" wide; equipped with electric motor and two Three-Heat Control Switches, high, medium and low, making it possible to heat half the Ironer when only ironing a few things.\n\nThe Ironer can be supplied with a heating element of either 110 or 220 volt. The motor supplied would be 110 volt, A.C., Single phase, 60 Cycle.\n\nWe quote as follows:\n\n1. CANADIAN SIMPLEX ELECTRICALLY HEATED INSTITUTIONAL FLATWORK IRONER, having an ironing surface 50\" wide.\n   PRICE $397.00\n   Including Dominion Government 8%\n   Sales Tax and freight prepaid to Gleichen Station.\n\nAs an alternative, the same Iron but with an ironing surface 56\" wide.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency, Gleichen, Alberta. File B/12\n\nPrice $435.00\nIncluding Dominion Government 8% sales Tax and freight prepaid to Gleichen Station.\n\nDelivery would be sixty to ninety days from receipt of order.

Phelan, please.\n\nReference yours of the 15th instant, file 104-1-5, addressed to the Clerk in Charge, Blackfoot Agency, re a piano purchased for Old Sun's Residential School: This letter was brought to my attention while I was at this Agency, and as Mr. James was not familiar with this, and had nothing whatever to do with it, I asked him not to advise the Principal of Old Sun's School until I had written further about this transaction.\n\nI have been a great many years an Indian Agent, and have always tried to follow instructions as to purchasing, and what not, and in this instance I did not believe I was acting contrary to your desires or assuming responsibility of a purchase which might have been carried out by the Purchasing Agent.\n\nOwing to pressure of other work by the Principal as well as myself, the matter of purchasing a piano for the institution was not seriously considered until I was aware that I would be spending considerable of this year as Acting Inspector, and in order to try and get the purchase through before the end of the fiscal year 1945-46, I had an interview with the Rev. Mr. House, when I told him to contact reliable firms in Calgary. I did not know of any piano available from a private source.\n\nIt was known that pianos had increased in price considerably during the War, and I told Mr. House not to exceed the sum of $200.00, which price was as low as could be expected and still get a reasonably good instrument. The Director and yourself must admit that that is not an excessive price to pay, and that to purchase a piano for $100.00 would be very poor business. It is respectfully submitted that $200.00 should be allowed: The Principal has paid more than that, and it is noted that he purchased a bench with the piano. He was directed to the Manager of the T. Eaton Company, and it is our opinion that this gentleman would see that he would get very good value.\n\n(OVER)\nAs already stated, I take full responsibility for this purchase, and before contacting the School authorities and stating that they must pay everything over $100.00, I would like to have your further comments, please.\n\nG.

Phelan, Please.\n\nReference yours of the 15th instant, file 104-1-5, addressed to the Clerk-in-Charge, Blackfoot Agency, re a piano purchased for Old Sun's Residential School: This letter was brought to my attention while I was at this Agency, and as Mr. James was not familiar with this, and had nothing whatever to do with it, I asked him not to advise the Principal of Old Sun's school until I had written further about this transaction.\n\nI have been a great many years an Indian Agent, and have always tried to follow instructions as to purchasing, and what not, and in this instance I did not believe I was acting contrary to your desires or assuming responsibility of a purchase which might have been carried out by the Purchasing Agent.\n\nOwing to pressure of other work by the Principal as well as myself, the matter of purchasing a piano for the institution was not seriously considered until I was aware that I would be spending considerable of this year as Acting Inspector, and in order to try and get the purchase through before the end of the fiscal year 1945-46, I had an interview with the Rev. Mr. House, when I told him to contact reliable firms in Calgary. I did not know of any piano available from a private source.\n\nIt was known that pianos had increased in price considerably during the War, and I told Mr. House not to exceed the sum of $200.00, which price was as low as could be expected and still get a reasonably good instrument. The Director and yourself must admit that that is not an excessive price to pay, and that to purchase a piano for $100.00 would be very poor business. It is respectfully submitted that $200.00 should be allowed: The Principal has paid more than that, and it is noted that he purchased a bench with the piano. He was directed to the Manager of the T. Eaton Company, and it is our opinion that this gentleman would see that he would get very good value.\n\n(OVER)\n2.\n\nAs already stated, I take full responsibility for this purchase, and before contacting the School authorities and stating that they must pay everything over $100.00, I would like to have your further comments, please.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA\n\nThe attached account has just been received in this office.\n\nIn this connection I draw to your attention letter of the Acting Inspector, dated April 22nd, copy herewith.\n\nPlease advise what disposition should be made of the account.\n\nR.D. Ragan,\nClerk-in-Charge.\nOttawa, 16 October 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nThe Principal of the Old Sun Residential School requested us to purchase a piano. There were several of the pupils whom the Principal thought should receive music lessons. Besides, he pointed out that this musical instrument could be used by the members of the staff to provide some innocent amusement for themselves. We recognized the value of a piano in a large Residential School but the Principal went ahead and bought the piano instead of sending us particulars to be sent to you.\n\nAn amount of $100.00 has been paid and there is a balance due of $149.00. Mr. G.H. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies, recommends that the Department pay this amount. Under the circumstances, it would be appreciated if you would issue a purchase order for $149.00.

A. Fogson,\nBox 309,\nTurner Valley, Alta.\nThe Indian Agent,\nBlackfoot Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta\n\nDear Mr. Pugh,\n\nAs is customary I am giving you this list of requirements from the Department. It would be a convenience if some action could be taken to procure these before the Summer holidays begin as painting and repairs can best be done when the children are away.\n\n1. Interior paint used by Schools management for upkeep of interior of school. This should be \"Bapco\" paint because most of the walls are already done with this brand and other kinds cannot be used for patching because they do not blend.\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Price |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-------|\n| 10 gals. Inside White gloss |          |       |\n| 20 gals. Inside Ivory flat  |          |       |\n| 2 gals. white enamel        |          |       |\n| 2 Russet Brown Inside       |          |       |\n| 6 gals. Bronzing liquid     |          |       |\n| 5 gals. Turpentine          |          |       |\n| 5 gals. Linseed oil         |          |       |\n| 6, 4 inch paint brushes     |          |       |\n| 6, 2 \"                       |          |       |\n| 6, 1 \"                       |          |       |\n\n2. Barn fixtures - repairs\n\n- 1 Loudens Letter carrier complete with hoist $100.00\n- 13 pairs snap fasteners for Loudens stanchion neck irons\n- 1000 feet of lumber - various kinds - for repairs to buildings.\n\nThese were in 1946 estimates but unobtainable. They should be procured as soon as possible.\n3. Rugs for staff rooms in the School.\n\n4, 9 ft. x 9 ft. Wilton rugs\n10, 9 ft. x 7\u00bd ft. Wilton rugs\n\nAll staff rooms have bare concrete floors and the Department equipped each room with a rug 17 years ago. These are now beyond repair and the above requisition is for replacement of these. This is long overdue.\n\n4. Singer sewing machines for sewing room.\n\n- 1 Tailor's machine = ?\n- 4 Treadle machines = $25.00\n\nThe present ones were condemned several years ago, and have been giving a lot of trouble. The above are for replacement.\n\n5. Painting barn and outbuildings.\n\n1 barn and roof\n1 cattle shed\n1 work shop\n1 granary\n1 tool shed\n2 implement sheds\n1 chicken house\n1 cottage\n1 brooder house\n\nMost of these buildings have not been painted for fifteen years and are a disgrace to a government plant. I would urge that they be done this year without fail.\n\n6. Painting outside of window frames of school\n\n237 windows\n237 storm windows\n19 doors\n\nExcept for a few which can easily be reached on the ground floor, these have had no paint for seventeen years and are beginning to show signs of weather. They should be done right away.\n\n7. For three or four years I have had an item of $900 for a pig pen in my estimates. No Departmental action has been taken about this so I want to cancel it and substitute therefor an implement shed at about the same cost.\nWe have only an open-sided shed for storing implements for the Winter, and it is usually full of snow. A school of this kind should have a closed-in shed, big enough to store any implement and a workshop (heated) on one end where farm machinery could be over-hauled and repaired during the winter months as part of mechanical training for the boys. In a farming area such as this, no boy should go out of school without a working knowledge of ordinary machine repairs, but this cannot be done without a place large enough to house machinery and repair it during the Winter. Will you please ask the Department to cancel the pig pen, and substitute an implement shed of this nature.\n\n8. Our pyrene extinguishers are so old that quite frequently they stick and will not work immediately. I think we should renew them all before next Winter. That would be -\n\n12 1\u00bd quart pump extinguishers, and\n2 doz. Flash Fire Chief automatic extinguishers from the Flash Fire Extinguisher Co.,\n10 Diana Court, Winnipeg.\n\nI am attaching an estimate from Mr. Fosson, Turner Valley, for painting the buildings (5 and 6). It looks to be a little high, but there is a lot of surface to cover.\n\nWill you please take these needs up with the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJohn W. House\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Res. School.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter received from Rev. John W. House, Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School which is self-explanatory and I would comment as follows:\n\n1. Interior paint: I would recommend that this should be supplied. Labour will be done by the school. Cost $250.00\n\n2. Barn Fixtures - Repairs: 1 Loudens Letter carrier complete with hoist and 16 pairs snap fasteners. Cost approximately $100.00. I would recommend that this be supplied as soon as convenient. 1000 ft of lumber needed for various repairs. Cost about $90.00\n\n3. Rugs for Staff Rooms: 4, 9 ft x 9 ft Wilton rugs and 10, 9'x 7\u00bd', Wilton rugs, the approximate cost $550.00. Principal's remarks self-explanatory.\n\n4. Singer Sewing Machines: 1 Tailor's machine and 4 Treadle machines. Principal's remarks self-explanatory.\n\n5. Painting Barn and Outbuildings: Refer to Principal's remarks.\n\n6. Painting outside of window frames of school: Refer to the Principal's remarks.\n\n7. Re new workshop: It was agreed between the Principal and myself that this Estimate should be properly prepared for 1948-1949 Estimates.\n\n8. Re Fire Extinguishers: 12 - \u00bc quart pump extinguishers; 2 dozen Flash Fire Chief automatic extinguishers (Glass self breakable). I would recommend that a representative of a Fire Extinguisher Company be asked to attend school, check all extinguishers, equipment and refill and replace where necessary.\n\nYou will note the date of this request and I am slow in sending it in but I informed Rev. House that this should have all been set out in 1947-1948 Estimates.\n\nI am passing this along for the Department's information and that requests Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 8 if possible should be complied with by the Department for immediate attention. If the dept. considers further action, please inform and requisitions will be prepared.\n\nW. P. B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1947.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant regarding the Old Sun Residential School, an amount of approximately $1,200 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school.\n\nWe are requesting the purchasing branch to secure the paint, litter carrier and sewing machines.\n\nWe feel that the number of fire extinguishers requested by the principal is excessive. We are ordering six 1\u00bd quart Pyrene fire extinguishers and also one 5 gallon Foamite extinguisher.\n\nWhen the above purchases have been made we will be in a position to decide what additional amount can be authorized for repairs and improvements at the Old Sun School this year.\n\nI doubt if we will be able to handle items 3, 5 and 6. If not, they should be included in the estimates for 1948-49, together with item number 7.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**July 21st, 1947**\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\n(Please furnish the following supplies for use of...)\n\n**VOTE** 516\n\n**SHIP TO:** Rev.

Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Estimates 1948-49, Old Sun Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nFollowing our recent conversation in your office, I requested all our Principals to consult with your Agents in their areas and submit a list of services urgently required at their schools. Hereunder is the report from our Principal at Gleichen listing the services required in order of urgency.\n\n**UPKEEP OF PLANT**\n\nEmergency repairs to pumping plant, heating system, plumbing and laundry.\n\nEstimated cost for year $400.00\n\n**MAJOR REPAIRS - TUBES FOR BOILER**\n\nThe local water eats through the tubes in 2 or 3 years when they suddenly go to pieces and have to be replaced. The present tubes have been installed for about 3 years and need for early replacement is anticipated. Repairs to radiators and traps are also needed.\n\nEstimated cost $300.00\n\n**EXTERIOR PAINTING**\n\nAll outside woodwork of the School and of most of the outbuildings have not been painted for about 17 years. As a result the exterior of these buildings is in bad condition and will get worse unless soon protected by painting.\n\nEstimated cost (as given by local painter) $2600.00\n\n**IMPLEMENT SHED**\n\nThe school has no closed-in place for repair\nof farm implements with the result that pupils who are going to be farmers have no chance of getting practical experience during the winter on farm machinery repairs. A closed-in shed large enough to take heavy farm machinery and which can be heated in winter for use as a repair shop.\n\nEstimated cost $2500.00\n\nRUGS FOR STAFF ROOMS\n\nAll these rooms have rough concrete floors. When the School was built in 1929, the Government provided a rug for each staff room but, after over 17 years of wear, they are pretty well worn out. 14 are required at an estimated cost of $550.00\n\nREFILLING OF FIRE EXTINGUISHERS\n\nEstimated cost for year $25.00\n\nThe Principal also recommends strongly the provision of labour-saving devices (potato peeler, bread slicer, mixing machine, etc.) advocated by your nutritional experts at a cost of $300-$400. I understand from Colonel Neary, however, that he is giving active consideration to the supply of such devices to all schools.\n\nThe Principal has drawn our attention to the deplorable state of his farm machinery, giving as examples his binder which is 1920 vintage and his tractor which scarcely has one original part left on it. I am not certain whether you help in the supply of machinery to schools that operate good-sized farms but if you can, we certainly shall appreciate it.\n\nWe shall be glad if you will give the fullest possible consideration to the inclusion of the services mentioned above in your Departmental Estimates for 1948-49. I understand that your Blackfoot Agency is aware of these needs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nOctober 6th, 1947\n\nMajor Gen. G. R. Turner\n\nMr. P. N.

School.\n\nI beg to report that on my inspection of the Old Sun Indian Residential School on October 31st last, I found the Boys' Urinals in bad state of repair - being blocked up and apparently have been for sometime. The drainage screens having been removed and apparently the boys put stones or some hard objects in the traps. The clean out is approximately 20 feet from the traps and Rev. House has caused to be tried various methods of cleaning same without results. The traps for the urinals (urinals of full length vertical type) are under the floor which of tierra construction and it will be a major job to take them up.\n\nI do not think that the urinal of the vertical type with the traps under the floor and inaccessible are advisable, and I would suggest replacing them with the trough type with the traps accessible and the troughs on floor standards. This would be quite costly and I have not obtained price pending your further instructions.\n\nI would again remark that the boys' Urinals are at the present very unsanitary.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.

Neary Esq., Supt. of Education.\n\nRe Old Sun Indian School\nPrincipal's Residence,\nRe-Furnishing.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of April 2nd of the above file and beg to enclose herewith Requisition for essential furnishings. The remaining few furnishings have been in use for 17 years and have definitely seen their best days.\n\nIn regards to the second bedroom suite, there has always been a guest room in the school but Mr. Cole is now endeavoring to get a third teacher who will occupy the school great room. Any guests of the school will now be occupying a room in the Principal's residence (apartment in the school).\n\nI would further report that in the kitchen of the Principal's residence is a McClary Electric Range which was installed according to statements at the time the school was built in 1898. This electric range is in a very bad state of repair and will have to be put in repair and I would estimate at a cost of approximate $75.00. I doubt the feasibility of repairing this range; a new range could be obtained for about $175.00 to $200.00. (Frigidaire Electric Stove RJ 10 C -4 burners on top $255.00)\n\nMr. Cole is also asking for an electric washer for his residence in the sum of $160.00, but as your letter did not go beyond furnishing I did not include this item till I hear further from you.\n\nI would take this opportunity of stating I regret the heavy expenditure at the Old Sun School this last three months but it would seem that everything tumbled down all in one fell swoop.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.

Electric Motor\nBread Mixer\n\nThe motor m/n, that has been running for a number of years has keeled over and is completely burnt out. In the emergency I have ordered one from the Bruce Robinson firm of Calgary. I got in touch with the manager but it appears these motors are hard to procure right now.\n\nI suggested to the Indian agent this was his responsibility, however, as he is new to the school work he does not feel it is his obligation. We will fight it out when the motor arrives.\n\nIn the meantime we are buying bread as we have no suitable bread mixing tub.\n\nI will forward you a copy of my letter to the Indian agent with a request to meet this account when we get fixed up.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed)\nE.

E. S. W. Cole, and pass it direct to you for payment. This would seem a less cumbersome procedure than the purchase by this Administration and our subsequent re-imbursement by your Department.\n\nWill you please advise me of the action you take in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

Pugh Esq.,  \nSupt. Blackfoot Indian Agency,  \nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs the toilets in the room off the boys playroom are in a frightful condition and most unsanitary with drains badly blocked and urinals not working may I suggest an inspection and subsequent report to be tabled to you for consideration by your Department.\n\nUnless the local plumber has power equipment it is doubtful if he can handle the work. However he might be able to present a problem to our solution.\n\nThe partitions or cubicles formerly built round each toilet have disappeared and the lady supervisor cannot comfortably check this room daily until these screens are renewed. I have made enquiries about the old ones but no one seems to know what happened to them.\n\nIt was suggested we do away entirely with the urinals (now blocked) however with 47 boys in residence I think after further consideration this would be a mistake.\n\nMay this matter have your early attention, please.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned E.S.W.

When this work on the toilets is completed I suggest you remind our boys that wilful destruction in the school cannot be tolerated. It has been my experience that a word from a Supt. of Agencies has a remarkable effect and from then our supervision is much easier.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned E.O.W.

I asked Mr. Michael to make an exploratory inspection\nof the set up and it was found that repairs could be made\nso owing to the condition I had him complete the job.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\nAttention B. Neary, Supt of Education.\n\nre Repairs to Old Sun School\nBlackfoot Reserve.\n\nI am in receipt of your two letters of the 4th June and 18th June. I have been conferring with the Principal Rev. E. Cole in this connection and we think we have arrived at considered conclusions.\n\nI would refer you to your letter of June 16th in which you refer in the last paragraph to refrigeration. I would draw your attention that your letter of the 4th just did not mention refrigeration. General Turner on his recent visit to the Old Sun mentioned that it had been allowed, in the meantime I have contacted a refrigeration man who gave some advice and Miss McCready drew attention to the refrigeration on her visit here a year ago.\n\nReference to your letter of 4th June asking for requisitions for the repair material required, as you are well aware it is exceedingly difficult to prepare these requisitions, in fact just about impossible, not knowing what repair job is until you get into the repair job itself, case of materials and labor.\n\nThe following are the proposed repairs:\n\n1. Repair roof house roof only, this roof is now owing in with the excess moisture of this past spring, and I might say this has priority. It is a question of labor with plumbing for the roof, sometimes available, sometimes not so kept up.\n\n2. Replacement of 5 toilet seats for Boys' Toilets at a cost of $15.00 each installed - Total $75.00. These are up swing weighted seats, rise to the vertical position when not in use. These seats have not been on since I have been here. Would recommend their installation. Estimates will be submitted between these 5 toilets. No estimate for this work.\n\n3. Small general repair, also locker seats, material & labor.\n\n4. Repairs to wind mill. Blow down during heavy blow this spring.\n\n5. Repairs to implement shed. No estimate available.\n\nIn your letter of May 4th last you state there is available approximately $125.00. May I suggest that you allow me to purchase the materials locally and employed local skilled help and have account forwarded immediately on completion of the work. I can assure you it would have my close supervision.\n\nAfter the above repairs are completed, we could then requisition for paint accordingly.\n\nI would like to bring to your attention that I am not submitting estimates and requisitions covering the above, but the purchase of materials will be closely supervised.\n\nIn the meantime when Major Clark was inspecting the Old Sun School it was suggested that a sound partition be erected in the School Auditorium so that it could be used as two class rooms. It would be a temporary affair. However, no doubt you are aware of the situation thru Mr. Clark's report. I would appreciate your comments on this work. If this work is to be proceeded with an Estimate can be furnished.\n\nW.B.P.\n\nVia Air Mail.\n\nJUN 24 1945\n\nW.B. Pugh,\nSupt.\nJune 29th, 1948.\n\nMr. W.P.B.

The Department approves the following expenditures:\n\n(1) Repair root house roof.\n(2) Purchase and install five seats in boys' toilets.\n(3) Small general repairs.\n(4) Repairs to wind mill.\n(5) Repairs to implement shed.\n\nIt is understood that you will give the above repairs your personal supervision and will keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nIt is noted from the second paragraph of your letter that you will write later regarding the refrigeration unit that you consider should be supplied for this school. With regard to the last paragraph of your letter, we do not appear to have received Major Clark's recommendation regarding the partition. We expect him to return to Ottawa some day this week and the matter will then be discussed with him.\n\nBernard F.

Please arrange for this.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nJune 29, 1948.\n\nFile: Ek-2\n\nColonel E. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nBelow is an excerpt from a letter written to the Administration by Mr. Cole, the Principal of the Old Sun School, which is self-explanatory.\n\n\"While I am indeed most reluctant to advocate capital expenditure of approximately $2,000.00 at this time, I nevertheless feel confident that, if a stoker is installed in this school, it will pay for itself in three years. I have made a careful check on the performance of the Iron Fireman from two users: (a) Roman school here and (b) the S. Army home in Gleichen. I have seen the stoker at the latter place. I suggest the Crowfoot school is a building similar in size with the Old Sun and not heated as comfortably as our school. The Principal of that school only uses one furnace and his fuel bill for six months was about 40% less than ours. Our fuel account for six months, viz: Oct. 1st to March 31st was in the neighborhood of $1300.00, kitchen coal included.\n\n\"I have been down to the Indian mines this week and talked this matter over with the Manager, Mr. Marshall; incidentally this chap is an expert on coal as he has spent a lifetime in the work. We can purchase steam coal at the mine for $2.00 per ton plus $2.75 cartage charges; the cartage price has been set by the Indian office. $4.75 per ton of coal at the school is a tempting proposition as c.f. $9.35 f.o.b. Gleichen depot. It is admitted that the B.T.U. Indian mine coal is not rated as high as the Blairmore mines, 9000 as c.f. 1200 per lb. at Blairmore mine. The fact that we can...\"\npurchase coal on the Reserve for years to come seems to warrant favourable consideration of the installation of a stoker.\n\n\"There are other stokers on the market as well as the Iron Fireman but an examination of detail has convinced me the one named is the one for our use. For example, the Iron Fireman has an iron-steel worm drive which grinds the lumps. Other stokers have a brass worm which, while operating silently, does not do the job of rolling the coal through and the brass worm quickly chews up.\"\n\n\"Mr. Michael, the town plumber, is a most reliable tradesman and a job done by him is satisfactory. He did submit tenders for the installation of this stoker years ago but nothing was done about it, worse the pity.\n\n\"This stoker is bin-feed and will, or would, be installed to enter the furnace on the south side, thus not interfering with any cleaning operations and an aperture of 2' square would be required to fix the main shaft through the coal bin wall.\"\n\nThe sum of $1900.00 is provided in the Department's estimates for new boiler and painting at the Gleichen school and I respectfully request that the proposition as put forth in Mr. Cole's letter be considered by Indian Affairs Branch. Not only would the installation of an Iron Fireman Stoker result in a considerable saving to the operational costs of the school but it would allow the Principal to purchase and use a type of coal mined on the reserve. Literature is enclosed for your information.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 5, 1948.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nReverend Canon Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., has requested us to supply a stoker at the Old Sun School. Canon Cook recommends the purchase of a stoker at an approximate cost of $1,900.00. He has forwarded to us the attached advertising pamphlet from the firm that supplies the Iron Fireman but he does not state the exact type and size of Iron Fireman that he thinks should be supplied.\n\nPlease consult the principal and let us know the size number of the stoker.\n\nWhen we receive your reply the matter will receive further consideration but it should be understood by the principal that in the event of our deciding to purchase the stoker, the funds used for this purpose will be taken from the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Old Sun School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nPrime Minister MacKenzie King,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. King:\n\nPlease read what I have to write and help me, I am not asking for anything, but what is rightfully my husband's and we are just about desperate. Mr. Sweeney and I are no longer young and in the last two years my husband's sickness has left us without anything financially.\n\nBack in the late 1920's, Mr. Sweeney built several Indian Schools for the Government everything went along well, 'til the last Indian School was built at Gleichen, Alta. to date we have not had a refund of the deposit which had to be put with the Government. The accumulated interest of all these years it is now quite a sizeable sum of money. My husband is ill and not able to work and that money at our age would keep us going without charity for the rest of our lives.\n\nFor the life of me, Mr. King, I can not see why the government would hold up refunding at least the principal. Mr. Sweeney worked hard for that money, all the bills towards that school are paid, I know that, because it just about cleaned us of every nickle we had. We used to a letter a month telling us that the money would be refunded in due course, to date we have had nothing. Those letters were addressed to the Yale Hotel, Calgary.\n\nI am writing this, because, my husband is ill and discouraged. Please help me obtain this money, Mr. King and thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Sgd) (Dora Sweeney,\n\nMrs. J.F. Sweeney,\n2503 15 A. St. N.W.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCOPY.\n\nOttawa, June 29, 1948.\n\nMrs. J.

Cole for his outlay on this frigidaire so that this equipment would be School property rather than the personal property of the Principal.\n\nMany of our prospective Principals, particularly those with families, are not in a financial position to purchase refrigerators, electric stoves, etc., on assuming appointments and I am certain that you will appreciate that the situation is rendered much easier if such equipment can be provided by your Department in the Government-owned schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

He reports that a local plumber considers that this would be too expensive a method because the coils would get quickly corroded and the expense of cleaning them out would not justify their usefulness.\n\nI am not satisfied that the hot water coils would corrode any quicker if incorporated in the main boilers than they would in a separate heater and, in the interest of saving fuel, I would appreciate if you could arrange that the heating engineers of the Department give the matter study at the first convenient opportunity and let us know, through you, what their views are.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

We also enclose a list of the different amounts due to sub-contractors with authorization from the Wyndels Construction Company to pay these amounts out of these certificates and also out of the deposit made by the Wyndels Construction Company.\"\nThe following is a statement of the final settlement:\n\nCertificate No. 11 $14,528.63\nCertificate No. 12 10,000.00\n\nTOTAL: $24,528.63\n\nSecurity Deposit 13,544.75\n\nTOTAL DUE CONTRACTORS: $38,073.38\n\nPayment of Accounts of Sub-contractors 31,882.03\n\nBALANCE DUE: $6,191.35\n\nA cheque for this latter amount was sent to the Winnipeg Trustee Company of Canada to close the transaction.\n\nYou will note that the Security Deposit was required in connection with the indebtedness of the firm.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJas. A. MacKinnon.\n\nPP/HM.\nOttawa, August 9, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Adam's memorandum of June 30th and our acknowledgment of July 5th with reference to a letter received by the Minister from Mrs. J. F. Sweeney of Calgary, Alberta. Enclosed is a draft letter for the Minister's signature. The delay in preparing this communication is due to the fact that we had to search our files and also had to communicate with Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Mr. Gooderham who was Indian Agent at the time on the Blackfoot Reserve, when the Old Sun's Residential School was erected. Mr. Gooderham interviewed Mr. Sweeney, husband of the lady by whom the letter of June 24th was signed. Mr. Sweeney made the following statement to Mr. Gooderham:\n\n\"He admitted that his wife had written a letter to Ottawa, which, no doubt, called for the information that you asked me to get. Mr. Sweeney claims that he took over the Windles Construction Company at the death of Mr. Windles at the time the Old Sun School was erected, and so far as he can remember the Company properly completed this contract, therefore the ten percent deposit should have been returned. He said that the Windles Construction Company erected many residential schools.\n\nMr. Sweeney stated that he and his wife were now in dire circumstances. He is nearly seventy years of age and was recently a patient of the T.B. San. I promised him that I would give you this information. I told him that I doubted that if at this late date, he had any claim which could be met\".\nOn reviewing our files at the time the Old Sun's School was completed in July of 1930, we can find no reference to Mr. Sweeney's name. The information contained in the draft letter which we are forwarding to you has been obtained from our own file.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nPP/HM.\nOttawa, August 10, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nThe following letter has been received from the Superintendent of the M.S.C.C.:\n\n\"At the above school the hot water is heated in a jacket heater separate and distinct from the large boilers producing the heat for the buildings.\n\n\"As it would seem more economical from the standpoint of fuel consumption to utilize the waste heat from the boilers for heating the hot water during the normal heating season, the principal was asked to look into the matter. He reports that a local plumber considers that this would be too expensive a method because the coils would get quickly corroded and the expense of cleaning them out would not justify their usefulness.\n\n\"I am not satisfied that the hot water coils would corrode any quicker if incorporated in the main boilers than they would in a separate heater and, in the interest of saving fuel, I would appreciate it if you could arrange that the heating engineers of the Department give the matter study at the first convenient opportunity and let us know, through you, what their views are.\"\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let us have your advice regarding the above.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to E.W.

Old Sun School Roof\n\nI wish to advise you that Mr. Jack Miller called during the absence of Rev. Cole, Principal, Old Sun School, and myself, in regards to the complaint of the above roof. Mr. Miller left his phone number, which I called last weekend, and Mrs. Miller informed me that he had broken his back and would be in Hospital for some time. In the meantime, for your information, Mr. Miller put sleeves in the roof drains, and one in particular broke down the original sleeve and caused a young flood on the first floor. I have had to have Mr. Micheal, the local plumber make a temporary repair of this. The sleeves in the roof are all made of galvanized iron and no doubt they will all need replacing.\n\nAs I informed you, considerable tar has run off the roof, and into the drains of the School and has caused considerable trouble in the plugging of same under the basement floor, where they are very hard to get at.\n\nYou realize the urgency of this situation and I ask you to contact somebody in connection with Mr. Miller's work.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch Ottawa, Ontario\n\nRe. Old Sun School Roof.\n\nThe attached letter to the Reggin Roofing and Metal Works, Calgary, is self explanatory.\n\nI beg to inform you that the running of the tar into the School sewer system, in my opinion is a major difficulty, and I am not quite clear how it will be overcome. I trust the Reggin Roofing Co. will be able to give us some satisfaction.\n\nIn the meantime, if an Engineer from our Department happens to be available, I would appreciate him calling at the Old Sun School in this connection.\n\nAUG 31 1948\n\nW.B.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\n1. On 26th August, 1948, I wrote requesting that provision be made in your Departmental Estimates 1949-50 for certain specified services at the above school.\n\n2. The Principal of this school has just drawn to my attention the fact that Miss McCreedy of the Nutrition Division, Department of National Health and Welfare, recommended the provision of the following equipment at this school:\n\n(a) Potato Peeler\n(b) Slicing machine\n(c) Lixing machine\n(d) Hood, with fan, over kitchen stove\n(e) Metal containers for storing flour\n(f) New kitchen sinks for washing children's dishes\n\n3. The Principal further points out that a new kitchen range is needed as the lids and top surface of the present range are warped and the ovens do not bake properly despite care and caution. I believe that your Mr. C. F. Clarke is familiar with the condition of the present range.\n\n4. It will be appreciated, therefore, if the items mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are added to the services listed as required at this school in my letter of 26th August, 1948.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

Cook\n\nSeptember 7th, 1948\n\nFile: Blft-2\n\nColonel R. F. Neery,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neery:\n\nOn 20th August during a discussion in your office you advised me that approval had been secured for an expenditure of \u00a31,967.75 for installation of a stoker at Old Sun School.\n\nI passed this information on to the Principal and have a letter today from him pointing out that it will be a great help to him in the matter of coal procurement if your local agent can receive official word from you about this expenditure at an early date. The situation is that the mileage from the school to the Indian Reserve Mine via the ferry (replacing the bridge carried out last spring and which will not be replaced until late next winter) is only 24 miles but, after the ferry ceases operating and until the new bridge is in, the distance involved through necessary circuitous route is 45 miles. The saving of 21 miles one way or 42 miles per round trip is an important consideration in hauling the tonnage required from the mine to the school.\n\nThe Principal naturally is hesitant about starting to lay in a stock of this coal (which is of little use for hand-firing) until your local agent receives official notification from you about the stoker installation and so I would appreciate if you could let your local agent have this information as early as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

Badly corroded threads in the 2\" pipe couplings which form the washout holes, and four bottom corners of the fire box water legs to be repaired by re-welding new 2\" couplings to the boiler. New 2\" brass plugs may also be necessary to insure a tight fit in the new couplings.\n\nThe brickwork foundations under the water legs of the fire boxes are also in poor condition. The outer bricks have been affected by dampness and are falling to pieces leaving the inner bricks exposed to similar treatment.\n\nThis condition could be averted by removing the defective outer bricks and applying a substantial cement facing to both sides of the brickwork under the water legs.\n\nRE: Boiler A3212 Cluny School.\n\nThe brickwork in the combustion chamber of this boiler is in poor condition and requires to be re-built.\n\nTrusting you will have the above mentioned repairs attended to before the boilers are again placed in service for the winter months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.A.

Refrigeration Unit - Old Sun School\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Aug. 20, last, and beg to submit the following:\n\nI would state that Rev. Coles is of the opinion that the present Walk-in Refrigerator is large enough. See his letter dated Aug. 23 last, addressed to Rev. Cannon H.G. Cook. I am of the same opinion as Rev. Coles, that with a new Blower type unit, and alterations to the present inside shelving, it will be ample for this unit.\n\nThe present unit has completed over 18 years of service and is of the old type, and would appear to be in need of repairs. I am of the opinion that a new Blower type unit, will give an effective job, after having discussed the matter with Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd., and Rev. Coles.\n\nI recommend that the enclosed quotation be accepted, in the sum of $508, that a further sum of $125 be allowed for the building of a platform for the motor, to put same on window level for ventilation purposes, and also shelving for the inside of Refrigerator, and any unforeseen extras.\n\nThe sum of $125 may not be used in full, but in dealing with this Refrigerator unit, there is always the unforeseen.\n\nEnclosed herewith is Bruce Robinson's quotation.\n\nP.T.O.\nColonel B.F.

E. S. W. COLE\n\nGLEICHEN,\nALBERTA 16/9/48\n\nW.P.B. Pugh Esqr.,\nSuperintendent/ Blackfoot Agency\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nNight watchman / Old Sun School\n\nWhile, as in other Indian residential schools no time and labour is spared here in the safety and welfare of the children I am wondering if your Department would consider allowing us a grant of $40.00 per month for six months to engage the services of a night watchman.\n\nMy reasons for this request are:\n\na) For the general welfare and safety of the children.\n\nb) While the installation of a mechanical stoker is a fuel and labour saver this machine none the less does require periodical checks as clinkers must frequently be removed or shaken up.\n\nc) While we encourage our graduates to visit their school we do find others wandering hither and yon in the late evenings and, in my opinion, an hourly inspection of barns and outbuildings as well as the main plant would be most assuredly in the interests of the Government.\n\nd) Our increased pupilage to one hundred and thirty warrants strict vigilance twenty four hours of the day.\n\ne) Should the Department accede to this request I will employ Bill Weasel Child - an ex-pupil of 20 yrs, and I think you may agree a reliable and hard working chap. Apart from giving him employment for the winter he should earn a small grub stake for the spring and summer's work.\n\nShould you consider this claim feasible may this letter be endorsed or a covering letter forwarded to the Department for their consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.S.W. Cole.\n\nc/Indian School Admin.Ottawa.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nAttention of R.F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nRe: Night Watchman at Old Sun School\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, a letter from the Rev. H. Cole, requesting a Night Watchman for the Old Sun School. The letter is self explanatory. The school as you are aware is supposed to be a fire proof construction, but Rev. Cole does not put all faith in this, he would like to have the Night Watchman for the whole school farm as well as the school.\n\nThis, I understand has never been asked for before in the Old Sun School, but it appears to be a reasonable request.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B.

Pugh,\nSuperintendent.\n\nRe: Old Sun School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your correspondence re above, and have been able to contact Mr. Miller of the Barrett Co., since he arrived home from hospital; we were awaiting his report before replying.\n\nIt would appear that the fumes from the sewerage system is eating the galvanized iron sumps, otherwise they would hardly break down with the pushing in of gravel stop sleeves.\n\nThese were originally to be copper, but at the time this work was carried out, due to war restrictions, copper was not available, and I was instructed to use galvanized iron. Under these circumstances, we believe the department should bear a portion of the cost, at least that of the sumps. We would have these made, and at as early a date as possible change them at our expense. It would be over two weeks before a crew would be available, but we would sooner have colder weather to make a better job of scraping the gravel and rejoining the roof.\n\nAwaiting your early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nREGGIN ROOFING & METAL WORKS.\n\nL.D.

Neary\n\nReference to your letter of Sept. 2, last, I beg to enclose herewith, a copy of a letter received from the Reggin Roofing and Metal Works. It would appear, that owing to War Time restrictions, galvanized iron was used for the drain stamps instead of copper, which was originally to be used.\n\nThe Reggin Roofing Co. will put these stamps in at their own expense, if we supply them. I would recommend that this be carried out.\n\nW.P.E. Pugh\nSuperintendent\nSeptember 27, 1948.\n\nAir Mail\n\nMr. W.P.B.

The following report and recommendations are a result of the investigations carried out.\n\nThe domestic hot water heating and storage equipment consists of one upright boiler approximately 23\" in diameter by 5'-0\" high with 24\" diameter grates and 52\"-7\" diameter tubes. This unit is connected to an upright domestic hot water storage tank 43\" in diameter by 9'-6\" high. The boiler tubes were cleaned last March and since the time that Mr. Haggard's memorandum was received, the pipe connections between the boiler and tank have been disassembled and cleaned. Some new pieces of pipe were installed and at present the operation is more or less satisfactory.\n\nThe boiler tubes and piping connections had become encrusted with scale, due to some extent to the hard water, but largely to the fact that no control of the water temperature was provided.\n\nThe draft door of the boiler was missing and when located, was found to be so badly warped that it was impossible to obtain a good fit. This results in the fire burning uncontrolled. At times when the hot water demand is light, the water temperature becomes critical and steam forms in the upper part of the boiler shell. Since there is no pressure relief valve on the system, an element of danger exists. It was also observed that a valve between the return connection from the hot water tank and the return connection on the boiler had been installed and was partially closed, thus throttling circulation between the two units.\n\nDue to such a combination of circumstances, rapid scale formation has taken place. It has been demonstrated beyond doubt, that when domestic water is heated to a point exceeding 140 degrees, undue scaling is the inevitable result.\n\nSince the expense of re-tubing the boiler has been incurred and since, with the exception of the draft door, the boiler appears to be in relatively good condition, it is felt that this unit could be used until further scaling reduces its efficiency to the point where new equipment is warranted, provided that the following revisions and additions are carried out.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n1. Provide and install an approved pressure relief valve set to release at 65 lbs per square inch and located where indicated on the drawing.\n\n2. Provide a new draft door for the boiler or repair the existing door in a manner suitable so that it may be closed tightly.\n\n3. Provide a coal blower to be controlled by an Aquestat set on the supply line from the boiler to the tank. This Aquestat shall be arranged to control the operation of the blower so that it will keep the water temperature within a reasonable limit, thereby giving protection from scale due to over-heating.\n\n4. Re-arrange and replace some of the piping between the boiler and tank and remove the gate valve on the re-circulating line.\n\nIf the above operations are carried out, it is considered that the existing equipment can be expected to give some additional years of service. Then a new heater is required, the blower and Aquestat can be re-used to the same purpose as hereinbefore outlined.\n\nThe drainage system was brought to the attention of our officer during his visit. It was reported and verified by our officer, that the roof drains carrying off the roof water, were of a design which permitted particles of tar and gravel to be carried into the system during rain storms. This has resulted in blockages to some parts of the underfloor drains and in some cases has caused a back-up from the sanitary waste from the principal's quarters. It is our intention after a further study has been given to this part of the investigation, to report more fully and make a recommendation which it is hoped will provide a solution.\n\nT. S. Mills\nChief Engineer\nNovember 19, 1948.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a memorandum received from the Lands and Development Services Branch regarding the Old Sun School.\n\nPlease confer with the principal regarding suggestions 1, 2, 3, and 4, and if you agree that the items are required you should forward a requisition giving the name of the firm from whom they can be secured and their approximate cost.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nNovember 24, 1948.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nWe are in receipt of your voucher No. 669 covering the cost of materials supplied for the root-house and lockers at the Old Sun Residential School.\n\nReferring particularly to the root-house, the following statement was made in your letter of June 21, 1948:\n\n\"Repair root house roof only. This roof is now caving in with the excess moisture of this past spring and I might say that this has priority. It is a question of lumber with planking for the roof. No estimate available; cost will be kept within reason.\"\n\nFurther in your letter you wrote as follows:\n\n\"May I suggest that you allow me to purchase the materials locally and employ local skilled help and have account forwarded immediately on completion of the work. I can assure you it will have my close supervision\".\n\nOn reviewing your voucher it is found that you expended an amount of $348.42 for material. Before we can have this account passed we will have to submit the matter to the Purchasing Branch and they will naturally inquire as to why such a heavy expenditure was incurred without first submitting a requisition to them and securing a purchase order in the regular way.\n\nWe inferred from the paragraphs of your letter quoted above, that the expenditure would be much less than the amount which has been spent.\n\n.... You\nYou are aware of the purchase regulations and when you found out that the materials were going to cost so much, you should have forwarded a requisition here so that we could obtain the necessary purchase order. As the matter now stands could we please have a detailed explanation for submission to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nAlso returned are your voucher 669 and attached accounts. Please submit a separate voucher for the locker materials, as being under $100.00; this can be paid at once.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nNovember 17, 1948.\n\nColonel Neary:\n\nOld Sun Indian Residential School:\n\nYesterday I looked into part# of this school and had a short talk with the Principal and later with Mr. Superintendent Pugh who expressed satisfaction with present conditions.\n\nThe Alberta School Inspector visited the school recently, but not since the appointment of the newest teacher who replaces one whose adjustment to residential school routines was declared inadequate.\n\nThe Principal is pleased with the new classroom formed from the room where a platform was originally built in. He found that the floor under the platform was harder to surface than anticipated. The present positioning of the blackboard that was installed should be corrected.\n\nI noted that a good type of toilet seat has been installed in the boys' basement, but that the five bowls are not partitioned singly. One bowl was covered with a plank, as though it were plugged. In another there was a piece of wrapping paper. I did not see any toilet tissue. You are aware of the theory that prompts these distasteful observations.\n\nIn the laundry the 10 H.P. pressure boiler is not used because (1) no employee is certified to attend to it and (2) the drier is said to be surplus to requirements. \"A good heating stove would be better in its place.\" I think that a survey of laundry practices in this school should be taken.\n\nThe Principal made the suggestion that the curriculum is perhaps, unsuited to the needs of most pupils, but rather than tinker with this, I urge a stronger attempt to place the institutional activities on a truly instructional basis so that agriculture, machine-tending, sewing, cooking, laundry work and physical education may be properly integrated with the present book-work. Some adjustments in the last would follow.\n\nOn the evening of my visit it was \"movie\" night and a number of adults, Indian and White, were in attendance. Community relations appear good and we should look to develop the school as a community centre for education and recreation for resident and day pupils (and ex-pupils). A start along these lines is seen at Crowfoot.\n\nIt is gratifying to learn that Mr. Superintendent Pugh has had conversations with the Alberta School Inspector looking toward the prospect of obtaining instructors in practical subjects who will spend part of their time at the two local Indian educational centres and part at nearby white schools.\n\nG.A.F.

When this work was started it was getting late in the season and as Mr. Cole had 6 tons of potatoes, 2 tons of carrots, 3 tons of turnips and 1600 lbs. of cabbage to store immediately, it was the expediency of the situation that I purchased the repairs direct without requisition.\n\nThe old roof was built 8 years ago, it was a make shift job, and one of these things that cost much more in the long run.

Pugh, Supt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter of September 20th, 1948.\n\nAs requested by you, the writer visited your Indian school at Gleichen on October 14th.\n\nIt was found that the extinguishers in this school are not due for annual recharging until February 1949.\n\nHowever, this school is inadequately protected against fire and our recommendations for adequate First Aid Fire Protection are as follows:\n\nSun Indian School\n\nOn Hand 2 - 2\u00bd gallon Model C.A. Foamite fire extinguishers (new)\n4 - #2 Vaporizing Liquid fire extinguishers\n\nRequire 7 - 2\u00bd gallon Model C.A. Foamite fire extinguishers\n\nIt is recommended that the four Vaporizing Liquid fire extinguishers be removed from the school and installed in the outbuildings for their protection as Vaporizing Liquid fire extinguishers should only be used where there is an abundance of fresh air and room for the operator to keep clear of the gases formed as these gases are poisonous. However, these extinguishers will not freeze.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nNo. of new extinguishers recommended 5 - 2\u00bd gallon Model C.A. Foamite fire extinguishers\n\nPrice $25.50 each f.o.b. Toronto less Sales Tax\n\nWe would appreciate delivering any new extinguishers ordered from our Calgary office and Calgary stock at the Toronto price plus freight.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nATTENTION B.F. Neary\n\nRE: Old Sun School\n\nI beg to state I had the Fire Extinguishers checked at the above School sometime ago and I beg to enclose herewith the remarks of Mr. Clark Chidlow, representative of the La France Foamite Protection.\n\nI did not complete a Requisition for the 5-2\u00bd gallon Model C.A. Foamite fire extinguishers at $23.50 each, as these are generally purchased by you through a Central Purchasing Agent. I would suggest buying 3 more extinguishers this year, 1948-49 and purchasing 2 more during the next fiscal year. This will give the school ample protection.\n\nW. P. B.

Against a static pressure of 1\u00bd inch. With 1/3 H.P. motor 110 volt 60 Cycle\n1- immersion Aquastat, electric wiring.

And thanking you for your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. Michael\nPlumbing & heating\nGleichen\nAlta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Old Sun School Hot Water Boiler.\n\nReference your letter of Nov. 19, excuse my delay in replying, but getting quotations these days is like trying to get materials - just have to wait.\n\nI beg to inform you that I have conferred with the Principal in this connection, but the Rev. Cole like myself is \"very\" Laymen in this Engineering business.\n\nThe enclosed quotation received from Mr. L. Michael, our local plumber and on whom we solely depend on for local repairs. He is a very competent practical man with vast local experience which does mean alot. For your information he has under his control the Salvation Army Eventide Home of about 150 people and so many matters in regards to plumbing and heating etc. are in common.\n\nI did not make up a requisition in so far as the Blower and Aquastat control are concerned which is to be set at 140\u00b0, I have my doubts if this temperature would supply sufficient volume of hot water for wash day purposes and to get hot water to the utilities located in the extreme ends of the building. This was mentioned to Mr. A. Hardgraves when he visited the Old Sun School. In regards to the draft door, - this is in good repair and will be easily fitted.\n\nP.T.O\nIn regards to the expenditure of $276.50, I feel this is an Engineer's decision. The safety valve should be installed immediately for safety purposes at the approximate cost of $50.00. I do feel with careful handling the present system should last for some time.\n\nI am now insisting that the hot water boiler be cleaned out regularly. I am of the opinion that the present system should be able to carry on for some time with the installation of the safety valve and careful handling.\n\nW.P.B.

As a matter of fact we are still endeavoring to procure a Bed from the manufacturers, in order to make the change.\n\nThis may be the reason that our invoice has been held up at Gleichen, but in view of the fact that we filled the order as specified, we think settlement should be made, and trust that we may receive cheque to cover at an early date.\n\nTrusting that the above will have your attention, we are,\n\nYours truly,\nBLOWEY-HENRY LIMITED.\n\nCVC/RK Per (Signed) \"C.

This account was forwarded to us at the end of November, and a cheque has been issued.\n\nIncidentally, it might be noted that the cost of the rugs was $211.00 instead of the $200.00 authorized on the Purchase Order.\n\nWe are communicating with Superintendent Pugh regarding the other items on the Purchase Order, and he is being directed to forward a Voucher immediately if the other items have been received at the School.\n\nBernard F.

In this connection, I quote from the letter received from the firm:\n\n\"Since making shipment of goods covered by the above invoice, we have supplied the two Wilton Rugs size 9 x 12 on this same Purchase Order, and for which we have received settlement.\n\nWe might say that we have had some correspondence with the Principal of the above School in connection with the Bed Room Suites forwarded with 4 ft.

If the situation is as stated in their letter quoted above, we believe that the firm is sufficiently responsible to make the change whenever they receive the other bed.\n\nPP/2T\n\nBernard F.

CANON H. G. COOK, D.D.\n\nFile: Blft-1\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Night Watchman, Old Sun School, Gleichen, Alta.\n\nThe Principal of the above school reports that the new stoker recently installed is doing a good job and that the buildings are very comfortable this winter as a result. However, the hopper of the stoker needs to be filled approximately every 24 hours which imposes an undue amount of night work on the school engineer who is required to do a full tour of duty during the day. In view of this, the Principal requests that provision be made for a night watchman at this school during the period 1st November - 31st March annually.\n\nI wish to support strongly this request of the Principal, not only because of the need for someone to look after the night firing but also for general security reasons. Admittedly the school building proper is supposed to be fireproof, but the barns and outbuildings are not, and some unauthorized wanderer from the nearby village or Reserve might do considerable damage if not detected through the medium of periodic patrol and inspection during the winter nights. Further, with the authorized pupilage now at 130 I suggest that the expense involved in providing a night watchman for 5 months of the year is not unreasonably heavy.\n\nI shall be glad, therefore, if you will give this request of the Principal favourable consideration and advise me as to what you are prepared to do in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\n19th February, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to applying for an allowance towards the salary of the night watchman at the Old Sun School.\n\nWe are somewhat surprised at the contents of the first part of your letter, due to the fact that we purchased the stoker on the recommendation of the Reverend Principal, and we were under the impression that he had chosen the stoker which would meet the needs of the school. In this connection, I would refer you to your letter of 29th June, 1948.\n\nI might also add that before making any allowance for the night watchman at this school, we will be obliged to make certain definite enquiries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nOttawa, 23rd February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Old Sun Indian Residential School, Blackfoot Indian Agency, Province of Alberta\n\nIt is our understanding that one of your engineers expects to make an inspection trip to Western Canada.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50, we have included an amount of $2,000.00 for overhauling the heating system at the above school.\n\nIf possible, your engineer should visit this school and on his return report to us what work is required.\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Alberta\nFebruary 14, 1949\n\nCanadian Fairbanks Co. Ltd.\nCalgary, Alberta\n\nI wish to inform you that the stoker, serial No. 10105-CL, size 135060-CY, installed at the Old Sun School on Jan. 26, the hopper only holds enough coal to operate for approximately two and one-half hours during severe weather. A close check was kept.\n\nYou will recall the phone conversation Rev. Cole and myself had with you in which you stated you would see that the hopper was enlarged if it proved too small.

Pugh,\nIndian Agency\nGleichen\nAlta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regards to the condensation pump at the old Son School Gleichen Alta. I beg to state that I debated the question of repairing this pump by installing a new impeller. With Mr. Alix Walker representative of the A. C. Dunham Co., Toronto, this pump was installed in 1931. And due to end-play on the shaft, and wear in the housing. If a new impeller were installed it would either not pump at all, or wear out the impeller in a short time.\n\nTrusting this is the information you are seeking for. And thanking you for your inquiry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL. Michael\nGleichen\nAlta.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Alberta\nFebruary 26, 1949\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nRE: Old Sun School\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on one of the condensation pumps at the Old Sun School. You will notice that this pump is beyond repair; I have examined the pump and I can quite see why it is. The cost of a new Dunham return pump, complete with motor, F.O.E. Gleichen.\n\nIt would appear this pump is a necessity, as one pump is doing all the work, and is over burdened.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\n\nWPBP/amc\nencl:\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Alberta\nMarch 5, 1949\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nRE: Skating Rinks at Schools\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of Feb. 28, I wish to advise you, after long drawn out correspondence with the Trust Branch in Ottawa, the $600.00 voted on by the Blackfoot Band Council, has been approved. I was advised of same by letter dated Feb. 22, 1949, of file 55-104 (T.1).\n\nIn regards to the Crowfoot School, Father Charron did build a rink, irrespective of waiting for the Indian grant and did an excellent job, and was used during the winter to very good effect.\n\nFor your information there was an old rink in use at Old Sun School with a boarded fence around it. Rev. Cole did not like the location because it left no play ground for the girls, so he took the boards down. However he states that he could not get labour to erect a new rink, so the Old Sun did not have a skating rink this year, or the last three seasons. In talking the matter over with Mr. Coles, as to location and size, as I have pointed out on previous occasions the water supply of this school seems very precarious, and he should keep this in mind.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\n16th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.F.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to one of the condensation pumps at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. You do not state the cost of installing the new pump. Please forward a requisition for the type of pump required, so that we will be able to submit the matter to our Purchasing Branch.\n\nBernard F.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReference is made to the second paragraph of your 758-5 (E.1) of 19th February, 1949.\n\nIf you will refer to the last paragraph of the extract from the Principal's letter contained in our letter of 29th June, 1948, you will see that he specifically mentioned a BIN-FED, NOT a HOPPER-FED Stoker. Had the bin-feed type been installed the question of the labour involved in frequent filling of a hopper would not have arisen.\n\nIn view of this, it is requested that further consideration be given my request of 11th February, 1949, for the authorization of a night watchman at Old Sun School for the period 1st November - 31st March, annually.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Alberta\nMarch 2, 1949\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nATTENTION: Superintendent of Education\n\nI beg to inform you that a Beaver Vorcolonics Clothes Drier, manufactured by the Beaver Laundry Equipment Co., type D 39, serial # 2780, with two separate 1 H.P. motors was installed at the Old Sun School at date of erection and has never been used owing to the fact it used too much steam. In view of the fact that this machine was not used, it appears to be in first class condition and no doubt could be used in one of our Hospitals or Schools, with a provision of steam being made.\n\nMr. Cole would like to have it replaced by some kind of a stove that could be used for drying clothes, or a stove that would give extra heat in the laundry. It extravagant to have a machine occupying space and not in use.\n\nCould you use or place this anywhere?\n\nW.P.B.

Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from the M.G.C.C. You will remember that the stoker which we purchased was the type requested by the Principal. At the time it was secured, we were not informed that it would require so much work to operate it.\n\nPreviously we have not made any allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at this school, due to the fact that we considered that there was no serious fire hazard. However, you will note from Canon Cook's letter that he is urging that an allowance be made. In cases where such an allowance is paid, it is only for the period 1st October to the subsequent 30th April.\n\nThe Deputy Minister recently ruled that no new allowances towards the salary of a night watchman could be made unless under the following conditions:\n\n(1) Allowance for a night watchman must not be paid to a present member of the staff.\n(2) The allowance must be paid only to schools which are certified by an engineer to be subject to special danger by fire.\n\nPlease let me have your opinion of Canon Cook's request.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Alberta\n\nATTENTION: Mr. W.P.B. Pugh - Superintendent\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe thank you for your letter dated February 14th, relative to the stoker recently installed at the Sun Indian School. The delay in replying to your letter is due to the fact that we have been trying to locate the Clinker Tongs for this machine. We finally found them and they went forward to you via prepaid transport yesterday, on a no-charge basis.\n\nWith regards to your remark relative to the Hopper of the stoker we installed, may we advise that this stoker is designed with a Hopper which will carry 780 lbs. of coal. Normally this amount of coal will be handled by this burner for a six to eight hour period. If you were to have a Hopper on this machine guaranteed to have coal for eight hour operation, during very severe weather it would have to be designed to carry 3,120 lbs. of coal. We believe you will agree that this would be out of all proportion as to the size of the stoker, and then too, it would severely handicap the operator of the burner in his duties of filling the Hopper. We have quite a number of these machines operating in this area now, in industrial uses, and the Hopper supplied with the stoker you have is correctly proportioned for the size of the burner.\n\nYour remarks are noted that a close check was kept on the hours of operation of the stoker, and the Hopper emptied itself in two and one half hours. This is rather exceptional, but it is probably due to the very severe weather you encountered during last month. We do not believe you will experience any difficulties with the size of the Hopper on the stoker under normal operation.\n\nMay we have your comments.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE COMPANY LTD.\n\nJ. C. Maclean\n2 - Indian Affairs Branch\n\nyou to have Mr. Perrie call as soon as possible and I would like him to inform me of the date of his visit in order that I could contact Mr. McLean and if it so happens that Mr. Perrie is in Calgary prior to coming here, that he would contact Mr. McLean, Service Manager, Fairbanks-Morse Company, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nW.P.B.

Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nRE: Old Sun School Stoker\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letters of 23rd March and 1st April and regret my delay in replying thereto, but it was owing to the fact that I was waiting a visit of Mr. McLean, Fairbanks-Morse Service Manager in Calgary and he arrived yesterday afternoon.\n\nWith reference to your letter of 23rd March and to the advisability of hiring a Night Watchman at the Old Sun School, as this building is, to the best of my knowledge, of fire-proof construction, I would not anticipate that an engineer would certify that the school is subject to special danger by fire.\n\nIn the meantime I am holding Fairbanks-Morse account for the installation of stoker in the Old Sun School in the sum of $1165.00, pending arrival of Mr. Perrie, as mentioned in your letter of 1st of April last.\n\nIn discussion with Rev. Cole, Mr. McLean and myself, it was opinion expressed that Mr. Perrie should pass on this stoker installation. I would ask\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nWe note from your letters of April 1st addressed to Messrs. Pugh and Taylor, files 758-5 and 751-5 (E.I) that the Lands & Development Services Branch are having one of their engineers, Mr. Ferrie, visit Blue Quills and Old Sun schools in the near future. We should like to know who Mr. Ferrie is and where he makes his headquarters. Until recently we had available the services of a Lands & Development Branch engineer, Mr. Cornish, who resided at Banff and we are wondering if Mr. Ferrie's services will be available to our Branch in the Alberta region.\n\nG.

Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant regarding your request for an allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at the Old Sun's School, I wish to point out that we have received a ruling to the effect that before any new allowances are made for night watchmen, the following conditions must be observed:\n\n(1) Allowance for a night watchman must not be paid to a present member of the staff.\n\n(2) The allowance must be paid only to schools which are certified by an engineer to be subject to special danger by fire.\n\nWe wrote Indian Superintendent Pugh regarding the necessity for a night watchman at the Old Sun's School, and pointed out to him the above conditions. In his reply he states that the building is to the best of his knowledge reasonably fireproof, and he does not consider that an engineer would certify that the school is subject to special danger by fire. Under these circumstances, we are not prepared to authorize an allowance for a night watchman.\nWith regard to the stoker installed at this school, I enclose for your information a copy of a letter received by Mr. Pugh from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company. We expect one of our engineers to visit the Old Sun's School in the near future, and no doubt when he submits his report he will include reference to the stoker.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Rasmussen, he stated he cleaned one well out some fifteen years ago and he thought the cleaning of both out at a cost of $60.00 each would be well worth while. I beg to recommend having this done.\n\nFor your information over the original well or well No. 1 there is a solid brick building built with the necessary holes in the roof for ordinary cleaning purposes but Mr. Rasmussen stated that the building was too high for his machine to set up if he thought it was necessary to drill the well a little deeper.\n\nI asked the local house mover if he would remove the brick building but he stated he would not take on the job of moving the solid brick building.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is possible that a further expenditure might be incurred for the lowering of the roof on this brick building in order that the well drill could be set up the same. This would be time and material and I am unable to obtain an estimate and it is possible that it might not be necessary but if it is I will further advise.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh, Superintendent\n13th May, 1949.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves an expenditure not exceeding $60.00 each for cleaning the two wells at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached list in detail indicates:\n\n1/ The present enrolment is 121.\n   \" day pupils are 4.\n   Graduating 1949 are 12.\n   Returning 1949 are 109.\n   To be admitted by/or/before September 49 are 22. Expected enrolment is 131.\n   Day pupils are 4.\n   TOTAL is 135.\n\n2/ To be admitted in New Year, 1950 are 6.\n\nIn view of the figures given above and the fact that we have experienced a little over-crowding in classrooms this year, may I suggest the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa be approached as to supplying the necessary school materials and equipment to be installed in the summer recess.\n\nThe room (now used as a sewing room) on the main floor and immediately opposite the junior classroom will make a splendid classroom. The measurements of this room are: 22' 9\" by 20' 2\". Windows are low and extend the full length of the room facing west.\n\nIt is proposed to move the sewing room to the large bedroom which has the adjoining sun-porch. Room measurements are 24' 6\" by 25' 6\". Sun porch is 9' 6\" by 9' 4\".\n\nThe sun porch seems to be the ideal place for operating sewing machines in the dull winter days. I have mentioned this proposition as some money will be required to put the sun-porch into winter shape as the radiators were apparently frozen years ago and since that time this place has been a catch-all which is not good. At the moment I cannot ascertain whether new radiators will be needed here or not.\n\nIt is further proposed to employ a well qualified handicraft teacher for the new classroom. This lady, Miss E. North, would teach the beginners in the mornings and in the afternoons she would take the intermediates and seniors in handicraft study. The Beginners do not assimilate much book-work in the afternoons and it would therefore appear a sound move to permit them to rest for three hours every afternoon.

Pugh\nSuperintendent\nBlackfoot Indian Agency\nGleichen, Alberta\nMay 10, 1949\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham\nRegional Supervisor\n507 Public Building\nCALGARY, Alberta\n\nRE: Additional Accommodation\nOld Sun School\n\nWith reference to the increased accommodation required at the Old Sun School this coming fall as you and the Department are both aware of, I beg to submit an estimated cost that will give this accommodation for the expected increase this fall 1949 and also 1950.\n\nThe proposal is to use the present sewing room for a class-room which measures 20'12\" x 20'9\", this room is well lighted with windows extending the full length of the room facing west. It is proposed to move the sewing room up into the Sun Porch up-stairs at present not used. This Sun Porch measures 7'8\" x 17'3\" which is also exceptionally well lighted, adjoining is a small room 9'10\" x 9'4\", which in the past has been used for catch-all storage, and can be used in conjunction.\n\nIn the heating of the Sun Porch apparently according to local plumber Mr. L. Michael there was insufficient radiation installed and the radiation froze some years ago and has not been used since. Mr. Michael estimates the cost of installing sufficient radiation to be $246.00. He is confident that this will keep the Sun Porch warm in all climatic conditions.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Additional Accommodation - Old Sun Residential School\n\nOn a recent visit to the Blackfoot Reserve it was indicated that there was no need for a day school in the vicinity of the Old Sun Residential School. This institution can care for a larger enrollment, and, as nearly all the families on that part of the reserve are Protestants, it is only necessary to make some changes in the building to supply necessary classrooms. Superintendent Pugh has written, as per the attached, and indicated what work and material are required. The estimated cost is $500.00.\n\nThe Principal of the school, Mr. Cole, has submitted a statement, copy attached, which shows the number presently enrolled and the expected enrollment for the school year 1949/50. With these known facts, I recommend that authority be given to make the necessary changes.\n\nThe quotation by the plumber Mr. Michael is the only one that is definite, and, as there are no other plumbers within fifty miles, I believe this should be accepted. As for other work and material, Mr. Pugh can get this material locally and I believe obtain the services locally of very good carpenters, Messrs. Kelly and Reid, who have done nearly all the work on the reserve for some years.\n\nI hope it is possible to give him authority to proceed with this work at the commencement of the summer holidays.\n\nG.

Arrangements are being made to pay this Voucher.\n\nHowever, I would point out that as the Purchase Order was issued during the fiscal year 1948-49, funds were allotted and when the Voucher was not forwarded during that fiscal year, the amount of $1,165.00 lapsed at the end of March. As a result, we are obliged to provide funds out of the current year's appropriation for which no provision was made.\n\nIn future, it would be appreciated if, unless under very exceptional circumstances, Vouchers for expenditures authorized in one fiscal year be forwarded during that fiscal year, so that funds specifically segregated by Purchase Order will not lapse.\n\nBernard F.

However, it will be done as reasonable as possible.\n\nI note General Steel Wares have one in stock at Calgary and if you are considering purchasing this one I think a wire or airmail should be forwarded.\n\nW.P.E.

I mention this now as I have to report that outside boys got into the senior girls dormitory by ladder some weeks prior to school closing. It would be useless to say a night watchman could prevent the outside men and boys from roaming around the school at night time, but at all events, a watchman on the job would most certainly stop others entering into the school grounds near the school, a mile before the main road. I would not request these additional governmental services; but, I feel, and I am sure you agree, that were we have 130 children living under one roof, their safety and comfort demand our constant vigilance.\"\n\nIn view of the above factors it is strongly urged that the matter be reconsidered and that a nightwatchman be authorized for Old Sun School even though the main building is reasonably fireproof.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

This is satisfactory during the summer season when the main heating plant for the building is not in operation but it is wasteful in fuel and labour during the heating season when water might well be heated in the low pressure steam heating plant.\n\nFollowing investigation and inquiries we are informed that a satisfactory solution would be the installation of an indirect steam-fed heater consisting of a cast-iron shell and removable copper tube element, having a capacity to heat water at the rate of 500 gallons per hour through a range of 100 degrees (40 degrees to 140 degrees) and equipped with a temperature control valve. We are informed that the heat absorbed in this equipment would still leave ample reserve boiler horsepower for any reasonable overload on the heating plant.\n\nWe understand that the cost of provision and installation of the equipment described would be between $400.00 and $500.00 and we shall appreciate if you can allot funds for the early execution of this service.\n\nWill you please advise us what you are prepared to do in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

As soon as we have their reply, we will write to you again.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Education Division\n\nRE: Old Sun Indian Residential School\n\nReference to your letter of September 23rd last asking for a report in regards to the drainage system at the Old Sun School, the report as rendered by Cannon Cook is correct and I have asked all summer for a Department engineer to be sent here to examine the same, and up to the time of writing I have not heard from Mr. Perry, the man you stated was coming from Regina. I would refer you to my letter of September 15th in which I asked if Mr. Perry was not available if an engineer could be sent from Banff.\n\nFor your information the drainage at this school is so poor that as a layman I am unable to give the details and it is definitely an engineer's job. I would further state that the drainage system has given trouble for years but as time goes along it is definitely getting worse.\n\nW.F.B. Pugh  \nSuperintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. Philip Phelan  \nChief, Education Division  \nRE: Old Sun School\n\nReference to your letter of September 24th attaching a copy of a letter from Rev. Cannon Cook dealing with the hot water heating at the Old Sun School, for your information there is a system already installed connected with the boiler with copper tube element, but the thing corrodes so fast with the water we are using in the school, that the thing was discontinued in favour of the jacket heater, and Mr. Michael, our local plumber, does not think the copper tube element would work out satisfactorily. However, this is another matter that can be investigated when and if, a Department engineer checks the school. In the meantime I would suggest that the present hot water heater be left as it is.\n\nW.P.B.

COOK, D.D.\n\nFile: Bkft-2\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nBooth Building,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nRe: Nightwatchman - Old Sun Anglican Indian Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nDuring our discussion in your office on 2nd September, 1949, I pointed out various factors which appear to warrant the authorization of a nightwatchman at the above School.\n\nWe now have received a report from this School advising that under normal winter conditions 250 lbs. of local (Blackfoot Reserve) coal are consumed per hour in the heating plant and that the capacity of the hopper of the Stoker is 750 lbs. of this coal. This means that under normal winter conditions the hopper must be re-filled every three hours during the night and more frequently under severe winter conditions. I am certain you will agree that it is unreasonable to expect any member of the staff who is employed continuously throughout the day to get up and shovel 750 lbs. of coal every 3 hours, or more frequently, during the night.\n\nIf, notwithstanding all the factors presented to you, the fact that the main school building is classified as \"fireproof\" renders it impossible for you to authorize a \"nightwatchman\" it is suggested that a night \"fireman\" be authorized as is now done for certain schools. Such an employee could, of course, do nightwatchman duties generally as well as fire the boilers and, in consequence, the present unsatisfactory situation would be remedied.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nHenry G.

Neary  \nSupt. of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRecently General Turner made a visit of inspection to the Old Sun School and I thought you might be interested in some of his observations as quoted from his report:\n\n\"Repairs - The Principal suggests that the Indian Affairs Branch be asked to hire a couple of men for about a month each spring to carry out various carpentry, etc. repairs beyond the capacity of personnel on School Staff and which fall in the category of responsibility of the Department under their \"Formula\". I consider this a sound suggestion which, if adopted, would tend to keep the building in a better state of repair.\n\nWells - Both have been cleaned out but No. 1 was found to contain an old section of casing which could not be removed. So far they appear to be working satisfactorily, but a longer period of trial is necessary before it can be determined whether they must be replaced by a new well.\n\nWindmill - This is still out of action (for pumping water at the barn) because it has been impossible to get anyone to take on the repair job to date.\n\nHeating Plant - A Mr. Clarke from Regina (presumably representing the engineering branch of Department of Mines and Resources) visited the School on 8th of October. He stated that he favours the installation of a stoker (with large hopper) on the second boiler to supplement the first boiler during the heating season. An order has been placed by the Agency Superintendent for repairs to the asbestos lagging of both boilers.\n\n.....2\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Old Sun's Indian Residential School,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nOctober 31, 1949.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of March 19th, with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Mr. Perrie, dated October 18th, in which he includes a report prepared by Engineer Clark, who inspected the mechanical services at the above as requested in our letter dated September 29th.\n\nThe report outlines in some detail certain heating discrepancies together with blockages to the drainage system and is accompanied by a rough sketch of the boiler room. The boiler room sketch shows no piping of any kind and merely outlines approximate locations of the various items of equipment.\n\nFrom the information received, it is not possible to make a definite recommendation or to prepare the necessary plans and specifications covering the necessary operations.\n\nWe are therefore writing Mr. Perrie requesting him to provide the data which is lacking and upon receipt of same, we will prepare our recommendation together with plans and specifications covering the requirements.\n\nWhen this has been done, you will be further advised.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Old Sun's Indian Residential School, Gleichen, Alberta.\n\nOctober 31, 1949.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of March 19th, with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Mr. Perrie, dated October 18th, in which he includes a report prepared by Engineer Clark, who inspected the mechanical services at the above as requested in our letter dated September 29th.\n\nThe report outlines in some detail, certain heating discrepancies together with blockages to the drainage system and is accompanied by a rough sketch of the boiler room.

The tumbler dryer was to be served by a steam line from the 10 horsepower high pressure laundry boiler.\n\nSince the high pressure laundry boiler has been changed to operate on low pressure, and arranged to heat domestic hot water, no high pressure steam is available for the tumbler dryer.\n\nTherefore unless it is contemplated to install a high pressure boiler in the near future, the tumbler dryer is of no use. If the Principal wishes to remove this unit to provide more space in the laundry room, we see no reason why it should not be unbolted from its present position and moved to any convenient storage space in the basement. Care should be taken to protect the dryer and its gearing assembly from rust, as it is conceivable that it may be desired to use this unit in the event that a new high pressure boiler is installed at some future time.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nNovember 14, 1919.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nOld Sun's Residential School\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter in reply to the point raised by you concerning the tumbler dryer at the above school.\n\nMay the Engineer's report be returned here when you have noted its contents.\n\nWe have also received a further report concerning the mechanical services at this school reading as follows:\n\n\"The report outlines in some detail, certain heating discrepancies together with blockages to the drainage system and is accompanied by a rough sketch of the boiler room. The boiler room sketch shows no piping of any kind and merely outlines approximate locations of the various items of equipment.\n\nFrom the information received, it is not possible to make a definite recommendation or to prepare the necessary plans and specifications covering the necessary operations.\n\nWe are therefore writing Mr. Perrie requesting him to provide the data which is lacking and upon receipt of same, we will prepare our recommendation together with plans and specifications covering the requirements\".\n\nThis means that the Engineer Services will be preparing plans and specifications in order that the necessary repairs can be carried out if possible during this winter. I believe that this clarifies the point raised in your letter of October 25.\nWith regard to the Principal's suggestion concerning repairs, we provide each year a considerable sum for each school and it would be necessary for the Principal to provide a specific list of jobs which he wants done and the materials which he wishes the Department to provide. In other words, we could not allow the Principal's suggestion to be followed without some control over expenditures insofar as labour and materials are concerned.\n\nI would like to discuss this labour point with you on your next visit to this office.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The tumbler dryer was to be served by a steam line from the 10 horsepower high pressure laundry boiler.\n\nSince the high pressure laundry boiler has been changed to operate on low pressure, and arranged to heat domestic hot water, no high pressure steam is available for the tumbler dryer.\n\nTherefore unless it is contemplated to install a high pressure boiler in the near future, the tumbler dryer is of no use. If the Principal wishes to remove this unit to provide more space in the laundry room, we see no reason why it should not be unbolted from its present position and moved to any convenient storage space in the basement. Care should be taken to protect the dryer and its gearing assembly from rust, as it is conceivable that it may be desired to use this unit in the event that a new high pressure boiler is installed at some future time.\n\nR.A.

Type D 3.9, Serial 2780.\n\n(b) Current Consumption - Two- one h.p. motors drawing 220 volts. 14 amps. 110 volts. 28 amps.\n\n(c) Dimensions, overall measurements; length 7', width 4', height 6'2\". Tubular frame - 30\" by 40\" length.\n\nCurrent consumption, two one h.p. motors. This is the point to be remembered. It has a steam consumption of 80 pounds and requires a high pressure boiler to operate the same, which was installed together with this drier at the Old Sun School.\n\nBoiler - TYPE Vertical F.T. boiler, 100 lbs. pressure, per sq. inch.\nThe difficult part of this drier is the high steam pressure required and this was the cause of it being put in the discard at the Old Sun School. I would point out that it cannot be hooked up to a low pressure heating boiler.\n\nI appreciate your interest in this and trust we can have the same moved out in due course.\n\nW.P.B.

Extremely economical for operation, and only One Horse Power motor is required. Our patented large side roller allows just the right amount of dough to fill the hopper entirely free from air pockets, producing a uniform loaf throughout the run.\n\nTHE ROUNDER\n\nTHIS MACHINE rounds a perfectly formed loaf\u2014without tearing or cutting the skin. Very little dusting is required. It can be cleaned in a few minutes time, as all parts are easily accessible. The Machine is arranged to round loaves of a uniform size from 1 oz. to 40 ozs.\nIT IS OUR AIM to build a Mixer that will not only do its work well for many years, but will also be prized for its beauty of line and sanitary appearance. In this well proportioned Machine we have combined beauty with an improved design producing a high grade Mixer.\n\nIt is equipped with Canopy Top, Approved Oiling System, Enclosed Base, Adjustable Bearings, Special Packing System, Extended Shaft and Clutch. The four-way Mixing Action of the Arm is an important feature, which produces a super quality Loaf in less time. It is in the medium priced field, and these important factors should recommend it for your earnest consideration.\nThe Brantford Moulder\n\nTHE IMPROVED BRANTFORD MOULDING MACHINE is an absolutely new and re-designed Machine embodying all the good points but eliminating all of the objectionable features. Many improvements have been incorporated in this Machine, and it has proved most efficient in every way. We have no use for the flanged narrow feed rolls commonly used, for the reason that they are too harsh on the dough and small pieces will be clipped off every few loaves in passing through. The work is performed with practically no noise and makes no scrap.\nThis Oven (formerly known as the New Homestead), will do all kinds of baking profitably, and in your bakeshop will earn the money to pay for itself just as it is doing in many other shops.\n\nDecks are of particularly smooth tile,\u2014peeling is remarkably easy\u2014pans last much longer. The walls are extra heavy and the flue construction distributes all the heat to the best advantage.

It will supply a large store with all classes of pastry, pies, cookies and cakes. It is a perfect baking oven for sponge goods, rolls, buns, coffee cakes, etc., and while it is not big enough for a large volume of bread, it will conveniently handle small batches splendidly.\n\nThis Oven is built true to the heavier type oven with heavy insulated walls, smooth deck tile, large fire brick lined furnace giving even radiation. The shield deck over the furnace is full tile and not merely an asbestos covered iron pad. The doors fit snugly and retain the heat for minimum consumption of fuel.\n\nThis Oven may be supplied with gas burners, advantages of which are outlined on page 13 of this catalogue.\n\n| No. | Baking Surface | Single Pans | Bun Pans | Deck Measurements | Floor Space | Weight |\n|-----|----------------|-------------|----------|------------------|-------------|--------|\n| 3   | 32 sq. ft.     | 84 loaves   | 12       | 38\" x 41\"        | 4' 10\" x 3' 10\" | 3500 lbs. |\n\nSingle pans figured above are No. 77 size 9\" x 5\" (inside), not strapped.\nBrantford Heavy Duty Portable Oven\n\nThe Brantford Heavy Duty Portable Oven (formerly known as the Black Diamond Oven), has been on the market for many years. They have been built to give lasting service and many of the first ovens are still in daily use. There is no portable oven made that embodies so many and valuable practical features as this heavy Oven.\n\nIt is not possible to fully describe the massive way in which these Ovens are constructed. Every section is reinforced, strongly braced and the heavy sheet steel on all sides prevents sagging.\n\nInstead of the heat being given out and heating the workroom, all the heat generated is retained and evenly distributed to all parts of the baking chamber. The saving thus brought about is remarkable.\n\nDespite this radical saving in fuel, and the further advantages attained in baking, the cost is remarkably moderate.\n\n| No. | Baking Surface | Single Pans | Double Pans | Bun Pans | Deck Measurements | Floor Space | Weight |\n|-----|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------------|-------------|--------|\n| 72  | 63 sq. ft.     | 156 loaves  | 168 loaves  | 22       | 56\" x 81\"        | 6' 6\" x 7' 9\" | 7630 lbs. |\n\nSingle Pans figured above are No. 77 size 9\" x 5\" (inside), strapped in fours.\nDouble \" \" \" \" \" \" 115 \" 7\u00bd\" x 10\u00be\" (inside), strapped in threes.\nBrantford Portable Ovens, Large Size\n\n\"ECONOMICAL ON FUEL,\" \"HOLDS THE HEAT,\" \"EASY TO FIRE,\" \"A PERFECT BAKER,\" SAY OWNERS OF THIS SPLENDID OVEN.\n\nSuch expressions of enthusiasm are corroborated by other Canadian bakers whose letters we have on file\u2014conclusive evidence that this oven is helping bakers everywhere to make more money.\n\nINSULATION\nAll the walls are heavily insulated. The heat is kept within the oven. Practically none is lost in outside radiation. Fuel is saved and because the bakeshop is cooler it is more comfortable for the operator.\n\nFURNACES\nThere are two furnaces, each lined with heavy fire brick. This means an abundance of heat without forced firing, and results in economy of fuel.\n\nAt all times, because of this great reserve of heating power, the oven bakes with a steadier, more prolonged heat.\n\n| No. | Baking Surface | Single Pans | Double Pans | Bun Pans | Deck Measurements | Floor Space | Height | Weight |\n|-----|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------------|-------------|--------|--------|\n| 10  | 124 sq.ft.     | 316 loaves  | 388 loaves  | 50       | 80\" x 112\"       | 108\" x 129\" | 6'     | 10,000 lbs. |\n\nSingle Pans figured above are No. 77 size 9\" x 5\" (inside), strapped in fours.\nDouble \" \" \" \" \" \" 115 \" 7\u00bd\" x 10\u00be\" (inside), strapped in threes.\n**PAN TRUCK**\nHeavy steel frame capable of handling large quantity of empty pans with ease.

Through the wonderful heat-conducting and radiating qualities of this famous construction, amazing results have been secured.\n\nHi-Speed Element\nHotpoint Feature\n\nThe Hotpoint Hi-Speed Element has been proven, by actual test, the fastest electric range heating element on the market.\n\nAll Hotpoint Ranges are now equipped with two Hi Speed Elements for fast cooking operations. The remainder, of course, are the famous cast-in type of Calrod Heating Element which has proven the most practicable construction possible for all ordinary cooking requirements.\n\nHi-Speed Elements can be obtained only on Hotpoint Ranges. They are an exclusive patent and have rendered all other types of so-called \"speed elements\" obsolete.\nPatented Calrod (Sheathed Wire) Elements\n\nElectric cookery has been denied many homes because of the persistent expense due to service and replacement of the heating elements.\n\nExhaustive experiments and tests have been conducted in the Research Laboratories of the Canadian Cement Electric Co., Limited, in an endeavour to produce an electric range element which would be practically indestructible. The element here illustrated is the outcome of these experiments. The heating element wire is surrounded by an insulating powder and enclosed in a metal tube or sheath. The element sections are then wound into a circular form and are CAST IN SOLID IRON, thus forming a complete self-contained element which is practically indestructible.\n\nPatented Calrod (Sheathed Wire) Oven Elements\n\nIn this construction the element sections are wound into a form which will give the most even distribution of heat. They are then set into a welded steel frame which will neither buckle nor warp. The steel frame is formed into a guide which makes the withdrawal and replacement of elements simple.\n\nThe Terminal Construction is such as to make contact solid and positive. Calrod Oven Elements are Standard in all Hotpoint Ranges.\n\nOven Linings\n\nAll oven linings are full vitreous enamel.\nAutomatic Oven Control\n\nThink of a range with an \"Electric Timer\" that turns the oven on automatically when the cooking is to be started and turns it off when the food is cooked\u2014all without care or attention.\n\nThink of a range that has \"heat control\" which automatically maintains the oven at just the right temperature for the food being cooked\u2014just right\u2014neither too hot nor too cool.\n\nThis is what Hotpoint gives you in its Super-Automatic Ranges\u2014the last word in range construction\u2014the finest, most modern electric ranges manufactured.\n\nThe Hotpoint \"Electric Timer\" and \"Heat Control\" start and stop the cooking operation and maintain an even and accurate oven temperature.\n\nHotpoint Economy Cooker\n\nCat.

Simplex Bulletin Boards and Tack Strips are placed above and at the ends of the blackboards in panels and strips; also in panels in doors and partitions.\n\nSimplex Bulletin Boards are uniform 1/4-in. thickness, pressed cork of uniform color and resiliency with butt-joint backing. The cork surface holds pins or thumbtacks securely and does not show holes when tacks are removed.\n\nSimplex Bulletin Boards do not warp or buckle, and when soiled can be cleaned easily with soap and water.

The modern way of joining blackboards. It is necessary to use more than one piece on long walls.\n\nIllustration shows how Simplex Joining Strips are fitted to the blackboard.\n\nThe illustration shows the proper method of covering joints on large writing spaces when more than one piece of blackboard is required. The joint is covered entirely with the moulding \"hump\" produced by the joining strip. This is the only method of joining composition blackboards. The installation is simple and requires only a few minutes. First cut the two strips to length, preferably before fitting them to the two blackboards. Then fit them together and hold them in place. Make several joints in the width of blackboard. See the illustration.\n\nJoining strips are finished to match color of the blackboards, thus making one continuous writing surface.\n\nThe Permanent Blackboard\n\nCANADA SEATING COMPANY\n311 HARPER BLDG.\nWINNIPEG\nMANITOBA\nYOU WILL FIND SLATEBESTOS ALL THAT WE CLAIM FOR IT\n\nA Tested, Superior Blackboard\n\nSlatebestos has established a new standard of blackboard excellence by practical proof and demonstration of its durability, economy and desirability.\n\nHow Slatebestos is Made\n\nThe base of Slatebestos consists of asbestos fibre, hard minerals and cement, united under a tremendous pressure of 24,000 lbs. to the square foot.\n\nSlatebestos has great tensile strength because of the fine, extra tough, clean, selected asbestos fibres employed in its manufacture, which preclude any tendency to buckle or warp.\n\nSlatebestos contains a special, high grade cement mixture with hard minerals, which improve with time. In fact, it actually becomes tougher and harder the longer it is used.\n\nSlatebestos is as hard as rock, possesses extreme density with almost no expansion. It is built solid throughout its full 1/2\" thickness.\n\nPerfect Writing Surface and Color\n\nThe writing surface of Slatebestos is produced through a series of liquid blackboard surfacing coats, which penetrate the body of the board. The result is to apply each coat and then rub it down, thus building up the incomparable, velvet-like, non-reflecting, dark slate color writing surface.\n\nThe result is ideal for rapid legible writing. The chalk marking surface contains just enough \"slip\" to cut crayons without noise and makes a clean, white, sharp mark, which can be plainly seen from all parts of the schoolroom without eyestrain. Erasures can be made easily and rapidly.\n\nJust a few of the many good reasons why Slatebestos has the advantage over other types of Blackboards\n\nMORE ENDURING: Slatebestos actually improves with age. It will render years of satisfactory service. It is fire-resistant and asbestos and related to Slatebestos is the greatest fire-resisting and enduring blackboard on the market today.\n\nNO BREAKAGE: Because Slatebestos possesses elasticity, it is subject to practically no breakage. Users of natural slate know from experience a shipment seldom arrives in perfect condition, with consequent difficulties and expense.\n\nLOWER LENGTHS: Slatebestos is manufactured in long lengths up to 8 feet. Hence it requires fewer joints. You are assured of a more continuous and better writing surface.\n\nLOW UPKEEP: Slatebestos surface is perfect and uniform and remains so indefinitely. Refinishing is infrequent and far less costly than slate. When necessary it can be done at a very small expense. Cost of maintenance is reduced to a minimum.\n\nSAMPLES AND PRICES UPON REQUEST\n\nPermanent, Durable, Dependable\n\nThere is no better blackboard made than Slatebestos for installation in new schools or for replacement in old ones where a permanent blackboard is required.\n\nLow Cost \u2014 Saving in Freight\n\nSlatebestos costs considerably less per square foot than natural slate. Your cost of installation is much less. But that is only a part of the actual saving. You pay freight on two-thirds less weight. There is little or no breakage, no inconvenience, no delays. And above all you have a better blackboard.\n\nSizes and Widths\n\nSlatebestos is made in standard widths of 3\u00bd and 4 feet, and in any length up to and including 8 feet. Any desired length will be cut, but a fraction of a foot is charged as a full foot. Slatebestos is \u00bc\" thick and weighs 2\u00bd lbs. to the square foot.\n\nEasily and Quickly Installed\n\nSlatebestos can be installed over any kind of even wall or plastered, stone, brick or tile. Joints can be made secure with Simplex Joining Strips, so that writing over them is always possible, thus forming a continuous writing surface.\n\nWe furnish complete directions for the installation of Slatebestos\u2014directions so simple that it is possible for any one to install it.\n\nService\n\nSlatebestos is carried in stock in Chicago and immediate shipments are assured.\n\nWe have a thoroughly efficient Service Department, competent to advise in all questions pertaining to blackboards.

LITTLE,\nSecretary,\n2 Victoria Park Building, Regina, Sask.\n\"CANADA\" STEEL DESKS\n(The Best Desk Made)\n\nA Word about Construction and Design\n\nIn designing and constructing its product, the CANADA Seating Company has been guided constantly by the ideas and standards of experts in education and national authorities. There are no mere theories embodied in Steel School Room equipment.\n\nStructural steel is used wherever possible for lightness and strength. The lightness saves 30 per cent of freight costs and facilitates moving about in the school room when necessary. Its great strength impresses abroad as being unequal to shipment or in long, hard service in actual use.\n\nFixed School Desks\n\nThe CANADA Combination Desk is known the entire country over because of its flawless design and enduring service.\n\nThe CANADA line of Adjustable Desks has adjustments that are both positive and simple. Once locked into the proper position, the wandering fingers of curious students cannot alter its height. The CANADA High School Desk has the same adjustment feature and restless little bodies can squirm about at will without annoying the students directly in front or behind.\n\nThe design is free from meaningless curves and scrolls, which might tear clothing and catch dust and germs. The lines are clean and dignified proportions which are in keeping with the finest surroundings and modern ideas of aesthetic fitness.\n\nThe smooth steel and carefully selected and seasoned woods are finished with the best of materials. Baked on enamel on the steel parts and fine varnish on the wooden construction will give enduring service.\n\nMovable School Desks\n\nDemand on Movable in school desks is increasing due to changes in type of school building construction, especially class-room teaching methods. The old-fashioned school desk being used occasionally for social gatherings. The 192 Steel Movable Chair Desk has been developed after extensive trials and experimentation to fill this growing need.\n\nThe old-fashioned cast iron desk is fast going out, and the steel desk taking its place.\n\nTHERE ARE IMITATIONS, BUT THERE IS NOT A DESK MADE EQUAL IN QUALITY TO THE CANADA STEEL DESK\nThe Finest Development of the Movable Chair Desk.\n\nOrder these Steel Chair Desks If You Want the Best in This Line.\n\nNo. 192\n\nCan be furnished without Book Drawer.\n\nPosture proof, correctly designed.\nAll wood parts, seat, back slat and desk top, plywood construction.\nFrame work of angle steel, absolutely rigid.\nBook drawer under seat with wood plywood bottom.\nPencil groove in book drawer.\nNoiseless feet.\n\nDesk top has three adjustments for height, 3 inches each.\nGreen enamel on steel parts.\nWalnut finish on wood parts.\nShipped knocked down.

It will render years of satisfactory service. Due to its composition of labored and studied composition it is the greatest fire-resisting and enduring blackboard on the market today.\n\nNO BREAKAGE\u2014Because Slatebestos is made of clay, it is subject to practically no breakage. Users of natural slate know how perfectly a shipment from them arrives in perfect condition, with consequent delays, expense and annoyance.\n\nLOW MAINTENANCE\u2014Slatebestos surface is perfectly uniform and remains so indefinitely. Refinishing is infrequent and far less costly than slate. When necessary it can be done at a very small expense. Cost of maintenance is reduced to a minimum.\n\nThe writing surface of slatebestos is produced through a series of liquid blackboards and enamels, which constitute the body of the board. The method is to apply each coat and then rub it down, thus building up the incomparable, velvet-like, non-reflecting, dark slate color writing surface.\n\nYour writing is ideal for rapid legible writing. The chalk marking surface contains just enough chalk to cut cleanly, without noise and makes a clean, white, sharp mark which can be placed on any part of the schoolroom without eyestrain. Erasures can be made easily and rapidly.\n\nWe guarantee SLATEBESTOS blackboard, when properly installed and used according to the printed instructions to give satisfactory service during the life of the school building.\n\nPrice per sq. ft. ........................................... $50\nLength to 8 feet Widths 3\u00bd and 4 ft.\n\nSLATOPlate\u2014\"AS GOOD AS THE BEST\" FOR LESS\n\nThe Slatoplate has exactly the same merits and advantages found in blackboards of similar ingredients and namesake. It is also guaranteed, providing it is properly installed according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\nBlack, per square foot .................................. $31\nGreen, per square foot .................................... $32\nNo charge for crating.\n\nWidths: 3\u00bd and 4 ft.

CANADA shades are the standard to which all other adjustable shades are compared. Note the important features:\n\n1. Adjustable\u2014May be controlled from the top as well as from the bottom.\n2. Sanitary\u2014Exclusive control features keep hands off touching shade surfaces made of fabric, and permit free ventilation through any portion of window.\n3. Durable\u2014The shade is made of materials throughout; may be expected to outlast the ordinary old-fashioned shades.\n\nThis shade is simple in construction and is a popular type in schools and public buildings. It can be further improved by overlapping the window casings, thus to hang between the casings, as may be desired. It is controlled by means of a cord and automatic lock pulley. It is simple in construction and requires no intricate parts to keep out of order.\n\nTranslucent Adjustable Folding Shades\n\n| Inches | Width | Length |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| No. 5/20 | 60 | $2.95 |\n| No. 10-24 | 66 | $3.00 |\n| No. 15-24 | 72 | $3.25 |\n| No. 20-26 | 72 | $3.60 |\n| No. 25-32 | 72 | $3.75 |\n| No. 30-34 | 72 | $4.00 |\n| No. 36-40 | 84 | $4.40 |\n| No. 45-34 | 84 | $4.75 |\n| No. 50-36 | 84 | $5.75 |\n| No. 50-40 | 84 | $6.00 |\n\nImportant\u2014Be sure to specify whether inside or outside height is required\u2014send exact measurements of full sized window between casing and shade.

We assure absolute satisfaction. We strongly recommend to place top of tank away from house. The tank may be emptied by draining into cesspits or pumped out through a finished basement building. Cesspit should not be nearer than fifty feet from well.\n\nTank in Basement\n\nIn Figure 5 we show a splendid model for installing tanks.\n\nIt is best to support tank on strong scaffolding in basement although it may be hung from joists. If the structure is built if building is strong enough to support the weight (over half a ton) without settling. A cesspit can very easily be built to drain contents into.\n\nTank Under Basement\n\nBasement installations must be carried out in such a way as to avoid any possibility of leakage. An ordinary plunger pump will satisfactorily empty tanks up to 375 gallons capacity. In installations, as in schools, should empty tanks fitted with heavy duty pump. Chimney Ventilation is possible when there are no other openings above our connection into chimney.\n\nOther installations can be arranged. Correspondence invited.\nSTANDARD SPECIFICATION\nNo. 125C\n\nThe following standard equipment is furnished with a single bowl system and is sufficient to make the installation on the ground floor of a one-story building:\n\n1.

Mr. Gibney,\nPrincipal, Old Sun's School,\nGleichen, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe understand that you are in the market for a quantity of School furniture, and we enclose herewith, one of our catalogues, and literature illustrating our lines.\n\nThe prices quoted in the catalogue are, of course, subject to discount for quantities, but as we are not in possession of the specifications of your requirements, we cannot give you exact prices. We have in Calgary, samples of desks etc., and if necessary we could bring one or two on to Gleichen for your inspection.\n\nThe Canada Seating Co. is the official Supply House for the Saskatchewan School Trustees' Association, and has also supplied considerable quantities of desks etc., to the Calgary and other large School Boards. We specialize in steel-pressed school furniture, believing this far superior to the cast-iron. However, if you would prefer cast-iron, we can quote you prices on it. We also sell a complete line of Folding Chairs and Auditorium furniture.\n\nIf you will forward us your specifications, we will give you a tender on the whole contract.\n\nShould you require any further information, kindly write, or 'phone this office at our expense.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCANADA SEATING COMPANY,\n\nfor W. H. Adhead,\nAlberta Representative.\n\nOFFICIAL DISTRIBUTORS FOR THE SASKATCHEWAN SCHOOL TRUSTEES ASS'N\nMASSEY-HARRIS ELECTRIC CREAM SEPARATOR\n\nMade in Four Sizes - 400, 500, 700 and 900 lbs.\n\nWHEN electric power is available the Massey-Harris Electric Cream Separator is the ideal equipment. It is a very close skimmer under any conditions\u2014in fact, even when running cold milk it gives splendid results. It is dependable, simple and convenient to operate and possesses several exclusive features which make it the favorite of experienced dairymen.\n\nCompact in Design\nAll the attachments are mounted on the Separator\u2014no motor or Governor Pulley on the floor.\n\nPowerful, Efficient Motor\nEquipped with special type motor\u2014ideal for use with cream separator.\n\nTakes Up Little Room\nNeat and compact\u2014easy to work around.\n\nReliable Speed Indicator\nAutomatic indicator tells when proper speed is reached. There is no guesswork with the Massey-Harris.\n\nCertain Control\nThe Governor Pulley may be set to run at any speed and always exercises absolute control.\n\nIf you have electric power or your farm do not fail to ask your local Massey-Harris Agent for all information about this wonderful Separator. Ask for a demonstration; you will readily see how this machine saves you money.\nTHE FOUR BIG FEATURES\n\nCleanliness, Close Skimming, Easy Turning, Reliability for Long Service\u2014these are the features a Cream Separator must have to ensure correct and profitable separation.\n\nMASSEY-HARRIS No 6 CREAM SEPARATOR HAS THEM ALL\n\nEvery day in the year you use your Separator. It must be always ready to give prompt and reliable service when you want it. And you have a right to expect this service for many years. That is the kind of service the Massey-Harris No. 6 Cream Separator is giving to users on thousands of farms in all parts of Canada today.\n\n1. Cleanliness\n\nAll parts are designed for simplicity and ease of taking apart for thorough cleaning.\n\nSeamless Tank\n\nThe supply tank is drawn from a single sheet of steel. There are no seams or corners and the bottom is evenly rounded so that dirt will not cling. The bulging sides are specially designed to prevent the milk splashing over when poured in. All other tinware is substantially made of steel heavily tinned. They are easily kept clean with brushes which are provided for the purpose.\n\nConvenient Disc Holder\n\nThe discs are removed as one piece by means of our improved disc holder which is furnished free with each separator. They are easily and quickly washed and hung up to dry.\n\nSeparate Spindle\n\nFor ease of handling the bowl is separate from the spindle. When wanted for washing it simply lifts off. This possesses many advantages over separators which have their spindles solidly attached.\n\nHow to Keep Separator Clean\n\nAfter using, wash bowl and tinware thoroughly in luke warm water (not boiling) and brush thoroughly with the brush that is provided. Then rinse in boiling water, which cleanses and sterilizes, and hang up to dry. If this method is followed the separator will be sweet and clean\u2014always.\n\n2. Close Skimming\n\nThe Massey-Harris No. 6 Cream Separator is famous for close skimming.\n\nBowl Skims Close\n\nThe bowl is so designed that it skims close under the most difficult conditions. Even when running a thick cream with cold milk there is no possibility of clogging, and only the merest trace of cream is left in the skim milk.\n\n6 V-shape Openings Make for Better Skimming\n\nNo Re-Mixing\n\nBoth the skim milk and cream have clearly defined courses and there is consequently no struggle or conflict between the two. They cannot re-mix after being separated so no additional effort is required or loss of butterfat results.\n\nThe Cream Screw\n\nThe density of the cream can be easily and quickly regulated by means of the cream screw. Once set this setting needs no attention whatsoever unless it is decided to vary the thickness of the cream. There is no tendency to clog, no matter how thick the cream may be.\n\n3. Easy Turning\n\nOwing to its smooth-running gears, simple positive clutch and other refinements of mechanical design, the Massey-Harris Cream Separator has a widely-known reputation for easy running. In actual dynamometer tests these famous separators have always shown their superiority in this respect. In one instance, with a Massey-Harris machine was tested against a slightly smaller machine of another make, the difference was approximately 25% in favor of the Massey-Harris Separator. This difference persisted when the machines were empty or empty. Every dairyman will realize that this represents a considerable saving in the amount of power or daily hand labor necessary.\n\nMilk Evenly Distributed Over Discs\n\nThe split-wing with its 6 V-shaped openings\u2014more than on any other separator\u2014delivers the milk to the disc in such a way as to give more even and better distribution over the entire skimming area, making for easier turning and closer skimming.\n\n4. Reliability and Long Life\n\nChief among the main features of the Massey-Harris No. 6 Cream Separator are its reliability and long service under all conditions. All parts are so strong and well made that the adjustments are permanent, and uniform results may be relied upon at all times for many years.\n\nSpring Cushion Bearing\n\nSmooth running at the bowl is always assured by our improved spring cushion bowl spindle bearing. It is designed to allow for the swaying motion of the bowl when it is not skimming at full speed.\n\nStrong Main Frame\n\nThe main frame is very strong. It is cast in one piece and holds all bearings in perfect alignment.\n\nDouble Lubricating System\n\nThe machine is lubricated by an efficient splash system and is also equipped with superior providing two complete lubricating systems. Thus long service and easy running are assured.\n\nSmooth Running Gears\n\nAll gears are absolutely correct as to pitch and size. The large gear and the pinion have diagonal teeth which run more...\nEvery day in the year you use your Separator. It must be always ready to give prompt and reliable service when you want it. And you have a right to expect this service for many years.\n\nThat is the kind of service the Massey-Harris No. 6 Cream Separator is giving to users on thousands of farms in all parts of Canada today.\n\n1. Cleanliness\n\nAll parts are designed for simplicity and ease of taking apart for thorough cleaning.\n\nSeamless Tank\n\nThe supply tank is drawn from a single sheet of steel. There are no seams or corners and the bottom is evenly rounded so that dirt will not stick. The long sides are specially designed to prevent the milk splashing over when poured in. All the other tinware is substantially made of steel heavily tinned. They are easily kept clean with brushes which are provided for the purpose.\n\nConvenient Disc Holder\n\nThe discs are removed as one piece by means of our improved disc holder which is furnished free with each separator. They are easily and quickly washed and hung up to dry.\n\nSeparate Spindle\n\nFor ease of handling the bowl is separate from the spindle. When wanted for washing it simply lifts off. This possesses many advantages over separators which have their spindles solidly attached.\n\nHow to Keep Separator Clean\n\nAfter using, wash bowl and tinware thoroughly in luke warm water (not boiling) and brush thoroughly with the brush that is provided. Then rinse in boiling water, which cleanses and sterilizes, and hang up to dry. If this method is followed the separator will be sweet and clean\u2014always.\n\n2. Close Skimming\n\nThe Massey-Harris No. 6 Cream Separator is famous for close skimming.\n\nBowl Skims Close\n\nThe bowl is so designed that it skims close under the most difficult conditions. Even when running a thick creamed milk there is no possibility of clogging, and only the merest trace of cream is left in the skim milk.\n\n6 V-shape Openings Make for Better Skimming\n\nThe whole milk enters at the top. It passes down into the split wing which, with its 6 V-shape openings, distributes the milk uniformly throughout the bottom of the bowl as shown in the accompanying illustration. Skimming takes place between the discs and the entire skimming area is utilized. The skim milk passes outward and upward to the skim milk outlet as shown in the diagram while the cream goes up between the wings to the cream outlet. As the skim milk and cream outlets are at the top of the bowl, there is no loss should the bowl be stopped for any reason during the process of skimming.\n\n3. Easy Turning\n\nOwing to its smooth-running gears, simple positive clutch and other refinements of mechanical design, the Massey-Harris Cream Separator has a widely-known reputation for easy turning. In actual dairyman's tests separators of other makes have always proved their superiority in this respect. In one instance in which a Massey-Harris machine was tested against a slightly smaller machine of another make, the difference was as much as 25% in favor of the Massey-Harris Separator. This difference persisted when the machines were either full or empty. Every dairyman will realize that this represents an admirable saving in the amount of power or daily hand labor necessary.\n\nMilk Evenly Distributed Over Discs\n\nThe split-wing with its 6 V-shaped openings\u2014more than on any other separator\u2014delivers the milk to the disc in such a way as to give more even and better distribution over the entire skimming area, making for easier turning and closer skimming.\n\n4. Reliability and Long Life\n\nChief among the main features of the Massey-Harris No. 6 Cream Separator are its reliability and long service under all conditions. All parts are so strong and well made that the adjustments are permanent, and uniform results may be relied upon at all times for many years.\n\nSpring Cushion Bearing\n\nSmooth running at the bowl is also insured by our improved spring cushion bowl spindle bearing. It is designed to allow for the swaying motion of the bowl when it is skimming at full speed.\n\nStrong Main Frame\n\nThe main frame is very strong. It is cast in one piece and holds all bearings in perfect alignment.\n\nDouble Lubricating System\n\nThe machine is lubricated by an efficient splash system and is also equipped with oil cups, providing two independent lubricating systems. Thus long service and easy running are assured.\n\nSmooth Running Gears\n\nAll gears are absolutely correct as to tooth form. The large gear and the pinion have diagonal teeth which run more smoothly and wear less wear than straight teeth.\n\nEvery Massey-Harris Separator Thoroughly Tested\n\nThere is no guess work about the Massey-Harris. Every machine is run empty for several hours to be sure that all parts are properly fitted and running smoothly. Then a supply of milk is run through and both cream and milk are tested. Each separator is tested under actual operating conditions to be sure it gives the best results before it leaves the factory. Remember, Massey-Harris Cream Separators are built in a special separator department, and carry the guarantee of the great Massey-Harris organisation.\n\nEquipment\n\nThe outfit furnished with each Separator includes 1 milk indicator, 1 quart can of separator oil (no other kind of oil should be used on a cream separator), extra neck bearing spring, 2 spare discs, 1 oil can, 4 wrenches, 4 cleaning brushes, 1 extra rubber ring, 4 lag screws for fastening separator to the floor or table, 1 spirit level and 1 wire for holding and wasting discs.\nFOR GREATER PROFITS\n\nProfits are of great importance on all dairy farms. Every progressive dairy farmer realizes this and welcomes all machines and equipment which lighten the work and yet make more money for the owner.\n\nMassey-Harris Cream Separators do this. Every day they give steady, efficient service and save money over old and inefficient methods. Every machine is tested and must skim to less than 2-100 of 1% before it leaves the factory. When it is remembered that every 1-100 of 1% of butterfat left in the milk represents a loss of one pound of butter per cow per year, and that some other makes of separators leave as much as .17 of 1%, it is readily seen how greatly Massey-Harris Tested Separators benefit the farmer.\n\nThe guarantee of the Massey-Harris Company, Limited, an organization which reaches nearly every part of the civilized world, with an enviable record extending over more than 80 years, is your protection when you buy a Massey-Harris Cream Separator.\n\nMade in Six Sizes\n\n| Actual capacity in pounds per hour | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 700 | 900 |\n|-----------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Equal to Imperial quarts          | 80  | 120 | 160 | 200 | 280 | 360 |\n| Equal to American quarts          | 96  | 144 | 192 | 240 | 336 | 432 |\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nMASSEY-HARRIS ELECTRIC CREAM SEPARATOR\n\nMade in Four Sizes\u2014400, 500, 700 and 900 lbs.\n\nWHEN electric power is available the Massey-Harris Electric Cream Separator is the ideal equipment.

We know that iron is brittle and easily broken when subjected to sudden shocks. We know that rolled steel cannot be broken even with the use of a hammer.\n\nFor any kind of structural purpose steel, without question, is superior to iron in every point of comparison.

This piano was purchased on the instalment system by the school staff, but since the fire only one or two payments have been made.

Thus, the entirely proper conditions under which the League is permitted to use the hall prevent any charge being made for admission, and the League is therefore compelled annually to resort to the expedient of renting the large Russell Theatre for the purpose of raising a revenue in addition to membership fees.\n\nThese handicaps can be removed.\n\nowing to the small accommodation of the lecture hall in the Victoria Room, the League has never made any effort to obtain members, and its growth in membership has been wholly due to the remarkable talent of the players it has developed and to the excellence of its productions. There is no doubt that the removal of the handicaps which its work is now carried on would greatly extend the scope of activities, and broaden the basis of its support. Even without any addition to its membership it would, with a Little Theatre, be easily to improve its productions and to show a satisfactory balance sheet. Sketch plans for a Little Theatre have accordingly been prepared, and rough estimates obtained which indicate that an up-to-date Little Theatre with a seating capacity of between 450 and 500 can be constructed at a cost of between $50,000 and $60,000, this figure covering both the land and the building fully equipped.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOLD SUN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nGLEICHEN, ALTA.\n\nSeptember 25th, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Residential Schools Com.,\nBible House,\nWinnipeg,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Gooderham, Mr. Gibney and I have been over the internal arrangement of the school this week, and there are two things which we thought would be worth while taking up with you.\n\nThe first is concerning the beds for the dormitories. We thought that it would be very much nicer to have brown enamel beds than the usual white. The white has a habit of getting chipped and looks horrible when that happens. Then everything in the room is white, except the wood work, and we thought that the brown would relieve the general appearance. If the order has not already been filled, our suggestion would be that the brown be purchased instead of white.\n\nThe next is concerning the mattresses. We hear that in some schools, ticks to be filled with straw have been provided. Now, if this should be the case here, it would mean considerable delay in the opening of the school, and very inconvenient, for there is hardly any straw in the district. What little the farmers have is being carefully conserved to help out the problem of feed for this winter. Mr. Gooderham said that he did not know where we could purchase straw within a good many miles of the school. If at all possible, we would suggest that the regular filled mattresses be provided.\n\nWith kindest regards,\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) John W. House,\nActing Principal.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find a copy of a letter just received from the Rev. John W. House, B.A., Acting Principal of the Old Sun School, and I commend to your sympathetic consideration his request for brown enamel beds for the Old Sun School, instead of the usual white ones, and also his request for mattresses.\n\nIf the beds have already been ordered, no further action need be taken in connection with that part of Mr. House's letter, but the lack of straw in that part of the country this year, appears to me to make the provision of mattresses an absolute necessity.\n\nThe furnishing of the new Old Sun School will, I trust, be completed at an early date, as some of the agents who were engaged some time ago and fully expected to begin duty at the 1st of September, have expressed their concern at the delay and the inconvenience to which they are being subjected through failure to draw any salary. Any steps, therefore, which you may be able to take to complete the furnishing of this building and to make it ready for occupation, will be deeply appreciated by our Commission.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nCANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS\n\nSTRAIGHT BILL OF LADING-ORIGINAL-NOT NEGOTIABLE\n\nRECEIVED, subject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of issue of this Original Bill of Lading.\n\nat Toronto, Oct. 6, 1930\n\nfrom...the goods described below, in apparent good order, except as noted (containing...unmarked, unnumbered, marked, broken, and damaged in transit), which Canadian National Railway agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its road; otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.

If the seating accommodation has not yet been ordered, I trust that this step may be taken immediately, as it will scarcely be possible to make any use of the chapel until this accommodation has been provided. There are certain furnishings for the chancel and sanctuary which our Society is quite prepared to provide, but it seems to me that the major and more permanent fixtures, such as a Communion table (5' long 3' high 2\u00bd' wide) reading desk, lectern, etc., should be provided by your Department, and I shall be glad to know if you will provide these for the Old Sun School.\n\nThe delay in opening this school on account of the lack of various furnishings is causing our Commission considerable inconvenience, and I trust that the above matter may receive your prompt and sympathetic consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOctober 14, 1930.\n\nMR. ORR\n\nKindly note that the Gleichen Hardware Company, of Gleichen, Alberta, is on the list for Gleichen, and should receive consideration in connection with the requirements of the Old Sun's School.\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\nOct. 14, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 6th instant, referring to the list of miscellaneous equipment for the Old Sun's School, I would ask you to kindly add the name of the Gleichen Hardware Co. of Gleichen to the list already given you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSECRETARY.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOct. 7th, 1930.\n\nMr. F. A. Paget,\nPurchasing Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe thank you for your order of October 1st, covering goods required for the Old Sun School, Gleichen, Alta. The goods are being assembled and we expect to make shipment of the complete order about October 21st. There is no delivery date specified on the order and we sincerely trust that the date we have mentioned will be entirely satisfactory.\n\nThe order calls for 6 #171 Beds, White Enamel finish, with Rubber Tired Casters. We would like to point out that the #171 Bed is made with 26\" elevation, and if used with 4\" Rubber Tired Casters, is much too high. As we have had some complaints on this score, we are taking the liberty of supplying, in this instance, #171 Beds, with shorter legs, so that when used with 4\" Rubber Tired Casters the elevation will be the same as our standard Hospital Beds. This does not alter the appearance of the bed as the height of the Head and Foot Ends will be the same as the regular bed.\n\nThe order also calls for 20 #4000 Beds, size 2'6 x 5'6, which we presume is the inside measurement? These beds are required for \"Dormitories\" and we take it that the 20 additional beds, required for the Dormitory on the Top Floor, are to be the same size? We are, therefore, supplying 40 #4000 Beds, in this special length, and if we have not interpreted the order correctly we will appreciate hearing from you before the goods are despatched.\n\nWe will have the goods consigned to \"G. H. Gooderham, Esq., Indian Agent, Gleichen, Alta.\" and forward invoices, in triplicate, and Bill of Lading, to him, in accordance with your instructions.\n\nAgain thanking you for this order, and awaiting your further commands, we remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSimmons Limited,\nManager,\nPrairie Division.\nOct. 20, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo regarding the furnishings required for the Old Sun's Indian School, I beg to say that orders have today been placed for practically all the equipment required. In the order for beds white enamel beds were specified. It is hoped that these furnishings will be delivered in the very near future.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that in the furnishing of the chapel the only furnishings supplied by the Department are the pews and arrangements will be made to have these provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn August 13th last, I wired to your Department recommending that the Indian Agent of the Blackfoot Agency be authorized to purchase cooking utensils, dinner set, and other crockery ware required for the residence of the Principal of the Old Sun School. In a letter from the Principal dated Oct. 5th, he states that nothing has been done about this, and that neither Mr. Gooderham the Agent, nor himself, have had any word from your Department about it. As there are no cooking utensils whatever, and no crockery ware for this part of the building, I beg to repeat my recommendation that the Indian Agent be authorized by telegram to secure all that is necessary.\n\nFurther, in the same letter, the Principal directs attention to the need of three kitchen chairs, and also to the need of an electric stove for the residence. He states that in the construction of the building no provision was made for any other type of stove, and mentions the fact that there is no chimney in the kitchen, but that it has been wired purposely for an electric range. At the present time all the cooking is done upon an old broken stove in the basement. This condition, I feel, should be altered at the earliest moment possible.\n\nIn the same letter the Principal states that no bedroom chairs have been provided for his residence. There are four bedrooms, and I beg to recommend that the Indian agent be authorized by wire to secure at once these and all the other items enumerated above.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nQuotations for Kitchen & Hardware\n\nO.

The Principal informs me that none of this equipment has been received to date and he would like to know if the order has been placed. As the goods are necessary to furnish the rooms I would like an early reply, please.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the supplying of curtain material, rods, etc., for the use of the Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that either the Principal or yourself may arrange for the purchase of the really necessary curtain materials and rods required. While serviceable material, etc., should be obtained, it is not intended that any unnecessary expense be incurred.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOld Sun School,\nGleichen,\nAlta.,\nNov. 28th, 1930\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn my requisition for school supplies covering this present quarter for Old Sun School, I asked for a school clock similar to that shown on page 76 of Osborne's catalogue. As I have not received this, Mr Gooderham, our Indian Agent, told me to write you and explain our situation.\n\nWe are commencing school on Monday Dec. 2nd, and have no clock in the whole building. The co-ordination of all our work will have to depend upon the various wrist watches carried by the members of my staff until we get a clock to set school time.\n\nWe really should have one big clock to hang in the hall to act as standard time for the school. Then as the class rooms are off at either end of the building, we ought to have two small inexpensive desk clocks for the teachers.\n\nI imagine you know already how impossible it would be to run one of these schools with half a dozen different times in the building, so I need not say more about my problem.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJohn W House.\nPrincipal.\n\nAttention Mr Perrier.\nOttawa, December 9, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that a large wall clock for use in the hall and smaller clocks for use in the classrooms at the Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is authorizing Mr. Agent Gooderham to arrange for the purchase of three clocks - a large wall clock for the hall and two wall clocks of a smaller type for use in the classrooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. John W. House,\nPrincipal,\nOld Sun Residential School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, December 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School requests that clocks be supplied\u2014one for use in the hall and two for use in the classrooms. In this connection I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase of a wall clock of the type as described in catalogue No. 16 of F. E. Osborne, Calgary, the price of which is quoted at $12.85. It is considered that wall clocks of a similar but smaller type would be the most satisfactory for the classrooms, and you may also arrange for the purchase of two of these clocks. Please give the matter of the purchase and delivery of the clocks your early attention.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, you should arrange to have the clocks forwarded to the school, and you should also obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost. This account you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

I do not want it known that this inquiry comes from headquarters; just inquire casually and let me know.\n\nWe are getting through the winter nicely and today is our first violent storm.\n\nMy regards to Mrs. Gooderham,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nGleichen, Alta.\nJanuary 27th, 1931.\n\nDear Doctor Scott:\n\nAnswering your personal letter of the 19th inst. in regard to Old Sun School, there are at present 73 pupils attending and it is not likely that this number will increase very much.\n\nThe bake oven was used for the first time yesterday and the Principal is satisfied with it. On enquiry I learned that it bakes well but it was necessary to make two bakings to meet the requirements. The electric bread mixer is good and certainly saves a lot of labour. The bake room is too small for all the equipment in it and the main source of trouble is a large metal dough trough. It is twice the size needed and stands in the way of workers. I believe a smaller wooden trough will answer the purpose much better. However, I am taking an experienced master baker to see the room and he should be able to suggest minor changes which will help the workers.\n\nThe Staff is mostly new to the work but the school is running smoothly and Mr. House will shortly have a good organization.\n\nWeather continues fine and warm. Light influenza is going about but so far, the Indians are mostly free from it. Mrs Gooderham joins in sending our regards to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan O.

Whether these are Holsteins or Shorthorns I am of the opinion that it does not greatly matter, but as our Society has provided the school with a thoroughbred bull of the Shorthorn breed Mr. Minielly, who is our Farm Instructor and a graduate of the Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph, has advised that any stock purchased should be of the same class.\n\nTo inaugurate a system of mixed farming which would meet the requirements of the school, somewhere between twelve and sixteen cows would be required, and I write to ascertain if your Department will come to the assistance of our Society in providing not less than ten of these. Without your assistance I can see no possibility of their being secured for some time to come, and if you will be good enough to give us a start in this way I shall be very grateful indeed and very deeply obliged.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, Dec. 28, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, in which you request the Department to purchase stock for the Old Sun Indian Residential School.

At present we have only two good cows, which we purchased ourselves last month. The purchase was made from the returns of four useless animals from a milking point of view. These new cows are pure bred Holsteins, and costing us $100.00 each. We have, besides these, six grade cows of more or less value. From the latter we could raise some animals for Beef purposes. Our great need is, however, a good stock of milkers. To complete our herd with what we have already got, we require ten new cows.\n\nSecondly, I may say that through your Department, all our stock were T.F. tested, including a Shorthorn bull. Three two-year-old heifers reacted, and we had to let them go to a cattle buyer for $32.00 for the lot. With this money, we anticipate buying a registered Berkshire Boar.\n\nIf your Department can come to our assistance in this very important matter, we should feel that our barn was being used to the very best advantage. At the present time, I am rather ashamed to have visitors come and find us in the position we are in. Our great aim here is to have sufficient butter and milk for the children as well as the staff, all the year round. In having these very necessary things, we shall feel that we are doing something to build up the physique of the children.\n\nOur Commission is doing all that it finds itself able to do at the present time for our Farm. I may say that outside the new Barn your Department has not done anything for the farm, except to make a grant last year of $100.00 for fence posts. We are very grateful for what the Dept. has done, but we feel that we must ask for assistance in this very vital matter.\n\nI am enclosing you a few of the items of expenditure by the Commission during the last two years; just giving the larger items.\n\nHousehold Equipment: I also beg to call your attention to the fact that our present Kitchen Range is old, with parts that cannot be repaired, and too small for the school. Our Kneading trough, which was granted last year with our new equipment, is made of...\nTo Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nwood, and is, therefore, very difficult to keep in a sweet condition in spite of every effort on the part of those responsible for the baking. Complaints have been made to me and I find that they are reasonable. If it is possible to have the present Kneading trough metal-lined, it would do, but if not, we should be supplied with an all-metal trough.\n\nI have been requested to write you in regard to these matters at once. I regret that our Agent is away at present in Ottawa. If he is still there when this letter reaches you, I believe that he would endorse my requests. If the matter must be held in abeyance until his return, I shall ask him to go carefully into these matters with me.\n\nBelieve me, it our aim here at the school to serve the Indian Department and our Church faithfully and well, so that I feel that the considerations I am asking at the present time, and may be asked for in the future, are with this sole object in view, that we may be the better enabled to make this Institution first class in every way.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 11, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to milk cows for the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, is being instructed to make a recommendation in this connection and he will in due course be authorized to take whatever action is considered advisable.\n\nThat portion of your letter which refers to the kitchen range and to the kneading trough will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. F. M. Ross Gibney,\nPrincipal,\nOld Sun's Residential School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, March 11, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has been requested to supply ten milch cows for the use of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. There is a new stock barn at this institution and the Rev. Principal reports that the school has two good milch cows and six grade cows. You were informed in my letter of January 4th that it is the Department's policy to ask school authorities to make replacements to stock. However, I am convinced that there should be more milking cows at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School; and the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that you be asked to make a report and recommendation. You should also intimate if it is possible for you to secure the proper type of milch cow in the West.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have just received a letter from the Office Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, Winnipeg asking if some arrangements can be made to supply the Rev. Principal of the Old Sun School with more milk cows, and I should like to be advised if the Department has changed the decision it arrived at, as communicated to me in Department letter No.104-1-14 dated the 10th of April last.\n\nIf the renewed application for the provision of additional cows for the Old Sun School is re-considered and allowed I wish to point out that the Crowfoot School has just as good a claim also to be provided with additional stock.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 10, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 401-11A, with reference to the purchase of stock for the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. I have noted that you consider the residential schools on the Blackfoot Reserve have had an opportunity to build up a herd during the years they have been in operation. The Department, after giving the matter further consideration, has decided not to purchase stock for either institution at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., informing me that the Department had a request from the Principal of the Old Sun School to purchase ten additional cows for that Institution. You reminded me I was informed on January 4th last, that it is not the Department's policy to supply stock for schools, but that you are convinced that this school should have more milking cows than they have at present. I am taking from your letter that you propose to supply these cows outright, if you found they were necessary.\n\nI visited this school last week, and I saw eight cows in the stable; two Holsteins that were recently purchased by the school, I was not impressed with them, in fact they are only giving a gallon each at a milking; and six grade cows, which are not of a bad type, in fact I would consider them an average-grade Shorthorns\u2014two of these cows are about to freshen. This will add considerably to the quantity of milk. However, I do not think that even with this additional supply in prospect there will be sufficient milk at the school. I am of the opinion that with an additional three cows, this is all that will be needed at the present time. I am not prepared, however, to leave the choice of these cows to the school authorities.\n\nI presume the Department are anxious to treat all alike, and I wish to inform you that it was only a couple of months ago the Crowfoot School authorities found it necessary to purchase a couple of new cows, and they paid for these out of their grant, and are prepared to buy another couple cows. When they hear the Government are doing this for the Old Sun School, they will naturally want the same treatment, and I think they should have it.\n\nIt seems to me these two schools have an ample opportunity\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nopportunity to build up a herd, and not call upon the Department to spend money in this direction; as a matter of fact they should be selling milch cows at these places, instead of the Department buying them for them, especially as these schools have been in operation for so many years. I would, therefore, recommend that three cows be bought for the Old Sun School and three for the Crowfoot School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 401-11 A of the 24th instant, with reference to the request of the church authorities for milk cows for the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. In reply I have to inform you that there has been no change in the Department's decision which was communicated to you in April, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Gooderham, in which he reports that one of the milch cows at the Old Sun School was slaughtered by the Government Inspector, and that no compensation has been received.\n\nThe Principal in writing to the Agent says \"The animal which was slaughtered was a pure bred Holstein cow, costing the school $100 about two years ago. We desire to get together a good herd of dual purpose Shorthorns. In a communication from our Commission I received the following instructions.\"\n\n\"Inform the Indian Agent in writing of the slaughtering of the animal mentioned in the report, and request him to take the necessary steps, in accordance with the agreement of his Department, to have this animal replaced by one of the class you consider most suitable. I am of the opinion that one of the Shorthorn class would be the best one to secure.\"\n\nThe Agent goes on to say that he knows nothing about arrangements made with the Department, and that the animal mentioned by Mr. Gibney was not worth $100 at the time it was slaughtered. I may say also that I do not know of any arrangement with the Department as mentioned by the Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 23, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A of the 18th instant, with reference to the replacement of a milch cow at the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. I have to inform you that it is the Department's practice to replace milch cows that are destroyed by order of the Veterinary General, and you may purchase for this school, when timely, one suitable animal. I note that the Principal is desirous of securing a dual purpose Shorthorn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nExtract from Report of Agent Gooderham on the Old Sun Residential School dated March 5, 1926.\n\nThe barns were inspected and found to be in good order but the milk supply was very low. This matter was taken up with the Principal and he stated that the M.S.C.C. had the matter in hand and promised, if possible, to authorize an increase of the milch cows immediately. This is the only solution as the present herd is small and for the most part, very low grade.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLee Gooderham\nTo Comm. Graham\nfor J.P.\nGleichen, Alta., March 2nd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of February 1926.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nOld Sun's was visited while under quarantine for measles and only the barns and stock were inspected. Found a distinct shortage of milk as only one cow was milking. Other cows will be freshing in a short time. All stock was receiving good care and were in fairly good condition but the cattle are a rag-tail bunch. The Principal has asked the M.S.C.O. for more and a better type of milch cows and I cannot state too strongly that there is a need for them.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Indian Agent Gooderham's report on the Blackfoot Agency for the month of February.\n\nI regret that the Agent found it necessary to report that the children at the Old Sun's School are getting no milk, or at least milk from only one cow, and that the herd is just as I have described it, a very inferior lot. The Church should be called upon without delay to remedy this matter. Keeping a lot of Indian children in a school and not giving them a proper supply of milk is to say the least, most unsatisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, March 16, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt is reported that there is an inadequate supply of milk at the present time for the pupils of the Old Sun's Indian Residential School. Our representatives properly point out that this is a serious matter and calls for immediate remedial action. I should be grateful if you would let me know what steps your Society is taking in this connection.\n\nI might point out that last month the Department authorized Mr. Commissioner Graham to purchase one suitable animal for this school, to replace a cow that was destroyed by order of the Veterinary General. The reports indicate, however, that several head are necessary before a sufficient supply of milk is possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Hard Pepper Test\n\nIt is very interesting to notice the progress which is being made at the Old Sun Indian Mission of the Missionary Society of the Church of Canada in the way of improving the originally mixed grade herd. Last week the second 60-day test in the way of accreditation has been successfully passed by the government Veterinarian. Another clean test in the next 60 days means that the herd will be fully accredited according to the rules and specifications of the department of agriculture at Ottawa.\n\nNot only will the school then have an accredited herd, but also the beginning of a fully purebred herd, as the grade cattle are being gradually fattened and butchered off and are being replaced with the dual purpose short-horn.\n\nOn January 24, 1925, the first test for T.B. was taken on the herd which proved to contain one reactor which was slaughtered immediately. It was very gratifying to receive the report from the government veterinarian that last week that not a single reactor was found.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a newspaper clipping relative to the test which has been made to the herd at the Old Sun Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the cattle at this institution are now in a healthy condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He states that the old drill, a LaCrosse, is now so obsolete that it is difficult almost to impossibility to get new parts or repairs. Moreover, he states that it does not seed evenly, and even misses rows from time to time. The cost of a new single disc, 20 run drill, of the latest all metal type, he estimates at approximately $225.00 f.o.b. Gleichen, and I am writing at the urgent request of our Commission to ascertain if your Department can provide this very necessary item of equipment in time for the seeding operations this Spring.\n\nI may mention for your information that in the same letter in which the Principal asked for the seed drill, he also requested an extra team of horses, and our Commission have agreed to purchase this team at a cost of approximately $200.00. As we have also expended during the last few months approximately $500.00 for pure-bred milk cows for this School, and were confronted at the close of last year with a heavy cash expenditure in excess of cash receipts from all sources, including the per capita grants, you will understand the circumstances which have prompted our Commission to solicit your help in the purchase of the seed drill.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience, and remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, March 27, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department wishes to supply a seed drill for the use of the Old Sun Indian Residential School, if you are satisfied that such is necessary at this time. It is represented that a single disc, 20-run drill is required. You may make purchase from the International Harvester Company, at an approximate cost of $200. Your early attention is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOttawa, March 27, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to a seed drill for the Old Sun Indian Residential School. It is the Department's policy to ask the school management to make replacements to agricultural implements and stock. In view of the expenditure which your Society has recently incurred at this school in the matter of live stock, an exception will be made. I am authorizing Mr. Agent Gooderham to purchase a drill, provided he considers one necessary, and am instructing him to attend to the matter without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The items asked for are:\n\n1 heavy wagon gear with yoke & trees\n1 wheel barrow\n1 post hole digger\n1 saddle\n\nMr. Gooderham explains that the saddle they now have in use there is the property of the Farming Instructor, but it can be purchased for $20.00, which he considers is good value, and estimates that the total cost of the articles requisitioned for will not cost in excess of $150.00. I am referring this matter to the Department, but I may say that I do not see why the Department should be called upon to expend this amount for the purpose named.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 401-11A C.E. of the 18th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Old Sun Residential School to be supplied with the following:\n\n1 heavy wagon gear with yoke and trees,\n1 wheel barrow,\n1 post hole digger,\n1 saddle.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that it is the Department's policy to ask the school management to make replacements to agricultural implements and stock. The Department is, therefore, not prepared to authorize the expenditure required in the purchase of the equipment asked for at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I agree that the cows will be needed when the school is opened.\n\nThe Missionary Society inform the Principal that the Department is responsible for the complete equipment of a new school before its administration is taken over. What are your instructions in the matter, please?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 30, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Old Sun Indian Residential School to be supplied with six milk cows to be added to the present school herd.\n\nIn this connection it is considered that, as this school has been in operation for a number of years, the old milk herd, plus natural increase, should have provided the number of cows sufficient to meet present requirements. If, as you report, six more cows are required, you should state the reason why the herd was decreased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOld Sun School,\nGleichen.\nOct.6th. 1930.\n\nMr Gooderham,\nIndian Agency,\nGleichen.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to our conversation re the Milk herd at Old Sun School, I have made investigation and beg to report as follows:\n\nThe herd belonging to the school prior to 1927 was made up of 5 scrub milk cows, some bought in the stock yards at Calgary. Two of them were defective, one was of Holstein and Jersey stock, another was more or less of pure Holstein breed, and the other just scrub. In 1927 the Indian Commission of the M.S.C.C. sold the two defectives and bought two pure bred Holstein cows to replace them. In addition to this they bought a pure bred Holstein bull which we now have. The scrub cow was traded for a Holstein heifer later on.\n\nThis makes our present herd to consist of one old more or less Holstein, one half Jersey and Holstein, and three pure bred Holstein cows. The natural increase of these consists of five heifers, one just over a year old, and the others younger.\n\nYou will see by this that our effective strength is four good cows and one old one which will soon be useful only for breeding purposes. Our increase has been fairly normal, but the heifers are too young to be producers for the next year at least.\n\nNow the situation that I am trying to handle is this. Within a few weeks we shall have from 80 to 90 children in this school, all of them having been living at home for over a year and in consequence under nourished. When we receive them, we shall be immediately faced with the problem of building them up to normal strength, for unless they are in good health, our time will be wasted in trying to educate them.\n\nI thoroughly discussed the care of the children with Dr. Windsor, our Indian Reserve L.C., and she was most emphatic about the desirability of being able to give each child at least one pint of whole milk and one ounce of good butter as a minimum ration (daily).\n\nUpon this basis we would need 13 gallons of whole milk, and 7 pounds of butter daily to provide a minimum ration for children and staff. Then, taking our present rate of production as a basis of calculation, we would require 7 cows to produce the whole milk, and 5 from which to make butter. That means that we ought to have at least a dozen cows to give us our minimum supply.\n\nYou will note that I only asked for six new cows to make our herd up to eleven. I did this because I thought that with a little more care we might possibly increase our supply per cow a little over what it now is. Assuming that this is a possibility I made the requisition of six as an absolute minimum.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Principal\nSIR:\u2014\n\nAnswering yours of the 30th ult., in regard to the milk herd at Old Sun School. I attach hereto a letter from the Principal of the school and I believe you will find it to be a satisfactory explanation of the existing condition of the herd. All animals are T.B. tested and the herd is now certified by the Department of Agriculture as being free from t.b. When the animals were first tested, two reacted and had to be destroyed.\n\nMore milch cows will be needed to supply the milk when the pupils return. Rev. Mr. House has lately assumed his new duties and I have confidence in him. If the M.S.C.C. cannot supply him with more cows, we cannot expect the pupils to get all the milk they should have. In such event, I recommend that the Department purchase the cows. In this connection, I beg to submit that the Holstein breed is not my choice of breed for this school. What is needed is a dual purpose breed and if I were making the purchase, I would try to get milking Shorthorns or some breed which can be readily beefed.\n\nMilch herds which are T.B. tested are limited in these parts\u2014in fact, it may be necessary to go out of the Province to locate fresh milk cows of the type required. Whether it be the Department or the M.S.C.C. that purchase the cows, arrangements to do so should be made right away.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 15, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAdditions to the milk herd at the Old Sun Indian Residential School have been engaging the attention of the Department. It appears that six additional cows should be secured, and it has been recommended that dual purpose Short-horns be selected. I have informed Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham that the Department will supply three such animals if your Society will purchase a like number. The general practice is for the Department to ask the school management to make necessary replacements to live stock. At most schools, the natural increase keeps the herd at required strength. However, in view of the circumstances at the Old Sun School, the Department makes the foregoing offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, October 15, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your B.12 of the 8th instant, with enclosure, concerning a milk herd at the Old Sun Indian Residential School. The Department is writing to the M. S. C. C., offering to supply three dual purpose Shorthorns, if the Society will add a like number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nWinnipeg, Man. October 20, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 15th inst., #104-1-14, in which you inform me that you have authorized Mr. Indian Agent Gooderham to purchase three cows for the Old Sun School. Only last week I received a letter from the Principal of this school dealing, in detail, with the whole question of the herd of stock now on the school premises. In reply to his communication, our Commission instructed me to authorize the Principal to take the matter up direct with the local Indian Agent, and to arrange, so far as possible, for the building up of a herd of pure-bred Holsteins. For some time our Commission desired to have at this school a herd of Shorthorns, or a dual purpose strain of stock, but the Indian Commissioner favoured the Holsteins and consequently a goodly number of Holstein animals are there at present. It seemed to our Commission that considerable expense would have to be incurred to make a complete change of the herd, and consequently it would be better to adhere to the one breed instead of having a mixture. The Principal has been authorized by our Commission to exchange some of the animals for Holsteins, and I trust that your Department may authorize Mr. Gooderham to purchase three good Holsteins as well. An authorization from your Department to Mr. Gooderham and the Principal to take whatever steps they consider best in the matter, will be much appreciated by our Commission.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, October 24, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the additional cows required at the Old Sun Residential School. You will note from official letter of the 15th ultimo that the Department considers that six additional cows are required, and that Mr. Agent Gooderham was instructed to supply three animals, if your Society will purchase a like number. I am not certain from your letter whether or not your Society is prepared to secure the three additional cows, and I would appreciate receiving a definite statement from you in connection with this.\n\nIt is noted that you prefer Holsteins to Shorthorns, and, when definite instructions are being given our Agent, your wishes in this regard will be presented to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

He checked over the herd when I attended the sale and six of them were purchased. The school has just taken in 60 children and needed the milk. I would prefer dual purpose Shorthorns but as there were none available, Holsteins were secured.\n\nThe demand for milk cows at present is heavy and prices are higher than last year. It is hoped that the herd may be gradually made up of dual purpose Shorthorns.

I trust that this arrangement will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit my report for the month of May 1938.\n\nBoth schools were visited. The Old Suns school graduates put on a banquet and dance on the 11th. The banquet was at the school and the dance at Crowfoot Hall. It was a creditable performance and we were impressed particularly by the fine meal prepared by school girls under staff supervision. This school has crops and garden seeded where irrigation is available and has also broken about 50 acres to raise feed. The acreage is a bit large, I feel but we will see what is done with it.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools\n\nThe writer visited both residential schools in connection with repairs and improvements. The children, of course, were still on holidays and did not return until the sixth of July. The improvement and repair work to the Crowfoot school was being carried out with local labor and the acting Principal is to be commended on the class of work and the amount that he was able to do with very limited expenditure. This school was in good shape to properly care for all the pupils this year. The crop at this school was excellent and is now being threshed. At the Old Sun School the staff was concentrating on the harvesting which came off irrigated lands. This land has produced abundance of feed and a good garden as well as some threshed grain. Both schools had done well with their exhibits at the Calgary Fair and prize money was here for the pupils on their return this fall. This coming year more stress will be given to handicraft work and the general work will undoubtedly be more pleasing to the Indian pupils.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian agent.\nAt the Old Sun School, the irrigated farm produced 850 bushels of oats, 235 bushels of wheat, 50 tons of alfalfa, and 75 tons of hay; besides a garden which was a revelation as to what irrigation will do. For example; they raised 20 tons of potatoes; 2000 cabbages; 100 pumpkins; 100 marrows; 10 sacks of cucumbers; 50 bags each of turnips; carrots and parsnips and numerous other small vegetables.\n\nThe cattle herd totals 34 head, of which there are 20 milch cows.\n\nClasswork and vocational work was proceeding in an orderly fashion and generally everything was quite satisfactory at this school.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alta., Mar. 6, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report for the month of February 1939.\n\nBoth schools have ample feed for stock and it was noted that the children were being fed a good varied diet, as they had lots of vegetables and milk.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nGleichen, Oct. 5, 1939.\n\nAGENCY'S REPORT ON BLACKFOOT AGENCY FOR SEPTEMBER 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nThe outfits working on the reserve threshed the crops on both school farms. The Old Sun School had 400 bushels of wheat and over 1500 bushels of coarse grain. This farm produced, also, sufficient alfalfa, greenfeed and hay to carry their herd through the year and the garden is quite good, although the potato crop is lighter than last year. This is true all over Alberta, however, where the potato crop is light.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nBlackfoot Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Dec. 6, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of November, 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nArrangements were made with both Principals for one boy pupil to feed a calf, the property of the parent, under the scheme put out by the Alberta Junior Livestock Clubs. The boy or girl must feed, water and care for this calf from the 1st of December until the early summer when it is hoped that some competition with other clubs can be arranged and a prize given to these boys. The main reason for this is to encourage and educate these young Indians in the care and feeding of stock. At least one other, outside the schools, will also care for a calf so that we will have a local competition at any rate. An ex-pupil of the Old Sun School was sent to Calgary to take the Dominion Provincial Youth Training course in mechanics; this boy is paying his own expenses. Four pupils of this school and nine ex-pupils of the two schools were started on a 6 weeks course in farm mechanics, carpentry, blacksmithing and agriculture under supervision of the Dominion Youth Training project. This school is held in Gleichen and arrangements were made for the boys to live at Crowfoot Community Hall where the wife of the Indian caretaker supplies the meals. An allowance is given by the Government for transportation and board, and this will be turned over to this woman. The boys are getting something out of this course at very little cost to their parents.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith my report for the month of December, 1941.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nBoth schools were visited. The writer was particularly impressed by the number of stock at the Old Sun School; there were 55 head of cattle, of which 16 cows are milking. There were three sows with three large litters of young pigs, besides 25 feeders and one boar. Two hundred odd hens were laying an average of 5 dozen eggs daily. Owing to the male staff being the manual training supervisor at Old Sun could only give a small part of his time to carpentry work. At Growfoot a good start has been made in this and the building used for this purpose has been fitted with benches and was sufficiently large to handle all those who are taking this work. More or less as an experiment and also because children had been retained in school almost continuously since summer holidays the pupils of both school got a week's holidays at Christmas time. Rations were issued to their parents and it was the first time that I have ever noted that the parent or guardian realized he had a responsibility to look after his own. The enthusiasm of getting the children out wasn't so great when they realized that they would have to feed them and keep them warm and in good health for the period that the Indian normally ran here and there all over the country. The pupils are now back in school and I believe they are mostly in good health. I have noted one thing that there was less travel to the city and fewer Indians drunk and in trouble than in former years; possibly this is due to the fact that they had to remain at home and look after their family - at any rate it was good training for the parents.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nMINUTES OF SPECIAL MEETING HELD JUNE 27th, 1945.\n\nRE DAMAGE OF SCHOOL CROP BY INDIAN STOCK:\n\nA letter from Mr. House, Principal of Old Sun Indian Res. School about damage of School crop by Indian cattle and horses, the Councillors showed regret and discussed this situation.\n\n1. They will broadcast it at the Sun Dance camp and do all in their power to preserve this farm intact.\n\n2. They recommend that signs be made and placed on fences and gates where some Indian may be inclined to enter or pass through the farm.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nEducation: Two boys are attending Gleichen High School in grade 10; they are doing alright.\n\nThere are 200 pupils at the two residential Boarding schools. They are healthy and happy. Vocational training has been improved and the calibre of the instructors satisfactory.\n\nClassroom work always appears to be lacking in something; possibly this is due to lack of interest by the pupil but it is so easy for a teacher to get in a rut and lack that spirit which the child needs so much to retain its interest and enthusiasm. Indian children love to sing and they are good singers. We need to practice a little more psychology to get nearer the desired results.\n\nAll children who were school age and physically fit at the beginning of the term are attending the schools.\n\nAt both institutions, the farms produced ample feed for stock. Good milk herds are retained while the flocks of foal produced sufficient eggs. Some cattle and pigs are slaughtered for school consumption. The Crowfoot School has a splendid lot of pigs. The Old Suns School had a splendid garden on its irrigated farms.\n\nGall. Gooderham,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh  \nSuperintendent  \nBlackfoot Indian Agency  \nGLICHEN, Alberta\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of November 26th, relative to testing of the dairy cattle at the Old Sun Indian Residential School, Gleichen, and the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Cluny.\n\nIn reply, I may say that while it is realized here these herds have not been tuberculin tested since April, 1945, I would suggest that you take the matter up with Dr. T. Childs, Veterinary Director General, Dept. of Agriculture, Confederation Building, Ottawa, as I have been requested to suspend all tuberculin testing under supervised herd plan in the Calgary District indefinitely in order that more time may be given to Restricted Area Work.\n\nYours truly\n\n(signed)  \nH.

Childs\nVeterinary Director General\nDepartment of Agriculture\nConfederation Building\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Doctor Childs:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have asked Mr. Storey, District Veterinarian for Calgary, to test two cow herds of approximately twenty animals each, located at the Old Sun Indian Residential School, Gleichen, and the Crowfoot Indian Residential School, Cluny, located approximately fifty-five miles east of Calgary. The herds have not been tested since April 1945. I enclosed a copy of Mr. Storey's letter which is self-explanatory.\n\nIf you could take the matter up with our Department in Ottawa it would be much appreciated and if the herds can be done, this would also be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.P.B.

Testing of Dairy Herds\n\nReference to your letter of December 15th last, in which you approve of the T.B. testing of dairy herds at both Crowfoot and Old Sun Indian Residential Schools, I beg to state that your last paragraph is contrary to what has happened in my experience in the past, in so far the Department have always paid the costs, if any, for carrying out these tests, and not the school authorities.\n\nMay I suggest in view of the immense amount of money being spent on T.B. hospital cures, I think this charge should be borne by Appropriation, in so far that I think it is a good preventative and the school milk should be protected from T.B.\n\nNeedless to say, the school authorities do not approve of paying the costs of the T.B. tests. Trust you will reconsider the matter.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nSuperintendent\nJanuary 6th, 1950.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nGleichen, Alberta.\n\nRe: T.B. Testing of Dairy Herds\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th ultimo and we feel that the school management is responsible for testing the herd at the Old Sun's Residential School if there is any expenditure.\n\nIt is doubtful if the officials of the Agriculture Department will charge for their services. Many of our residential schools in Canada have their herds tested at frequent intervals at their own expense.\n\nPP/T\n\nBernard F.

On the arrival of the Sisters they will open a Boarding School, and His Lordship, who asks that the usual assistance may be given for 8 boarders, willing, for the current year, to accept supplies to the amount of $60.00 per cap per annum, as authorized for the Ermineskin's School by Departmental letter No 117201 of August 26th last.\n\nI would recommend His Lordship's application to the favourable consideration of the Department, and also that provision be made in the Estimates of 1896-7 for a cash grant of $72.00 each for eight pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy,\nof the Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo Mr. Skins\nwhat about part\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant reporting the receipt from His Lordship, Bishop Grandin, of a letter advising you of His Lordship's intention to send two Sisters to take charge of the Roman Catholic School on the Pigeon Reserve now being carried on as a Day School, when it would be opened as a Boarding School, and asking that the usual assistance be given for 15 boarders; and in reply I beg to say that the Department does not approve of the way in which these changes are proposed to be made. Application should in the first place be made for permission to open a Boarding School as it places the Department in an awkward position in having to contribute towards the support of a school for which no provision has been made. However, as this course has been allowed before, the Department will, in this instance consent to an issue of provisions and clothing to an amount equivalent to a grant of $60 per capita.\n\nWhere such an arrangement is taken advantage of a tuition grant only will be paid for the number of pupils in attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, S.W.T.\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA 8th January 1896\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter to you of the 27th November last relative to the provision for the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Peigan Reserve, I beg to inform you that a personal application has been made to the Department by Rev. Father Lacombe, to have the $300 grant formerly paid as a salary to the teacher continued to the Boarding School in addition to the rations and tuition grants, and in this connection I beg to say that Father Lacombe has been informed that the Department regrets its inability to meet his wishes in this direction, owing to the lack of funds, and in view of the fact that the Church of England School upon the same Reserve is in receipt of a maintenance grant of $52 per capita only. Kindly inform Father Lacombe to this effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to above no letter I beg to say that the Rev Father Poisy has expressed his wish to draw the following supplies in lieu of cash grant, viz:\n\n400 lbs flour\n100 \" rice\n80 \" oatmeal\n20 \" corn meal\n200 \" Sugar\n30 \" tea\n50 \" dry apples\n5 gals Syrup\n50 lbs salt\n50 \" soap\n5 gals coal oil.\n\nWith the exception of salt I cannot let him have any of the above articles, without running myself short, and he desires to get the whole at once.\n\nWould you kindly let me know the price of these goods per lb, etc.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina.\nAllow me to state that in order to comply with the instructions received in a previous letter, Rev Father Poisy, or the date for the 26th of April, had made a requisition for a certain amount of supplies, in provision of the impending opening of the Boarding School at the Roman Catholic Mission on the Piegan Reserve. Said requisition having been forwarded to Regina by the Indian Agent, the answer has come that most of the dry goods supplied asked for could not be supplied from the store at Regina; and on the other hand such supplies are exhausted at the Agency. Yet these it was absolutely necessary to get at once viz:-\n\nBlankets ticking for mattresses, cotton for bed sheets gingham for dresses, etc., and there was no alternative except to purchase the most necessary things.\n\nAs the same inconvenience may occur again at any time, it would be a great deal more satisfactory that the per capita grant for the support of children should be paid, as far as possible out of the moneys at the command of the Department, in consequence of the regular salary for the day school being discontinued.\n\nIt cannot be said that there is no provision made for the purpose.

If such sums be secured for the maintenance of the boarders, the balance only of the grant would have to be made up in goods, and this I am sure would be more satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nConsequently I would ask the Department to allow a sum of $75.00. to be paid at the end of this quarter towards the support of the Boarders who are to be taken in a few days, in order to help to defray part of the first expenses of the opening of the school.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nsgd Em Legal, Pte O.M.I.\nEXAMINED\nSCHOOL BRANCH.\n\nTHIS LETTER HAS BEEN SENT OTTAWA 26th August 1896\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your requisition for the sum of $6.50 in payment of tuition grant for pupils at the Piogan P.C. boarding school, I beg to say that in view of the representations previously made by the Rev.

Let me kindly reiterate the same request.\n\nIf the Department could find the means to pay for these five pupils, it would help this school, as it is rather expensive to live here.

Laird Esq.\nIndian Commissioner.\nWinnipeg.\n---copy---\n\nEVECHE DE ST. ALBERT.\nAlberta, T.N.O., Canada.\nCalgary March 9/99.\n\nTo the Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the occasion of a recent visit to the Catholic Boarding School, on the Peigan Reserve, I have been made pleased to notice the progress made by the pupils during a comparatively very short time.\n\nIt had been complained, for some time, that the person in charge of the class was not sufficiently qualified to teach English and especially to give the true and exact pronunciation. By looking only at the results there would not seem to be much foundation to the objection, as it would be hard to find any instance of such a remarkable transformation having been more rapidly accomplished in the training of Indian children. Yet to comply with the wish of the Department, the services of an English lady teacher have been secured and she has just taken charge of the class work.\n\nThe object of my present letter is\nis to call the attention of the Indian Department to the fact that there are only 20 children authorized for that school, which could furnish accommodation for 40 or even 50 pupils.\n\nAt present there are 25 children admitted in the school, with the consent of the Department, but for the 5 supplementary pupils, the usual grant is not given, the Agency providing only the rations of beef and flour for them.\n\nAt this time of the year, it would be an easy matter, by making a special allowance in the supplementary estimates, to secure the usual grant for these five children and even for other children who could be admitted before the end of the fiscal year. The school is large enough for about fifty children and it seems that it should be filled as soon as possible.\n\nI believe that the number of children recommended for next year is 40. I would respectfully ask that, even before the end of the fiscal year, it should be allowable to admit, if possible, that number or at least 30.\n\nIt cannot be said that funds are not available as there are good many schools where the authorized number of pupils is far from being completed and cannot be completed before the end of the year. To give only one instance, I will\nwill point out the St. Joseph's Industrial School, Munbow, the number of pupils admitted therein being at least twenty short of the authorized number.\n\nWhile visiting the school on the Peigan Reserve I could not help being struck with the poor accommodation there to be found as far as desks and blackboards are concerned. In fact they have nothing of the kind worth notice. I would therefore strongly recommend also that the Department should kindly make appropriation for 2 dozen of desks (4 of each size) and 2 large blackboards.\n\nThese of course, should be attended to at once, if it is wished not to thwart the work of the school.\n\nWithout doubt the Rev. Principal of the School shall have communicated with you, of late, on these subjects. I hope that the Department will be willing to take the matter in the most serious consideration, and grant our requests.\n\nWhile the Principal of the School shall be notified, it would be a favour conferred on me, if I could also receive the information.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\n&c., &c., &c.,\nEmile J. Legal, Bp. of Pasla.\nCoad. of St. Albert.\n\nAddress to\nAt. Albert.\nAlberta. N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose copies of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop of St. Albert and of one from the Principal of the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Peigan Reserve, asking that a grant be paid for five pupils now at this school, over and above the number allowed. I may say that although there are no funds for this purpose and that the Department may feel averse to the idea of diverting appropriation from their intended use, or at least to use one school's unexpended appropriation for the purposes of another school, I still think it a pity that a school which can obtain more than its full complement of pupils should be refused the grant for the extra number whilst the same is allowed to lapse in the case of other schools not as favourably situated, such as the Crowfoot Boarding School which is practically not in existence, and the Blood R.C. School which has only succeeded in obtaining 5 pupils up to the present, and in consequence only a small or no part of their grant is received. I therefore beg to submit the request of His Lordship to your favourable consideration with my recommendation. The matter of purchasing furniture for the above school will be submitted later on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, 24th March, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enclosing copy of a letter from His Lordship, the Bishop of St Albert, and one from the Principal of the Roman Catholic Boarding school on the Piagan Reserve, asking that a grant be paid for the five pupils now at that school over and above the number provided for.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot accede to this request and pay for the pupils suggested.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nTimmins, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enquire if the Estimates for the current year provide for the painting of the R.C.

There were admitted last year 25 pupils, during the whole year, with the consent of the Department, which however refused to pay for more than 20 pupils. We were made to understand then that 40 would likely be the number of children approved for this year, and instead the former number of 20 has been left to stand. By treaty the Government has assumed the duty to provide instruction for all the Indian children.\n\nRespectfully submitted with the consideration of the General Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\n\n(Sgd) + Emile J. Legal,\nBishop of Regina.\nOTTAWA, 7th December, 1929\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop Lepel, asks for an additional grant of $1440.00 to provide for 20 more pupils for the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Piagan Reserve.\n\nTwenty pupils are now provided for with twenty-five on the roll.\n\nThe last census shows that there are 162 children of school age living on the Reserve\u201437 Roman Catholics, 48 Anglicans and 19 pagans. There are no day schools on this reserve, and if a grant were given for forty pupils it would provide for three more children than they are shown to have by the census. Provision is made for thirty pupils at the Church of England Boarding School.\n\nThey have ample accommodation at the Roman Catholic school for forty pupils, if allotted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin O'Brien\nSir,\n\nAllow me to forward you a copy of a letter that I am writing to Honorable David Land Commissioner of Indian Affairs. At Father L. Dorion of the Saguenay River is writing to me, giving communication of an official letter in which, after informing him that only 20 people will be given the grant, you go on to say: \"We do not know yet what will be able to do after June 30th next, but will advise you as soon as I am informed.\"\n\nI have also to say that after it has been realized at Maningi, that it could only be out of an overlook that the same number of 20 people had been promised, while 25 had been admitted for a whole year, I am really amazed to see that nothing has been done so far and that there is nothing certain for the future. The Department is not yet sure that there is nothing certain for the future. The Department is not yet sure that there is nothing certain for the future.\n\nI consider it very unfair that there should be people admitted during the whole previous year with the knowledge consent of the Department have not been given the usual grant, and formally ask that this grant be paid for the whole amount from year.\n\nAs I suppose that the matter will be brought before you, I hope that you will acknowledge the justice of my demand and that you will be able to give a satisfactory solution of the case.\n\nI have the honour to remain, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 9th, 1900\nOttawa, 19th April, 1900.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Cleary,\n\nPlease look over this letter and let me know what I can say to the Bishop.\nOttawa, 27th April, 1900.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI duly received your letter of the 8th instant, with regard to the application of the Peigan Roman Catholic Boarding School to have their per capita grant extended to twenty-five pupils, instead of twenty as at present provided for. In reply, I beg to state that this matter was brought to the attention of the Department in the spring of last year when the decision arrived at was that the request could not be acceded to, and the Indian Commissioner was so advised. I have again had the matter looked into and I regret to say that there would appear to be no way in which the grant could be increased.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nHis Lordship\n\nBishop F.J. Legal, O.M.I.,\nSt. Albert, N.W.T.\n\ncc.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 23rd April, 1900\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe Peigan R.C. Boarding school.\n\nI can find nothing on file to indicate that the Department had any intention of providing for more than twenty pupils for this school, that being the number for which the per capita grant is now paid.\n\nThe school has had an enrollment of twenty-five since December quarter '96 and in March '99 the Commissioner submitted the request of Bishop Legal and Rev. Father Doucet (the Principal) for payment for the extra five pupils to the favorable consideration of the Department and he was informed in reply that the Department regretted that it could not accede to his request and pay for the pupils as suggested\u2014that is, out of the unexpended vote for other Roman Catholic schools.\n\nThe letter to which the Bishop refers as being addressed to Father Doucet stating that he would be advised later on what could be done after the 30th of June was not written in the Department.\n\nProvision is made in next year's estimates for the same number of pupils as at present, no consideration being given to the five extra pupils still on the roll.\nIt would be well if the Church authorities and different missionary societies could disabuse their minds of the idea that because money is voted for one particular school and not used, it therefore becomes available for any other school of the same denomination, which has more than the authorized number of pupils in attendance.\n\n[Signature]\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Ind.

Having twenty...\nsix pupils, all Indians of this Reserve, to provide for, and receiving the Department grant only for twenty. I cannot really see how to get make both ends meet.\n\nI hope the Department will kindly take under consideration my demand.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. Doucet (signature)\nPrincipal\n\nR.C.

Boulet, O.M.I.,\nSacred Heart Boarding School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSt. Patrick's Church\n\nTo the Superintendent-general of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa\n\nVery Honorable Sir,\n\nAs you are aware, it is myself who has started and continued the controversy about the admission of Indians into our schools, of the children slightly affected by tubercular disease. Now in the course of my pastoral visitations, I have been able to notice that it is the Protestant Boarding School of the Pagan Reserve which is made to profit first of the new provisions of our dormitories and other improvements, toward the admission of such children; I beg to pass the remark that this is scarcely fair to us.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nVery Honorable Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n+ Emile J. Legat,\nP.M. of H. Albert.\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant in further reference to the admission of children to the Indian boarding and industrial schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is a matter which has for a considerable length of time been receiving the earnest and careful consideration of the officials of the Department. At the same time the suggestions offered by Your Lordship and others interested in educational work among the Indians have been gladly noted and, where practicable, acted upon.\n\nAs to the establishment of fresh air dormitories as a part of the programme of the Department in alleviating the present unsatisfactory health conditions I think that the following statement will show that Your Lordship is under a misapprehension in supposing that any discrimination against the Roman Catholic schools has been exercised.\n\nThe policy of the Department is to treat all religious bodies in a fair and equitable manner and there was no departure from this policy in the case of the Pelican school.\n\nIn February last, Mr. Inspector Markle submitted plans for a pure air dormitory in connection with the Pei\n\nRight Rev. E. J. Legal, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of St. Albert,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nChurch of England school and on the 18th of that month instructions were given to have the work proceeded with. In the same communication Mr. Markle was asked to prepare plans for similar dormitories at the Roman Catholic school. These were received on March 29th and on April 14th authority was given for their construction. At the same time Rev. Father Doucet was advised of the action taken and on the 23rd of April he acknowledged the Department's communication.\n\nThis action on the part of the Department was unsolicited and I think Your Lordship will agree prompt. If there has been delay in completing the work it is no doubt due to the fact that Mr. Markle's many and varied duties have prevented his giving the matter the attention he would wish. Owing to his experience it was thought expedient to leave the whole work in his hands and there is no doubt that when completed these dormitories will be appreciated by the staff of the school.\n\nThese explanations will, I think, show that there is no ground for the assertion that that Roman Catholic Church was unfairly treated in the matter of the erection of these dormitories.\n\nMr. Inspector Markle will be written to with reference to the completion of this work.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 17th, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Five Agreements, in duplicate, between Your Lordship and His Majesty the King, represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, for the future maintenance and management of the Peigan, Bruneckin's, Crowfoot, Blue Quill's and Onion Lake Roman Catholic Boarding Schools and I have to request that you will be good enough to sign these documents in the presence of a subscribing witness and affix your official Seal, returning same to the Department at your earliest convenience, as the Agreements will go into effect on the 1st. of April next.\n\nOn the return of these documents the signature of the Deputy Superintendent General will be affixed, and a copy of each will then be sent you. Certain alterations and improvements may be necessary to bring the buildings at these five Schools up to the required standard. An officer of the Department has been instructed to inspect and report on the improvements required at these Schools.

In their case I found the children healthy, clean and well clothed as I have found in all the R. C. schools there.\n\nAs I was told that they are likely to be removed from there to another place more adjacent to the railway so there is nothing for me to suggest. Where they are is a beautiful spot and there is splendid water and lots of it and a most desirable place for the disposal of the sewage. The ventilation and food is also well looked after.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nO.I.

In reply I beg to say that you may have the leave asked for and that the Rev. Father Dounet may act as principal during your stay abroad. I wish to add my personal good wishes for a safe return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. M. Lepine, O.M.I.,\nP.C Peigan B. School,\nBrocket P.O., Alta.\nI have inoculated all the children with Typhoid vaccine the second time and gave three of the sisters their first inoculation. I expect to complete the inoculation of the school children by the end of the month.\n\nOf the three cases there, two of them have regained normal conditions but the girl is still running a temp of 103 in the evenings. I think it is a true case of Typhoid, though the first I have ever seen amongst the Indians.\n\nDr. Safery wrote me & said he would send containers for water analysis but they have not arrived as yet.\n\nAll the usual precautions are being taken & I think I have the conditions well in hand. In conclusion, I think everything is satisfactory so far as it is possible to make it. I had good cooperation in this work.\n\nI hope you & yours are well.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.J. Gillespie\nDear Dr.\n\nI have just returned today from a visit to the Agency & the schools on the Pigeon Indian Reserve and had to report as follows.\n\nI have succeeded in improving the surroundings. The pig pen has been placed back by the barn. The original sty has been cleaned and sprinkled with lime (plenty of it too). The agent & farmer surveyed the cabins and decided they were not worth moving. Two new ones have been built and sanitary facilities arranged. The old ones torn down, filled in after a good quantity of lime was used.\n\nThe new ones are located \u2014 on the girls side at the farthest corner... on the boys side, outside the grounds 50 feet from its farthest corner from the buildings.\nSir,\n\nDr. Gillespie of Pincher Creek met me at Brocket Thursday September 7th, and we drove to the Roman Catholic School, where we discovered three cases of typhoid fever. We immediately took steps to find out the source of the trouble, and came to the conclusion that it was from the water in the well, as there is a pig sty with a small open yard, covered with mud and water, and the pigs were wallowing in it, about twenty (20) feet from the well and about ten (10) feet farther on was a pit closet, which was used by the boys. The soil in that locality is gravel and easily penetrated by fluids. We had the patients isolated to one of the sleeping balconies, instructed them to boil the water, have the closet removed and the pit filled in, also the pig sty placed at a greater distance away. We drove back to the Agency and left instructions for a closet to be made with a seat to lift up, and the Doctor was going to order some galvanized pails to be used, and they are to be emptied in a place a distance away from the Institution, chosen by ourselves. We also ordered a lot of lime to be used about where necessary. Dr. Gillespie was going to inoculate the rest of the inmates of the School, with typhoid vaccine, and have the water sent to be analyzed. There is another well farther away, which has not been used for a time, and Dr. Gillespie was going to have it looked into for getting the water supply. As the School is a very old building, and in an\nout-of-the-way place, and I was given to understand from Mr. Markle and others, that there is a chance of them having a new one in another locality, as soon as conditions permit, I would suppose that the Department would not care to go to the extra expense of putting down another well, at the present place. I expect the Agent will communicate with the Department for further instructions.\n\nI happened to meet Dr. Lafferty at Okotoks, who is now Provincial Health Inspector, and he said that he would have sealed bottles sent for the water, and see that it was analyzed himself.\n\nThe School was clean and as well kept as an old building of this sort could be expected.\n\nI also visited the Church of England School and Hospital and found everything in good order, with the exception of flies coming through the windows, and I requested that they get some cheese cloth to cover the windows, which would be opened. I heard them ordering the man to get the cheese cloth, while I was there.\n\nThey are going to have all the houses on the Reserve, cleaned and fumigated before they go back to occupy them for the winter.\n\nRev. Mr. Haynes, principal of the Church of England School took me to look at another site for a new school. The site is admirably situated, if there is any intention of building one. His idea is to get trees planted and the ground worked up before a building is erected. Of course, I have no idea of what the Department contemplates in the matter.\nI was more than pleased to find that Dr. Gillespie had returned from the war, and was back to his position again to attend to the Indians on this Reserve, as there were a great many complaints about medical attendance to the Indians during his absence. In fact I had received a letter from Agent Gunn about it sometime ago, and I wrote to Dr. Dubuc in regard to it. A copy of my reply I enclose. The people all seemed pleased that Dr. Gillespie was back again to renew his work. They had had an epidemic of measles among the Indians with a very heavy death rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Ind. Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Rev. F. Lapine, our principal of this school, having been called to join the French Army, I have been transferred to this mission from Crowfoot School, Okanogan, where I am replaced by Rev. F. Doucet, o.m.i.\n\nAt the same time, I would be very much obliged if you could kindly let me have a free copy of the Indian Act and also of the last three Books of the Indian Department.\n\nI remain, sir, your faithful servant,\n\nJ. L. Leveson, o.m.i., p.\nOttawa, October 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that your action in having the children at the Pegian (R.C.) Boarding School who were suffering with typhoid fever isolated and instructing the authorities to boil the water, have the closet removed and the pit filled in and the pig sty placed at a greater distance from the school is approved.\n\nYour remarks in regard to the hospital and the Pegian (C.E.) Boarding School have been noted and also your remarks in regard to the medical attendance on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nO. L. Grain, Esq., M.D.,\nMedical Inspector,\nIndian Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIn this Agency there are two Boarding Schools. The Victoria Home (Church of England) and The Sacred Heart (Roman Catholic) Boarding Schools.\n\nThe Victoria Home School is situated just off the Western Boundary of the Reserve. The Principal, Rev. W.R. Haynes, resides on the Reserve as Missionary, and the school is run by an assistant principal. This has been vacant lately but there is a new man who is to take over the duties of Principal after he has been here three months. The same objection as before still remains, too many changes and the lack of an energetic man. There have been five boys discharged from this school lately and I think it wasted money that they cannot speak better after being in school ten or eleven years. There is no farming at all done and the garden was an almost total failure last year. The outbuildings are poor and hardly worth keeping in repair.\n\nThe Sacred Heart Boarding School.\n\nThe Sacred Heart Boarding School is situated near the site of the old Agency about the centre of the reserve. The Principal, the Rev. Father Levern, the Teacher is Sister Lewis. The Staff seem efficient and the place is well kept and clean. The garden was a failure last season and no farming is done.\n\nThe effect of education on the reserve is slightly improving especially among the women.\n\nI have been given to understand that new schools have been promised when the war is over to both denominations and under the present government it should be possible to have one Government school situated on the\nbest land on the reserve and self-supporting and non-denominational, the Department securing the best teachers possible and best farm instructors. This seems to me to be the only way to get the best returns for the money spent on education as well as saving the cost of one building which should pay for running expenses until it could be made self-supporting.\n\nIt is certain to me here that the present system is nearly a waste of money as the boys get no training in the care of horses and usually under no competent men as the church schools cannot afford to keep men of this description owing to lack of finances.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. A. Gunn,\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nBrockett, Alta.\nApril 5th, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn this agency there are two boarding schools,\nThe Victoria Home (Church of England) and The Sacred\nHeart (Roman Catholic) Boarding School.\n\nTHE SACRED HEART BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nThe Sacred Heart Boarding School is situated near\nthe site of the old agency about the centre of the re-\nserve. The principal is the Rev. Father Levern. The\nstaff seems efficient and the place is well kept and\nclean. The garden was a failure last season and no farm-\ning is done.\n\nThe effect of education on the reserve is slightly\nimproved, especially among the women.\n\nI have been given to understand that new schools\nhave been promised when the war is over to both denomina-\ntions and under the present government it should be\npossible to have one government school situated on the\nbest land on the reserve and self-supporting and unden-\nominational, the Department securing the best teachers\npossible and best farm instructors.

H. A. Gunn,\nOttawa, April 22, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, in view of the very unsatisfactory condition of affairs at the Peigan (R.C.) Boarding School, the Department will be forced to close it unless a very decided improvement is noted in the near future, as the results do not justify the Department in continuing the expenditure incurred there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. L. Levern, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nPeigan (R.C.) Boarding School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nR.C. Boarding School, Peigan Reserve,\nBrocket, Alta., April 29, 1918.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd inst.,\nno. 1181834, re Condition of affairs at the School,\nand to say in reply that it certainly caused us a\ngreat and painful surprise, as we were not prepared\nat all to receive such a sad news, for many\ngood reasons:\n\n1. The Inspectors, Agents and Doctors have regu-\nlarly visited this School and they always had\nbut one voice to praise our work, and their\nreports in the Annual Blue Books show that\nthey seemed to mean what they used to\ntell us. Did not even Mr. Markle, after his last\nvisit here, make a personal appeal to the Indian\nDepartment to try and build a new school for\nus as soon as possible?\n\n2. The proper time to speak about closing this\nschool was eight or nine years ago when the\nIndians were all removed away from us and\nnew farms were arranged for them around\nBrocket and close to the other schools who could have\nbelieved at that time that we would have been\nable to recruit any more pupils? However, in spite\nof the river and of the long distance, the Indians\nhave kept on giving us their children and even\ntoday, we have three pupils over the number for\nwhom the grant is paid.\n\n3. I must say also that our pupils seem to appre-\nciate the care and the attention they receive\nfrom us; they are happy, contented and quite\nat home here, and at the end of their vacation they are all in a hurry to come back.\n\n4) And now you are informing me that \"in view of the very unsatisfactory condition of affairs at the Leigam R.C. Boarding School, the Dept will be forced to close it unless a very decided improvement is noted in the near future...\" A thunder clap in a cloudless sky could not have made on me a stronger emotion; is it possible that we have been deceiving ourselves when, in the circumstances just mentioned, we thought that our work had not only the approval, but also the congratulation of the Department? On the 20th of last March McGunn came here with the Head Doctor and Mr. Gil. Leslie and, after having made their inspection, they claimed they were greatly pleased and praised us for the cleanliness of the house, the good manners of the children, etc., etc.\n\n5) If, in spite of all this, it is true that you find the condition of affairs \"very unsatisfactory\" and wish for a \"very decided improvement\", kindly let us know what is unsatisfactory and what kind of improvement you want. I believe that I am entitled to say that we have always been anxious to comply with the wishes of the Department.\n\n6) You complain that \"the results do not justify the Department in continuing the expenditure incurred here\". I admit, very willingly, that our work is not very encouraging nor the results so good as desired; but, on the other hand, do the other schools obtain a better success on the Indian Reserves? The transformation of an Indian race is necessarily a slow work.\nafter all, is even the White race perfect, after nineteen centuries of civilization and christianity?\n\nHoping you will kindly excuse the strong emotion which shows itself through my letter and take into consideration the few remarks I am submitting you and answer promptly and satisfactorily. I remain dear Sir,\n\nyour faithful servant,\n\nJ. Keenan, o.m.i.p.r.\nJuly 23rd, 1916,\n\nDear Father Levern,\n\nI have just read for the first time a departmental letter of the 23rd April, 1916. This letter was written without my knowledge and authority and in complete disregard of my wishes. My attention was not drawn to it or to your reply of April 29th or else I would have immediately written you at that time. The Department has no intention whatever of closing the school as you must have been aware from my past correspondence. I have been personally interested in this school and I know well the difficulties under which you have been operating it and have endeavoured so far as possible to ameliorate the conditions.\n\nKindly place this letter with your correspondence in order that it will remove the impression conveyed in the previous communication. My sentiments towards the school have not altered since I wrote you on November 20th, 1916.\n\nPlease convey to the devoted sisters my regret that you and they should have been troubled so unnecessarily in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 23rd, 1916.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of letter I have just written to Reverend Father Levern, Principal of the Roman Catholic Boarding School on the Peigan Indian Reserve.\n\nI regret very much that our officers should have written him such a letter without referring the matter to me. The action was quite unauthorized and does not represent the intention of the Department as to the future of this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's Most obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt.

L. Reven, o.m.i., p.r.\nDear Sir,\n\nHow could I thank you for your so kind and encouraging letter of July 23rd, which I just received? The letter of the Indian Department had caused me indeed a great surprise and, as I never got any explanation about it, finally I made up my mind to apply to Bishop McNally; and I easily imagine your indignation when he told you about the matter: many, many thanks!\n\nI have pinned your kind letter on the one of April 23rd.\n\nI had kept all this completely secret as I did not wish to cause to the Sisters any useless pain: but now that the affair is settled, I have spoken to them about it and they ask me to forward you also their most heartfelt thanks.\n\nThe attic is finished, a good while ago, and is now a good and comfortable room, giving accommodation for a few more pupils.\n\nThe Sisters have been painting nearly all summer and all the inside of the house looks\nagain nice and clean; an extra grant of $502 was given us also for that purpose last spring.\n\nThanking you again from my heart for the great interest you are taking in our work, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nyours respectfully\n\nJ.

Boarding School, he requests that the number of grant earning pupils be increased. They are at present receiving a grant for 30 pupils only and he states that they are in the school, with ample accommodation for 45, and that alterations were completed in the spring of 1918 to accommodate that number.\n\nIn December, 1916, Mr. Inspector Markle recommended that the grant earners be increased to 40 pupils. This was noted, on your authority, for the Supplementary Estimates for 1917-18, but, at the time these estimates were prepared, it was disallowed.\n\nThere will, no doubt, be sufficient funds in the appropriation for the next fiscal year to provide for an increase of 10 pupils, and, as the school can obtain that number and has accommodation for them, I would recommend that the Principal's request be granted. His letter to you referred to above, has been returned for your private files.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. T. Curtin\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlmo. [signature]\nOttawa, January 19, 1921.\n\nRev.

She has not mastered the art of teaching the individual through the class; although classes are called, only one pupil at a time is taught - all the others meanwhile being passive.

Rev. J.B.

The Grey Nuns of Nicolet have kindly placed Sisters in certain of the institutions financed and controlled, jointly, by this Department and the Roman Catholic Church. It is extremely desirable that certain Sisters, who are destined to give academic instruction, should receive professional qualifications at some Normal School in Quebec.

As the Department has financed these schools for many years, I believe the stock and equipment should be considered school property.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. J. B. Beys, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n10,138 - 107th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that while at the Peigan Agency I inspected both Boarding Schools on the reserve.\n\nAt the R.C. School I found 22 boys and 30 girls in residence, and the grades being taught were from one to seven. 46 of these children are from the Peigan Reserve, but there are six girls there from the northern part of the province, being orphans and admitted to this school by the Department. Everything at this institution was in first-class shape, the premises well looked after and clean. The children all looked to be in splendid condition, and I must say are well cared for. The school had an excellent crop last Fall. They threshed 5000 bushels of wheat and had 12 tons of potatoes and a lot of other garden truck. The grade of the wheat, of course, was low, but the Principal told me that this extra money certainly helped the school out greatly. I cannot speak too highly of the work that is done here. I believe the class-room work is good. The children are well fed, well clothed and are receiving a good training.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nREGINA, SASK., 4th April, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a report on an inspection of the Roman Catholic and Church of England schools in the Regina Agency. The report shows that excellent work is being done at the Roman Catholic School. Everything in connection with the institution was found to be in first class shape. The premises were clean. The children were in good condition and the father had reaped his first crop, which yielded 5,000 bus. wheat and 12 tons of potatoes, as well as a lot of garden truck. This goes to show what can be done with proper management. I consider that the Principal of this school should be congratulated on the manner in which he has managed this institution. There is no doubt in my mind that the boys and girls here are getting a real training.\n\nWith regard to the Church of England School, conditions have not changed and it seems too bad that this work is to suffer through absolute incompetence on the part of the management. The Indians are not receiving the proper training for their children under the management of the present principal. In the first place he is impracticable. He knows nothing about farming, which after all is the most important branch of the work to be carried on at the institution. He has in his employ Mr. Hillier, who was dismissed from our service as being incompetent, lazy, and a failure generally, and it seems to me that this school is going to get worse instead of better. I am quite aware that when the Inspector's last report went in Doctor Westgate replied to the charges therein and it was thought that we could let the matter ride for a while. This inspection, however, goes to show that there has been no improvement. Just fancy a new place of this kind, with all the equipment we have supplied, and no land ready for crop, and no summer allowing done. The Department should take serious steps in regard to this matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 22, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They work also in the kitchen and are taught what to do with the milk, how to make butter, etc.\n\nHoping that this will be found satisfactory, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSacred Heart Indian Residential School, Brocket, Alta., Dec. 17, 1929\n\nThe Honourable Duncan C.

Levern, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Brocket, Alberta. Rev. Fr. Levern is leaving for Europe and may be absent for about four months.\n\nRev. Fr. J. M. Salaun, O.M.I., who had for some years resided on the Indian Reserves and more particularly among the Piegan, will replace him.\n\nI thought I would write to that effect in case Rev. Fr. Langlois might have been unable to see you personally, and secure the approval of the Department.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nA. Haessens, O.M.I.\nVice-Provincial.\nOttawa, August 23, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the leave of absence granted the Reverend J. L. Levern, O.M.I., Principal of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to inform you that Father Levern drew this matter to the attention of the Department, stating that he would be absent from August 16th until December, next, and that the Rev. Father J. M. Salaun, O.M.I., would be in charge during his absence. Both Father Levern and the local Indian agent were informed that this arrangement met with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Naessens, O.M.I.,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report on a recent inspection of the Sacred Heart Indian Boarding School on the Peigan Reserve. At the time of my inspection there were 55 children in residence. I spent practically a whole day at the school, and during that time I spent quite a little while in the two classrooms.\n\nMr. Bremner, the Provincial School Inspector, has recently inspected the classroom work at this school and according to his report everything is quite satisfactory. I will not dwell on this phase of the work any more than to say that both teachers are performing splendid work; especially Sister Gertrude Roy. She has been at the Blood and Peigan Schools for a great many years and I have always found her work most satisfactory. She takes a great interest in her pupils and gets splendid results. Sister St. Joan of Arc is also a good teacher, but she has not had the experience of Sister Gertrude Roy.\n\nHEALTH:\n\nI was very well pleased with the appearance of the children. They are certainly getting exceptionally good care and are being well looked after in every way. They receive good food and there was no sickness of any kind to be seen in the school.\n\nThe secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n2.\n\nSACRED HEART SCHOOL, Health (Cont'd),\u2014\n\nTheir clothing was clean and tidy and in looking over the stock of clothing on hand for the children, I found that they were probably better supplied than any school I have ever visited; They have five changes.\n\nBUILDINGS: The school building and outbuildings were all in A1. condition. The same applies to furnishings throughout the building.\n\nAll the machinery was also in good order.\n\nWATER SUPPLY: This is proving very satisfactory and the school has an ample supply of water. The Engineer informed me that a short time ago he wanted to clean out the tank at the spring, and he pumped for 9\u00bd hours steadily before the reservoir was pumped dry.\n\nFARMING OPERATIONS:\n\nTheir farming operations were very successful during the present year. They threshed 3000 bushels of wheat, 1400 bushels of oats, 700 of barley, and summerfallowed 60 acres. They put up 100 tons of hay and green feed.\n\nThe school owns 80 head of cattle and are milking 14 cows. They have 14 work horses, 21 hogs and about 100 chickens.\n\nThey had about 400 bushels of potatoes and an abundance of all kinds of vegetables consisting of 18 different varieties.\n\nGROUNDS: I reported on the grounds, garden, &c., of this school in June last.\n\nTeaching other than classroom work:\n\nThe girls are taught to make bread and\n3.\n\nSACRED HEARD SCHOOL (Teaching other than classroom work) For they are instructed in the method of doing all kinds of cooking, sewing, &c. Practically all the clothing used in the school is made up by the girls, and the Sisters informed me that the girls have become very interested in this work. It seems that a great change in this respect has taken place in the last ten years. Formerly they had to be practically driven to do any sewing, whereas now they show an eagerness to do it.\n\nThe older boys assist with the farming and look after the stock, gardens, &c., and as this work is exceptionally well performed at this school, it is a splendid example for the children.\n\nSeven of the pupils will be discharged this coming spring, but I understand that there is quite a number of children on the reserve who will be of school age, and there will be enough starting school next summer to replace those who will be discharged.\n\nSTAFF:\n\nAt the time of my inspection of this school, Father Laverne, the Principal, was absent. He left some time in August for Rome and he is now on his way back and is expected to arrive about the middle of the month.\n\nThe staff consists of the Reverend Principal, a combined farmer and engineer, a lay brother who looks after the grounds and garden, &c., and nine sisters.\n\nThis School......\nSACRED HEART SCHOOL (Continued),\n\nThis school is very well managed in every respect, and affords the children an excellent opportunity to prepare themselves for the time when they are to graduate and start up for themselves.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, December 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 406-11A., R.C., of the 7th instant, reporting on your recent inspection of the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that conditions generally at this school are satisfactory; that the children are receiving every care and are in good health and that the school is well managed, affording the pupils an excellent opportunity to prepare for the time when they will graduate and start for themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nCALGARY, ALTA., November 30th, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report that on a recent visit to the Peigan Agency I inspected the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School on that reservation. At the time of my visit there were 55 children in residence. I was pleased to note that everything was in A1. order at this institution.\n\nI visited the classrooms and found that good work was being performed. As the Public School Inspector had inspected the classrooms just a few days previously I shall not dwell on this phase of the work here. The children were well dressed and looked very healthy and there was no sickness of any kind at the school.\n\nAs you are aware this school farms considerable land and also has quite a large herd of cattle. Their farming operations, of course, were very much retarded this year on account of the dry weather. They did, however, thresh enough wheat and oats for feed, and sufficient wheat to grind into flour. I believe they also have enough over for seed. The balance of the crop was cut for feed. They also raise an exceptionally good garden and have an abundance of garden truck, but\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\ntheir potato crop this year was a failure compared to other years. The school owns about 100 head of cattle which is more than they really should have. It will be seen from this that they will have some cattle for sale and all the beef they require.\n\nThe training afforded the children at this institution compares most favourably with the best schools in the province. They receive good academic training in the classrooms as well as being taught all kinds of outside work. The school garden is well maintained and the grounds kept in first class shape, although the school has been handicapped by lack of water. The well at the school only produced a small amount of water and with the number of live stock there the spring which was developed a couple of years ago to take care of the water requirements is not, of course, sufficient to provide for the school and the stock in dry weather. Father Levern had to get an Indian to look after his live stock.\n\nThe buildings were all in good shape both outside and in.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nsir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDecember 4th, 1933.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson,\n\nI have read with interest your reports on the Peigan agency and also of the Church of England and Roman Catholic Schools on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nTaking into consideration the fact of the unfavourable climatic conditions of last summer, I think the report on the whole is a very favourable one.\n\nYours faithfully,\nH.

Sutherland,\nActing Supt of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n23 mars 1934\n\nCher M. Sutherland,\n\nJe n'ai pas eu depuis assez longtemps de nouvelles de notre fameux puits \u00e0 notre \u00c9cole Indienne de Brocket; j'esp\u00e8re qu'on y travaille et que le D\u00e9partement pourra enfin jouir de la paix sur cette question au moins. Je vous en ai parl\u00e9 plusieurs reprises parce que l'approvisionnement d'eau est une chose vitale dans une institution comme celle-l\u00e0. Heureusement que vous le comprenez et que vous \u00eates bien d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 voir \u00e0 ce qu'un bon puits soit donn\u00e9 au cher P\u00e8re Levern.\n\nQuant au nombre de t\u00eates d'animaux que poss\u00e8de actuellement l'\u00c9cole, j'ai voulu m'en assurer moi-m\u00eame afin qu'on ne garde pas un stock plus consid\u00e9rable qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire, et je n'en ai compt\u00e9 que 44 en plus des chevaux et de 5 porcs. Il me semble que c'est un nombre plut\u00f4t inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 ce que l'\u00c9cole devrait avoir pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des enfants et du personnel. Ne pensez-vous pas que, d\u00e8s que l'approvisionnement d'eau sera suffisant, il faudrait encourager le Principal \u00e0 augmenter le nombre de ses bestiaux, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 trouver dans son troupeau toute la viande requise.\n\nEn visitant cette \u00c9cole, je trouve aussi qu'il n'y a pas assez grand de terrain de mis \u00e0 la disposition de la ferme. Vous savez combien l'herbe est rare dans le sud de l'Alberta et combien il faut d'espace pour fournir assez de p\u00e2turage \u00e0 quelques t\u00eates d'animaux seulement. Nous ne nous plaignons pas \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole Ste Marie de Cardston, parce que nous disposons de plus de deux sections de terre et que nous pouvons couper sur la r\u00e9serve autant de foin qu'il nous en faut. Dans ces conditions, la ferme dont nous avons charg\u00e9 est d'un grand secours pour le soutien de l'\u00c9cole. Pourquoi ne pas \u00eatre un peu plus lib\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la petite \u00c9cole de Brocket ? Moins il y a d'\u00e9nfants dans une \u00c9cole, et plus elle est difficile \u00e0 maintenir, au point de vue financier; il me semble alors que le D\u00e9partement aurait tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 entretenir ces petites \u00c9coles, afin que ceux qui en ont l'administration ne trouvent pas leur t\u00e2che trop lourde.\n\nPardonnez-moi, cher M. Sutherland, de vous entretien si souvent de cette \u00c9cole; c'est que je m'y int\u00e9resse beaucoup et que je voudrais aider de toutes mes forces le Principal si d\u00e9vou\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire un v\u00e9ritable succ\u00e8s.\n\nAvec l'assurance de mes meilleurs sentiments,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 28, 1934.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, I may say that the question of the water supply at the Sacred Heart Residential School has been taken up with the officers of the Dominion Water Power Branch. They suggest that the old well be cleaned, as possibly this would result in securing sufficient water and avoid the necessity of incurring the heavy expenditure required for drilling a new well. Arrangements have been made to have the well cleaned during the month of April, and before taking further action, the Department will await a report regarding the results secured.\n\nThe last annual report submitted to the Department by the Principal of the Sacred Heart School states that the school has the use of 800 acres of land on the reserve, of which amount 340 acres is under cultivation. I am inclined to feel that this should be sufficient land to meet the purposes at this school.\n\nReports received also indicate that quite a large herd of cattle is kept at this school. As a matter of fact, one of our Inspectors recently stated that he considered more cattle are being kept than are really necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nCLOSED\n\nFROM 19/4/1895\n\nTO 28/3/34\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6362)\n\nFile 759-1, part 1\nPeigan Reserve - Sacred Heart Residential School -\nGeneral Administration. 1895 - 1934.\n\nFile 759-2, part 1\nPeigan Reserve - Sacred Heart Residential School -\nQuarterly Returns. 1941 - 1952.\n\nFile 759-5, part 2\nPeigan Reserve - Sacred Heart Residential School -\nBuildings - Supplies & Accounts. 1929 - 1933.\n\nFile 759-5, part 3\nPeigan Reserve - Sacred Heart Residential School -\nBuildings - Supplies & Accounts. 1933 - 1936.\n\nFile 759-5, part 4\nPeigan Reserve - Sacred Heart Residential School -\nBuildings - Supplies & Accounts. 1936 - 1938.\n\nFile 759-5, part 5\nPeigan Reserve - Sacred Heart Residential School -\nBuildings - Supplies & Accounts. 1938 - 1943.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence during quarter, as shown in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Feigan Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart School at Brocket, Alberta on Feigan Reserve for Quarter ended December 31, 1941.**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |               |     |     |      | Grade          | Class               |                          |                             |            |\n|                 |               |     |     |      |                |                    |                          |                             |            |\n| Brought Forward |               | 24  | 26  |       |                |                    |                          |                             |            |\n| 0131 Mary Bed Eagle | 9   | 1   | do  | E    | 59 1           |                    |                          | Oct. 1/40                   |            |\n| 0132 Catherine Crow Eagle | 7   | 1   | do  | E    | 91 1           |                    |                          | Jan. 16/41                  |            |\n| 0133 Alfreda Yellow Face | 7   | 1   | do  | E    | 102 1         |                    |                          | Sept. 22/41                 |            |\n| 0134 Juliana Rabbit | 6   | 1   | do  | E    | 94 1           |                    |                          | do                           |            |\n| 0135 Doris Rabbit | 3   | 1   | do  | E    | 94            |                    |                          | do                           |            |\n| 0136 Susan Sharp Adze | 8   | 1   | do  | D    | 60 1          |                    |                          | Oct. 5/41                   |            |\n| 0137 Joan No Chief | 7   | 1   | do  | A    | 117 1         |                    |                          | Nov. 2/41                   |            |\n| 0138 Mary Wolf Tail | 7   | 1   | do  | A    | 127 1         |                    |                          | do                           |            |\n\n**TOTAL number of days in Quarter:** 92\n\n**AGGREGATE number of days pupils in residence during Quarter:** 8102\n\n**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 55.45\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $2016.86\n\n**NOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.**\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                          |     |          |                |                   |                         |                             |            |\n| 0102            | Clara Nooskey            | 14  | 1 do B   | 68             | 1                 | Home Economics          | Jan. 1/32                   | 92         |\n| 0103            | Ruth Crow Eagle          | 15  | 1 do E   | 92             | 1                 | do                      | June 7/32                   | 92         |\n| 0105            | Florence L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 9th, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated October 22nd, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|----------------|------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                | Brought forward        | 24  | 56  | Peigan | 18 9 149 1 2 1 3 |                     |                         |                             | 4550       | 2276                                                          |\n| 0182           | Catherine Crow Eagle   | 8   | 1   | do    | E     91         |                     |                         | Jan.15/41                   | 91         | 47                                                            |\n| 0183           | Alfreda Yellow Face    | 7   | 1   | do    | E     102        |                     |                         | Sept. 22/41                 | 91         | 57                                                            |\n| 0184           | Juliana Rabbit         | 6   | 1   | do    | E     94         |                     |                         | do                           | 91         | 18                                                            |\n| 0185           | Doris Rabbit           | 3   | 1   | do    | E     94         |                     |                         | do                           | 91         | -                                                             |\n| 0186           | Susan Sharp Adae       | 7   | 1   | do    | D     60         |                     |                         | Oct. 5/41                   | 91         | 57                                                            |\n| 0187           | Joan No Chief          | 7   | 1   | do    | A     117        |                     |                         | Nov. 2/41                   | 91         | 57                                                            |\n| 0188           | Mary Wolf Tail         | 7   | 1   | do    | A     127        |                     |                         | do                           | 91         | 57                                                            |\n\nTotal number of days in Quarter: 91\n\nAggregate number of days pupils in residence during Quarter: 4967\n\nAverage attendance of pupils during Quarter: 54.8\n\nAmount of per capita grant due for Quarter: $1997.44\n\nNOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                          |     |     |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 0102            | Clara Noosokwe           | 14  | 1   | 0    | B              | 69                 | Home Economics          | 146 Jan. 1/32               | 91         |\n| 0103            | Ruth Crow Eagle         | 16  | 1   | 0    | E              | 92                 |                         | 366 June 7/32               | 91         |\n| 0105            | Florence L.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 3rd 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at OCT 6 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart School at Brocket, Alberta on Piigan Reserve for Quarter ended September 20th 1942**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                |     |     |      |               |                   |                          |                             |            |\n| 0134            | Juliana Rabbit | 6   | 1   | do E | 94            |                   |                          | Sept. 22/41                | 92         |\n| 0135            | Doris Rabbit   | 8   | 1   | do E | 94            |                   |                          | Sept. 22/41                | 92         |\n| 0136            | Susan Sharp Adze | 9  | 1   | do D | 60            |                   |                          | Oct. 5/41                  | 92         |\n| 0137            | Joan No Chief  | 8   | 1   | do A | 117           |                   |                          | Nov. 2/41                  | 92         |\n| 0138            | Mary Wolf Tail | 7   | 1   | do A | 127           |                   |                          | Nov. 2/41                  | 92         |\n\n**TOTAL number of days in Quarter:** 92\n\n**AGGREGATE number of days pupils in residence during Quarter:** 92\n\n**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 92\n\n**Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $5274.80\n\n**TOTALS:** 24 28 3 4\n\n**TOTALS:** 19 9 13 12 4 3 4\n\n**TOTALS:** 5244 1000\n\n**NOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.**\n## Indian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\n**Piagan Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Sacred Heart School at Brocket, Alberta on Piagan Reserve for Quarter ended September 30th, 1942**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n|                 |                 |     |     |      |                |                   |                        |                           | Total days pupil attended during Quarter | Remarks as to progress, etc., reason for absence, date of absence, whether authorized or not |\n| 0102            | Clara Nosekaye  | 14  | 1   | 0    | Grade 1        | Fair             | Sewing & Cooking      | Jan. 1/32                | 2208       | 400         |\n| 0103            | Ruth Crow Eagle | 16  | 1   | 0    | Grade 2        | Good             |                        | June 7/32                | 92         | 20          |\n| 0105            | Florence L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart R.C. Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal: E. Bower, O.M.\n\nDated July 1st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this place July 2nd 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReop.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheets, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The aggregate attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is determined by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: September 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended March 31 1945\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended June 30 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. George Crehan, D.D.\n\nDated: June 30 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended December 31 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils enrolled during quarter, obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. George Creelman, D.D.\n\nDated: March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this date, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SACRED HEART INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended June 30 1946\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30 1946\n\nI have carefully

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.
