When sitting at the desk she claims she nearly has to stand up to look at the children.\n\nThe teacher also states that there is no drawers to this desk and therefore no place to put any books. All these statements have been checked and found to be exact.\n\nI have measured the stand carrying the desk and it is 47\" wide by 56\" long.

I suggest that court action be taken against these adults mentioned in paragraph eight who have admitted breaking into the school on or about April 23rd, 1946. You may consider authorizing prosecution under Section 539 of the Criminal Code or perhaps even under Section 461 of the Criminal Code, in view of the admission in Edgar Billot's statement to the effect that they broke in to get some cigarettes which indicates intention to steal. No action will be taken pending instructions.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\n\nOTTAWA\n1-6-46\nEO\n\n(F. W. Zaneth) Supt.,\nCommanding \"A\" Division.\nWith reference to correspondence from the Director of Indian Affairs, dated 11-5-46, and forwarding minute appended thereto, regarding the captionally noted subject, the following enquiries were made. A patrol consisting of the writer and Cst. Richard proceeded to Maniwaki, P.Q., and visited Mr. J.R. Grendon, Indian Agent for the Maniwaki Band.\n\nMr. Grendon informed the writer that the Indian Day School had been broken into on three occasions, the latest being during the Easter Holidays, April 1946. Nothing apparently had been stolen during any of these breakings and enterings at the Day School; however, a sewing machine which was in the teachers quarters at the rear of the school was slightly damaged, and the place was left in a disorderly condition.\n\nThe School Teacher Miss. Marie Brennan, was contacted and stated that she had been employed at the Indian Day School since the first of the year, and confirmed the above information regarding the entering at Easter Time. Miss Brennan was asked for the names of any suspects, and she suggested Frank Meness, and Aime Baptiste.\n\nAfter considerable questioning by Cst. Richard, and the writer it was finally learned that Aime Baptiste, age 12 yrs., Albert Chabot aged 15 yrs., and Edgar Chabot, aged 12 yrs., had been involved in breaking into this school during the berry season, which would be during the latter part of July or early August, 1946. A statement was taken from Aime Baptiste and Edgar Chabot, and are held on file at this office, the following are copies of the statements.\n\nManiwaki, P.Q.,\n27-5-46.\n\nMyself, Albert and Edgar Chabot were the ones who broke into the Indian Day School, Maniwaki Reserve. We only took six pencils, two each. Albert and I got on the roof of the back shed, but I did not break the window, and the window must have been broken by Albert. Edgar stayed on the ground the whole time.\n\nSdg. Aime Baptiste\n\nWitness:\nSdg. R.W. Christy\n\nCont. Page 2.\nManawaki Que.\n27-5-46.\n\nAlbert CHABOT my brother, and Aime BAPTISTE climbed onto the shed roof adjoining the Indian School, Manawaki, and my brother Albert went inside while I sat outside, watching when they came down they gave me two pencils which left them two each. This took place last fall sometime at about 3:00 p.m., I am not sure when.\n\nSgd. Edgar CHABOT\n\nWitness:\nR. W. Christy\n\n5. Albert CHABOT was questioned and admitted his implication in this affair; no statement was taken from Albert other than verbally, which was to the effect that he corroborated the above statement. Albert admitted that he broke the window with a slingshot, and had entered the school, while the other boys remained outside, one of the roof and his brother on the ground.\n\n6. These youngsters are Treaty Indians and live on the Reserve; their fathers are Andrew Baptiste, and Jim Chabot. Aime however resides with his grandfather, while the other two boys live with their parents.\n\n7. The first time the school was broken into was during the spring of 1945, and was admittedly done by Aime BAPTISTE, Frank MENNESS age 13, and Patrick DUMONT age 10. No written statements were taken from these boys. From the stories given by them it would appear that a window was broken, the school entered and five pensiles stolen shortly after the school teacher had closed up and gone home for the night.\n\n8. The Band Easter time was admittedly done by Edgar BILLIOT age 17, Tom BUCKSHOT age 18, Tom CHAUSS\u00c9 age 15, and Charlie SMITH age 18, at about 5:00 a.m. on or about the 23rd of April 1946. The above subjects are all Treaty Indians with the exception of Edgar BILLIOT who is white, all subjects reside on the Indian Reserve. The fathers of the above are Rene BILLIOT, Ignace BUCKSHOT, Ellie CHAUSS\u00c9, and Charlie SMITH.\n\n9. Statements were taken from the two principals and are set out hereunder; the originals are held on file here.\n\nManawaki Que.\n28-5-46.\n\nAt about 5:00 a.m. in the morning I was returning from a party at Frank MENNESS home with Tom BUCKSHOT, Tom CHAUSS\u00c9, and Charlie SMITH when Tom BUCKSHOT said let's go into the school; may be there are cigarettes there. BUCKSHOT and I got on the shed roof and Tom broke the window with his fist, both went into the teachers rooms and down into the school room staying a short time & leaving right away. We did not take anything with us. This happened about the 22nd or 23rd of April on a Tuesday morning.\n\nSgd. Witness. E.J. Richard. Sgd. Edgar BILLIOT.\nDuring the latter part of April Edgar BILLOT, Tom CHAUSSE, Charlie SMITH and I when on the way home from a party went into the Indian Day School. Edgar and I got on the roof of the shed and I broke the window with a stone that I had in my hand. Edgar and I went in and had a drink of water the other two fellows stayed on the ground. We did not take anything and left right away.\n\nWitness. E.J. Richard.\n\nSgt. Thomas BUCKSHOT\n\n10. Both BILLOT and BUCKSHOT claimed that neither had touched anything in the school building, especially the sewing machine. The reasons given by both these boys for entering the school are quite different and are obviously untrue.\n\n11. Mr. J.R. GRENISON Indian Agent was advised of the findings of this patrol and requested that prosecutions be entered against Edgar BILLOT, Tom BUCKSHOT, Tom CHAUSSE, and Charlie SMITH, as he was of the opinion that an example should be made, as damage being done to the school, had become all too prevalent during the past year. Mr. GRENISON was advised that the facts, and his recommendations regarding this matter would be reported upon, by me, to my superiors for further instructions.\n\n12. With regards the B.E. & Theft of the Conway Road School neither Mr. GRENISON, Indian Agent, nor the school teacher Miss Geraldine HOGAN had any suspects in mind. Miss. HOGAN advised that 2 dozen pencils, and some chalk had been stolen, and tentatively suggested the sons of Xavier COMANDO, Russell and Robert.\n\n13. Russell and Robert COMANDO were questioned at length with negative results; neither boy spoke very good English, and no French. Russell aged 12yrs, and Robert aged 10yrs have not been attending school since. This matter was taken up with their mother, and she said that they did not want to attend therefore she had not made them. These boys cannot write, and have no use for pencils; no pencils were noted laying around their home, and it is believed they can be eliminated as suspects in the theft from the Conway Road School.\n\n14. Several other boys of the Distr., who might be inclined to rowdyism were questioned at length by both members of the patrol, but nothing could be learned that would indicate any of them were guilty of the above offence.\n\n15. The Conway School is not securely locked, as the lock on the door has been broken all this year, and is very easily opened. Miss Mildred TENESCO, who takes care of this school confirmed the above, as when asked if she had a key to enter the school in the mornings stated that one was not necessary.\n\nCont. Page 4.\nPara 15 Cont.\n\nnot necessary owing to the lock being broken. Some of the Indians living close to the school have noticed the school door open on different occasions, and as the lock was broken believed that the wind had blown it open. Miss. HOGAN the school teacher when questioned regarding the loss of the pencils, and chalk, appeared rather uncertain that they had been stolen. It possible that after an absence of two weeks, Easter Holidays, that Miss. HOGAN was mistaken, however she thought not. In view of the lack of information on the B.E. & Theft at the Conway School it is considered that this enquiry should be concluded.\n\n16. Instructions will be awaited as to what further action if any, is to be taken regarding this matter.\n\nS.U.I.\n\nH.W. Christy 10570 Cst.\n\nThe O.C.\"A\" Div.\nR.C.M.P.Ottawa, Ont.\n\nSir; Forwarded for your information and that of the Department concerned.\n\nIt is my belief that prosecution action is warranted against Edgar HILLIOT, Tom BUCKLETON, Tom CHAUSSE and Charlie SMITH at least under the provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada. As there is nothing to indicate that anything was stolen from the Indian Day School a charge under Section 430 of the Criminal Code of Canada would not stand. Also, as there is no evidence that there was any intent to commit an indictable offence it is felt that a charge under Section 438 of the Criminal Code of Canada would not be applicable.\n\nIt is my opinion that we could successfully enter prosecution under Section 539 of the Criminal Code of Canada. In any event I believe that some action should be taken in this regard as nothing else will have a deterrent effect on people of this type.\n\nHowever, before taking any action instructions are awaited as to what charges, if any, are to be laid.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\n\nJ.J.Somers, Spl.9889\n1/c Detachment\n\nFILE NUMBERS, HEADING AND MARGINAL REFERENCE ARE TO BE PROPERLY FILLED IN.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOTTAWA, June 12, 1946.\n\nFILE NO. 46 D. 652-6-D-8\nYour Ref. 18-2-5\n\nRe: B.

However, if the above information is furnished this office it might be possible to obtain the Deputy Minister's approval to accept the offer of $10.00 made by the Kensington School Commission. I think it might also be advisable to mention the present condition of both desk and chair, and whether the $10.00 offered is considered fair and just.\n\nIf it is found that the desk and chair is the property of the Public Works Department it will be necessary to report the articles as surplus to them.\n\nI should be glad to hear from you in this connection before steps are taken to authorize the sale of the articles in question.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, 23 September 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: File 113 L.A.H.F.\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of the 18th instant respecting disposal of an old desk and chair at Maniwaki.\n\nThis equipment was originally purchased from funds of this Branch and not by the Department of Public Works.\n\nThe desk has no drawers and the Indian Agent states that both desk and chair are \"pretty well scratched up\".

We have also included a sum for the erection of a small teacher's residence at Congo bridge.\n\nCould you please advise me of the local building situation and give me an indication as to whether you think it will be possible to have tenders called for the erection of such buildings in the near future.\n\nWe are having great difficulty in other agencies with our school building programme and are now investigating the possibility of erecting prefabricated teachers' houses where we find lumber is not available. However, I understand from Mr. Raymond, M.P., that we should be able to obtain a supply of lumber in your agency.\n\nBernard F.

I have already connected a few contractors around here and they all give me the same answer, should any construction go on, I would suggest that it should be done by day work.\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, APRIL 16, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nKanawaki Indian Day School\n\nOur Superintendent of Welfare and Training visited the above school on April 15. He reports that it will not be necessary at the present time to construct the addition as listed in our 1947-48 Estimates.\n\nHowever, there are certain repairs and changes required at this school insofar as the hydro and water are concerned:\n\n(a) Water:\nThere is no water at all available within a half mile of the school, as the building is situated on a rocky slope, the Indian Agent, in view of his building experience nearby, feels that it will be necessary to install an artesian well and an electric pump.\n\n(b) Hydro:\nThe hydro is now connected to within approximately 200 yards of the school and it is our intention to connect.\n\n(c) Indoor Toilets and Sewage:\nWhile the above two repairs and installations are being carried out, it is felt advisable to install flush toilets in this school. There is ample basement room.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6094, file 320-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nroom and by the construction of stairs from the present cloak-room into the basement these toilets could be located on the basement floor level. Plywood or gypsum partitions can be erected to cut this section of the basement off from the furnace area.\n\nAs Maniwaki is very close to Ottawa, would it be possible to have one of your engineers spend a day there in the near future, with Mr. Gendron, to ascertain the best location for the septic tank, sewage pipes, proposed stairs to basement, toilets, etc., as indicated as required in the above memorandum. It is felt that five or six hours should be sufficient to acquaint Mr. Gendron with the requirements of the whole situation. As Mr. Gendron has had a great deal of building experience, it is felt that he can then proceed with the necessary alterations.\n\nDirector:\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We will advise the Indian Agent as to the exact day that our officer will reach Maniwaki.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Hoey\n\nFurther to my memorandum of April 16th last and for your information, please.\n\n19/5/47\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Meniawaki Indian Day School.\n\nIn accordance with information supplied you in our memorandum of May 5th last, an officer from this Service visited the above on May 14th and following an inspection of the building and site, technical advice was given to the Indian Agent covering the proposed installation of a plumbing and drainage system.\n\nNo difficulties were encountered in arranging for new stairs to the basement and ample space was found in which to locate the plumbing fixtures. An arrangement of fixtures and partitions was sketched on print at the instruction of the Indian Agent. The fixtures recommended are as follows: two W.C.'s and one basin on boys' side; 2 W.C.'s and one basin on girls' side and one W.C. separately partitioned off for the teacher. A combination laundry tray and kitchen sink was suggested for the kitchen and one drinking fountain in the Class Room.\n\nNo suitable area was found where a septic tank and the customary disposal bed could be located without involving some blasting of rock formations and bulldozing operations in addition to a large quantity of gravel required, which would have to be trucked in and spread. Such an operation would be costly and out of all proportion to the total cost, and to the importance of the project.\n\nThe alternative, is to construct a rock pit or leeching well and connect the raw sewage line from the school thereto. This cess pit would be covered and after bacterial action has taken place, the effluent liquid would rise and be permitted to escape through the pit walls into the surrounding area. Such a pit would require examination and cleaning out after each school term.\n\nA suitable location was found for a leeching well, and the ground slopes away from that point. This set up would be quite inexpensive, and has often been resorted to on jobs where similar conditions as described above were encountered.\n\nThe well diggers were at work and had gone down to an approximate depth of 50'-0\" without finding water. Inquiry showed that some wells in that area are between 100'-0\" and 150'-0\" deep.\n\nUntil water in sufficient volume is found, no recommendation can be made regarding the type of pump required. The Agent was asked to communicate with the Indian Affairs Branch and advise as to the depth of water below grade, at which time the proper unit can be selected.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6094, file 320-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nConsiderable verbal, and other information in sketch form was given to the Agent, and it is believed that he is thoroughly conversant with the requirements, and should be able to competently supervise the installation.\n\nThe Agent was advised to get prices and submit same to Indian Affairs Branch before proceeding with the work. Accounts would be forwarded to Indian Affairs for payment, when operations are completed.\n\nChief Engineer.\nManiwaki, May the 16th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Well for the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nThis is to inform you that following our phone conversation of Saturday May the 10th, the well for the Maniwaki Indian Day School was started on Monday May the 12th, 1947. On my last visit there they had approximately 40 ft. drilled. I expect they may get water at approximately 100 ft., but no one can guarantee this.\n\nThe cost of this well is $6.00 a foot, complete with the casing whenever there is one needed. I have asked them for a well able to furnish approximately 200 to 300 gallons of water an hour, this is in view that some other Indians might want to connect on this system later on, or that the Band might decide to build other buildings in that location which might need water.\n\nWhenever this well is finished I will immediately connect with the Department informing them of the deepness of this well and also to what height from the ground the water rises, in order that this information may be passed to the Engineer to enable him to recommend the pump needed for such a well.\nWhen this first Maniwaki Indian Day School was located there, there should have been some understanding with the proprietor of the lot or the Band on which this School is built as to what dimension was allowed for the ground of this School. Would you have any records of this, if so could you let me know? I would like to know this on account of the projected Pit we would have to build outside of the School and going down the Hill, in order that this might be done on the ground allotted for this School, and if it is not possible get a piece of ground on the next lot, which is owned by an Indian. There seems to be no one around here which can give me this information and I have nothing in the records showing the exact dimensions of the grounds allotted for the School.\n\nThe Maniwaki Indian Day School is built on lot 23 Road Range West and the Congo Bridge Indian Day School is built on lot part of 34 Range 7 North of Congway Creek.\n\nI also wish to inform that I had the visit of the Engineer regarding the ameliorations to be made at the Maniwaki Indian Day School and no doubt he will produce his report and recommendations shortly. The well question was very well discussed with him and no doubt should you desire further informations on this well, I think he should be able to give you them.\n\nThe same informations as to the size of the ground allotted for the Maniwaki Indian Day School, would be requested for the Congo Bridge Indian Day School.\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1947.\n\nMr. J.E. Gendron, Indian Agent,\nManiwaki, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the Maniwaki Day School. It is noted that the drilling of the well has commenced.\n\nWe have made a very careful search of our files and I regret that we cannot obtain definite information for you regarding the property on which the school is located.\n\nWhen the present school was built, the old school on the site was torn down and the new school built on the same location. As far as we can ascertain, the school is on lot 23, but we have not been able to locate any definite information regarding the size of the lot.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nWe have your memorandum of May 19th with reference to the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nIn a letter dated May 16th, Indian Agent Gendron advises us that the well was started on Monday, May 12th. On the date he wrote his letter, approximately 40 ft. had been drilled. Mr. Gendron expects that water will be secured at approximately 100 ft.\n\nWe will advise you when we hear from him further.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MDG\nManiwaki, May the 21st, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Well at the Maniwaki Indian Day School.\n\nThis is to inform you that the well at the Maniwaki Indian Day School is now finished.\n\nWe had to dig 130 ft. before sufficient amount of water could be reached and we have now a well that can furnish at least 35 gallons of water per minute. The digging of this well cost $6.00 per running foot, that is a total cost of $780.00. I have here Mr. J.P. Larocque's bill for the digging of this well, and I am keeping it here until I get written authorization from the Department to make a Voucher in Mr. Larocque's favour for this amount.\n\nThe water at present rises to about 20 ft. from the level of the ground and it is quite certain that an ordinary deep well pump installed in the cellar of the School will be sufficient to pump any amount of water we may need there either for the use of the School or any surrounding Indian habitation that may wish to use this water. Would you kindly connect with Mr. Hargreaves the engineer who absolutely wishes to know the height of the water in the well in order to recommend the right pump to be used. Kindly be sure to specify that this water at present cannot be lowered any more than 30 feet from the level of the ground and that at 40 ft. from the level of the ground it would be quite certain to have water at any time. Nevertheless it would be always recommendable to go as deep as possible with\na deep well pump providing it is a pump which could be put in the cellar of the School and avoid having to build a cabin over it, outside of the School.\n\nI am quite positive that when the engineer has those informations, he will immediately know exactly what pump is necessary as this situation was discussed with him here in Maniwaki.\n\nPersonally I am very much satisfied with this well and I really believe it will satisfy our purpose, should the needs of water increase we will have a sufficient reserve for all emergencies.\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 26, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nManiwaki Indian Day School.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of April 16 and your reply including Mr. Hargreaves' report of May 17, please be advised that we have now received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Gendron concerning the well which was dug at the school. In his letter Mr. Gendron reports as follows:\n\n\"The water at present rises to about 20 ft. from the level of the ground and it is quite certain that an ordinary deep well pump installed in the cellar of the school will be sufficient to pump any amount of water we may need there either for the use of the school or any surrounding Indian habitation that may wish to use this water.

As far as bringing the electricity from the first farmer to the School, I have asked the Manager of the Gatineau Power many times to let me know if they would do that free but yet I have been unable to get an answer. I really think that we could do the balance of the work, that is making the partitions in the cellar, building the stairs, running the sewer pipe to the Cess-pit and also building the Cess-pit out of cedar as understood with the Engineer for approximately $1200, and adding to that $200, for the painting making a total expenditure as follow:\n\n| Item               | Cost   |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Digging of well    | $780.00|\n| Plumbing complete  | 1425.00|\n| Electricity        | 400.00 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would think this hose would be most suitable in rubber and after enquiries find that it would cost approximately .20 a foot. Should you think that the cost of this hose too expensive they might use the \u00bd\" hose but to water a small rink with \u00bd\" hose would be a long job.\n\nKindly let me know what you think of the idea?\n\nJ.E. Gendron,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 2, 1948.\n\nMr. J.E.

The teacher is very devoted and is quite successful. Good housekeeping should be taught and would strongly recommend that hot soups and drinks be given regularly to those pupils having lunch at school. This would be prepared by the older girls under the teacher's supervision and direction. This would be one efficient means of training for those girls.\n\nA Junior Homemaker's Club should also be organized and the teacher should give such an organization much attention. Competitions in handicraft should be encouraged.\n\nA small open air skating rink could be provided at a very low cost. Upkeep of which would be done exclusively by the pupils.\n\nIf this school was under the direction of a religious order such as the Grey Nuns, I am sure would be a step forward in the right direction. This possibility should be kept in mind and taken advantage of at first opportunity.\n| Date       | Description                  | Amount |\n|------------|------------------------------|--------|\n| Avril 10   | 1513 - 2 c/s Dustbane 6-5    | $4.00  |\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would be highly commendable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell Baker,\nActing Superintendent,\nIndian Agency\nJuly 12, 1948.\n\nMr. Russell Baker, Acting Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Maniwaki, Quebec.\n\nManiwaki Indian Day School.\n\nOur records show the following accounts for electricity at the Maniwaki Indian Day School:\n\nOctober 22 - December 5, 1947 $7.83\nFebruary 5 - April 3, 1948 $13.88\nApril 3 - June 1, 18.66\n\nWe do not seem to have a voucher covering the period December 5 to February 4; therefore, if we take the four months, February, March, April and May, the cost for electricity would be $8.00 per month. It would, therefore, be up to Mrs. Lee and succeeding teachers to pay any amounts of the electricity bills in excess of $8. per month.\n\nIf Mrs. Lee is willing to accept this arrangement, you may proceed to instal the unit mentioned in your letter at a cost of $85.30.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nManiwaki, Que.\n10 July 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nWhen at Golden Lake I was speaking to Mr. Neary about our intention to introduce into our Maniwaki Indian Day School as well as our Congo Bridge School hot drinks and food for the benefit of those children who have dinner at the school house.\n\nThis would serve also the purpose of training the older girls in the preparation of different dishes. As this is entirely new to this agency I will not venture in estimating what the cost of this will be.\n\nAs this is being practiced in other schools you are no doubt able to inform us of the approximate amount that will be allotted to each school. The Maniwaki Indian Day School has an attendance of approximately 30 children and the Congo Bridge School 20 school children, two-thirds of whom have lunch at school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell Baker,\nActing Superintendent,\nIndian Agency\nMr. Russell Baker, Acting Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Maniwaki, P.Q.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant regarding serving a hot drink to the pupils at the Maniwaki and Congo Bridge Day Schools, the Department approves the following expenditures for the period November 1st, 1948 to March 31st, 1949:\n\nManiwaki Day School - $8.00 a month\nCongo Bridge Day School - $5.00 a month.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that the children bring a lunch with them.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n| Date       | Description | Amount |\n|------------|-------------|--------|\n| 1-3-48     |             |        |\n| 2-3-48     |             |        |\n| 3-3-48     |             |        |\n| 4-3-48     |             |        |\n| 5-3-48     |             |        |\n| 6-3-48     |             |        |\n| 7-3-48     |             |        |\n| 8-3-48     |             |        |\n| 9-3-48     |             |        |\n| 10-3-48    |             |        |\n| 11-3-48    |             |        |\n| 12-3-48    |             |        |\n| 13-3-48    |             |        |\n| 14-3-48    |             |        |\n| 15-3-48    |             |        |\n| 16-3-48    |             |        |\n| 17-3-48    |             |        |\n| 18-3-48    |             |        |\n| 19-3-48    |             |        |\n| 20-3-48    |             |        |\n| 21-3-48    |             |        |\n| 22-3-48    |             |        |\n| 23-3-48    |             |        |\n| 24-3-48    |             |        |\n| 25-3-48    |             |        |\n| 26-3-48    |             |        |\n| 27-3-48    |             |        |\n| 28-3-48    |             |        |\n| 29-3-48    |             |        |\n| 30-3-48    |             |        |\n| 31-3-48    |             |        |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs.

The balance is to replace old desks, which I have culled, as the cost of repairing would be too high.\n\nAs regards the Teacher's desk, I have requisitioned one, but insist on a large desk, as the one she has there is only 26 inches wide and is far too small to handle such a large number of pupils.\n\nI hope you will order the desks as requested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRussell Baker,\nSuperintendent,\nManiwaki Indian Agency.\n6th May, 1949.\n\nMr. R.

These are made in three sizes, large, medium and small.

As you are aware, the Indian Education Division forwarded you an advance of $25. in connection with the trip to Ottawa of Indian school children last May. This is the only amount for which we request you to account to us. If you have received money from other divisions, you should account direct to them.\n\nWhile we have no doubt that you spent the $25. at the same time the mere statement to this effect is not sufficient for auditing purposes. It will be necessary to forward receipts obtained from the persons from whom the purchases were made.\n\nWe also have received from you voucher # 471 which we also return for the same reason stated above as it will not be accepted by the Treasury Branch as is.\n\nIt is noted that on voucher 452 you stated \"Paid by cheque # 17478\" and on voucher # 471 you stated \"Paid by cheque # 61756\".\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nEncl:\n\nPP/HM\nManiwaki, Nov. 26th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMalvina Carle, a member of the River Desert Band, would like to get the two outside toilets, which are no longer in use at the Maniwaki Indian Day School.

GEORGE ISEHOF, TEACHER OF THE MISTASSINI SUMMER SCHOOL, FOR THE PERIOD JUNE 15th TO AUGUST 15th, 1939, RIGHT REV. J. G. ANDERSON, BISHOP OF MOOSONEE, STATES AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\"The teacher tells me in a personal letter that he has had a summer with many interruptions. Parties of the Indians had to go away from time to time to hunt for food, as they were all very hard up. Others went to Oskelaneo for their supplies to get cheaper goods, but it meant taking their families with them for weeks.\n\nThere were only about 18 of his pupils who were fairly regular, but even these were compelled to go away for fish, etc., in other parts, so that he had only 32 days for school. The rest of the time from June to August there were no children to teach, only a few being there. I think he should have kept school for them. Where there are seven days present and five absent for example means that these children could have attended 12 days, as they were in the camp. A number of others he did not enroll as they attended only 2 or 3 days at a time. Indians arrived late - about middle of June.\"\nAGENT'S REPORT ON ABITIBI AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JUNE 1942.\n\nI must note here the teacher in charge of our summer school, allows to remark that we will experience good results, an organization had been set up as requested by me, to provide women, girls with training for improved use of discarded military clothing, dress making, knitting and mending particularly.\n\nH. Larivier,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 22, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nIn a letter dated June 12, 1945, on File 44-1-1 Rev. J. S. Ford, Assistant Treasurer, Diocese of Moosonee, St. Paul's Church, South Porcupine, advised the Department as follows:\n\nMISTASSINI - Teacher Rev. Norman Burgomaster\nSalary $100.00 a month plus bonus\nSchool to be open four (4) months\nJuly 3rd, 1945.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just returned from my first Missionary trip to Waswanipe and Mistassini in Northern Quebec, and I thought I should write to you while the observations I wish to make are fresh in my mind.\n\nIn the first place, I am sorry to say that the school supplies which I ordered when I was in Ottawa more than two months ago had not arrived in time. I wrote to Mr. Phelan, who told me that the printers were behindhand, but that the supplies would be shipped as soon as possible. In the meantime, the teachers are on the spot and would do their best. I think I told you last year that at the two Missions I mentioned there are nearly a thousand Indians, very simple decent people, for whom comparatively little has been done in the educational way. [I have taken the Rev. Norman Burgomaster and left him at Mistassini, where there are six hundred Indians. The work there is a real challenge.] I have given instructions to the Hudson Bay Company to get out logs and lumber for a new church. The old building is not adequate at all, but I think it would do for a school to begin with, in fact it must be used for the present in that capacity. As we plan for the future, I feel that the Government and the Church ought to work together, and that we should understand each other. I could only stay a little over a day, and I found that Mr. Lariviere was there with a nurse. We were both so busy that it was difficult to have a confidential talk. I do not know him very well; I know he has very strong ideas about the health of the Indians; I believe he is genuinely anxious to help them. He is also a French Canadian, and the school is in the province of Quebec, but on the other hand, it is under the Department of Indian Affairs, which is a federal foundation, and the money spent for welfare and education comes from the pockets of the whole Canadian people. The Indians there speak Cree and a little English, but no French. I think it would be just and only fair, that in any development of schools or hospitals, the background and the history of the Indians should be considered. I am perfectly sure that if we were given the opportunity, it would be better for obvious reasons, if the Mission, the Hospital, and the school could work together.\nThere are several graduates of the Indian School at Chapleau, who have had some training at the Mothercraft Hospital in Toronto. It seems to me that there is a real vocation for some of the cleverer Indian girls. I think eventually that there should be a nurse at Mistassini, and possibly at Waswanipi, all the year round. An ordinary white girl on her own might find that difficult. Another alternative would be to give a decent grant and equipment to the Missionary's wife. There are several that I know who have some qualifications as Red Cross or St. John's Ambulance nurses, who would be able to do a great deal to keep the Department posted with regard to emergency cases requiring hospitalization outside, and do routine work on the spot.\n\nI am going to be very busy this summer, and I hope to leave about the 15th of the month for James Bay. Would it be possible for us to talk the matter over in the Fall? I am most anxious and hopeful that I should be able to work with the Indian Agent who happens to be in charge of these two important posts, but I thought it better to speak to you before talking the matter over with him. He seems to be doing pioneer work, but it would be much more effective if we can work together.\n\nI have ventured to send a copy of this letter to Dr. Moore, your Medical Superintendent, and I should be very glad if you could make any suggestions about having the matter cleared up, not only here but on James Bay at some convenient time.\n\nI am very grateful for the help and for the kindness which has been shown to me since I came to Moosonee, and I would like to make some contribution towards the general good of our Indian fellow-citizens.\n\nYours faithfully,\nSt. John's Seasonal School,\nMistassini, via Roberval, P.Q.\nAugust 10, 1945.\n\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery,\nMines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere has been considerable delay in our communications due to bad flying conditions. Herewith I return two invoices duly signed.\n\nThere ought to be a third invoice for supplies sent to Oskelaneo. This invoice has been checked, but has since been lost. I am working under most difficult office conditions quite without any privacy and it is difficult to know what might have happened to this particular invoice. However, I am quite certain that the invoice was in order and I trust you will accept this acknowledgment as due receipt.\n\nThe supplies were sent to Oskelaneo from whence I had expected the Indians to portage them. They did not so, the parcel was reshipped to Roberval and brought here by plane. Hence the long delay in returning the invoice.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Rev.) N. Burgomaster.\nRector.\nOttawa, January 19, 1946.\n\nMy dear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 16th and have noted with interest the suggestions contained therein.\n\nThe Superintendent of the Reserves and Trusts Division of this branch, Mr. Allan, will visit Quebec City at an early date with the object of discussing with the Quebec Government the best ways and means of securing reserves for the Indians of the Abitibi Agency. Should Mr. Allan be successful in his negotiations, we shall then be in a position to select sites and proceed with the construction of improved Indian day schools in the area; in the meantime, if you are convinced that you can secure a group of pupils either at Waswanipi or Mistassini who would be prepared to attend school regularly for a period of six or eight or ten months, we shall be glad, of course, to pay the salary of a teacher. We cannot, however, pay the salary of a teacher when the school is not in operation. Salaries, in such cases, can only be paid when returns are sent in promptly and regularly.\n\nI have discussed the subject matter of your letter very fully with Mr. Phelan and we are of the opinion that it will not be necessary for you to visit Ottawa at this particular time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nThe Rt. Rev. R. J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nc/o The Imperial Bank,\nCor. Yonge and Bloor Sts.,\nTORONTO 5, Ontario.\nRt. Rev. Robert J.

Hoey, Esq.\nDirector, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\n165 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe time has come when I wish to make preparations for our activities next year. I have come down to Toronto for consultation with our Boards, and I am remaining for a couple of weeks for correspondence. My address until the end of the month will be C/o The Imperial Bank, Cor. Yonge and Bloor Sts., Toronto 5.\n\nThere are several matters about which I would like to consult you. Since Archdeacon Cook and I saw you, I have been down on James Bay, and have been in touch with our various Missions. I am trying to arrange that everyone who teaches in our Indian Schools should send a copy of his report to the Archdeacon at Moose Factory to ensure that they are properly made up and that our obligations are kept as far as possible. I am also arranging that their cheques should be sent directly to the teachers. I think this will save a good deal of time. You will remember that we were speaking of the need of improved buildings; I understand that when it is possible the Department would be willing, either to replace them or put them in order. As far as I am concerned, I would be willing to have all our schools where the Government pays for tuition, transferred to the Department. I understand, however, that the question of title might prevent this (with regard to land).\n\nIn our last conference, which was held with you and Mr. Lariviere, I gathered that as a beginning, the Department would be willing to pay the salaries of a superintendent teacher and his wife at Mistassini and Waswanipe. In the former place, there is no permanent residence although I have the lease of the old Hudson Bay Co. house for next summer. This could make a beginning. At Waswanipe, there is an old Mission house which is quite habitable in the summer time, which might be permanently improved. I have a man and his wife who I think would be qualified to take charge of one of those Missions. I understood that you wished to consider the matter a little further, and I would now like to know whether I should carry out the understanding which we were considering. If necessary, I could go to Ottawa some time in February or after the middle of March. I should be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience, and I can give you further information if desired.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey \u2014\u2014\u2014 May 1, 1946.\n\nI am prepared to find teachers for each of these places if the Department will make a grant. I understand that allowing for travelling expenses of University men, who will come from Southern Ontario, the Department agreed for $100. a month for the actual time of teaching.\n\nWe discussed the matter of the need of school buildings and the impossibility of finding materials and labour this summer. In most of these places we have had to use the church for many years, which has caused depreciation of the property, and the need of frequent painting and repairs. I wonder if it could not be arranged to give a modest rent to the Diocese for our buildings that are used as schools. Personally, I will be very happy when we can have the church to ourselves for religious services. Mr. Clarke of Nekina, who is the Superintendent of all these Missions except Kissatassine and Waswanipi, tells me that there is a very good building at Collins on the railroad, which could be bought for $250.00. This could be renovated for $100. and would be a most excellent beginning in the policy of having school buildings. Could you consider recommending to the Department that this building should be procured at once? I would be grateful if you could confirm our plans for this summer and let me know as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey, Esq.\nDirector of the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\n165 Sparks St.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAs the spring draws near, I wish to write to you about our plan for seasonal schools in the North Country. The following places are the ones we have chosen, all of which I mentioned to you when I called upon you in March.\n\n1. Mistassini - 3\u00bd or 4 months\n2. Waswanipi - Lansdowne House 3\u00bd or 4 months\n3. Lansdowne House, Albany River do.\n4. Collins and Fort Hope do.\n5. Pickle Lake do.\n6. Ombobika do.\n\nA word of explanation about the various points. Lansdowne is the most distant point from the railroad, where we have had a church and school for several years. Mistassini and Waswanipi need no explanation. The Indians are all ours.\n\nWe will have to teach school for this summer in the church at both these places. I have associated Collins with Fort Hope; you will remember that last year we asked permission to follow the Indians when they left Fort Hope in July to go to Collins on the Railroad for the berry picking. The Indian Agent, Mr. Swartzman, approved this action. It may come to pass that Collins will be the headquarters for a considerable number of Indians in the future. Pickle Lake, which is sometimes called Pickle Crow, is a new mining centre where the Central Patricia Mines are gradually drawing Indians from Osnaburgh. We are anxious to begin work there this year. It looks as if it might become an all-year proposition before long. The last place, Ombobika, is rather special. The Ontario Government has a little school and teacher's house at this village on the C.N.R. A good number of Indians come down there for the summer. The teacher is willing to have an Indian school during the summer months. It is probably the only chance that the children will have for any teaching.\nOttawa, May 16, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to six seasonal schools that you recommend be operated during the coming summer.\n\nA quantity of school supplies has been ordered for Mistassini, Waswanipi and Lansdowne House.\n\nI infer from the information contained in your letter that all of the three places are located on or close to the railway line. This means that certain Indians are moving down from the reserve. In the past, it has not been our policy to encourage Indians in that section of the country to reside along the railway line. If they are unable to obtain regular employment, numerous complaints arise, that could be more easily handled if they were living on their own reserves.\n\nThe Department has already written to Indian Agent Swartman with a view to obtaining additional information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Reverend R. J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\n100 Argyle Avenue,\nIroquois Falls, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 22, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of the 16th instant, regarding the seasonal schools that you suggest be operated this year, I regret that the third paragraph of that letter was not as clear as we intended.\n\nThe schools about the operation of which we were doubtful were Collins, Pickle Lake and Ombabika. This information should have been contained in the third paragraph of Mr. Hoey's letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Reverend R.J.

It may be that the materials for some places have already been ordered. If so, please check to avoid duplication. Last year, owing to the lack of materials and perhaps some vagueness as to the address, the materials arrived too late to be of service to the teachers. All our teachers have not yet been chosen, and I have therefore requested them to be sent to some permanent and responsible person. Please let me know if this is satisfactory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I apologise sincerely.\n\nCould the cheque issued for this service be made payable to the Diocese of Moosonee, since no part of it is included in my income and the Diocese has covered all transportation and living costs.\n\nBefore going to Mistassini I flew to Waswanipi with Captain Ted Gray to introduce him to the work there. Consequently I was a little later than usual in arriving at Mistassini.\n\nIn my requisition for last year I had included a mimeograph capable of producing one hundred copies at least. I received a very unsatisfactory hectograph pad that will do less than forty very poor copies. A good mimeograph is almost essential to effective teaching among those primitive Indians for much of the work must be outlined in syllabics. I bought efficient equipment for this work, prepared to cover the cost personally if the Department was not interested. The equipment is standard with the Dick Company and easily serviced locally. With the mimeoscope and all accessories the cost is about one hundred and seventy-five dollars. I have the invoices available. I find myself unable to continue the work at Mistassini but will make all necessary plans for my successor, and leave all equipment in care of the Diocesan Office. Would the Department be interested in taking this machine off my hands? It has been used only this summer for nothing else but Cree work.\n\nIn closing my connection with your Department in this respect may I thank you for the courteous treatment of your office and offer my co-operation for any service I can render the Cree people in the future. I know the Mistassini Band itself will never regard me as retired from that work. My mail from there is still heavy.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nNorman Burgomaster.\nOttawa, 23 October 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant enclosing the return of the Mistassini Summer School.\n\nPresent regulations do not permit issuing a cheque to anyone but the person who performed the service. We are forwarding the cheque for the Mistassini School in your favour to Right Reverend R.J. Renison, Bishop of Moosonee.\n\nThe mimeograph to which you refer in your letter is much more expensive than we supply to an Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. N. Burgomaster, B.A.,\nSt. Mark's Anglican Church,\nIROQUOIS FALLS, Ontario.\n11th October, 1946.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Hoey,\n\nI am much obliged for your very kind reply to my letter to Mr A.H. Neill, about the proposed change of personnel on the Bay. I quite agree it would be a very unwise thing for my son to go down there at the present time. In fact, I mentioned that fact in my letter, but I did think that it was the kind of work which would appeal to him and for which he has a natural aptitude.\n\nI want to ask your advice about two or three matters of a departmental nature, perhaps you could tell me whom I should see or write on the subject. I have been struck by the fact that whether we like it or not day schools are going to become popular again. I was always keenly in favour of them and I venture to send you an old copy of a speech which I made before a National Convention in Ottawa in 1912. After you have glanced over it, I should be glad if you found it any contribution to the problem which is now before us the Parliamentary Committee.\n\nIt is very obvious that the Government is seriously undertaking the teaching of the Indians. They are willing to build schools where possible and provide teachers. Would you mind if I said that we have received comparatively little help or encouragement in the past.\n\nOur Missionaries, who are fairly well educated, only receive about $30 a month for the period when they teach on James Bay. So far we have provided the schoolhouse and even the fuel which is a serious item in the winter. I would like to know whether\nthis matter should be taken up with the Indian Agents or with the Department. As a matter of fact I have thought that if the Department would be willing to pay the Teacher, we might put an extra man or woman to do this - the very job at some of the larger Missions. The Teacher could live with the Missionary and it would be very much cheaper and more comfortable than building a new habitation at each place.\n\nIn 1945 when Mr Burgomaster was at Mistassini he brought out 25 children and took them to the school in Chapleau. The Mission paid $335 for their railroad fares. So far this has not been repaid by the Department and I have not been sure to whom I should apply. I know there was a misunderstanding between the Missionary and the Agent and it is possible that Mr Burgomaster acted without authority.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Remson\n\nP.S.

We would certainly be glad to discuss with you further the proposal which you make concerning full time teachers at some of your schools. If you write directly to the Department, we usually refer the matter to the Indian Agent for his recommendation, therefore it is usually better to discuss the subject first with our Agent, and submit the proposal through him. We are communicating with the Agent concerned regarding the misunderstanding in connection with Mr. Burgo-master and you can anticipate a further letter from us in this respect.\n\nInsofar as the fuel is concerned, I feel certain that we can meet the costs for heating these school houses. Could you please provide me with a list of the schools which are not receiving fuel grants and I will write to the Agent concerned about them.\n\nI hope I have been able to answer to your satisfaction the various points which you have raised in your letter. Mr. Roey was very delighted with the copy of your speech of 1912 - it would seem that you were 35 years ahead of the times.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRight Rev. R.J.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am very glad to have your letter concerning the questions about which I wrote to the Director, and which were referred to you.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to tell you that I mentioned your name to my son George, who is now a working man, learning the paper business in the Howard Smith Paper Mills. He is married and he has a young daughter one week old. At present he is in Beauharnois. If you care to write to him, you can find him C/o Howard Smith Paper Mills. He was delighted to hear of your activities in civilian life, and spoke most warmly of his relationship with you in Italy. I feel the matter of the Day Schools is so important and may have such wide-spread influence on the future of the Indians, that it is worth more than merely a list of schools and their requirements. I would very much like to come to Ottawa with all the requisite information and talk the matter over with some idea of arriving at a policy in keeping with future developments. The Treasurer of our Diocese, Mr. H.T. Jamieson, Chartered Accountant, goes to Ottawa very often on Government business. I feel that with his help it might be worth while for me to see you personally at some convenient time. I will bring him with you if you wish. I might be able to come between the 15th November and the 1st of December. Please let me know if this would be convenient to you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

My present plans do not call for any outside trips between the 15th of November and the first of December. Therefore this time should be very convenient for me - unless of course an unexpected inspection trip is necessitated.\n\nI was very pleased to hear about George and will drop him a line some time soon. I sincerely hope that he makes as great a success of the paper business as he did of his army career.\n\nHoping to see you, then, in the near future, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstore,\nPorcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nProposed Indian Day School at Mistassini\n\nOn November 18 the Right Reverend Robert J. Renison, M.A., D.D., Lord Bishop of Moosonee, visited this office to discuss educational plans in the Diocese of Moosonee. When informed that the Department was prepared to build an Indian Day School at Waswanipi, he informed us that he felt there was a more urgent need for a permanent day school at Mistassini. Not only are there more Indians at this latter point but they are a more stable group and a day school would have a better chance of success.\n\nAs a result of the meeting, the following decisions were reached:\n\n1. That an educational survey be conducted by the Department as soon as possible to decide the location of this school.\n\n2. That His Lordship be informed as soon as the necessary moneys have been made available for this purpose.\n\n3. That a decision be deferred until the Spring as to whether the Department will be able to build this school or whether it will be necessary to appeal to the Church of England to have it constructed (as was the case at Fort McPherson).\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 30, 1946.\n\nRental for Mistassini Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nFurther to our interesting discussion of recent date, I have been checking the old files concerning the rentals paid in the past for various Anglican Churches used as part time Indian day schools. It is my intention to write you separate letters concerning each one.\n\nI find that up to 1931 the following amounts were paid to Bishop Anderson for the use of the Church of England Church at Mistassini:\n\n1. Allowance for scrubbing and sweeping during the months of June, July and August at $5 per month - $15.00\n\n2. Rental of building used for school purposes during the above period - 3 months at $5.00 per month - $15.00\n\nIf it is necessary to run this school again during the next summer, the Department is prepared to make the same payments as previously arranged by us, in a letter sent to Bishop Anderson on June 21, 1924. Therefore it will be in order for you to submit accounts to this amount, quoting as authority our letter 44-9-5 of June 21, 1924.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend R.J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\nCol. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nOne matter, which I was going to discuss with you more fully was taken over by Mr. Phelan when we met in your office; for the sake of record I would like to put it in writing. In 1945 when Mr. Burgomaster was at Mistisini he brought twenty-five children with him on his return. They were flown out to Oskalaneo which is 200 miles by air and from there they were taken by train to Chapleau; the distance by train alone must be nearly 500 miles. I thought that Mr. Burgomaster had arranged with the Indian Agents; apparently he had to act quickly. I know that the regulations do not provide for the flying of children but a canoe trip, in this case would have cost very much more besides incidental expenses for food I paid a bill to the Hudson's Bay Company for $350.00. The children all did well. This summer Mr. Burgomaster brought out six children to Chapleau at a cost of $100. May I say that this summer the cheque for the school in Mistisini two months teaching was $217.00. Mr. Burgomaster was very much more than a teacher at the school. He was the guide philosopher and friend of 600 Indians. I am sorry he will not be with us next year. It would be a great encouragement to me when we can have a stable organisation at Mistisini. In the last two years during the summer our Mission has spent $3000.00 at Mistisini alone. I would be grateful if you and Mr. Phelan can have this matter adjusted.\n\n(Signed) Robert J. Renison\nBishop of Moosonee\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nOn February 15th, 1947, Mr. Indian Agent Lariviere visited this office and the following proposals were made concerning the provision of Indian Day Schools at Mistassini and Waswasinipi.\n\nThe sum of $8,000 has been provided in the 1947-48 estimates for the construction of an Indian Day School at Waswasinipi. In view of the isolated position of both these schools it will not be possible to construct a frame building but it will be necessary to put up log buildings. It is further recommended that in view of the fire hazard which exists in these localities, that separate buildings be constructed for the teacherage and the school.\n\nWe therefore plan to proceed as follows with the expenditure of the $8,000 provided in the estimates:\n\n(a) During the following summer logs will be cut by the Indians and hauled into position at Waswasinipi so that a start can be made in the construction of this school in the summer of 1948.\n\n(b) During the following summer logs will be cut by the Indians and hauled into position at Mistassini so that a start can be made in the construction of this school in the summer of 1948.\n\n(c) That a supply of school books be sent in to Mr. Lariviere for use in these schools.\n(d) A supply of sporting goods be sent into Mr. Lariviere for use in these schools.\n\nBernard F.

Neary:\n\nI will be in Toronto until the end of next week, which is the last time I shall be able to discuss with you our plans for next summer. In the first place I would like you to know that Arch-deacon Cook, who is my representative on the Bay, and Principal of the Moose Factory School, will be in Ottawa next week on Departmental business. I have asked him to discuss with you the matter of building a new school for day pupils at East Main and Old Factory River. These are badly needed. I believe that if the Department cannot see its way to building themselves, it would be quite possible for us to undertake the work if they would pay the cost. We have two good teachers there, but the time has come for a school building in each place. Archdeacon Cook has my confidence, and I would like you to see him when he calls. I rather think that it would be a good thing for me to come down to discuss the building of the new school and residence at Mistassini. I would very much rather that the Department should undertake this work themselves but however it may be done, now is the time to make preparations.\n\nI would also like to discuss with you the schools to be approved for next summer. You were good enough to go over the list last year, but there are some changes. I have your forms for the recommendation of teachers, which I will use in every case this year.

I hoped to be able to see you when I went down to Ottawa with the deputation to meet the Parliamentary Committee. Unfortunately, you were away that day. However, I heard from Archdeacon Cook of what you are hoping to do at Waswanipi and Mistassini. I have some good men already chosen for the North, but I have marked one or two on your list to whom I will write.\n\nLast summer you were good enough to send me a list of forms to be filled in by prospective teachers, giving their experience. I am afraid I sent it to Archdeacon Cook who is on James Bay and I now am going to ask you to send me twelve or fifteen blank forms so that I can have them filled in and sent to you before these men reach their posts. I would be grateful if you could have these forwarded to me at once.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRJR/AF\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour No. 35-12-1 (WT 1) April 21st, 1947\n\nIn reply the suggestion of Rt. Rev. Bishop Rennison, is in accord, following conversation with him at Iroquois Falls and later in Ottawa, in presence of self and the Director Mr. R.A. Hoey, about 2 years ago.\n\nThe teachers at Mistassini I am still of the opinion should develop these Indians along practical lines, not altogether within the meaning of \"school\" as most persons understand it.\n\nI believe teachers, man and wife, to teach these Indians as previously discussed, should both be paid, with the clear understanding that as soon proper set up is established, etc., that regular full time salaried teachers should take over, this should be possible at opening of summer season in 1949.\n\nI wish to insist on this, that the set up at Mistassini must end and close up on August 15th, these Indians the majority have some 200 miles and more to move their supplies before freeze up and they should be all out of Mistassini before end of August, some of them by August 10th or about, holding them back like it has been done for a few years past, is detrimental to these Indians and a source of endless troubles, during winter, shortage of food etc., when pulling out too late, they don't get home to get the fish run and this means starvation, T.B. poverty and what not.\n\nH. Lariviere, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, April 28th, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of April 9th and my reply of April 14th with reference to your suggestion to obtain the services of a married man and his wife to conduct the Mistassini Seasonal School during the coming summer.\n\nMr. Lariviere, our Indian Agent, is very strongly in favour of this suggestion and I trust that you will be able to make a nomination of a suitable couple.\n\nMr. Lariviere points out that the school should close by August 15th as the Indians will have to leave for their hunting grounds about that time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope,\nPorcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Mr Neary;\n\nWhen talking with Bishop Rennison of Moosonee recently he informed me of the developments at the Mistisinni Lake Reservation, P.Q. I was intensely interested as I spent some years in the Bay and at one time made the long hard trip by canoe from Rupert's House to Mistissini.\n\nI wonder if you will mind my suggesting that in my experience over a period of eighteen years in the North, the ideal plan for the bush Indian would be a \"cottage\" school for all the children during the Summer, and a continuation for picked pupils all winter while the parents were in camps. I would build a couple of cottages or a dormitory attached to the school under an elderly Indian caretaker. The brightest of the Summer pupils could be retained... (say a dozen) and in one winter I am sure more could be effected through them than in years of 'summer' educating... when the pupils go off in the Fall and come back next Summer having forgotten all they knew.\n\nI do not advocate the Residential School as it is (among other things) too expensive and elaborate for the bush Indian. Such a 'cottage' school as I suggest could be operated by a married teacher or Missionary and the wife could teach the juniors and organise the women folk, etc. A good garden could be cultivated by the pupils, animals caught... all with the aid of the Indian caretaker... who might be an elderly couple.\nI did not have time to discuss this with Bishop Rennison but he had invited me to fly into the missions this Summer as I have some knowledge of the Cree and Chipawayen. Unfortunately I cannot get away this year...but I am interested. I came out of the North because my two eldest children had to go on to higher education, but when we are through we intend returning.\n\nI hope this will not seem an impertinence but in reading the reports from Ottawa and the Briefs presented I have yet to see anything as practical suggested for the North.\n\nSincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend A.R. Marshall.\nOttawa, June 23, 1947.\n\nSeasonal Schools\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nThe supplies for these schools were shipped in to Mr. Lariviere some three months ago. You will recall that I discussed this plan with you on your visit to the Department last winter. Our supplies department then made up the necessary bundles of books, pencils, etc., and shipped them to Mr. Swartman and Mr. Lariviere to forward to the schools immediately the teachers arrived. I saw Mr. Lariviere recently and he informed me the supplies had gone in to the schools concerned. It is our intention to do this every year in future so that the agents will have on hand a sufficient minimum stock to get the schools started.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P.

Bishop Renison has been advised that the teachers should in each case report to you or contact you in some way so as to ensure the delivery of these school supplies.\n\nIn my notes made upon this visit I have written that the Mistassini Exploration Company is keenly interested in this area and that there is a possibility they might put a road through to this district. You are probably already aware of this probability. I understand that Canon Jacob Shakapo will probably live in the mission house and that the teacher whom Bishop Renison nominates will live in the teacherage. I presume that the above arrangement will be workable and will expect to hear from you about this point.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 12th, 1948\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. B.F. Neary - Supt. Education\nYour No. 35-12-1 (E) 35-13-1\nMarch 6th, 1948\n\nI note the arrangements as regard the teachers nominations and supplies for Mistassini & Waswanipi, rest assured the supplies will be delivered on time and I will be very pleased to assist the teachers.\n\nThe Chibougamau-Mistassini-Roberval road, is more in connection with huge pulpwood projects and power through the operators on the St-Maurice River down to Three Rivers, this year will be the last trip for the Mistassini Indians on Oskeneco, the best we hope for this season is to get some use out of the new road to as far as Chicobish Lake, about 90 miles by truck road and 90 miles by air on Mistassini towards late summer or early fall, however for 1949 it will be workable and dependable. I again recently discussed this matter with traders and operators of transports, for 1949 we should be able to realize a saving for the Indians and ourselves of about $25% to 33%, I am making a strong bid to get it this late summer on fall supplies, at least on Family Allowances.\n\nThe accommodations suggested for the Teachers at Mistassini & Waswanipi, are like last year, I consider unfair to the Teachers, and it does not create the desirable and badly needed example among these Indians more so at Mistassini. Cannon Mathew Shecapio is an Indian, family infected with T.B., Rev. Evans lived with them last year, I could never understand how they could do it. Rev. de Pendleton lived by himself in a miserable old house, Indians would not do it, however I presume it is up to them.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nI have your letter of March 25th about Mr. Alexander Short with regard to summer work. I think I could find a place for him. I wonder if you would consider placing him with the Rev. C. D. Ellis at Mistassini? You will remember that I asked for a young girl teacher there but I have heard that Mr. Ellis may have to leave early in August. As there are about 150 children there it would be far better if two young men could be together. They could live in the same house. At any rate I hope to be in Ottawa on April 14th when I can discuss the matter with you. If Mistassini is impossible I will try to find a place for him at one of the other schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMarch 31st, 1948.\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI.

He is 27 years of age and is very keen to undertake the work which we are endeavouring to promote with the Mistassini Indians. He has discussed the local situation with both Bishop Renison and myself and has also written to the Reverend Mr. Ellis, who will be the senior teacher.\n\nI understand that the Reverend Mr. Ellis may not stay the full term at Mistassini and that Mr. Higginson will probably finish the last two or three weeks out as the only teacher.

Evans won't be at Mistassini this year, no doubt the main reason is living conditions experienced in 1947.\n\nI note the arrangement for summer 1948, it is evident Mr. Higginson and Rev. Ellis understand the conditions they will have to put up with. I do hope that at Mistassini someone suitable does become interested in this work in a permanent way like, changing annually is viewed by the Indians, with a great deal of dislike and it follows they become non-interested. These Indians are better described as \"sauvage\" and it is only through an interested person returning for at least a number of years, that they will develop what we are all aiming at, no doubt after the new set-up is completed it will bring about the desired interest into the settlement.\n\nThis year Mistassini will be definitely free of ice by late May, if they wish to go in for June 1st, they will find a good number of Indians already in, they should be all there by the 15th. of June, the Nursing Station will be opened on June 7th.\n\nA.M.

I advised him to write you directly and advise when he was leaving Montreal so that you could arrange for the school supplies to be sent in with him. The Reverend Mr. Ellis has already seen Mr. Higginson here in Ottawa, and I understand that the two of them are going in together.\n\nMr. Ellis has had previous experience with the Indians and will be leaving in mid August to attend Yale University. As I told you in my previous letter Mr. Higginson will remain in Mistassini until the end of the term. I have given Income Tax and Staff Questionnaire forms to the Reverend Mr. Ellis and have also given him a supply of Quarterly Returns.\n\nI understood from him that they will be going in as you suggested, namely, during the first week in June.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nNO. 43\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI have waited for some time until I can give you a picture of our plans for the Indian schools this summer. I will take them in order.\n\n(1). MISTASSINI. There are two teachers there. The Rev. C. Douglas Ellis, M.A. of Trinity College, Toronto and Arthur Higginson of 217 Fifth Avenue, Ottawa. They will fly in from Roberval on June 3 and will work together for about two months. I do not know if the new teachers' residence is finished but I have permission for them to use the old Hudson Bay Co. house in the meantime. With regard to this place I had a letter from the Rev. Condon about the possibility of sending a contingent of picked children from there to Moose Factory, by air. You will remember that two years ago 30 went to Chapleau and came back wonderfully improved. Although it seems remote, actually Moose Factory would be very suitable for these children. One large plane could carry about 20 and they would make the trip in three hours. I only want you to know that if the Indian school administration approaches you on the matter you have my consent.\n\n(2). WASWANAPI. I understand that the school and the teachers' house are already completed. I am sending in Mr. P. J. Stephenson from Trinity College, Toronto, to take charge this summer. He will fly in from Senneterre about June 1st. He will be there until the end of September.\n\n(3) LANSBOWE HOUSE on the Upper Albany River. Mr. R. E. Blight, B.A. of Huron College, London, will be flown in from Nakina at the end of the first week in June.\n\n(4). FORT HOPE. Mr. R. W. Ross of Huron College, London, will go up with Mr. Blight and be flown in at the same time.\n\n(5). COLLINS. You will remember that you approved of sending a man to do the work at Collins this summer. I have a man in sight, Mr. S. A. Ball, University of Toronto. He is a married man and has not seen his wife all winter. He would like to go if he can take her with him but $120 a month and his travelling expenses would\nbe required. I am not \"holding you up\" but would you tell me what you think of it? In the meantime I am putting Mr. Vollrick as the nominal teacher. I think it would be wise as an experiment this year, to see what he could do to shepherd the children there. I will send you further details later.\n\n(6). OSNABURG INDIANS (Pickle Landing) The Rev. T. H. Bridle, B.A. You will remember during our conversation in April you told me that you would approve of the school being continued at Pickle Landing which is near Geraldton. Although it is only a rented building which we have improved for the present, you agreed that Mr. Bridle was a very capable person. Since then I have heard that Mr. Swartman has recommended that the school should be at Dog Hole where there is a medical centre. I agree that eventually if the government will build a school there it will be ideal but I am afraid they could not provide a building this year and if they did Mr. Bridle would not be able to give enough time and it is rather late to ensure a new man. I would ask your permission, for this year only, to allow the school to be continued at the landing. Give Mr. Bridle the grant and I know he will do a good job. For next year when there is a building and a man provided he will be very glad to hand it over to a summer teacher. May I ask you to wire me here before May 15th, if you approve of this as I will be seeing the missionary in charge at that time.\n\n(7). GENERAL. I would like to tell you something about the financing of these schools, from our point of view. We are very grateful for the grants to the teachers. In the past, while they have not covered expenses, they have been reasonably adequate. But now, as you know, the cost of living in the north is very high. These students are putting themselves through college. I have found this year that I must guarantee to every man his travelling expenses both ways and $120 a month, as in the case of Mr. Ball, and we must advance their travelling expenses. These men vary in calibre but considering the character of the appointments I would be very glad if you would make the grants as high as possible, otherwise we may not be able to get men for another year and I am sure that until a permanent school is justified the present method is reasonably successful.\n\nI am hoping to go to England for the Lambeth Conference in June and would like to have everything settled as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRJR/G.\nDear Colonel Reary:\n\nMrs. Higginson and myself are both settled in Mistassini, and school is proceeding. Neither building nor teachers' residence is up, and we have no supplies except six specimen copies of books, entirely wanted to the kiddies here.\n\nThe school is divided into two classes, of youngers and older children. Mrs. Higginson takes the older, and I the younger. Mr. Lariviere has been very helpful with his suggestions regarding the school, one of which was that I write your office, asking for a supply of the new first readers for Indian children. Mrs. Higginson holds her class in the church, and in the bottom flat of the old H. B. Co. house.\n\n(Poor Copy)\nWe are expecting a supply of writing-books and pencils from Mr. Laurin shortly. Meanwhile, the school is proceeding more or less on the lines suggested\u2014as far as our dearth of supplies permits.\n\nApparently Wasawapi has received a supply of the readers in question, and we would appreciate a supply also if possible,\u2014as soon as possible.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience,\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Rv.) C. Douglas Ellis\nJune 23, 1948.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Amos, Que.\n\nWe have a letter from Reverend C.D. Ellis at Mistassini dated June 14th, 1948, in which he states that the school supplies had not reached the school by that date.\n\nOur records show that shipment of school supplies went forward to you from here on June 1st. They were addressed to you at Amos, Quebec. No doubt you have received them and we would appreciate knowing when they were sent to the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPF/MGD\nThe Indian School Administration\nof the\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SUPERINTENDENT\nRev.

Ellis, M.A., as teacher of the above Indian Seasonal Day School.\n\nMr. Ellis will be the junior teacher at a salary of $150.00 a teaching month, effective May 25th, 1948. Cheques should be forwarded to him care of Mont Laurier Aviation Company, Roberval, Quebec.\n\nPlease find attached income tax form as completed by Mr. Ellis.

They were sent in care of Mr. Lariviere at Amos, P.Q. We wrote to him concerning this matter.\n\nWe also sent you a number of application forms for the entrance of Indian children into Residential Schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. C.D. Ellis,\nc/o Mont Laurier Aviation Company,\nRoberval, Quebec.\n\nPP/MGD\nJuly 5th, 1948.\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Mistassini Ind. Summer Day School.\nYour letter No. 74-8-1 (E.1)\nJune 23rd, 1948.\n\nThe supplies referred to in my letter to Mistassini by air on June 12th, delivered by myself to Rev. C.D. Ellis. Last year at Mistassini there was a considerable surplus put away by Reverend Evans for use in 1948. I found that these supplies were issued during winter to the Indians by Deacon Mathew Shecapio, school books were found all over in the bush near the camping grounds; I asked Rev. Ellis to make sure that this year the surplus be better taken care of.\n\nDuring my stay at Mistassini Reverend Ellis discussed with me possibilities to transfer Indian children from Mistassini to Moose Port Residential School. I pointed out that on the railway line there was a number of children (anglicans) unless educated in a few years they would not be able to earn their living and it was most important to provide for them if there were vacancies at residential schools. I cannot say if he will apply for transfers from Mistassini. Personally I feel unless the children along the railway line are provided for, it would be an error to transfer children from Mistassini or Waswanipi Band points.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt., Indian Agency.\nMistassinny Post,\nc/o Mt. Laurier Aviation Co.,\nRoberval, P.Q.\n\nJuly 27, 1948.\n\nCol. B.W. Neary,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\n165 Sparks St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThis is to advise you that I shall no longer be teaching at the school at Mistassinny Post, as of August 10th., 1948.\n\nFollowing your directions, I shall date my withdrawal from teaching as of August 20th., 1948, being the ten days you have allowed to cover travelling expenses.\n\nAs I mentioned in our conversation towards the end of May last, I made a business trip to Waswanipi. The trip occupied several days longer than I had anticipated, causing me to lose about three school days more than the four or five estimated when speaking to you. Although this was due to circumstances over which I had no control, I shall continue to teach two or three days beyond the date cited above, or until such time as air transportation from Mistassinny is available, without showing this on the Returns. This should compensate the Department for any time lost.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) C. Douglas Ellis\nSt. Luke's Church  \n(Anglican)  \nRosemount, Montreal\n\n3432 Rosemount Blvd.,  \nRosemount,  \nMontreal 36, P.Q.\n\nAugust 27, 1948.\n\nCol. Bernard Neary,  \nDirector of Indian Schools,  \nDept. of Mines and Resources,  \n- Indian Affairs Branch -  \n165 Sparks Street,  \nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThis letter is a check-up on the one forwarded with the last Day-School Returns.\n\nAs stated therein, I continued to teach until the 10th of August, inclusively. On the 11th, however, there was a flight leaving Mistassiniy; so I took advantage of the opportunity,- since weather had been undependable, and left the Post that day.\n\nThe last day, accordingly, on which my name would appear on the payroll-file in your office, would be August 20th.\n\nSincerely,\n\nC. Douglas Ellis  \n(Rev.) C. Douglas Ellis.\nSeptember 1, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Mistassini Indian Day School, No. 321.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of July 6, please be advised that the Department has received and accepted the resignation of Mr. C. D. Ellis, M.A., as teacher of the above school, effective August 20, 1948. No further payment of salary should be made to him after that date.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nDirector of Indian Schools,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch -\n165 Sparks St.,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nEnclosed please find cheque, No. A9-W C70085, to the amount of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00), being my salary for the whole month of August.\n\nIn case you failed to receive either of my letters stating that I would be leaving before the end of the month, I might point out, Sir, that I have no right to be on the payroll after the twentieth of August, 1948. This date includes the ten days allowed for travelling expenses as well.\n\nI return the cheque to allow you to make any adjustment you may desire, in case some misunderstanding has occurred.\n\nSince I expect to leave the country next week, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let me hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nSincerely,\n\nC. Douglas Ellis\n(Rev.) C. Douglas Ellis.\nExtract from letter from Supt. Lariviere dated September 3, 1948, Original on file\n\nMr. Higginson left Mistassini on August 31, 1948.\nOttawa, October 18, 1948.\n\nRe: Riggingini Indian Day School, No. 321.\n\nPlease find attached cheque forwarded to Mr. Rigginson, teacher at the above Indian Day School, in payment of his services for the month of September.\n\nAs Mr. Rigginson taught only a part of the month, he has returned this cheque. We will advise you later concerning the amount which should be allowed to him for his partial services during this time.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nEmil.\n\nBFM/EM\nDec. 16th, 1948.\n\nColonel B. D. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI am very grateful to you for your interest in suggesting the name of Mr. H. L. Church and his wife, who is a registered nurse for the Constance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIt may be that this suggestion can be carried out, although Mr. W. H. Thompson seems to be doing a very good job and is taking much interest in the Indians.\n\nI have had it in my mind for some time to suggest to you, that we ought to have a Teacher at Misstasini for a longer period than two or three months. Evans and Higginson did a good job there last Summer. Unfortunately, owing to my absence in Lambeth, I was unable to visit the Mission last Summer but it is very much on my mind. As you know, there are about six hundred Indians connected with the Post. The School and the Teachers' Residence should be completed by now.\n\nHow would you like to consider the possibility of putting in somebody like Mr. Church and his wife?\n\nThe time will soon come when modern development will make it necessary to have someone there most of the year, if not, all the time.\nIt would be a great challenge for a young man, who is a teacher and a nurse as his wife. It would give them a respectable living.\n\nIf you think well of the idea, would you be kind enough, to ask Mr. Church to write to me here.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Renis\n\nRJR/L.\nDecember 31, 1948.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nConstance Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI was very pleased to receive your reply of December 16 concerning Mr. and Mrs. Church.\n\nYour plan would be ideal but for the fact that Mr. Church is an Ontario teacher and he is anxious to continue teaching in that province. I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Church to consider one of our schools. He has an Ontario Provincial Teaching Certificate and is anxious to keep his Superannuation fund in good condition. He can get credit for teaching experience in Ontario Indian Day schools but not in any other province. He can only get credit for Ontario when he has an annual inspection from a Provincial School Inspector.\n\nHowever, I will keep on the look-out for someone like him for Mistassini but there is still a great shortage of male teachers.\n\nThe other school for which I had him in mind was the one to be erected next year at Mountbatten near Toffet. He preferred Constance Lake because he could live in a separate teacherage there.\n\nIn closing may I extend to you on behalf of the Education Division our sincerest wishes for a happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It would be a unique opportunity for the Department to actually see their Schools in operation.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I hope that arrangements can be made for him to accompany you but unfortunately cannot make a definite commitment at this time. He may have two special educational surveys to make this summer and the dates might conflict with your proposed tour. He has just left for James Bay and we should know by the time he returns the definite dates for these other projects. I will write you immediately we can be certain of our plans for the coming summer and sincerely appreciate your offer.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 4th, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nIn my letter yesterday, I told you that I was going to write to you about the matter of our Summer Schools this year.\n\nFor your convenience, I will number them, and where necessary, make some observations.\n\n1. Mistassini - This is the largest community, and you probably know all about it. I was there two years ago; owing to my trip to England, I could not make my Northern Journey last Summer. You were good enough to allow two men. I hope that the School and the Teachers' Residence are both completed by this time. You have already written me about the possibility of W. H. Thompson going there next Fall. This indicates that you are considering the possibility of having a man there for most of the year. There are six hundred people in the Summer. Would you consider sending two men this year, if I can find them?\n\n2. Waswanipi - There, also, I hope that the new School and Residence are finished. I would like to know if that is the case, whether our Summer Teachers might have the use of the residence.\n\n3. Lansdowne House - There are generally, two or three hundred Indians, coming and going, during the Summer. We have a church there and our own teacher's house.\n4. Fort Hope - This is an old mission, where we had a man last year.\n\n5. Collins - This place is on the Canadian National Railroad, a hundred miles West of Nakina. During the last three or four years, a great many Indians have come down for the Summer. They should be looked after and last year, we had a teacher there. These Indians are from the Northern Bands. We try to keep them from coming down the Railroad Line. There are many temptations there and the presence of a teacher seems desirable.\n\n6. Pickle Landing - During the last two or three years, the Rev. T. H. Bridle of Central Patricia has done a remarkable work among the Indians at Dog Hole, Pickle Landing and also Osnaburgh. He is a trained teacher. I know that the Dept. has been thinking of finding some central place for a permanent school, but nothing has yet been decided. I am afraid, that this coming Summer, is the last one, when Mr. Bridle will be there. He deserves a larger sphere, but while he is there this Summer, I think, it would be a good thing if he were allowed to carry on. I know, that last Summer, with the help of an old car, he used to carry the children, several miles, in various directions, for his school.\n\n7. Moose Factory Island - You will probably already have spoken to Mr. Clarke about the situation on Moose Factory Island. This is the site of the Indian Residential School, but there are many on the island in the Summertime, who are not pupils in the Residential School. I wonder, whether you would consider, having a student at Moose, this Summer, for the purpose of holding a Summer School. The other teachers are away for their holidays and I feel that an extra man could be valuable.\nCol. B. F. Neary - 3.\n\nThis would make eight men, if you allow two for Mistassini.\n\nI would like to know how many you think we should have for the coming Summer.\n\nIn the past, the Diocese has had to finance the travelling expenses and the monthly cheques for these men, until the Fall.\n\nMay I ask, whether you wish to continue this plan, in the future.\n\nI would like to know, what salary the Dept. would be willing to pay this year.\n\nTo tell you the truth, we have had some difficulty in paying these students, and also paying their travelling expenses, which in most cases, includes transportation by airplane.\n\nI am going to suggest, that it might be a good thing, if you could consult the Rev. Canon Cook of the Indian School Administration, 102 Bank Street, Ottawa, because he knows the details and the background of these schools. I will send him a copy of this letter.\n\nI also hope that Mr. Clarke, who has just returned from Moose Factory, will be able to give you some light on the subject.\n\nEvery Summer, about the middle of June, I make a trip through all my Indian Missions, including James Bay and this year, I am going to Fort George and Whale River. We will finish at Mistassini. It seems incredible, but I can complete the trip, in about five weeks.\nCol. B. F. Neary - 4.\n\nI has occurred to me, that it might be a good thing, if the Dept. could see these schools in action, during the Summer. I therefore, asked Mr. Clarke, if he thought the Dept. would be interested in sending a man with me, this Summer, on my journey.\n\nIt might be a good investment, from the standpoint of gaining knowledge, and it would help both of us, for we could share the expense.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRJR/L.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I saw Mr. Higginson last week and while he would prefer a transfer to another school, he is quite prepared again to go to Mistassini.\n\nWill the Reverend Mr. Ellis be available again this summer? If not, I have several applications here from young university students who might be interested.\n\n..... Waswanipi\nWASWANIPI\n\nWhile the building at Mistassini will not be completed until late summer, I understand that the school at Waswanipi is nearly finished. I have also heard that Mr. Stephenson is again interested in teaching at this school. You will recall that last year we hired Miss Kathleen Gull as the second teacher. I have a young college student also available for this school if you have no one in mind.\n\nLANSDOWNE HOUSE\n\nMr. Ralph Blight taught here last year. Will he be available again next summer?\n\nFORT HOPE\n\nRobert Ross taught at this school last year and I presume that he will be available again next summer.\n\nGOLLINS\n\nYou will recall that Mr. Wilbert Vollick taught at this school last summer and I presume that he will be available again next year.\nI am pleased to note that the Reverend T. H. Bridle will again be available next summer. I agree with you that he did a good job and hope that he can again teach this school.\n\nMOOSE FACTORY ISLAND\n\nI discussed this with Canon Cook and he advises me that he is writing you directly concerning this school.\n\nWe are preparing a small form to be sent to each teacher, on which they will indicate the opening and closing dates of each of these summer schools and mail them directly to the Department so that we can be sure of their salaries this year. If you would indicate the teachers you have in mind for the above schools, I will write to them directly sending these forms and also other documents needed. Income Tax forms are not required from teachers who taught in these schools last year and whose income tax status has not been changed.\n\nI do hope that we will be able to obtain the services again of those who were with us last year. I feel that often the first summer is spent almost entirely in getting to know the Indians. It is only in the second summer that these teachers can really accomplish very much.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 30, 1949.\n\nMr. J. Schuster,\nTrinity College,\nUniversity of Toronto,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nRe: Mistassini Indian Seasonal School\n\nDear Mr. Schuster:\n\nThe Department has approved your appointment as teacher of the above seasonal school for the summer of 1949 at the rate of $150.00 a teaching month. As you are probably aware, it is most difficult to definitely settle the opening and closing dates of these seasonal schools. This is due largely to the nomadic habits of the Indians whom they serve but also due to the condition of the ice in the rivers and lakes of Northern Ontario.\n\nPlease find attached Income Tax forms to be completed and sent directly to me.\n\nYou will also find attached a form which is to be completed and forwarded here on the occasions of the opening and the closing of this school.\n\nI would also like the attached Application form completed and returned with the Income Tax forms.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDept. Of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI have just returned from London and Toronto where I met some of the students who are going north. Schafter and Meikle met me in Toronto and I have arranged for them to go to Montreal to meet the manager of the Mistassini Hudson's Bay Co. store. I have heard that the old Hudson's Bay house is still habitable and will give them shelter. I have authorized them to purchase whatever is necessary for their trip. Any house equipment the mission will pay for. Other things like personal luxuries they can pay for themselves. I have advanced each of them $100 and have given them an order on the Mont Laurier Aviation Co. at Roberval for return plane fare. They are both keen and competent and will leave early next week. I have also written to Mr. C.H. Brown and Mr. G.W. Thomson who live near Toronto and instructed them to travel to Senneterre. I have given them an order for a plane fare to Waswanapi. So far these are the only men for whom I have advanced money and I am sure that there will be no difficulty. I will either send the bills to you or have them pay me. I would much rather not have to take their cheques myself so that there will be no money transaction between us. If I have made any mistake in assuming that Mr. Brown has accepted you can let me know. I expect to begin my air journey about June 15th at Central Patricia, going down the Albany River, visiting about 6 posts and then around James Bay from Atawapiscut to Whale River and perhaps the Belcher Island then I will go Overland to Mistassini and Waswanapi, ending the journey at Val D'Or. It will be nearly 4,000 miles. I wish you could have sent one of your men with me, or come yourself.\n\nYours faithfully,\nSgd.

This fact was also confirmed in letters received from you. We sent us the prescribed form notifying the Department that we reported for duty of May 20th. This was in accordance with instructions received from the Bishop and which he claimed had your sanction.

We could certainly experiment for one winter and find out just what the reaction of the Indians will be. I hope that these teachers return the money advanced them for travelling expenses.\n\n2/11/49\nThe last post which I visited was Mistassini. It is the largest on the list. There had been an epidemic of measles there and when I landed I found the people rather miserable. There were over 600 Indians, all living in tents, there were two nurses looking after the sick, I found the school is almost finished and the teacher's residence will also be finished this fall. That will be a very great help, although in my opinion the school is a little small for the population. I found Mr. J. Schaffter, B.A. of Trinity College, Toronto, and Mr. Thomas Meikle, B.A. of Trinity College, Toronto, established in bachelors' quarters in the ruins of the old Hudson's Bay Co. house which was to have been demolished this summer but was spared at my request. It will not be needed next year.\n\nI have always felt that when a school was completed and a teacher's residence built which should be consummated this fall I would like to speak to you about the possibility of putting in a resident teacher as a permanent missionary. As you know, perhaps, civilization is drawing near to this place. For 100 years it was separated entirely from the outside world. For the last 20 years it has been served by airplane from Roberval, but this has made transportation very expensive. The road is drawing near to the post. I believe that lumber companies have their eyes on the district. The lake itself is 150 miles long and 15 miles wide. My own opinion is that the Indians should be encouraged to hunt as long as possible. The lake is full of fish but they are mostly living, during the summer, on government rations and flour and lard. I think they are much healthier when they are living their nomadic life, but I am sure that we cannot stop this post having a population of 100 or so all the year round. I have heard rumours of an Indian boarding school there. I believe a government deputation went in but just as soon as Indians go to a boarding school for 5 or 6 years they cannot return to their tents and be happy and healthy.\n\nMr. Schaffter and Mr. Meikle have done admirable work. I advanced them $100 each before they left and they have charged up their purchases to me, for the present, besides that I paid $150 for their flight in to Mistassini and I suppose their return fare will be the same.\nI received your letter, written during my absence, about their cheques which you sent to me. On my return I sent the cheques directly to them. Do you think in any way it would be possible to make some adjustment in order that they may be able to return at least part of the money which they have been advanced for travelling expenses?\"\n\n(Sgd.)

Our officials feel that it is worth while experimenting with for at least one year although I believe Mr. Lariviere is none too keen on operating the school during the winter.\n\nI note you have Mr. Thomson in mind for some such post and would be pleased to hear from you in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E.

(depending on ice) to about August 15th. latest 25th.\n\n3.- This year: Teachers will have own residence - 5 rooms, good log building - new, painted etc.\n\nWe have a similar set-up at Waswanipi, under #2, Waswanipi is operated from about early June, to middle September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI am enclosing a card addressed to Mr. R. Neil who is now living in British Columbia.\n\nI would be very grateful if you would have your secretary insert his present address on the card and return it to us. He is a subscriber to Mrs. Renison's \"Northland\".\n\nChristmas is now near, and the end of the year. I was very glad to hear that Mr. Allan of Moose Factory that he had at last been able to straighten out the report from our four teachers on James Bay. There was no difficulty anywhere, except with the returns of the Rev. Redfern Louttit of Old Factory River, who was able to produce a copy of his returns which had been forwarded to Archdeacon Clarke who found them.\n\nEverything is now arranged for the future. The monthly salaries for each man are agreed upon but since the transition has taken so long there must be a comparatively large sum due to the Diocese. I would be very glad if you would send me these first returns for the past year or more, made payable to each man, as I will have to make an adjustment with them for money that we had to advance, pending the arrival of their cheques. After the adjustment is made I would like each monthly cheque, or quarterly if it is done that way, sent to each man at his address. I would much prefer that each man was responsible to the government for his own returns and that would be the best way to keep them up to the mark. It would be a great convenience if the back cheques could be sent before the end of the year.\nI hope you will write me in good time, the date of your proposed trip to Moose Factory, as I should like to be at home when you arrive. We hope you will stay overnight at least. If possible I should like to go down with you.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Should it not be $45.00?\n\nI sent you his returns for the Dept. quarter 1924.

Under these circumstances the Department felt that payment for only two months could be allowed and a cheque for $150.00, covering the salary, was sent to the Royal Trust Company and a cheque for the bonus for two months was sent to you.\n\nIn the case of other schools in outlying districts which are only conducted for part of the year, the Department pays the salary of the teacher on a per ordinance basis. I believe that this would be the most satisfactory plan to follow with the Mistassini School. I consider that a rate of $4.00 for each day the school is actually in operation would be a fair amount to allow and I would be pleased to have your views regarding this suggestion.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

However, I can agree with the proposal provided payment is allowed for holidays and sickness. Otherwise it would be a hardship that the teacher should lose its amount due for days of sickness and necessary holidays, as he must live whatever happens and provide for his needs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G.

Some were pretty bad, but still for all that I kept school for six days during the September Masters...\"\n\nHe also wrote he refers to was \"flu\" which was widespread throughout that whole district from Massawippi north to Nemiska and N.E. to Mistassini.

However, in view of your representations, we will favourably consider allowing the salary of a teacher for the summer months, only. The dates between which this school should be kept open might be June first to September 30th, provided the Indians would be close to Mistassini during that period.\n\nFor this summer school, we approve the appointment of George Iserhoff, and he will be allowed salary at the rate of $75.00 a month. At the end of the summer, the usual return forms should be completed and a report obtained, showing if the Indian parents sent their children to school regularly.\n\nIn the event of the school being a success this summer, the Department is inclined to favourably consider a year round school, if you believe that the attendance would warrant same. However, in this event, it would be necessary to secure a qualified teacher. In view of the number of qualified teachers at present unemployed, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Department to consider paying salary to a teacher who has no teaching qualifications.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nCochrane, Ont.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1937.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant and it is noted that George Laerhoff opened the Mistassini Indian Seasonal School on June 1st. He will be allowed salary at the rate mentioned in official letter of April 7th, 1937.\n\nYou did not mention in your letter to what address the register should be sent and, as this school has not been in operation for several years, the Department is not aware of the direct post office address. Under these circumstances, arrangements are being made to forward a register and some lead pencils to you. I trust you will be able to send them on to the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,-\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Rev. J.G.

Mr. Higginson is an R.C.A.F. veteran, now in his third year at Carleton College. He is 27 years of age and is very keen to undertake the work which we are endeavouring to promote with the Mistassini Indians. He has discussed the local situation with both Bishop Renison and myself and has also written to the Reverend Mr. Ellis, who will be the senior teacher.\n\nI understand that the Reverend Mr. Ellis may not stay the full term at Mistassini and that Mr. Higginson will probably finish the last two or three weeks out as the only teacher.

Renison, M.A., D.D., Lord Bishop of Moose Cree, visited the office and requested the payment of a small rental sum for the Anglican Churches and buildings which are being used as day schools in his Diocese. These include the following:\n\n- EASTMAIN (72-3-5)\n- OLD FACTORY RIVER (72-7-5)\n- MISTASSINI (48-8-5)\n- WAWANAPI (35-13-5)\n- LADYBOWNE HOUSE (144-3-5)\n- PORT HOPE (44-5-5)\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 30, 1946.\n\nRental for Mistassini Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nFurther to our interesting discussion of recent date, I have been checking the old files concerning the rentals paid in the past for various Anglican Churches used as part time Indian day schools. It is my intention to write you separate letters concerning each one.\n\nI find that up to 1931 the following amounts were paid to Bishop Anderson for the use of the Church of England Church at Mistassini:\n\n1. Allowance for scrubbing and sweeping during the months of June, July and August at $5 per month - $15.00\n\n2. Rental of building used for school purposes during the above period - 3 months at $5.00 per month - $15.00\n\nIf it is necessary to run this school again during the next summer, the Department is prepared to make the same payments as previously arranged by us, in a letter sent to Bishop Anderson on June 21, 1924. Therefore it will be in order for you to submit accounts to this amount, quoting as authority our letter 44-9-5 of June 21, 1924.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend R.J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nCOPY SENT TO MR. H. LARIVIERE\nThe upstairs could be made into an apartment and the downstairs would make a fairly good school.\n\n3. I am aware of the fact that there is a regulation that the Governments only build schools on a Reserve. This may be a good rule in certain settled places, but I am sure it could be modified in places where there is no reserve and the Indians have their only home for the summer.\n\n4. One matter, which I was going to discuss with you more fully was taken over by Mr Phelan when we met in your office; for the sake of record I would like to put it in writing: In 1945 when Mr Burgomaster was at Mistisini he brought twenty-five children with him on his return. They were flown out to Oskelaneo which is 200 miles by air and from there they were taken by train to Chapleau; the distance by train alone must be nearly 500 miles. I thought that Mr Burgomaster had arranged with the Indian Agents; apparently he had to act quickly. I know that the regulations do not provide for the flying of children but a canoe trip in this case would have cost very much more besides incidental expenses for food I paid a bill to the Hudson's Bay Company for $350.00. The children all did well. This summer Mr Burgomaster brought out six children to Chapleau at a cost of $100. May I say that this summer the cheque for the school in Mistisini two months teaching was $217.00. Mr Burgomaster was very much more than a Teacher at the school. He was the guide philosopher and friend of 600 Indians. I am sorry he will not be with us next year. It would be a great encouragement to me when we can have a stable organisation at Mistisini. In the last two years during the summers our Mission has spent $2000.00 at Mistisini alone. I would be grateful if you and Mr Phelan can have this matter adjusted.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\n1. I have six letters from you Nos. 72-7-1-72-2-5-44-1-5\n   44-5-5-35-3-5 and\n   35-12-5.\n\nThese deal with a situation of the schools which have been held\nin our Indian Mission. I wish to say that I am obliged to you\nfor the interest and trouble which you have taken in considering\nthe relationship of the Church of the Indian Department over a\nperiod of more than twenty years. I may say that my object in\ndiscussing the matter was not to have the matter judged on the\nbasis of the Indian Department's actions and interest in schools\nyears ago. We all admit that times have changed and the claims\nof the Indians have a new significance. Many of the nominal\ngrants which were authorised were never submitted. I would much\nrather have the past record looked upon not as a standard for\npresent requirements but as a precedent for a forward policy\nnecessary today.\n\n2. The most hopeful thing which I learned from our interview\nwas the promise to build a school and residence at Mistassini this\nis the largest place and I hope will be merely the beginning. If\nI can have a definite assurance that this can be undertaken next\nsummer before April 1st, we can undertake plans. I would prefer\nthat the Department erected the buildings but if necessary I would\nbe willing to try to have it done by private contract which could\nuse local labour. The next year we should do the same at Waswanipi.\nAs a matter of fact, we have two buildings there one is the Church\nwhich needs restoration and it has been used for a school for twenty\nfive years. There is a residence for the teacher or Missionary which\nneeds an expenditure of $500 to put it in repair. I would be willing\nto give this building to the Department for a school and summer resi-\ndence for the Teacher if they would undertake to have it restored.\nFebruary 28th, 1947\n\nMEMO FOR AGENCY (Advance supplies)\n\nShipment to Mistassini re: School to be stored at Mistassini\n(Nursing Station)\n\n1 Deep Well Pump 10\" pipe and cylinder standard - frost proof type\n1/2\" galv. pipe. about 90 lbs.\n\n3 Bales Oakum Dry - about 300 lbs.\n\nTo go in Mistassini ex: Senneterre\ntrip - returning sick Indians from hospital,\nto make up part load - space vacant.\n\nVoucher April 1st, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6095, file 321-5, part 1)\nAt Mistassini, they may be issued with a Nation No. 1 each, allowed one tent and stove with pipes and strict necessary clothing, a limited issue on other items, axe, file, snarewire, plates and kettles, forks and knives and tin cups, sufficient to get along the ration to be monthly, except for Hubert Voyageur, Hubert after he receives his ration should be assigned to cut logs the same size as for the nursing station.\n\nLogs to be 20 feet long 8 inches small end,\n\" 16 \" \" 5 \"\n\" 12 \" \" 4 \"\n\nOn logs you should try to get them to cut as follows, and near to the banks, etc., as usual, for removing and hauling after open water.\n\nAppro. 600 Logs 20 feet long, at small end 8 inches or over price in the bush $.50 cents each,\n\" 800 Logs 16 feet or 18 feet long at small and 5 \" or over price in the bush $.25 cents each.\n\" 400 Logs 12 feet or 14 feet long at small and 4 \" or over price in the bush $.20 cents each.\n\" 500 Poles for making fences - length about 16 to 20 feet top 2 inches Price in the bush $.10 cents each.\n\nThe removing from the bush, peeling towing and piling we will pay separately.\n\nIn spring all logs 800 16 feet or 18 feet, should be piled, in the narrows at point, where I said last year, it would be an ideal spot for a \"saw pit\", all these logs, will cut in halves like we did for the nursing station.\n\nAll the others to be piled at about where Willie Jimikin and the Trappers had their camp, last summer.\n\nYou may put on this job any of the Indians around the Post, including the women if they wish to cut poles and the smaller logs. It will be necessary to scale the logs and secure receipts from persons doing the work, like we did for the nursing station with time these logs will be used for a building \"Training Centre\" (School).\n\nHoping with this allowance, as they show up this spring they will get going, if possible I want all these logs to be completed before I leave Mistassini in June\n\nYours very tryly,\n\nH. Lariviere,\nIndian Agent.\nFor information Welfare; It is evident, this year is the right time to get logs, etc., for school. Indians are poor and traders keen to get some business out of it.\n\nBy Lariviere, Indian Agent.\n\nMarch 4th, 1947\n\nDear Mr. McLeod:\n\nI have yours of the 28th. of February 1947, I wrote you on February 27th, as regard logs for proposed school, gave quantities and sizes. It is noted the two best \"saw pit men\" are around, there is no objections that they go ahead and start sawing as soon as delivered to the Post.\n\nIf they want to, they can go ahead and make boards, with the best logs 16' (feet) 1.\" I presume in what they will make \"mark every two inches and saw off on the mark\", the 16' foot logs, they should sawed in halves, like we did for the nursing station, price as paid last year $.40 per cut is satisfactory.\n\nThe price delivered quoted, is about what I figured they would cost, better fix the price for cutting separately and if the same man complete and deliver it is O.K. \"pay after the work is done\".\n\nAs regard the fuel wood for the Nursing Station, I am aware the shed is full of good wood now, but I want to have enough to fill the shed in fall 1947, for 1948, I have no objections that they cut, B.L.C.H., off the ridge at $5.00 per cord delivered, piled, etc., as usual.\n\nIf you get the logs cut, on the south side of the lake, likely they will be larger in diameter this is O.K. If you can get some nice spruce logs over 40 feet, we could take about 10 of them, naturally we would have to pay more for them - 1 piece - it will be O.K. also.\n\nThe main point, is to keep them working instead of loafing and waiting, for relief or \"Family Allowances\" and that they get sick, considering the scarcity of country food, etc., will do the final adjustment in June.\n\nover .......\n\nIndian Affairs.

Education\n\nFurther to our conversation when in Ottawa last, since I have prepared slowly to cover completion of Obedjiwan, Manowan and Mistassini schools.\n\nMr. Magnus Edwardson, who has been doing work for us on nursing stations and schools, is prepared to go in with others and do all this work this summer.\n\nConsidering, it is absolutely impossible to make arrangements for crews of men, their transportation, also supplies, at the last minute; and to do these three jobs this summer it means rushing in immediately after break up and if possible before, that is last trips. I would appreciate authority to make arrangements to do this work on account season 1949-50.\n\nAs regard Waswanipi, it is only a matter of a man going in for about a month to complete details. Here, there is a plan underway to do some Indian houses, in any event some improvements. I estimate completion of the school will be possible probably through these other men, which means savings on transportation, etc.\n\nRequisitions for supplies are being prepared now and I hope to be able to submit by early February for spring delivery if you have funds available on present fiscal year, or for early summer delivery as a charge to 1949-50 appropriations. Our summer program is developing to a new high, that is very heavy, and if we experience too many delays we won't be able to carry it out. Our medical service alone calls for 6 to 7 nurses in the field. Here as you know everything has to be worked out in full details to put it over. This with other things we have only 3 or 4 months to do it. Needless to say we must be prepared in advance and everything must be timed well ahead.\n\n(Sgd) H.

I depend a great deal on the men employed by us in the past, mainly the Edwardson at Oskelaneo.\n\nIf it is your intention that we go ahead and finish Mistassini this summer, all must be prepared now and delivered at Oskelaneo for June 1st. or else, I regret we cannot handle it, at a figure near what we estimated when this matter was first discussed with Mr. Neary.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\nMarch 8th, 1949\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Mistassini Indian Summer Day School\n\nFurther to my conversation with your Mr. B.F. Neary, Supt. Education, I now submit the attached requisition to take care.\n\nAs regard transportation, some might be able to go through the new road part way, however all told it will still be a $.10 and to $.06 haul per lb. and will be for a number of years to come unless the unforeseen took place in a few years.\n\nMost of these supplies we can take care through Oskelaneo, by air, on a pay load out with sick Indians on Oskelaneo & La Tuque, and pay load return with supplies, which will give approximately the same rate on combined transportation, for agency as a whole.\n\nRequisitions:\n\n#1 - Material for residence. (Same as nursing station residence)\n#2 - \" school (Same as for Waswanipi - except all)\n#3 - \" \" (round log job.)\n#4 - \" school & residence\n#5 - \" Do\n#6 - \" school\n#7 - \" \"\n\nRequisitions #1, 2, 3, quoted on by Simard & Frere Cie Ltee, local manufacturer, all these windows etc., you will note special sizes etc., and as much work on them locally in view to accelerate job at Mistassini and take care on aircrafts so they will fit in doors, for loading, etc.\n\nRequisitions #4, 5, 6, I believe these could be secured locally for DELIVERY ON TIME and as required to move these goods.\n\nRequisition #7 through usual source of supply.\n\n.................\nMarch 19, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nRe: Mistassini Indian Day School.\n\nThe attached requisitions have just been received from Indian Superintendent Lariviere.\n\nIn connection with requisition No. 1 (3 pages) he recommends that the order be placed immediately with Simard and Frere Limited, Amos, Quebec.\n\nHe also recommends that he be given authority to purchase locally the items shown on requisition marked 2, 3 and 4. We would appreciate it if you would find it possible to accept his suggestion as we want to obtain the supplies at the earliest possible date so that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nSuperintendent Lariviere points out that unless the supplies can be secured immediately, it will be impossible to build the school during the coming summer. In addition, he has arranged for workmen and naturally if building operations are to go ahead they will have to be advised so that they do not take any other job.\n\nBernard F.

Gendron, R.S. for P. of C.\n\nFurther to conversation, your last visit at Amos, we have received no information, as to if it is desired that this job be completed this summer.\n\nHere it is extremely important that if we are going to go ahead with, that material etc., be all on hand at Oskelaneo River, Que., for June 1st, we could very likely handle most of, on part loads, return flights, on Agency general usual services, next arrangements for men to go in etc., must be done before May 15th, otherwise it is next best to impossible to handle this job, at a price \"normal figure\".\n\nIf this work is not going to be done this year, logs, piled, peeled in 1947, must be disposed of, or most of them will be spoiled. If job cannot be done early this summer, I would appreciate authority to use logs, for making \"Indian tent frames\".\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\n\nP.S. There is also some material stored at Nursing Station, the Nurse has been more or less deprived of her storage facilities, this must be cleaned up, The Medical need their storage.\n5th May, 1949.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nAmos, P.Q.\n\nYour letter of April 22nd addressed to Mr. Gendron has been referred to me.

We are starting out our summer Field Work - on about May 15th, which means after that date, what has not been provided for, is more or less hopeless, we cannot attend to it.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt.

This difference is due to the fact that copper screens have been substituted for those ordered, and also that freight charges were underestimated.\n\nIn view of the above will you please increase encumbrance No. 430 by $62.16.\n\nW.

Edwardson p axe man and general\n  (son of Angus about 23)\n\nat a rate of pay of $7.00 for foreman, $6.00 for others, transportation and food, from date of departure to date of return, shelter tents. These are the going rates of pay, for bushmen, employed by mining companies and others for this class of work.\n\nWould like to have these men go in, first or second trip after ice is clear at Mistassini. If other supplies are not delayed with the help of the Indians, this job should be finished by early August, subject to weather and usual, in any event when Nurse will be ready to come out in August, the job should be closed, if necessary completed in 1950, unless we are assured of transportation out, on a returning flight.\n\nI expect to be able to land at Mistassini anytime after the 15th., I would appreciate authorization by wire.\n\nH.

With the new schools, it doesn't adjust the key troubles, we will have the same difficulties, which are almost anything that can happen to a key or keys. A pet habit when keys do go astray, they brake a glass to get in and so, or use a steel bar or an axe to open doors. On our new MEX schools if they do this, it means smashing our doors.\n\nWe tried various methods to control keys on Nursing Stations, which is just as bad as on schools, we failed to get success, we had tags - wooden, made by Indians, with strings, the wooden tags \"rub off\" the \"strings cut off\", we had them on a wire loop, they take them off one by one, finally, we find keys with Indians, traders and so on.\n\nI estimated a regular \"Hotel Key Tag\" with the usual strong hook, would adjust, all these keys be given a number \"stamped\" (we have the stamping punches) registered at Agency, and whoever is entitled to have these keys, be held responsible, between the schools and the nursing stations, we have a very large number of keys. With a good control we should get results.\n\nThe regular MASONITE KEY TAG WITH HOOKS, I feel would adjust and would be cheaper, an Indian during a day does not whittle many \"sticks\" in a day, using sticks we do not overcome, pencil marking rubbing off and cutting of strings.\n\nH.

On my return I phoned the supplier and he explained he felt justified. As far we were concerned here, we were satisfied that this supplier had the same difficulties on screen wire, like others, going over the copies of P.O., we noticed the note by the Purchasing Agent, $1.75 extra for copper, so we took for granted, it was understood, if necessary applicable to all.\n\nOn school material, as you know orders were late, it followed it caused difficulties, through the good will of the supplier, we managed to get the material on time, to transport some of it, without making specials, men in the field on construction did not have to wait, except in one instance.\n\nI can assure you, P.O. are highly respected.\n\nH.

In other parts of the country where a combined log building and teacher's residence has been erected, the cost varied between $6,000.00 and $7,500.00. Consequently, it is difficult for us to understand why the expenditure at Mistassini has reached the total shown above. We would appreciate having an explanation.\n\nIt is understood that you have now submitted Vouchers for all the expenditures that will be incurred for the construction of this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nBernard F.

(60 miles north of Oscalanea). I understand it is your purpose to conduct a summer school during the months of June to September inclusive, and I will agree to the appointment of two teachers\u2014one for classroom activity and the other for field matron's duties in Indian homes. Salaries of $75 and $50 per month, supplemented by any bonus provided by law, will be allowed.\n\nThis Department will also arrange for certain school room supplies:\n\n- 20 Readers, Dom. Catholic, Part I (French edition)\n- 30 Slates (medium)\n- 3 Boxes Slate Pencils\n- 2 Boxes White Chalk\n- 1 Beaver plate Blackboard 12 ft. x 3\u00bd ft.\n- 3 Blackboard brushes\n- 1 Numeral frame\n- 2 Dozen Scribblers\n- 6 Dozen Lead Pencils\n- 2 Pkts. Ink powder\n- 1 Box Pens\n- 6 Sheets blotting paper\n- School Register and Quarterly Return forms.\n\nThis equipment, with the exception of the 30 slates, will be ordered through the Government Stationery Office and shipped to you at Oscalanea, in care of Mr. John Midgley. You are authorized to purchase the slates and submit the bill, in duplicate, properly certified by yourself, to the Department.\n\nI should be pleased to have an answering communication, informing us of your wish to proceed with the work and intimating the names and qualifications of the teachers that you engage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I could not engage teachers. This is the cause I did not answer yet to yours dated April 3, 1923.\n\nI am in correspondence this year, with two others, one for classroom and the other for field work duties in Indian homes. But they say: \"Are we sure to get the bonus of $15.00 per month?\" Please give an affirmative answer to that question.\n\nThen I will engage the teachers, buy so slates, and I will inform and intimate the names and qualifications of those teachers. At the same time I will also send the school-room supplies mentioned in yours No. 69-3-1.\n\nSincerely Yours in X\n\nRev. J. B. Bernard O.M.\nManiwaki, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the opening of a summer school at Obedjiwan for the months of June, July, August and September.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you are endeavouring to obtain the services of two teachers\u2014one for classroom activity and the other for the matron's duties in the Indian homes. If you can obtain suitable teachers for the above services, the Department will provide salary and bonus at the rate of $50 per month to the teacher and $65 per month to the matron. Kindly inform the Department, as soon as you are in a position to do so, of the names, qualifications and experience of the teachers engaged by you.\n\nWe are placing an order with the Government Stationery Office to ship addressed to you in care of Mr. John Mcle, c., Oskelino, G.N.R. (Transcontinental Ry.), the school supplies mentioned in our letter of April 3, 1923.\n\nWe note that you will purchase and have forwarded the 50 slates. You should obtain accounts, in duplicate, and you should certify thereon that the slates were received by you and that the prices charged are fair and just.

The Indian women who have returned from the bush had several dresses to cut and sew for themselves and their children.\n\nThe cleaning and ironing of the men's clothes took a good part of the time.

Having not yet received special forms for my report, I am doing so in the best way possible on this sheet.\n\nThe school is open since the first of June. It will close on the first of October.\n\nThe number of pupils inscribed on the register is forty-five (45), nineteen (19) girls and twenty-six (26) boys.\n\nAverage attendance of the girls seventeen (17), the average attendance of the boys at school sixteen (16). Number of school days during the month of June, twenty-one (21).\n\nThe attendance of the boys at school was upset during this month as they were occupied transporting the stores of the Hudson Bay Company on the Indian Reserve. The number of pupils registered is inferior to that of last year, as many of them go now to the school of Waymontachinque.\n\nThe class room is large and clean, well lighted and well furnished; but to favour the progress of our good little Indians a few articles are missing yet, such as daily copy books, writing books, series, one, two and three, ink stands, maps of Canada.\n\nI wish to ask for all these as they are quite necessary.\n\nYours, etc.,\n\nA. Bibeau.\nTeacher.\nOttawa, July 30th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of letters from yourself and Miss Brosseau regarding the services performed as teacher and assistant teacher, respectively, at the Obedjiwan Summer School during the month of June, last.\n\nWe note that the school was opened on the 1st of June and that it will be continued in operation until the end of September next. We are pleased to note that there has been a good average attendance of the pupils enrolled. Cheques in payment of salary due for the months of June and July are being sent you and Miss Brosseau.\n\nI am enclosing a supply of report forms on which you should prepare a report at the end of each month giving the names of the children on the roll, their ages, standards or grades, days' attendance, etc. Please prepare a return for June, last, and also for the current month, and forward them as soon as possible. You should also prepare another return when the school closes at the end of September, which you should forward to the Department, when payment of the balance of salary due will be made.\n\nThe assistant teacher should also furnish a brief statement at the end of each month showing the work she performed in teaching the children sewing, etc., and any work that she has done in the Indian homes.\n\nWe will place an order with the Government Stationery Office here to send to your address a supply of exercise books, scribblers, copy books, lead pencils, pens, ink powder, ink wells, penholders and a map of Canada.\n\nWe hope that you and the assistant teacher will meet with every success in the work during the period this school is in operation this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Alexandra Bibeau,\nTeacher,\nObedjiwan Summer School,\nOskelaneo, Que.\n\nA.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the engaging of teachers for the Indian summer schools at Weyrontecheing and Quediwan, I beg to inform you that, provided you are able to obtain teachers having suitable qualifications, the Department will allow the same salary as was paid last year. If you desire that these schools be conducted this coming summer, prompt attention should be given by you to the securing of the services of a teacher and an assistant teacher for each school. Please forward the names, qualifications and experience of the teachers whom you nominate for each school. You should endeavour to obtain teachers having professional qualifications for the position as senior teacher at each school, and it is hoped that you will be able to do so.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you in due course as to the teacher whom you have been able to secure for each of these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I note for the summer school at Weymontecheing, Miss Doris Durocher has been appointed as teacher and Miss Elizabeth Nadeau as matron. As you were informed in official letter of the 16th instant, the salary allowed will be at the same rate as was paid last summer viz., $90.00 per month each, during the period they keep the school in operation.\n\nRegarding the Obedjiwan Summer School it is noted that you have secured the services of Miss Alexandra Bibeau as teacher and Miss Claire Girard as matron. The salary allowed will be at the same rate as was paid last year viz., $90.00 per month to the teacher and $65.00 per month to the matron.\n\nPlease inform the above named teachers accordingly and arrange with them to begin duties as early in June as possible. Each school should be kept open during the months of June, July, August and September.\n\nIt is presumed that the same arrangements can be made by you for carrying on the classroom work at each of these schools as was done last summer. The Department is not prepared to incur any expenses other than the payment of the teachers' and matrons' salaries and the providing of the necessary school books, scribblers, pencils, etc. The teachers should prepare returns in the same manner as last summer, giving the names of all the Indian children in attendance, their ages, days' attendance, etc. These returns may be forwarded to the Department at the end of each month. It will be sufficient for the matrons to give a brief written report of the work they performed. We have noted the addresses of these teachers.\n\nA map of the world will be sent to each school. Should any other school material be required, the teacher should prepare a list and forward it to the Department.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you later as to the date upon which these teachers began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.

The Reverend Father Guenard had fixed the date on the 17th I had therefore only three school days left. Kindly remark that I was keeping the class every Saturday to leave the mission sooner. I was so much run down that I was unable to teach. I judged that it was better for me to return home. The appointment I received was to teach at Osekelaneo, and I was greatly disappointed when I had to go to Obidjuan. I did not lose courage in front of such sacrifice. I found that the work was great and I felt happy with my Indian scholars. The work was very hard, but I kept it up as much as I could and when I saw my health vanishing I abandoned it.\n\nI hope that you will be kind enough to send me my full salary at Ste.

These schools are known as MAHONI, WEMOROCHING, and OBEDJIAN. These schools were first opened two years ago, on the recommendation of the Missionary in that district, Rev.

As far as the Department is aware, Miss Cote's services during the past two years have been satisfactory and, as she is conversant with local conditions, it is felt that it would be in the interests of the work at Obedjiwan to reappoint her. However, before making any definite decision in that regard it was decided to write to you, as it is quite probable that you will again nominate her.\n\nI would appreciate receiving from you as soon as possible your nominations for the Manousan, Weymontaching and Obedjiwan Schools for the summer of 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Were this in good from him, but I cannot prefer for any other. My father is dead since 30 years ago and I am carrying my mother's life also mine, or else for\nI was getting $324.00 for 4 months, and the rest of the year doing nothing. You can see we have not done much of that to live two on. If Father Greenwood wants to help some other girl, he can take Miss Bordelon's place she is also teaching for Indians and she has her father which keeps the Post Office and also Secretary for the place where she lives and she is there for 5 years now and she is engaged for this year. You will see Mr. Berebeau our deputy he has on hand the letter on which Father Greenwood paid my work is very plain feeling etc. Now I don't want your money what I want it in any place and as I paid on the starting of the letter you are the man to give me every place back. You have only to say a word to the Dept of Indian Affairs and I will have every place. If I do ask you this it is because you owe me that I have done many places in the best election.\nNow let me do yours.\n\nI am writing on your reply regarding your talk with the department of Indian affairs, and that I am re-engaged.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMme Hermine C\u00f4t\u00e9\nLac \u00e0 la Tortue\nCe Champlain\nPersonal\n\nOttawa, February 27, 1934.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI enclose herewith communication directed to the Prime Minister by Miss Germaine Cote, Lac a la Tortue, Quebec.

Father Gu\u00e9rard whom you had occasion to know at the time of your visit at Ojibway, gave for reason to the Department of Indian Affairs that he wanted to teach English to the Indians, and that I did not know that language. What is more, because I can teach without difficulty English in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd form. But if that can be of any use I can get a certificate. At Ojibway there is only the preparatory course and the first grade to teach. Last year the missionary hired teachers from Manitoulin. You know our situation and I know that I need to earn a living as well as the young girls from Manitoulin.\n\nThese Indian schools being in your county, I hope you will succeed, and I pray you to accept in advance the expression of my sincere gratitude.\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have no local Indian agent who has supervision of the Indians at these points. Reverend Jos. Guinard, C.M.I., Maniwaki, a missionary for the district, who is interested in the education of the Indian children, has exercised supervision over these Indian summer schools. We look to him for the nomination of teachers, and his recommendations have always been approved by the Department.\n\nMiss Cote was employed at Obedjiwan during the summers of 1932 and 1933. Father Guinard reported, as his reason for not nominating her services for the past two summers, that she had too little authority or control in her classroom and also that she had very little knowledge of English. Father Guinard considered, as a number of tourists visit this mission, it would be in the interests of the Indian children to have some knowledge of English. He reported that he could not approve of Miss Cote's re-engagement as teacher for the reasons stated.\n\nThe Department is writing Father Guinard regarding Miss Cote's request for re-engagement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department looks to him for the nomination of teachers, and his recommendations have always been approved.\n\nMiss Cote was employed during the summers of 1932 and 1933. Father Guinard stated last year that he could not approve of Miss Cote's re-engagement as she had too little authority or control in the classroom and also that her knowledge of English was limited. We are writing Father Guinard, requesting that he give favourable consideration to the re-engagement of Miss Cote for the coming summer.\n\nI would suggest that Miss Cote forward her application to Rev.

Miss Cote has again written Mr. Crete, requesting re-appointment.

I hope you have received mine on which I give you the names of the teachers, assistant teachers and the information required.\n\nReasonably, I can not wish better teachers than those whose names are on my last letter to the Department, and for their full success, those school teachers are re-engaged since last fall, except Miss Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bonaventure.\n\nMiss Marianne Abe, wishing to be more useful to the Indians of Weymontachie, passed last winter few months in an hospital to learn how to treat the common diseases amongst Indians.\n\nMiss Fernande Cole, having written to Miss Juliette Lafreniere, assistant teacher, knows already that the teachers of last summer are re-engaged to teach again the Indians of Obijwan.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nRev.

You have, sir, the motive of this letter.\n\nMiss Alice Hubert is the best school teacher of my missions. She worked very hard, she had in her class about eighty (80) pupils. Miss Alice Hubert is well liked by the Indians.\n\nLast summer, when I saw her, she told me that she was teaching every Saturday; I advised her to continue and give the number of school days lost.\n\nYou know that she could not be in Obedjiwan in time, the lake was covered with ice.\n\nSir, probably you do not know that Miss Alice Hubert is a nurse too. She treated with success bad cases and even hospital cases. By this she saved money to the Department and too likely she will save some again if she return in Obedjiwan.\n\nNow I will be pleased if you allow me to re-engage Miss Alice Hubert.\n\nYour truly servant in X.\nJ.

In view of the strong recommendation contained in your letter the Department is prepared to consider re-appointing her for the seasonal school in operation at Obedjiwan during the coming summer. However, I doubt the advisability of attempting to operate the school six days in the week as it is extremely unlikely that the majority of children would attend school on Saturdays. I, therefore, feel that the school should only be conducted for five days each week and it should be distinctly understood that Miss Hubert and the other teachers will only be paid for the number of days during which the schools are actually in operation during the summer of 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It would be appreciated if you would nominate her for the position.\n\nOwing to the nomadic habits of the Indians in his Agency Mr. Lariviere recommends that the Manouan, Obedjiwan and Weymontaching Schools do not re-open until June 1, 1941. This should be kept in mind when selecting teachers for these schools as the Department approves of the Agent's recommendation.\n\nLast year there were several expenditures made for these three schools without any authority having been received from this Branch. As a result we have had a great deal of correspondence and trouble in paying some of these accounts. Please keep in mind and advise all teachers that in future unauthorized expenditures will not be paid by this Branch. The proper procedure, when any expenditure is considered necessary, is to apply to Mr. H. Lariviere, Indian Agent, Senneterre, Que.

Madeleine Julien, I consider this person 100% unfit for our work at a Summer Day School.\n\n1.- Being the 1st. Teacher, made it very difficult for her assistants. On my arrival in July, I found that Miss. Tremblay had been more or less nothing for a servant girl.\n\n2.- There was no work done, for the time put in, I was presented with a long serial of various troubles, needs for improving the Teachers House, etc., regularly.\n\n3.- Miss. Julien, being a person employed to go out lecturing, organize meetings, door to door cells, in view to combat certain social difficulties, etc., remedy all ills, lack the main quality to promote our interests among these Indians, this quality is common ordinary sense.\n\n4.- I spoke to the Chief, who is an ordinary Indian but intelligent, his reference as to her ability - \"too high class for us ordinary people\".\n\n5.- On the school garden, her direction to promote this part, I am of the opinion an ordinary Indian could have done better, on all matters of interest to us, excuses and finally she admits she knows very little along our needs, but will learn during coming winter for next year, etc., her views and actions, having not changed since July, at which time both were fully explained what was desired, I recommend as follows:\n\nThat Miss Madeleine be refused to teach any of the Indian Summer Day Schools, at least in this Agency.\n\nOn clothing, it is evident she had in mind to make a show, I was showed a large wooden box over filled, with practically nothing in it, only a few Indian made articles on top. The excuse was they no military clothing, I showed in the storage a very large quantity and good assortment waiting for willing hands to work.\n\nH. Leli\u00e8vre - Indian Agent.\nFrom [signature]\n\nTo Mr. [signature], Secretary\n\nSir,\n\nOn behalf of the girls teachers in Oldfjord: Miss M. Jubin & Miss Rose Tremblay, I write you these few words as a complaint.\n\nWe are on the 7th of Sept., soon they will go back to their homes and they have not returned yet even the 1st month of June. Their salaries.\n\nThese misses ordinary, are poor and they need some money to live and sometimes to help their parents. They have to borrow them, and this by our letters of somebody.\n\nYou may reply that the dept. had not received their reports in due time. Whose fault is this? I am asked here in order to force them to send them first their reports. And as I am asked in quite travelling during a summer season, or too, by negligence, the reports lay at his office.\n\nPlease why not to do as of old: The Teachers were sending their reports direct to you and then they were paid.\n\nI remain your all faithful,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, September 9, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department has now received the returns for the Obedijwan School for the months of June, July and August and cheques have been forwarded to the teachers.\n\nI have received a report from the Indian Agent in which he states that the services of Miss Madeleine Julien could not be considered satisfactory in view of the fact that she is not conversant with the Indians.

I do not understand these forms very well. I have corrected Section 5 on form T.D.1, hoping that was the only change needed. It is rather difficult for me to arrange these forms exactly, because my salary of $80 per month which I am earning here is not regular. I am earning this amount during the 32 summer months that I work for the Indian Affairs Branch. I am usually employed in a store at $35 per month. This amount must serve for the upkeep of the house, food, insurance. My father has been ill for 12 years and is unable to work. I have to keep him as well as my mother. With the cost of everything being what it is during wartime, there is not much left at the end of each month. I am earning $80 per month here but from this it is necessary to pay for our food and travelling expenses so that after this money has been spent there is very little left over. I would like to believe that you understand my situation quite well and that you will send me my cheque for June and July together with the cost of living bonus within the shortest possible delay -- at Senneterre, Abitibi, P.Q.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nAnnette Ganim,\nAsst.\n\nMission Obidjuwan,\nVia Oskelaneo.\nMonsieur\n\nJ'acuse r\u00e9ception de votre ch\u00e8que pour le mois de juin au montant de $91.85.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The last cheque sent to you, for the period September 1 to September 15, 1944, was cashed at the Banque Canadien National on November 13th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Agathe Gagne,\nSenneterre, Que.\nAMOS, Que.\n\n5 f\u00e9vrier, 1945.\n\nRev. Pere Ed. Meillour, O.M.I.,\nManiawaki, Que.\n\nCher Rev. Pere :\n\nJ'ai ici la votre du 30 janvier, pour Obedjiwan, je constate que vous \u00eates de mon avis \u00e0 propos de Malle. Agathe Gagn\u00e9, je suis de la votre \u00e0 propos de Malle. C'est, esp\u00e9rons qu'elle se trouvera une compagne.\n\nPour la question de pension, ceci est une cause de troubles, d'ailleurs les institutrices trouvent d\u00e9j\u00e0 le travail assez difficile et tous les ans, sur cette affaire nous avons des plaintes, \u00e0 Manouan tout particuli\u00e8rement durant deux ans, les institutrices n'ont pas donn\u00e9 le rendement possible \u00e0 cause des pensionnaires, cette ann\u00e9e nous d\u00e9sirons \u00e9tablir un service de garde-malade \u00e0 Obedjiwan Manouan et Weymontachie, en coop\u00e9ration avec les \u00e9coles et si possible la garde devra demeurer avec elles, durant son s\u00e9jour sur les R\u00e9serves, naturellement nous ferons une allocation g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse. En dehors de notre service je ne puis pas intervenir, d'ailleurs je suis contre le principe que les institutrices devraient les gens \u00e0 titre de maison de pension.\n\nJe comprends l'emb\u00eatement dans votre cas surtout cette ann\u00e9e \u00e0 Obedjiwan, je crois que si vous \u00e9tiez capable de trouver une personne convenable, Mr. Boone serait satisfait de faire des arrangements pour la pension des fr\u00e8res, un autre moyen serait que durant la construction qu'ils prennent une maison et s'organisent, V\u00e9ronique Dub\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre capable de leur faire la cuisine etc., V\u00e9ronique comme cuisini\u00e8re en dehors de l'\u00e9cole, je crois serait la meilleure solution.\n\nPour la question de l'eau \u00e0 Obedjiwan, si nous pouvons, c'est l'intention de faire faire des puits, naturellement nos hommes seront forc\u00e9ment oblig\u00e9s de faire comme les autres, leurs propres arrangements pour pension et ceci en dehors de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nSoyez assur\u00e9 de mon enti\u00e8re co-op\u00e9ration.\n\nLorsque c'est possible, je profite de l'occasion pour vous pr\u00e9senter mes meilleurs souhaits.\n\nBien \u00e0 vous,\n\nM. Larivi\u00e8re, Agent des Indiens.\nAMOS, Que.,\nFebruary 5, 1945.\n\nRev. Father Ed. Meilleur, O.M.I.,\nManiawki, Que.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nI have received your letter of the 30th of January. In regard to Obedjiwan, I note that you are of my opinion re Miss Agathe Gagne, and that I am of yours re Miss Ganim. Let us hope that she finds a companion.\n\nIn regard to the board, I may say that this is a cause of worry. The teachers find the work very difficult and we received complaints every year in this connection, and especially at Manouan for the past two years, where the teachers did not give satisfactory services because there were boarders there. We intend to establish this year a nursing service at Obedjiwan, Manouan and Weymontachie, which will work in cooperation with the schools and, if possible, the nurse could share the teachers' house while on the reserves. Naturally we will grant generous allowance. I cannot intervene in affairs not connected with our service, and I am opposed to the principle that the teachers should act as boarding-house keepers.\n\nI am aware of your embarrassing situation at Obedjiwan this year. I believe that if you could find a responsible person, Mr. Boone would be satisfied with the arrangements in regard to the Brothers' board. As an alternative they could rent a house and organize themselves during the construction. Veronique Dube should be able to act as cook, and the best solution would be that she attends to her work outside the school.\n\nIn regard to the water situation at Obedjiwan, we intend to dig a well there. Naturally our men will have to do like the others, that is room and board outside the school.\n\nPlease be assured of my full cooperation when at all possible, and I extend to you the Season's Greetings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(S.) H. Lariviere, Indian Agent.\n\u00c0 Monsieur Herv\u00e9 Larivi\u00e8re,\n\nmonsieur;\n\nLes F\u00eates sont pass\u00e9es, puisque nous voil\u00e0 \u00e0 la fin de janvier. Comme d'habitude, je suis all\u00e9 \u00e0 Weymontaching pour la No\u00ebl, puis \u00e0 Obedjiwan pour le 1er de l'An avec notre Paul Megweto, enfin \u00e0 la Loutre pour l'Epiphanie.\n\nJe n'ai pas oubli\u00e9 de prier et pour vous-m\u00eame et pour votre honorable famille. Bien entendu, si Amos \u00e9tait sur mon chemin, de tout c\u0153ur j'arr\u00eaterais vous voir, vos chers petits surtout. Comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e7a doit grandir.\n\nPour les institutrices de 1945, c'est toujours Obedjiwan depuis nombre d'ann\u00e9es qui ne cessent de subir des changements. Je crois bien faire \u00e0 ne pas proposer le nom de Melle Agathe Garn\u00e9. L'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, elle n'a pas donn\u00e9 satisfaction suffisante, puis son caract\u00e8re difficilement s'accorde avec celui de Melle Annette Ganim. Je crois que Melle Annette Ganim sera meilleure institutrice. J'ai re\u00e7u de Soeur Agn\u00e8s un certificat \u00e0 son sujet. Je vous l'envoie. Sous peu, je vais savoir de Melle Annette Ganim quelle demoiselle qui pourrait \u00eatre seconde avec les qualit\u00e9s requises \u00e0 cet effet et avec laquelle ensemble il y aurait \"bon m\u00e9nage\".\n\nPour les travaux dans nos missions, disons que Manawan et Weymontaching sont finis; il ne reste plus qu'Obedjiwan. La Chapelle est trop petite et il faut la rafra\u00eechir. C'est m\u00eame, il me semble, une question d'hygi\u00e8ne et donc de sant\u00e9. Pour la derni\u00e8re fois, j'ai obtenu d'avoir encore le Fr\u00e8re A. Sauv\u00e9, o.m.i. Comme alors, il faut h\u00e2ter les travaux, j'esp\u00e8re avoir un deuxi\u00e8me Fr\u00e8re oblat. Il reste \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir la question de pension. J'avais pens\u00e9 que la H.B.C. pourrait le faire, mais apr\u00e8s information aupr\u00e8s de M. Bone et de M. Watson, ils objectent qu'il n'y a pas moyen facilement pour eux de\ntrouver une cuisini\u00e8re \u00e0 Obedjiwan et qu'alors M. Bone se fait \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame sa cuisine, etc.\n\nAlors, j'ai pens\u00e9 que puisque c'est aussi l'avantage du D\u00e9partement que la Chapelle soit hygi\u00e9nique en l'agrandissant, qu'alors nos institutrices pourraient les nourrir comme par le pass\u00e9, quitte assur\u00e9ment compensation suffisante pour la d\u00e9pense, mais craignant un surcro\u00eet de travail pour les institutrices, je recours \u00e0 vous et je sais que si vous le voulez vous pouvez arranger cela en ce sens que vous pourriez gratifier nos institutrices, pour cet \u00e9t\u00e9, du 1er juin au 15 septembre, d'une aide c.\u00e0.d. d'une femme ou fille pour le travail de leur maison, cuisson des aliments et entretien, etc., et vu que la question de l'eau \u00e0 Obedjiwan est vraiment difficile, vu la distance, vous pourriez mettre un homme qui tous les jours fournirait l'eau n\u00e9cessaire. Ainsi, tout serait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et cela gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 votre coop\u00e9ration.\n\nVeuillez me croire votre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\nEd. Meilleur, o.m.i.\n\n\u00c9d. Meilleur, o.m.i.\n\nP.S.: Copie fid\u00e8le de la lettre de la R\u00e9v. Soeur.\n\nSenneterre, 26 janvier, 1945.\n\nJe certifie que Melle Annette Ganim a fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l'\u00e9cole de Senneterre dirig\u00e9e par les Soeurs des Sacr\u00e9-Coeur et a poursuivi ses \u00e9tudes jusqu'en 3i\u00e8me inclusivement. Sa conduite, son travail et ses succ\u00e8s ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 excellents.\n\nSr Agn\u00e8s de la Pr\u00e9sentation,\nReligieuse des Sacr\u00e9s-Coeurs,\nDirectrice.\nMeniweki, Que., January 30, 1945.\n\nHerve Leriviere, Esq.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe holidays are over as we have reached the end of January. I have visited Weymontaching at Christmas as usual, Obedjiwan on New Years Day with Paul Megwetc, and la loutre on little Christmas.\n\nI have prayed for you and for your family. If Amos was on my way, I would certainly visit you.\n\nIn regard to the teachers for 1945, those appointed to Obedjiwan have been changed very often. I think I am right in not proposing Miss Agathe Gagne's name. Her services were not satisfactory last year and Miss Annette Ganim and her could not agree. I believe that Miss Annette Ganim will be a better teacher. I have received from Sister Agnes a certificate about her. I will know soon from Miss Annette Ganim the name of a young woman who would have the necessary qualifications to assist her and with whom she could agree.\n\nIn regard to the work done in our missions, we are through at Manawan and Weymontaching; there remains but Obedjiwan. The chapel is too small there and it must be re-decorated. It is even a question of hygiene and health. Brother A. Sauve, C.M.I. has been appointed here for the last time. As the work must be rushed, I hope to obtain the services of another Oblate brother. We must foresee the question of their board. I have thought that the Hudson Bay Company could do it; after receipt of information from Messrs. Bone and Watson, they are of the opinion that it is quite difficult to secure the services of a cook at Obedjiwan, and Mr. Bone is his own cook. As it would be in the Department's interest that a larger chapel be more hygienic, our teachers could feed those gentlemen as in the past, provided, naturally, that they receive sufficient compensation. As more work would have to be done, I take the liberty of asking you to find out if our teachers could be given some help this Summer, between June 1st and September 15th. A girl or a woman could provide for the upkeep of the house, cook the meals, etc. As the water problem exists at Obedjiwan, in view of the distance, maybe a man could be appointed to supply it daily. Thus, everything would be settled, thanks to your cooperation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Ed. Meilleur, C.M.I.\n\n(P.T.O.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

The main complaint was they had to feed practically free of charge the visitors, on this they were told to settle the problem, was to accept none.\n\nAt Manouen particularly the teachers neglected to a certain extent our work, due to strain caused by boarders, if this summer continued abuses is noticed, it is my intention to submit a complete report and demand changes.\n\nH.

Please note one of your letters attached herewith. The form requested was duly filled and I forwarded it to you around the middle of December. I also enclose a statement of amounts received. You will note that deductions from my salary for taxes amounted to $58.08. My salary is not within the bracket which warrants such deductions and I am, therefore, entitled to reimbursement.\n\nIt is this amount which I am claiming. I trust that you will respect your obligations which appear on said form dated August 25th.\n\nHoping to receive a reply soon, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

By that time you had given up duties and it was not possible for us to make any refund.\n\nThe only way you can secure the amount deducted from your salary for income tax purposes is to prepare an Income Tax Return for the year 1944 and forward same to the Income Tax Collector in your district. The correct preparation of an Income Tax Return by yourself will show the amount of salary that you received for the period you taught at Obedjiwan School for the summer of 1944 and also the amount of income tax that you paid. Refund of the latter will be made by the Income Tax authorities. I return the letter and cheque stubs which you sent me, as you will require these when sending your income tax return to the local Tax Inspector.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Agathe Gagne,\nObedjiwan,\nvia Oskalaneo, Que.\nOttawa, April 12, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nIn official letter of April 12, 1945,\n(File 69-2-1) the Department approved the appointment of Miss Annette Ganin and Miss Helene Desjardins as teachers of the OBIDJIWAN Seasonal School for the summer of 1945.\nTo Mr. M.

In the course of the summer, Bishop Comtois is expected to visit the Reserve and we are generally the ones who look after the reception.\n\nBesides that, a few priests from the Diocese, great benefactors of the Mission, come ordinarily over the week-end, in order that we may have Mass on Sunday. If we have to refuse them hospitality because it is forbidden by the Department, please let us know as soon as possible, so that we notify these priest in what situation we are in.\n\nYours very truly\n\nURSULE BORDELEAU, teacher\nCasey, Que.

Lariviere, Indian Agent,\nAmos, Que.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of February 14, 1945, with reference to the teachers at the seasonal schools providing meals for casual visitors.\n\nRecently, I was forwarded a copy of the notice which you issued to the teachers. If your notice is interpreted literally it would mean that the teachers would be forbidden to serve meals to the Bishop or any clergyman when their occasional visits are made. It was never my intention to prohibit the serving of meals to people such as those just mentioned.\n\nI took the impression from your letter of February 2 that white people, travelling through the country on business of their own, were bothering the teachers by requesting them to serve them meals.\n\nI trust that you will adjust the matter in a manner satisfactory to all parties concerned. It is not a subject on which there should be any great divergence of views and certainly should be settled without bothering this office and without causing any undue hardship.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour Letter No. 69-3-1 June 23rd, 1945\n\nI acknowledge yours of the 23rd. ult., as regard the interpretation, the teachers are familiar with the need and it was never understood by my knowledge by them or intended to deprive any members of the clergy on official visit to Indians.\n\nBut the teachers do understand that young priests travelling in groups or two or three, as tourists are not official members of the clergy within the meaning of servicing Indians, this class should be considered as \"whites\", the teachers are familiar that restrictions does not cover, such as if they desire to invite them, etc., they cannot do so, them or others.\n\nI am most anxious that all concerned do not take advantage of the teachers and that they don't take advantage of others, reports that have reached me so far this summer do indicate that the teachers troubles are fairly well adjusted.\n\nI doubt that any other persons except Rev. Meilleur would feel offended by placing the teachers to protect themselves on abuses that some one might try to impose on them when visiting these Reserves.\n\nI will visit these Reserves in near future if there is anything to adjust it will be looked into. At Manouan one summer the Teachers experienced very little left off their wages, due to feeding all visitors,\n\nH.

The Register is being adjusted to show all children of school age, etc., the attendance on this basis in July will be about 18/20%.\n\nThe school building, is far too small to take care of children, considering this instead of allowing them relief for clearing land, I arranged with the Chief that the destitutes Indians cut and deliver, about 200 logs during summer months, the price was fixed $1.10 delivered, for logs spruce NOTHING UNDER 21\" top 8\", piled on skids, with these logs on hand, a good building could be put up for our purposes, any time later and at no extra cost. During winter I will take up the matter of arranging need there. The School Teachers' house, requires painting, exterior and interior, also certain repairs this will be attended to later, for 1946, Urgent immediate needs were provided for during visit.\n\nH. Lariviere,\nIndian Agent.\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI submit the following report: OBEDJIWAN INDIAN RESERVE\n\nThis Band I consider important that we improve on the following:\n\n1.

I believe there is a mistake, as, contrarily to the past years, I am a teacher instead of an assistant. My salary should therefore be $90.00 per month plus bonus, as agreed with Father Melleur, O.M.I. when I was hired.\n\nI am therefore submitting my claim hereby. If there is a mistake please tell me whether I must keep the cheque or return it.\n\nOn the cheque there is an indication: bonus, $18.42, and the total, $98.42. That is all. It therefore appears that there are $80.00 for salary instead of $90.00. There is no deduction for tax. I filled in a T.D.I form when I was hired and I believe that everything is in order because there should be no tax as I have dependents and I work only 3\u00bd months at this salary, while earning $40.00 to $42.00 per month, the remainder of the year.\n\nI trust you will give this your kind and prompt attention, and let me have the balance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Annette Ganim, teacher,\nObedjiwen,\nVia Oskelaneo.\nBUREAU FOR TRANSLATIONS\nAUG - 9 1945\nOFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ganim meeting her boy friend, who was apparently delayed coming in to Senneterre, from what I could gather from them in September, Miss. Ganim dragged Miss. Goulette along with her.\n\nThey further informed, that they heard we going in to Obedjiwan only about July 5th, however this news they said they got from the Indians, the Indians themselves knew we would be there on July 1st, for they were all there, others knew that Col. Jones and self would visit Obedjiwan for on July 1st, or about.\n\nMy personal opinion, is they were not interested meeting us, for the school at Obedjiwan is just about nil and they know it.\n\nH.

I received no news about this matter and I did not receive the cheque. Please note that this amount is owing to me for the work done from the 1st to the 15th of September which means that almost two months have elapsed since I left the Indian reserve. I suppose that there has been an oversight and that I shall soon receive this salary cheque. I have been out of work since the closing of the schools and this money would be very useful to me as I am the support of my father and mother and with the cost of living as high as it is today, it is hard to get along without any money.\n\nI trust that my request will be taken into consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLorette Ganin,\nSenneterre,\nAbitibi, P.Q.\n\nTranslation\nAP/\nNov. 14/47.\nMay 5, 1948.\n\nDear Father Meilleur:\n\nThe Department approves the appointment of the following teachers for the Obedjiwan Indian Summer School:\n\nMiss Antoinine Bordeleau\nMiss Clemence Lafontaine.\n\nPlease find attached income tax forms and staff questionnaire forms to be completed by these teachers as soon as they report for duty.

It appears you ran short of logs suitable for the job, when I was at Obedjiwan Chief McQuish was to attend securing. I have not yet received the bills from the H.B.C. at Obedjiwan, in any event this will adjust during coming winter.\n\nI note you used old Nemess' house to store the lumber and other material, if the roofing paper has not yet been delivered to Obedjiwan, I would appreciate that you see Mr. Kidgigs and ask to store until next spring, 40 rolls 15\u00a2 green roofing.\n\nAs regard completing these buildings, we will endeavour to do so as early as possible in spring 1949, very likely we will do Manawan also immediately after, in any event during my next visit at Oskelanso, I will see you.\n\nAs regard payment of your salary also for Angus, for work done at Manawan - Nursing I presume, you have by now received payment in full, if not please advise. As regard payment for the Obedjiwan job, on account new regulations, effective October 4th, on Unemployment Insurance, it may cause a little delay, the invoices are going forward today and I am sure in Ottawa they'll do all they can to push settlement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Neary, Supt. of Education\nRe: Manawan & Obedjiwan Indian Summer Day School\n\nAs regard lumber required, I communicated with various persons, considered who might be in a position to supply at a fair price, Mr. Joseph Lamarche of Senneterre, informed his mill will not resume operations much before late October (was burnt early this last spring) prices he said will be running at $60.00 per M. for dressed, average lumber, sizes etc.,\n\nFinally I visited Mr. Leonides Boisvert, Saw Mill Operator and large Commission Dealer, at La Sarre, Que., he has a fair lot of dry lumber on hand which he could prepare within 24 hours and ship. Attached hereto requisition covering estimated need, subject to approval and if acceptable to the Purchasing Agent, may I suggest that he wire us confirmation order to follow, It is late now and I am most anxious to move this lumber this fall.\n\nH.

Education\n\nRE: Your letter Jan 6, 1949,\nYour file #113-74 (El) - 322-5\n\nIn reply, the expenditure of $24.00 was incurred in connection with carload of lumber from LaSarre for Obedjiwan and Menawan Schools. Unfortunately the shipper did not follow our instructions on billing. Apparently through a refusal from the part of the station Agent, the question of interpreting tariff. As soon as we became aware of this we communicated with Mr. McLeod, manager of H.P.C., at Oskeleneo; considering, we felt it was fair to distribute the charges on a fifty-fifty basis for both schools.\n\nInvoice amounting to $126.45 actually represents a charge for services rendered to us. Had Mr. McLeod declined to take care of our sick Indians and look after the unloading and rebilling of lumber, on the lumber alone it will have meant an extra expenditure of some $30.00 at least. He was asked to submit a separate Invoice, but unfortunately he overlooked and made a slight error when writing receipts, which we corrected on our original voucher, hoping it would be satisfactory to all.\n\nIn such cases it is my understanding we should not alter original invoices from suppliers, so it was presented as received. More, I am aware that the Company's Head Office object a great deal that their employees spend their time assisting us like in this case. However most of the Post employees are open to cooperation providing that if they make an error on billing or equal that if at all possible it be adjusted within our own services.\n\nWith Hudson's Bay Company it is understood any alterations, deductions, etc. they must be notified.\n\nIn this Agency, it is not altogether possible to operate without the good will and cooperation of our suppliers at various points. If for the least error they make, more so like in this case, we are not prepared to overlook certain\ndetails we will lose their cooperation. At this office, owing to shortage of staff, long working hours, we are not altogether equipped to do extracts from Invoices from various sources. We are continuously asking to furnish us with separate bills for Welfare, Medical, Education, Nursing Stations, etc. As a whole I consider our suppliers are doing their best for they themselves often have not the staff to take care. And if we insist too much we will be the ones to suffer, and our cost will be much higher in many instances.\n\nI can assure you we are doing the almost impossible to secure charges as desired by various divisions, but unfortunately we don't always get results, owing to communications most of the time it is felt better to clear as received. For example a minor error from Manowen say in fall, cannot be corrected before March or April.\n\n(sgd) H. Lariviere\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Ind.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJanuary 26th, 1949.\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAtt'n Mr. B.F. Neary, Supt. Education;\n\nFurther to our conversation when in Ottawa last, since I have prepared slowly to cover completion of Obedjiwan, Manawan and Mistassini schools.\n\nMr. Magnus Edwardson, who has been doing work for us on nursing stations and schools, is prepared to go in with others and do all this work this summer.\n\nConsidering, it is absolutely impossible to make arrangements for crews of men, their transportation, also supplies, at the last minute; and to do these three jobs this summer it means rushing in immediately after break up and if possible before, that is last trips. I would appreciate authority now to make arrangements to do this work on account season 1949-50.\n\nAs regard Waswanipi, it is only a matter of a man going in for about a month to complete details. Here, there is a plan underway to do some Indian houses, in any event some improvements. I estimate completion of the school will be possible probably through these other men, which means savings on transportation, etc.\n\nRequisitions for supplies are being prepared now and I hope to be able to submit by early February for spring delivery if you have funds available on present fiscal year, or for early summer delivery as a charge to 1949-50 appropriations. Our summer program is developing to a new high, that is very heavy, and if we experience too many delays we won't be able to carry it out. Our medical service alone calls for 6 to 7 nurses in the field. Here as you know everything has to be worked out in full details to put it over. This with other things we have only 3 or 4 months to do it. Needless to say we must be prepared in advance and everything must be timed well ahead.\n\nH. Lariviere, Sup't Ind. Agency\n3rd February, 1949.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nAmos, P.Q.\n\nWe have your letter of the 26th ultimo,\nwith reference to completing the Obedjiwan, Menawan\nand Mistassini Schools.\n\nPlease let me know the post office address\nof Mr. Magnus Edwardson, and also at what rate he\ncan be employed.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Education\nYour No. 322-5 (E1) Feb 3rd, 1949\n\nIn reply, Mr. Magnus Edwardson, may accept going in at the rate of $7.00 per day, providing he is paid regularly monthly, and expenses as usual in such cases, from date of departure to date of return; his address is Oskelaneo River, Que.\n\nWhen at Oskelaneo in late January, I saw Mr. Edwardson, we covered the work in view for coming summer, taking into account transportation etc., it was felt doing Mistassini, Obedjiwan and Manowan, it could be best arranged with two crews and complete Waswanipi, nothing very definite was decided upon, for I hope to see Mr. J.E. Gendron, R.S. for P. of Q., early in March at Amos, after, depending on what \"Welfare\" can do on \"Indian Houses\" better arrangements might be possible.\n\nI estimate that on schools alone: 1 crew should do Obedjiwan and Manowan, 1 crew Mistassini, complete Manowan as early as possible and I wish that Mistassini be well advanced by late June that is that most of it be done during my stay at this point.\n\nCurrent prevailing rate of pay for bushmen, capable of doing this work is $7.00 for man I/C and $6.00 for others, all expenses from time they leave until they return, that is travelling and food,\n\nH.

Cost here is always at lowest when arrangements can be made well ahead of time, combined with Agency general affairs, on all matters.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt.

I might say that about 2 years ago I discussed with Mr. B.F. Neary, Supt. of Education (in Booth Building) the question of log buildings and what he would care to have, your plan represent, his views at the time, but we had to make certain changes, owing to various conditions, Indian labor, size of logs, transportation (canoes and aircrafts).\n\nThe construction of log buildings for nursing stations, and schools, not only was originally intended to cover a building need, but to educate the Indians, to improve, on their own shelters.\n\nOn a log job, one point which is extremely weak, as a matter of fact not acceptable, is the two small windows, near front wall, at Waswanipi we placed in front, however I have noted that you took care, by allowing leeway if necessary.\n\nFor remote areas, the question of standard glasses is one very important, if we have variation on sizes, within a few years the damages are great and it usually end up with no widows, in any event, on requests for glasses, I never saw it fail, they ask \"send me a glass for the side window or front door, you know the size.\"\n\nThe most important part, is that we have not yet received authority to go ahead, we are already late, I am scheduled to be at Manawan on the 19th. of May latest, at Mistassini on about June 6th, and we have many details to take care of, briefly after May 15th., we will swamp.\n\nH.

Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nCHARGE TO: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. B.F. Neary, Supt. of Education,\nYour No. 322-5 (E) May 6th, 1949\n\nYours together with copy of Memorandum dated May 3/49, came to hand.\n\nOn school buildings, I took the same stand as I did on Nursing Stations, educating the Indians, create new ambitions, train them to work when possible and so on, through this type of buildings, make them realize that they can do something for themselves by themselves. Our Indians at Mistassini, Obegowan are very primitive, at Manawan improved.\n\nYears ago when with a trading Company, to get business, furs and the usual, the firm decided to get houses made for the best trappers, some were made in Quebec City, pre-fabricated, others on the ground by number crews of carpenters from the cities, we furnished some of them, more for the top trappers, we allowed a house organ, portable, imported from France, the whole thing was more or less failure, the weak point, was it was too good, with that experience and better knowledge of the Indians, I feel \"log jobs\" where it applies, is the solution.\n\nWhen the Nursing Stations buildings were first brought up, it was in Cochrane, Mr. Doucet was present, I hope this summer it will be possible to show Mr. Doucet the results obtained through it.\n\nI always maintained primitive Indians, have to be trained for almost anything, over doing it on one point, might delay their progress for years, as you know they have plenty of time, more so when it is not within their ideas of things.\n\nH.

I found that a certain which had been made in the first place, was to be cancelled with manufacturer, resulting now that they are shipping 6 windows BS lights 12 x 18\", which means these windows will replace the windows provided for openings.\n\nIn order to take care, it will be necessary to adjust, by pulling down casings and likely logs, in between windows as you have it now.\n\nThese new large windows, are to go in, from center post, 3 on each side, between each window, considering the load, (roof etc.,) suggest a post between each. As regard window on side near front, at about false wall - partition, if preferred, this one may stay as it is, and will ship a window for it later.\n\nAs the new windows are considerably larger, I feel it should not be too much work, to put them in instead.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Lariviere \u2014 Supt. Indian Agency.\n\nP.S. Your windows, doors, etc., should leave Amos, in a few days, on Oskelano. Henry St-Pierre can freight them in, by middle of next week. If short of paint, etc., let us know at once. There has been a mix-up and delay on shipments.\nOttawa, September 1, 1949.\n\nExtract from Superintendent Lariviere's letter dated August 26th regarding the Obedjiwan Indian Day School.

(RG 10, Volume 6096, file 323-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nReferring again to your letter, No 152220, and dated 24th July, I beg to advise you that according to promise we investigated the case of the teacher of the Oka country school against whom your agent preferred charges of inattention and incompetency. The result has not been favorable to your Agent or his report. The Missionary who is acquainted with all the facts in the case denies that she lost eight days in June. He reports that she did not lose a day in that month except the two last days which were spent in examining the children and the distributing of prizes. The complaints seem to be purely personal. The Agent is said to have taken offence because the teacher refused to be coerced to do what was a part of the Agent's duty to do. Our Missionary declares the Agent himself is the incompetent one. He can neither read, write, nor understand the English tongue. More than once our Missionary has had to read and interpret his official letters, and frequently has made out his monthly report for him. Miss Wilson, the teacher in question, has left with no intention of returning. I thought it best to report the facts to you as they were reported to us so that you might know what value to attach in the future to any similar reports coming from the\nsame source. We are now taking steps to obtain a suitable teacher for the school in question.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssociate Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMonsieur,\n\nJe vous inclue le rapport de l'\u00e9cole d'Oka Contre pour le quartier finissant le 31 Dec 1906.\n\nremarque : Monsieur je suis alla le 21 courant \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d'Oka Contre pour les rapports d'\u00e9cole sachant que les \u00e9coles fermaient le jour de l'instution etais absente je lui avais donner les blanc de rapport dimanche le 16 courant pour les deux jours lor de mon passage a cette \u00e9cole le 21 et comme je vous dit plus haut quel n'y \u00e9tait pas et le 22 elle m'envoie par son charlier de la station qu'il la conduir une lettre avec seulement que le rapport du quartier que je vous envoie je dois vous dire que cette derni\u00e8re est partie pour ne plus revenir.\n\nMerci peut \u00eatre que ma mis\u00e8re\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur\n\nJoseph Perillard\nIndian Agent\nOka Contre\nOka, Dec. 23, 1906.\n\nSecretary, Dept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI inclose you the report from the Oka country school for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1906.\n\nOn the 21st inst., I went to this school to get the report, knowing that the schools were closing on that day. The teacher was absent. I had given her the blank form of report on Sunday the 16th inst., to hold it until my visit on the 21st inst.; and as I said above, she was not there. On the 22nd she sends me by the cabman who took her to the station a letter containing only the report for the quarter, which I send you. I beg to say that she has gone not to return.

Last evening we had our Christmas tree at Oka, the entertainment was given by the pupils of both schools on the Reserve, this being an annual affair & was in a position to judge, it was the eighth in succession which I have attended and presided at. I must say that both children and the teachers who trained them deserve a great deal of credit, the program excellent, well rendered in every particular. The order was perfect and the pupils have improved very much.\nhave no knowledge, whatever, of Mr. Perillard having to go to the school to restore order. I shall make enquiry regarding that statement. Before Miss Carr began school in September I told her if any of the pupils should give undue annoyance for her to refer the case to Chief Peter Oke who is a man of good sound judgment and has on other occasions rendered our teachers valuable assistance. I also told Chief Oke that I had suggested to Miss Carr to solicit his assistance if necessary and I believe he would have been called on, as he lives not far from the school, if Miss Carr needed such assistance.\n\nI believe we are fortunate in securing the services of both Miss Carr and Miss Moore at the very small salary which is being paid.\n\nShould I be able to give you any further information I shall be pleased.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a communication from Rev. J. D. Ellis, who is Chairman of the District of our Church in which Okma Village and Country Schools are situated.\n\nUp to the present time we have been unable to secure a regular teacher for the Okma country school, and Rev. Thomas Whitehouse, our missionary at Okma has been conducting that school. He is a well qualified teacher, but I do not know that he will be able to continue the double responsibility.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Ellis, the Chairman of the District, suggests the advisability of closing the Okma country school and that a party be engaged to drive all the population from that vicinity to Okma village school. He thinks that this would cost $100 a year and that the work would be strengthened by the payment of an additional $100 towards the salary of the teacher at Okma village school.\n\nMy colleague, Rev. A. C. Farrell, will visit Okma within a few weeks and will have some report to make on the situation there. In the meantime I should be glad to have an expression of opinion from the Department as to the wisdom or otherwise of the suggestion re Okma country school.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary\n\nJ.

A. C. Farrell, whom you state will visit Oka shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. T. F. Egerton Shore,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Oka Country School.\n\nIt was my privilege, in company with Rev. J. D. Ellis, Chairman of the Montreal South District of our Church, to visit Oka Indian Mission a short time ago.\n\nI would not advise the closing of the Country School and the attempt being made to bring the children from the Country to the Village School, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The school building in the Village would not be large enough to accommodate all the children from the village and country who ought to attend.\n\n2. The road leading from the country into the village has been recently opened through the woods and, we would judge, would be in a very bad condition for travel for a considerable length of time.\n\n3. It is doubtful if satisfactory arrangements could be made for the carrying of the children from the country to the village school.\n\nWe are therefore endeavoring to secure a teacher for this school through Rev. Mr. Ellis, which applications will be placed before you for your consideration when such are secured.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAl. Darrell\n\nMr. J. D.

After your interview with the late Deputy Superintendent General, an officer of the Department was sent to inspect the two schools at Oka.\n\nHis report on the Village school showed very satisfactory work, but I am sorry that the report on the Country school was not very favourable. Miss Lunan is young and inexperienced, but nevertheless, the Department is prepared to increase the grant by $50.00 from the beginning of the September quarter last, and a cheque for $12.50 for that quarter will be sent you.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nC.F. Bertrand, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nREPORT OF A.F. MacKENZIE ON THE OKA COUNTRY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is a neat frame building on a stone foundation, the interior finished in wood and neatly painted both on the exterior and interior. The classroom is 20 feet by 15 feet and provides suitable accommodation for the number of children who attend. The furnishings are good and with some few exceptions sufficient for the needs of the school. An additional blackboard is needed, two chairs, a water tank, basins and towels, which I would recommend the agent be authorized to furnish. The closets are badly dilapidated and ought to be renewed at once, as they are beyond repair. I asked, Mr. Bertrand, the agent, to obtain an estimate of the cost of a suitable double closet, which he promised to do and submit to the Department for consideration.\n\nSCHOOL SITE.\n\nThe site on which this school is situated erected was given the church authorities by two Indians, being the half of two lots and is only 40 feet by 75 feet. This is regrettable as there is no playground for the children. There is a driving shed at the rear of the school, but the entrance to it is only a few feet wide. Mr. Simons who owns the lot to the west of the school ground would be willing to grant a strip of land about 16 feet wide, which would give a little better playground and a better approach to the shed where the Indians tie their horses when they are attending church services, which are held in the school. As the purchase of this small strip of land from Mr. Simons would entail but a small expenditure (he is to submit an offer at a later date), I think it would be well for the Department to make the purchase and add this piece of ground to the lot.\nTo Supt of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs to Indian schools at Oka and Caughnawaga.\n\nI am acting for our church in this district. Would you kindly advise me as to plans for the school at Oka. I am shown a letter to Mr. Bertram, the agent telling him to arrange to convey the children next year from village to country school. I presume in that case it will require a larger school. Do you think the Dept will be willing to grant $500. for salary in that larger school. As salaries go now I do not think a competent teacher can be got for less.\nSni Caughnawaga. I have an application from a lady named Mary Mathews for next year. She is 37 years of age. Her father was a missionary to the natives in Australia. She taught there three years among the natives. Afterward for two years in an industrial school under the government. She has good credentials for the same. But she has no diploma for the province of Quebec. I should judge her to be capable and efficient. Kindly advise me if you would approve of her engagement.

Mr. Whitebeans of Oka called on me today and brought up several matters in connection with the schools there. One is in regard to the driving of pupils to school. He says that there are only two children living in the village who should attend the Country school and he recommends that these two children be placed in the French Methodist Institution at Montreal. We can get them in there for $60.00 a year each. If these children are so placed it would reduce the cost of driving the other pupils to school by $10.00 a month. Of course the children will not have to be driven until the bad weather sets in in the fall and only until the fine weather in the spring.\n\nMr. Whitebeans then brought up the question of getting a little more ground around the Country Schoolhouse. He says that the owner has put up a prohibitive price, but he thinks that he could be induced to take a fair amount for the sixteen feet that we would require. If he will take $25.00 I would recommend that we pay it.\nWhen we secure this land for the Country School we want either a new shed or the present one extended.\n\nThere is a claim for rent for the school premises in the village. I believe this has been recognized, but there are five or six heirs entitled to share in it and one of them is away in the States and his signature cannot be obtained.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Can.\n\nSir,\n\nRe. driving Oka children to school.\n\nDuring the summer holidays by order of the Indian department the Indian agent and myself engaged James Gabriel to do the work, and I believe the department later confirmed the appointment. Now, finding out afterwards that James Gabriel was willing to do the work only till Xmas, we immediately set out to get another man, and this time we got a man who was willing to do the work as long as the Department wanted him, the same salary as the other man, and also a good deal more capable, intending later to notify the department and have the transference confirmed.\n\nNow, after this Bernard Gabriel preparing himself at some expense, an objection is made by a party whose sole business seems to be to kick at anything the Department undertakes to do, saying that they would not trust him to drive their children. This Bernard Gabriel who is a young man about 27 years of age had got a girl into trouble about a year ago but has since married her and is living with her and getting along well together.\n\nNow as far as I can see there is no ground for this objection, and is only made by one man whose children belongs to the country school, have always attended there, and I understand that the Department is getting this conveyance for the Oka village school children and not for the others. The teacher intends to reside in the village as soon as the driving starts and expects to go up and down with the children which I think is a good thing as she can have her eye on them all the time.\n\nArthur Tienshaw and Florence Bishop the two pupils in the village for whom the Department granted $60 dollars each to go to the French Methodist Institute are not going now. They lost their places there on account of the Dept.'s delay in notifying us of the grant. So now I suppose the driving will start from the village for which Bernard Gabriel asks $10 per month more.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nThos Whitebear\n\nP.S. Bernard Gabriel, the man lately engaged.\nOttawa, October 9, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter dated July the 29th, last, with regard to the appointment of a teacher for the Oka Country School, in which you were requested to submit the names of any applicants for the position to the Department for approval.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of the September quarter return from this school and the name of the teacher who signs it is L. N. Dickinson. The Department would like you to forward at your earliest convenience full information regarding the qualifications of this teacher.\n\nA cheque for the amount of salary due for the period the school was open during the September quarter at the rate of $500.00 per year is being sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Church, Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. D. Ellis,\n301 Fortune St.,\nMontreal, Que.\nMontreal, 11th Oct. 1914\n\nMr. J.D. McLean, Asst. Deputy Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your favour No. 152280/1 dated 9th inst re qualifications of Laura N. Dickinson as teacher for OKa country school I beg to refer you to your letter of Aug. 13th No. 152216-1 approving of Miss Dickinson for that appointment. Sincerely yours,\n\nJohn D. Ellis.\nOttawa, October 19, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the arrangements made for the driving of the children to and from the Oka Country School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Bertrand has also sent a communication on this subject and the Department agreed with you and the Agent that there should be no objection to Bernard Gabriel's doing this work on the terms agreed upon. When the terms were fixed for this service it was expected that Arthur Tieushaw and Florence Bishop would go to the French Methodist Institute, but, as you say there were no vacancies for them, they will now have to attend the Country School. As the extra distance that the driver would have to go to the village would not be very great the Department considers that $5.00 a month extra would be quite sufficient remuneration for this service, which would bring the amount up to $30.00 a month. If Gabriel is willing to accept this amount the Agent will be instructed to engage him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nRev. Thos. Whitebeans,\nOKA, Que.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nSec of Indian Department\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen organising the work for the Oka Country School, I took it upon myself to make some slight alteration. The children are in seven different stages of progress, so I have organised them into as many standards. For seven weeks I have done my best to follow in the old way to which they had become accustomed, of keeping these seven classes working at one the same time, but in different sets of work. Under these circumstances I could only get in about ten minutes\u2014sometimes more, sometimes less\u2014of a lesson with each class, but no time have I been able to give a thorough lesson to any one section. Oral lessons even could not be given collectively, because it is impossible to successfully adapt Junior & Senior methods to one another. I have tried several schemes of work & organisation but they will not work with success while Juniors & Seniors continue to be mixed the whole time.\n\nAfter thinking it well over, I decided to keep the Juniors for 3 hrs only in the morning (from 9 am to 12 pm), giving my whole time to them; while the Seniors were set to private study or written work. The Juniors I dismissed at 12 o'clock for the remainder of the day; from one o'clock to quarter to four I gave my full time to the Senior portion of the School. I find it works much better as by so doing I am able to get in some thorough work with each section; but some of the parents are objecting, whose objections seem to be based simply on the ground of my method being an innovation. I have had fifteen years experience as a teacher, having interested in my work, I assure you that I have only the interest of the children at heart. I would therefore like to ask you to give\nme your written permission to try this method, at any rate for one month, to see how it works. If it is not successful, then we can easily go back to the old method.\n\nWaiting your favorable reply,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\nLaura B. Dickinson.\nCountry School,\nQuebec.\n\nOct. 26th 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nMay I ask if it would be possible to enforce the act for the compulsory attendance of the children at above school? At present the majority of them attend very irregularly. Under such circumstances it is almost impossible to bring them up to any standard of efficiency. Not only does slackness in this respect prove to be bad for the children both intellectually and morally, but it makes the work very disheartening. Myself as teacher; as all the work put in appears to be only so much waste energy.\n\nCertainly some of the children have a very long distance to come. Often the roads are exceedingly bad, but now that the Govt has provided a conveyance to take them to and from the school, would it not be a good opportunity to enforce the Compulsory Attendance Act?\n\nTrusting you will see your way clear to approve of the suggestion,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nLaura E. Dickenson\n\nP.S. Last month I sent up a Requisition Form for certain articles, but up to the present nothing has arrived. I would be glad if they could be forwarded as soon as possible, as it is very difficult to work without suitable apparatus.\nOttawa, November 2, 1914\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo I beg to say that the Department will allow you to give the scheme you suggest for the teaching of the children of the Oka Country School a fair trial say till the first of January to see how it works. If it is not found satisfactory it can then be discontinued. You may inform the Indians and the Agent that you have the Department's sanction for this innovation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nMiss Laura E. Dickinson,\nTeacher,\nOka Country School,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, November 2, 1914.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant in reference to the attendance of children at the Oka Country School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Agent and the Rev. Mr. Whitebeams will be written to in regard to the appointment of a truant officer for this school.\n\nWith regard to your remarks that some school material ordered by you has not yet been received I beg to say that, as this has to be ordered through the Government Stationery Office, considerable time elapses before the requisitions can be filled. In future it would be well for you to allow for this delay and send your requisitions in advance of your requirements. The Stationery Office will be requested to see that the supplies asked for are forwarded with as little delay as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nMiss Laura E. Dickinson,\nTeacher,\nOka Country School,\nOka, Que.\nSir,\n\nThe teachers have now commenced the little boys and girls in school all day because they cannot speak in English. We send our children to school to have them learn but how can they learn if they are about on the road all the afternoon, before not send them home so they do not go home, they stay around and play and some bad boys they fight and rob each other. When we send our children out in the morning they are under the teacher's protection until 4 o'clock in the afternoon. But now this teacher does not look after them only half day. We want a teacher who can look after and teach the children all day. Besides she beats the children little once because they cannot speak in English and she will not let the old ones tell them what she says. Sometimes she puts them outside and will not let them come in, we send to learn but if they cannot stay in school there is no use to send them to school some of them go three miles for nothing. Did you give another to have her do what she is doing.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Joseph Lee,\nLake of two Mountains,\nPoveshu,\nCanada.\nOttawa, November 5, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMiss Laura E. Dickinson, teacher of the Oka Country School, wrote the Department on the 27th ultimo asking to be allowed to try an experiment of teaching the younger children during the forenoon and taking the older children in the afternoon, as she stated that owing to the seven different grades the pupils are in it is impossible to keep these classes working at once and the same time. The Department allowed her to give this scheme a fair trial to see how it works.\n\nA complaint has been received from Mr. Joseph Cree objecting to this arrangement and I am enclosing a copy of his letter.

Some of our people have been called away, so we have had to keep our children home, not to let them stay out late at night. We are very sorry about this, but we have no choice.\n\nWe have heard that the teacher treated the children very harshly. We have never seen such behavior before. The children have been living 3 miles away, so we sent them there three weeks ago. They are now doing well.\n\nWe hope you will understand our situation.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6096, file 323-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 26, 1914.\n\nRev.

To any competent and unprejudiced observer it is clearly seen that the Teacher has the welfare and the interest of the children at heart. She has a natural love for children and knows how to manage them, and I gather from what I have learned about her, she has had great success in her fifteen years teaching experience. In spite of the absence of corporal punishment of any kind in her school, she has in the short time she has had this school secured a first class discipline. Only once has she sent a boy home from school for repeatedly day after day failing to do what she wants him to do, and as a result, was cured, I'm told, of his neglectful habit.\n\nWith regard to the objection by some of the parents to the experiment, by the Department's permission, of teaching the younger children in the forenoon only, I cannot see any way out of the difficulty. There are so many different grades it is impossible for one person to handle them all at the same time for whole days, so she is trying this plan of giving all her time to the juniors in the forenoon. The seniors during the forenoon are given desk work, which does not take very much of the teacher's time, and they do not lose any time as work is given them the whole time. In the afternoon the teacher has just seniors. By this plan the juniors get more work done in the half a days than if they were kept in all day and the teacher giving only occasional attention to them. I am fully convinced that these juniors will learn more in one year by this plan than in any other year before. Parents are remarking already of how much their children have learned since the teacher came. The plan is not altogether new, by any means, as it is followed in hundreds of schools throughout the country.\n\nThese objectors are not competent to judge about these matters, and further they are very unreasonable and will never consider from any other viewpoint but theirs. Facts can be given to prove, that we have not had as good a teacher in the last ten years than the present one. The objectors should never be encouraged but should be told to co-operate with the teacher in her endeavors to elevate their children. The teacher tells me that she notices in the children's behaviour the influence of these complainers on them and makes it harder work for her.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As far as I can gauge the feelings of the children (parents), I think it would be appreciated, and I think also, that some of the adult Indians also, would like to take advantage of a Savings Bank, where they could lay by small amounts at a time. I certainly think such an institution would be a help to the Oka Indians, help to develop their independence & self-respect. If you can suggest particulars of anything on that line, I would be glad; should you wish it, I am quite willing to take on the responsibility of the working of it.

Since the bad weather set in, some of them for lack of proper clothing stayed at home, while the others who are big enough to earn money by digging potatoes worked out during digging and threshing season to earn winter clothing.\nIt is needless for me to say that after this season there is nothing at which they can work to earn anything. The importance of taking advantage of this opportunity of making a little to readily earn in view of the coming hard winter. Moreover I am the father of eleven children and supporting eight who are still at home. It will I hope be seen the importance of feeding and properly clothing them for school at a laborious way.\nI state these facts not to plead exemption for my children from attending school but simply to be treated fairly and fairly under the circumstances. I am fully aware of the value and importance of education and I am doing everything in my power to help my children along these lines.\n\nIn view of these facts stated above if the Dept will meet through the trust officer to have the children attend school there I must\nDemand that the children be clothed at the expense of the Dept.

The Department would be willing to purchase material to make the clothing and would like you to start a sewing class among the girls for this purpose. Kindly state whether you would be willing to undertake this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Laura E. Dickinson,\nTeacher,\nOka Country School,\nOka, Que.\nReceived today your letter dated Feb. 13th re. starting a sewing class here to make garments for the children. Way I say that conditions here are such that the idea is hardly practicable. The severe weather & bad condition of the roads at present, besides the home claims of the women & girls, also the distance of the homes from one another, make it difficult to gather them together at a central place of meeting. This course too, would cause a delay in the churn having the clothes. As the sewing class could not be for more than an hour or two at the most & that in the evening (we have very poor lights to work by & the sewing would have to be done by hand) - it would be at least a week or two before the garments were ready; the churn are in need of them now. It certainly is best that material should be given them to make up instead of ready-made clothes; but may I suggest that they be allowed to do it in their own homes where some of them have sewing machines. In this way, the garments would be ready more quickly, there would be no need for the women & girls to neglect their home duties to come to the class. As the roads are at present, the journey to & from a place of meeting would take at least an hour extra for most of them. I am willing to superintend this work if you wish it, & to give all the help I can to those making the clothes.\n\nMy objections are not raised through any unwillingness to start the sewing class. I have twice tried it before, but the women found it claimed too much of their time, when they could do it at home in half the time, & superintend home duties as well.\n\nMay I also suggest that perhaps it would be a good thing to start a sewing class in the summer months. After the planting is over before the harvesting begins. The garments when finished could be left in charge of some responsible person, to be ready for use when the winter comes.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nLaura E. Dickinson\nFeb. 19th\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nRev. J. Whitebeam forwarded to me, your letter addressed to him, re. the flag for Oka School.\n\nWhen Mr. Whitebeam removed from Oka, he left the flag in my charge, & I still have it, with the school materials.\n\nMay I mention here, that we have no flag pole for the Oka School; therefore the flag cannot be put to its proper use. Last Summer, the janitor made a rough kind of pole, but only about 25 or 30 ft high. He asked me for the flag, I intended raising it on. Of course I refused it to him under those conditions. Until we could get a good pole & proper fittings - as it is a large and very good flag. I think it is this fact that has caused the trouble & misunderstanding.\n\nAs I will probably be resigning my post here at Easter, would you be kind enough to inform me with whom I should leave the flag when I go; as two or three of the men seem to be trying to get it into their charge.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nLaura E. Dickenson\nOttawa, February 26, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to the flag for the Oka School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your explanations in regard to this matter are satisfactory and, should you give up your duties at this school, you should leave the flag in the charge of the Agent.\n\nThe Department regrets to learn that you will probably be resigning your position at Easter. Kindly state whether you have yet forwarded your resignation to the authorities of the Methodist Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Laura E. Dickinson,\nTeacher,\nOka Indian School,\nOka, Que.\nSir,\n\nIn pursuance with the instructions contained in your letter of February 13th, I proceeded to Oka and met the Indians in Council, as well as making personal calls at some of the homes of the children. From observations I was able to make I do not think it advisable, in the meantime, to provide clothing for any of the children in order to enable them to attend school. The fathers of the three families mentioned by Chief Peter Angus are earning livelihood as well as other Indians and are in position to clothe their children. The school is quite near their homes, not farther than half a mile. To begin to clothe school children here would be an unwise departure, these Indians are now the greatest parasites of the Department and should be made to realize that the Department does not exist for the sole object, as they think, of feeding and clothing the Oka Indians.\n\nWith regard to those parents who do not send their children to school and defying the threats of the truant officer, I did not call upon them for the following reason:\n\nThe roads owing to the severity of the winter have been practically in an impassable condition, and living as they do over two miles from the school, and the children would have to travel across an open country it is no wonder that they were unable to attend school regularly.\nThe teacher, Miss Dickenson, had evidently lost control of her school and interest in her work, particularly during the last few weeks, and the Indians had serious complaints against her, therefore, lost confidence of the children and with it had outlived her usefulness. The fault, to my mind, was not altogether with the Indians. The school was closed and had been closed for two days the day I called. The teacher informed me that she had tendered her resignation to the Mission authorities and that she expected to leave at the end of February. In conversation, with Rev. A. A. Radley of St. Lambert, who has charge of the Oka Indian Mission on behalf of the Methodist Missionary Society, he informed me that Miss Dickenson's resignation as teacher of the Oka Country School had been accepted.\n\nWith the incoming of a new teacher, I am inclined to think, the attendance at school will prove satisfactorily. I would, therefore, leave the matters complained of, by Chief Peter Angus, as they are until after the new teacher is well started in the work. In the case of Etienne, who defies the Department to punish him for not sending his children to school, I would give him another chance and see how he acts after the change of teachers, and if he still continues to be defiant I would recommend legal action being taken against him and the result will no doubt be a salutary as an example to all other recalcitrants.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Radley, St. Lambert, Quebec, informs me that Miss L. E. Dickinson, teacher at Oka Indian School, has had a complete breakdown and cannot continue her work. As Miss Dickinson was planning to leave Oka within a short time, it is likely that she will not resume her duties at all. As this school is situated at considerable distance from our office and conditions in Quebec are somewhat different to those with which we are directly concerned in connection with our other schools, it has been customary for the nomination of a teacher for this position to come directly from the Chairman of the District.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher to succeed Miss Dickinson at the Oka Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is in receipt of a communication from the Rev. A. A. Radley, St. Lambert, Que., in which he states that he has engaged Miss Violet Macnamara of Bedford, Que., to take charge of this school. Mr. Radley has been informed that the Department approves of this appointment and that Miss Macnamara will be paid a salary at the same rate as the former teacher received, viz.\u2014$500.00 per annum.\n\nIn connection with this appointment I would draw your attention to the fact that Mr. Radley states he has engaged this teacher. As you are aware, although the Church authorities are given the privilege of nominating teachers, the appointment rests with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

Mr. Radley, of Montreal, stated to the Department that he had \"engaged\" a teacher for the Indian School at Caughnawaga. You point out quite properly that \"although the Church authorities are given the privilege of nominating teachers, the appointment rests with the Department.\"\n\nIn reply, permit me to give an extract from my letter to Mr. Radley on this question:\n\n\"The way for us to work in the matter is to work through the Indian Department, who alone have the power to appoint teachers, although this is done on our recommendation. As I mentioned to you before, on account of the distance of Oka and Caughnawaga from our office, and the different conditions which prevail in Quebec, these nominations have previously been made by the Chairman of the District. To save time I will send a note today to the Department, advising them of Miss Dickinson's retirement, and asking them to await a nomination from you.\"\n\nYou will note that these instructions correctly represent the relative position of the Missionary Society and the Indian Department in this matter. I can only think that Mr. Radley has inadvertently used a word which expressed more than the actual state of his negotiations with the applicant for this position. I received a note from\nhim to say that he had forwarded to Ottawa an application for the Oka Indian School from Miss Violet MacNamara, of Bedford, Quebec, a graduate (1912) of Macdonald College, recommended by two gentlemen of educational standing whom I know very well.\n\nHowever, I shall again draw his attention to the correct form of procedure for the future.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ.

I called on all the parents and some have responded while others have not, because they lack clothing and boots. I think it would be wise for the Department to furnish these people with the articles I asked for and promised me when I was in Ottawa.\n\nWith regard to the children of Leon Etienne, I would not ask anything on their behalf as their father is too unwilling to send them to school. He says \"such laws do not belong to him;\" he is following the Indian idea of freedom. I am surprised at your way of treating people like him. His mother is getting regularly relief from the Agent notwithstanding her children are engaged to support her as she has given them all her property. They are all followers of Thunderwater. If the Department intends to enforce the compulsory school act then Leon Etienne should be the first man to make an example of.\n\nThe Indians are very bitter against me for being a truant officer and have asked me to resign or they will do me injury. I will not resign, I would rather fall at their hands than do what they wish. I should like the Department to supply me with something with which to protect myself in my travels among them in the event of my being assaulted by them.\n\n(Signed) Chief Peter August\n\nIndian Affairs.

On Friday last...\nChief Peter Angas called with the complaint that he heard that the children were playing with dolls in school. I replied that last December two girls brought dolls a time or two to play with at noon, but the moment I observed them in school hours I forbade it. He also inquired as to time of closing school. I have been giving no recess in the afternoon, and letting school out at half-past three, the primary class at half-past two, also on Friday once a month at half-past two to attend the ladies' aid which we organized for the uplift of the women. I understand that similar complaints have been made.\nTo Mrs. Bertrand, the Indian agent, and to Mrs. Primeau, the School Inspector at St. Jerome.\n\nNow permit me to say, I did not seek this position. The Rev. A.A. Radley urgently requested me to take the school. He assured me I was well recommended as to ability and character by Inspector McQuatt and Mr. Beiler, with whom I have been acquainted for some years. I hold a B.A. degree from McGill University, and a certificate of a successful summer course at Macdonald College. I have several years experience in teaching\u2014four years and a half at this Oka Country School.\nWhen I came here twenty-seven years ago the pupils\u2014even the most advanced\u2014were hardly able to utter a sentence in English. After three years teaching I left them speaking, reading, and singing fairly well. I placed eighteen bibles in their hands, and as many hymnbooks, at my own expense. I interested my friends in getting places for them and four chief lingers among the number-found situations among my people.\n\nI don't think I should have to spend my time carrying on a correspondence to maintain my position here.

Mrs. A.F. Jacobs stated at the meeting that I was not employed by the Government to do this kind of work. This has been the result of Agent's action in dismissing the case against these two delinquents. I am being branded as the one who is their enemy and a persecutor of the poor.\n\nThey are now urging to have the Dept. provide clothing for their children, and to have the present teacher replaced by another. We have had a good teacher in Miss Laura E. Dickinson but was not appreciated by these people. It is hard to please them. They want their own way. I think it is very urgent for the Dept. to send one of its officials to look into this matter soon, by meeting the parents and explaining to them the duties required of them in school matters.\n\nAnother matter. My brother, Phillip Angus, stated that last fall he was told by the Dept. to guard above all the health of the children by keeping them at home; that schools were being closed owing to sickness. He has taken the word of the Dept. and has allowed his boy to wander about all day long.\n\nThe Agent does not seem to exercise his powers in matters of this kind;-\"he lets them off altogether\".\n\nLast night, May 6th 1919, I am told the women paraded the road without any clothing.

This state of things cannot be too severely con-\nI cannot think that the interest of education was ever contemplated in creating such a system. A driver for two years would meet the situation. There are twenty-two children of school age in the village and vicinity. Of course to make...\nthis a success the Dep't\nwould have to formulate\na school board.

He states that there are from 40 to 45 children on the reserve who do not attend school, 22 of whom reside in the village or adjacent thereto. He suggests that if a driver were appointed it would meet the situation and enable these children to attend school.\n\nThe Department would like you to furnish at an early date, the names of heads of families who reside in the village and the number of children of school age in each family. You should also state your opinion as to whether you consider, if a driver were appointed, satisfactory results would be obtained. You will also be good enough to recommend the name of a suitable person having a horse and rig for the purpose.\n\nAs you are aware the Department has given this system a trial with very unsatisfactory results.

We want a Teacher that could teach our children everything that is needed to be taught not only drawing & laughing & playing as its going on now but even lets some of the boys bring in gun powder in school and set it a fire there she often tells the children not to keep still and let her sleep awhile you know it no place to sleep.\nwe have been letting this going on\nlong enough now we want our\nchildren to learn something just the\nsame as any other people.

Bertrand,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe complaints - I am not surprised that complaints are made against Miss F. E. Saunders. \"Were not complaints and charges more serious preferred against all former teachers?\" We know the people from whom these come, they may be classified under three groups. The first are boys and some widowers that would like a giddy young teacher, the reason is obvious. The second are Councillors and Chiefs who are Office gone crazy, their motive is to control. The last group is composed of the Council of the Tribe, chief among them is Gabriel. They are against all education because in their opinion the Education deprives them of their Indian Treaty Rights. Any one of these groups would place a bomb under the Indian Department and blow it and all its Officials to atoms, for they haven't any more love for it than they have for Miss Saunders.\n\nAny cognizance taken by you of these complaints would not enhance their estimation of you. The charges or complaints, I am positive are without foundation or truth.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The fact that she was little deaf and the children are taking advantage to make some noise to counterbalance the attention she can't hear them. I enclose herewith the communications that I have received from Mr. O'Keefe in reply to my questions with regard to that matter. I may be advised that I am in no position, when he said that some Indians will like a white woman teacher and that the majority of the Indians around that should accept a teacher of the education for they consider that it will do more good than Indian teachers.\n\nIf they think right it may be a good thing for them if that school will not be opened next fall.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have to request the Department hire for the next year Miss Helen Earl if possible as she does very well and all the parents are pleased with her work. I beg to say that Rev.

The distance some of the children would have to go to and from the school is too great, and on other Reserves where this scheme has been tried it has not met with success; besides there is not sufficient accommodation in the Village School for all the children.\n\nBoth these schools are to reopen after the holidays, and if possible, you should arrange with the teachers to resume their duties.

Now we want to know why is it that the Department does not seem to care whether our children gets a good learning or not. But the money is paid out to the teacher just as well as if we had one of the best teachers. Now our wishes is that the Depart-ment would be kind enough as to favor us in this way as to change the teacher for us and send a teacher that would be a little younger than Miss Sanderson because she is too old now and is not able to manage the children at school. The children are really ruining the school them selves, there are rules now to follow. The children goes in school like\nclaws & come out wild cats.\nNow we sent our children to school,\nwe expect them to be taught how to be\nas other children that are going to\ndifferent schools, it's just a shame\nany one passing by the school house\ncan hear them talking away out on\nroad everybody is busy in school.\nThey get up from their seats at any\ntime and go to the board to get\nwhat they want don't even know\nhow to go on his toes at that.\nNow it's just a shame if it keeps\non like this, there won't be any\none would care about sending\ntheir children to school if you don't\nchange the teacher its the Depart-\nments duty to see to this, we don't\nneed to be forced to send our\nchildren to school, if we see it\nfit to send them and also we all\nwant our children to know how to\nread & write, same as any other\nparents do. But Mr Scott took him.\nthese years of our children are going by, so don't think let without money is paid out year after year for teachers go to work, it's only the teachers that getting benefit of it. Now we have made this report 2 years ago. But no body was good enough to look to this for us in the right way. Now don't you think that before the school was open in the village again that Rev Oka would have sent his little children here to school too if he thought it was worth while he only sent a few days then one of his children said that they were not going to come anymore because that their country school was not worth a snap. Let me then that Rev Oka sent his children over the river to school and then report that the school in the village must be opened again because he had a few little ones that was not old enough yet to be sent with, treat now our children.\nneeds a good teacher and a smart one too just as well as Rev. Ote does he does not care he'll report that Miss Sundrie is all right if he was asked at any time because she belongs to the ladies aid same as his wife by and a few others of their friends. We understand this does not mean that we beat Miss Sundrie no. But she is too old now she can't hold the school any longer because if you give her the charge of this school again when the school opens on the next term we will tell at once she won't have much to tend too for it just wasting the children's time. Can we do ask you kindly Mr. Scott to favor us with a new teacher its me that here knows how its going on and we ask it for the benefit of our children to do this for us, also discharge the one you have now on hand to force our children to school its no need of it its paying money out for nothing we can be\nPolice over our children our slaves\nand you won't have to pay us\nanything only favor us with a\nnew teacher and you'll see how the\nreport will be at the end of the\nnext term it only costs displeases\nand cases trouble to bothers to see him\ngo around the homes and trying to be\nBoss over our children before he was\nin duty there was always more children\ngoing to school also she had a good\nteacher as long as she was teaching all\nright and holding to the schools rules\nfor all right when we will close\nour hand letter If care us for raising\nso much in our letter but it needed\nif we must talk to be under stood\nreasonably Now hoping that you will\nkindly ever as much as to let us know\nyour manner to this little answer to be\nsent to our agent from the Parents\nof the County School Oka.\nLove\nif you will ask Miss Simon for our teacher\nThe Names Of Those Wants A New Teacher.\n\nMr. James Martin, Martin.\nMrs. Mary Simon, Renville.\nMrs. Josephine Bonaparte.\nMrs. John Johnson, Pipestone.\nMrs. L.

Saunders, teacher of the Oka Country School, be dispensed with and that another teacher be engaged. These Indians have been making complaints during the past two years regarding the work Miss Saunders is performing in the classroom. They state that she has no control over the children and consequently the discipline is very poor, also that their children are making no progress in their studies. They request that a younger teacher be engaged.\n\nWe have in the past taken this matter up with our Agent and the Rev. J. J. Oke, Missionary on the Reserve, and they have stated that these charges are without foundation. The fact, however, remains that the Indians refuse to send their children to school and the majority of them, at least, are very much prejudiced against Miss Saunders. In view of these facts, it would appear to be desirable to make a change in the teacher at this school. We find that when the Indians are against a teacher, with or without good reason, although the teacher may be competent, it is better to make a change. These complaints have now been coming in to the Department for the past two years, and I submit for your consideration the advisability of the Methodist Church authorities making a change in the teacher at the Oka Country School. It might be that the services of Miss Saunders could be utilized elsewhere.\n\nIt will also be necessary to obtain a teacher for the Oka Village School, as Miss Helen Earl, the former teacher, has resigned.\n\nBoth Miss Saunders and Miss Earl were appointed through the Chairman of the Montreal South District of the Montreal Conference, and I shall be pleased if you will take the matters referred to in this letter up with your Church authorities in that district.\n\nYour early attention to this matter will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McKenzie, Action Assistant Deputy and Secretary, admitting a mistake in a previous letter in not noting that Miss Vera Simons had been appointed to succeed Miss Earl at the Oka Village School.\n\nNow, about Miss Saunders not being satisfactory at the Oka Country School. Rev. Robert Smith, Chairman of the Montreal District, wrote me on April 12th, enclosing Miss Saunders' application to be employed as teacher for this school next year. I replied to his letter, telling him that I knew of no reason why her services should not be retained, but told him that I had written to the Rev. Arthur Barner about this, as he superintends our Indian Missions. Mr. Barner did not know any reason why she should not be re-engaged and I consequently told Mr. Smith that so far as I knew it would be satisfactory to re-engage her - which he did.\n\nI presume that I should have written to the Department, rather than to Mr. Barner, but as the Indian Work has recently come under my supervision I have not been as familiar with the method of procedure as I trust I shall be from this time forward.\n\nWe have other applications for positions as teachers on Indian Schools, and I have no doubt that I can nominate one who will be satisfactory for the Oka Country School, and with your concurrence will be pleased to nominate Miss Saunders for some other Indian School. Before doing this I would like to learn from you what provision is being made for the school at Georgina Island next school year; also who is to be teacher at Gibson. Would Miss Browne's appointment be satisfactory to the Department for Chemong Indian School? I presume that you have appointed a teacher for Christian Island, - you having intimated to me that the Indians themselves wished to have the nominating of the teacher for that school.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am, Very faithfully yours,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The nomination of Miss Saunders for some other Indian school conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church will receive consideration.\n\nWe have no teacher in view for the Georgina Island Indian Day School. Miss Grace Martin, who taught this school last year, is taking charge of the New Credit school after the summer holidays. It will be necessary to secure the services of a teacher to replace her at Georgina Island, and I shall be pleased if you will nominate a teacher for this school. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRegarding the Gibson Indian Day School, I beg to say that insofar as we are aware Miss Black will again resume duties when the school re-opens after the holidays. We have had no intimation that she intends to resign.\n\nRegarding a teacher for the Chemong (Mud Lake) Indian Day School, I beg to say that the services of Miss Brown will be satisfactory, and the Department will approve of her re-engagement for another year.\n\nWe have not yet appointed a teacher for the Christian Island school.

Bertrand, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI am this morning in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Robert Smith, Chairman of the Montreal District of the Methodist Church, informing me that Miss Saunders, (who last year taught the Oka Country School, and to whose reappointment you consented, although a protest had been made against her continuing,) has accepted another school and is not now available to serve the Country School referred to for another year.\n\nHe strongly advises that we engage MISS HILDA OKE, daughter of one of our missionaries. He says that Miss Saunders strongly advises that Miss Oke be appointed to this school. She is 18 years old; has been attending the public school at St. Anne de Bellevue in connection with Macdonald College and passed her ninth grade with the exception of Geography and Arithmetic, in which she failed last year. Mr. Smith quotes Miss Saunders as saying that Miss Oke is quite capable of teaching anything which will be required in the Country School at Oka; has a good way with children; and is a teacher in the Sunday School. He says he has not met her and knows nothing more of her than he learns from Miss Saunders. He gives me the information, however, that Mr. Oke's children have a good name and states that the older daughter is engaged in teaching in some Mission School in the West. He strongly advises that Miss Hilda Oke be engaged for this Country School.\n\nIt occurs to me that, in view of the difficulty we have had in finding a suitable teacher, it would not be amiss to give Miss Oke a trial. If you will agree to this, it will be satisfactory to the Missionary Society.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

They stated that you had no control over the children, and that they were making no progress in their studies. We ignored these reports for some time. From the reports of our agent and the Rev. J.J. Oke, missionary on the reserve, these complaints were without foundation. We find, however, that when the Indians are against a teacher, with or without good reason, although the teacher may be a competent one, it is advisable to make a change. For this reason we asked the Methodist church authorities to nominate the services of another teacher for the Oka Country School, and, if possible, to utilise your services in another Indian school.\n\nWe consider that your services were satisfactory, but for the above reason thought it better, if possible, that a change of teacher be made. The Methodist church authorities recommended, in view of the difficulty of obtaining another teacher, that your services be continued. This arrangement the Department agreed to, but we were lately informed that you had accepted another school, and that your services would not be available for another year.\n\nThe receipt which you enclosed, covering the bonus paid for the June quarter, last, was also received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Frances H. Saunders,\nBox 45,\nSt. Gabriel de Brandon,\nQue.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe teachers for Indian Schools.\n\nIn your telegram of yesterday's date you approved of the appointment of Lorenzo Big Canoe as teacher at Christian Island; also of Miss Hilda Oke as teacher for the Oka Country School, and stating that Enos T. Montour would be satisfactory at Georgina Island, if he would accept.\n\nI immediately wrote to Lorenzo Big Canoe, offering him the position of Missionary Teacher at Christian Island; also sent a letter to the Rev. Robert Smith, stating that the Department approves of the engagement of Miss Hilda Oke for the Oka Country School and asked him to complete arrangements with her. I have also written, offering to Mr. Enos T. Montour the position of Missionary Teacher at Georgina Island. I will notify you as soon as I hear from these to whom these positions have been offered.\n\nYou did not say anything in your letters as to the salary allowed for the teacher at Christian Island.

I am sorry I had\nto do it. I will not take him back\nwithout a promise of better behaviour.\nHe gave endless trouble to Miss\nSaunders whenever at school.

The Agent should then have drawn the attention of the parents to the boy's conduct, and, if they did not aid you in exercising control over him, he could have expelled him.\n\nI have to request that you will refer this matter to Mr. Agent Blanchette and if you are both of the opinion that Percy Angus would not be amenable to the discipline he could then be instructed to remain away from school. If, however, the Agent can succeed in having the parents exercise authority and see that the boy behaves himself, he might be given another chance to continue his studies.\n\nIn future, any matters affecting your school should be taken up with your local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The doctor should inform you what children should not be allowed to go to school while suffering from this ailment, and you will please inform the parents of the doctor's finding.\n\nWhile the Department desires the attendance at both the Village and Country Schools to keep up to standard, it is not our intention to expose children who are at present immune from whooping cough to those troubled with it.

Blanchette, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nO K A , Que.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have visited the village and country schools of the Indians. In the Village School all the children are present and in good health, although there are several cases of hooping-cough among the children in the Village, but these are not of age to attend the school.\n\nIn the Country School, out of twenty (20) pupils registered, nine (9) are present, all the others have the hooping-cough, some at the first period, the others are in the last period.\n\nI went to the home of those who are not at school and found that these children were kept at the house because they were coughing with hooping-cough. I visited six (6) houses, and everywhere they have hooping-cough.\n\nSo that I believe that in the country especially, nearly all the Indian children have the hooping-cough since the beginning of October.\n\nI believe it would be better to close the country school for at least two (2) weeks so as to prevent contagion and allow the sick ones to cure themselves.\n\nYours devotedly,\n\nJ. Ouimet, M. D.\n\nOka, November 3rd, 1922.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st October, I am enclosing herewith report from Dr. Ouimet.

Ouimet regarding the outbreak of whooping cough among the children in the Village and Country Schools on the Oka Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that Dr. Ouimet recommends that the Country School be closed for at least two weeks in order to prevent further contagion and to allow those children who are sick to recover. You may therefore, if you consider it advisable, instruct the teacher of the Country School to close the school for a period of at least two weeks, or longer, if necessary. If you consider that the Village School should be closed for the same reason, you may also instruct the teacher of that school to discontinue classes until you consider it safe to have the school re-opened. Both these schools should not remain closed for any further period than is absolutely necessary, and the Department will leave this matter in the hands of the Doctor and yourself to decide as to the period the schools should be closed in order to prevent a further spread of the disease.\n\nIt is considered that it will not be necessary to destroy any of the books at these schools, as there is very little likelihood of any contagion from the books in use by the children who have the disease.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection I would refer you to your letter of September 2, 1922.

He complains about his being indiscreet, and states that he would not like to go over his experience again of keeping him and others out of trouble. He says he is so pliable that he is easily led and victimized. You should regard this information from Mr. Oke with a measure of confidence. I would suggest that you make further enquiries of the Indian Agent at Oka, relative to the conduct of this young man.\n\nWhen I wrote you on June 19th I had a complimentary report regarding his work from the Rev.

There is a clique of Indians, headed by Mrs. Ernest Simon, who are pagan and disloyal, and are doing their best to hurt the teacher's reputation as well as destroy his influence. Mr. Boutcher explained to me why he is able no longer to live in the country and why he has to secure board in the village. This is rather an expensive arrangement for him, as he will have to ride a horse in the winter time to and from his work.

The petitioners in the first place requested a change in the teacher at the Oka Country School. They stated that he put too much time on music, did not teach the children anything, allowed lengthy recesses, allowed the Indian language in and around the school and made improper advances to some of the girl pupils. They also asked that Joe Simon, the truant officer, be kept in his position instead of being discharged (see official letter No. 15-20 of the 20th inst.)\n\nI am sending the papers to Mr. Indian Agent Harbour for his report and recommendation under covering letter No. 20-1-1 of today's date.\nOttawa, December 26th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing papers that were handed to the Superintendent of Indian Education this morning by Ernest Simon and Joe Simon. You will note that the petitions, which are not originals, are supposed to have been signed by 20 Indians of the Oka Band. The petitioners make charges against Mr. Boutcher, teacher of the Oka Country School, and ask for his dismissal. They also request that the Department change the decision to discharge Joe Simon, truant officer and janitor.\n\nMr. Ferrier informed the two members of the Band that the papers would be directed to you for your report and recommendation. One of the charges against the teacher is rather serious and if you think it is founded on fact the Department would consent to an investigation.\n\nYou might make a recommendation regarding the position of truant officer. In this connection see official letter No. 15-20 of the 20th instant. I may add for your information that the Department has received a letter from Miss Helen Earl, teacher of the Village School, to the effect that Joe Simon has refused to send the children to school and that he has not called at the Village School since the 1st of September. Miss Earl was unaware of the fact that there was a truant officer appointed until the last few days.\n\nYou might direct separate communications with reference to the teacher and the truant officer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Lefebvre\n\nMrs. Francis Oka Lefebvre\nSir:\n\nRE: Balby Boutelier, School Teacher\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to say that all the papers, reports submitted to you and forwarded to me for recommendation, are not, to my opinion, reasons for dismissing a teacher.\n\nThat serious charge against the teacher, spoken of in your letter, would be the only valid reason, if founded on facts. Mrs. Frank Lefebvre has given me her complaint, which I enclose herewith, and she told me the only thing she wants is the dismissal of the teacher. She claims to have witnesses to prove the facts.

The Department is not prepared to make a change in the teachers at the present time, and if the attendance does not improve, the school will be closed. The attitude of the parents in this section of the reserve makes it very difficult for the Department to either enforce the law or conduct a school successfully. Closing the school for an indefinite period may have a salutary effect and such action will be taken if conditions do not improve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, February 18, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe continued poor attendance at the Country School on the Oka Indian Reserve and the inability of the truant officer to induce the parents to send their children has led the Department to seriously contemplate closing the school for an indefinite period. The attitude of the parents in this section of the Reserve makes it very difficult for the Department to either enforce the law or conduct a school successfully. It is, therefore, thought that the closing of the school may have a salutary effect, and the local Indian Agent has been informed that such action will be taken if conditions do not improve.\n\nA complaint was made a short time ago by certain of the Indians regarding the conduct of the teacher, Mr. Selby Boutcher, and also objections were raised to the recent change in the truant officer. The Department after carefully considering these complaints is not prepared to make a change in either the teacher or truant officer.\n\nI am informing you of the action which it may be necessary to take regarding this school, and shall be pleased to have an expression of your views in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is our intention to close this school in the near future if the attendance does not materially increase. As was promised, the Department will arrange for a new teacher in September, next, if the attendance between now and the end of June is such that we would be warranted in keeping the school open. I might also add that it is our purpose to erect this year a day school in the village, which will accommodate 40 pupils; and, if the Country school is closed, no doubt some of the children for whom the parents wish an education can arrange to attend in the village. A copy of this communication is being directed to Mr. Indian Agent Harbour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nErnest Simon, Esq.,\nIndian Reserve,\nOka, P.

Lefebvre, visited the Department in connection with the Oka Country School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P. Q.\nOttawa, February 27, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nSince my No. 20-1-1 of the 18th instant, an Oka delegation has visited Ottawa with reference to the Country Day School. There is a very strong clique of Indian parents who are opposed to continuing the services of Mr. Selby Boucher, the teacher. The delegation was informed that the Department intended to close the school unless the attendance materially increased. Promise was given that, if a good average attendance was secured for the months March to June, inclusive, the Department would not only keep the school open but would make arrangements for a new and better qualified teacher. I regret, therefore, to inform you that in any case the services of Mr. Boucher will not be required after June 30th.\n\nThe Department does not consider that Mr. Boucher is largely to blame for the present difficulties and the poor attendance. However, I am convinced that the Country Day School would never function satisfactorily as long as he is the incumbent. The clique opposed to him are very strong in the locality and it is not considered advisable to again enlist the services of the R.C.M.P. at the present time in an effort to bring about satisfactory attendance. As soon as you have conferred with your representatives, I shall be pleased to hear from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, B.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings, Queen St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of February 27th, File No. 20-1-1, re OKA COUNTRY DAY SCHOOL. I beg to say that it will be quite satisfactory to us to have a change in teacher there.\n\nI presume it would be satisfactory to have a lady teacher appointed. I am leaving for the West on Monday night, and will not be in Toronto again until about the 17th of March, after which I hope to be in a position to nominate someone for the Oka Country School.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI am,\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIn reply to your letter of Feb 27th, we passed through the meeting and the band they decided and resolved of their wishes on the school program. The Country School was been founded in established of our own kind in the year back date 1876 for purpose of school house and meeting place. So far the condition of the Country School is however no doubt to continue on them one main thing is the Indian Department never been given any notice to our circle weather ever we to be consulted it\nAccordingly,\n\nIs the Indians' and Department to deal it of any matter then the success of both sides not by any means... and the parents were not afforded to send their children to Noka Village so far a distance. It impossible for law to enforce us to do thus the need building purpose is useless for us in our locality we have. One school in our vicinity only is essential to removed the nasty teacher in near future then the success will obtain to mind the School Concerned\nThirdly:\n\nWe have confidence to arrange more desirable to leave open the country school, as its form and easy for us and won costs less much.\n\nThen the band appointed two representative of the school matter do deal land debate appointed to you sincere.\n\nSimon K. Simon Oka Indians Band\n\nErnest Simon\nOttawa, March 4, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you intimate that it will be satisfactory to your Society if a change in teaching services is made at the Oka Country Indian Day School. I note that you will be in Toronto again on the 17th instant and that the question of securing a teacher will engage your attention at that time.\n\nI have now to inform you that another delegation from Oka visited the Department yesterday in connection with this matter. They are apparently quite interested in having the Country School remain open. The Department promised that we would confer with your Society, with a view to securing the services of a new teacher at an early date. I beg to suggest that you nominate a worker who could commence duties on the first of May. If the attendance in the months of May and June is satisfactory - the different Indian delegations have promised that it will be so - the Department would agree to conduct the school during the coming academic year.\n\nIf a new teacher is not available on May first, I believe it advisable to close the school at that time, as under present conditions it will not be a success. If you concur, I should be pleased if, upon your return to Toronto, you would inform the teacher that his services will not be required after the 30th of April.

I am, consequently, writing him today, telling him that his engagement will terminate on the 30th of June.\n\nI am trying to get a successor and hope to be able to nominate someone in a few days to take charge of the school during May and June.

I am, today, sending information to this effect to the local Indian agent. It will be satisfactory to the Department if you secure a well qualified lady teacher for this school. The home of Mr. Joseph Simon would be a suitable boarding place.\n\nThe teacher should bend every energy to confine her activities solely to the general duties of the missionary and the teacher. If she allies herself with any group of the Indians, the other group will, in short order, make it extremely difficult for her to carry on the school satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You may inform him that the Department is taking this action, not because he has failed as a teacher, but because there is a strong clique of Indians who persist in refusing to send their children to the school as long as he is the incumbent. Mr. Boucher should be informed that the Department regrets the necessity of dispensing with his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.

Cowling has held the position of Principal in the Woodbridge Public School for nearly eight years, during most of which time I have been his inspector. This long, unbroken service in the same place is of itself good evidence of faithful and successful work, and it affords me satisfaction to add my testimony to the same effect. In addition to good ability and creditable attainment, Mr. Cowling brings into service a strong ambition to promote not only the intellectual and social, but also the moral well-being of his pupils; and his residence and labors for eight years in the community has undoubtedly been a valuable factor in raising to a higher standard public sentiment on social, intellectual and moral questions.\n\nMr. Cowling is held in high estimation in his profession as well as in the community where he is known.\n\n(SGD.)

His discipline is of the right kind and effective in securing willing cooperation and the proper attitude towards authority and work. His methods are modern and he shows good skill in the teaching of all the grades.\n\nKnowing Mr. Cowling some years ago as a very successful teacher and principal, I was pleased to find he still has the spirit and touch to control and direct in teaching successfully and happily.\n\n(SGD.)

Cowling, of 704 Logan Avenue, Toronto, for a position as teacher in some Indian school. Mr. Cowling is over sixty years of age, has taught school for twenty-nine years, has a second class professional life certificate, and for a year and a half prior to last Christmas time he taught in Secord Public School, Toronto, leaving there, I believe, on account of some disagreement between him and the lady principal. He would take charge of the Oka Country School for May and June, if satisfactory to your Department.\n\nI enclose copies of two testimonials which he showed me. I have known of Mr. Cowling for many years and regard him as a superior type of man, and think it would not be a mistake to appoint him to the Oka School. He has been accustomed to a very much larger salary than he would get there, but is willing to take charge for the time named. What salary would you allow him if you should agree to his appointment?\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst.

That is why Mrs. Lofwe wants to get him away she is a shame of herself before so to get him away she would feel better will more we do hope that our pleading for our teacher to remain his term out will be a success, for anything that is right and good work should gain instead of the sooner to gain for we see that if they gain it will be very bad for those who are for the right well hoping we will be looked upon as we do really want him to stay for the sake of those who likes to send school it no use trying to please them because they will only go a day or two and stop again and then they want to be forced to go we know them and hear what they say so now we remain the Mothers of the children of the Country School Mr. H.

I found Mr. Bantchin's school very well attended\u2014better for this time of year than many previous years for the same time. There were eleven scholars in attendance\u2014showing clearly that he is doing under the circumstances much better work than has been done by many former teachers.\n\nI want to express my conviction not only as a district officer but as chief, on the merits of this organization of the living element of Oka. I think that the Department as a Dept is establishing a precedent that will prove troublesome to itself, but can inspire the agitators. The Dept has played into their hands.

In reply I wish to inform you that the Department realizes Mr. Boucher has given faithful service; but the attitude of a certain clique of the Indian parents makes it impossible for the school to be a real success as long as he is the incumbent. The Superintendent of Indian Education explained this to Mr. Boucher upon the occasion of his recent visit to Ottawa. The Methodist Missionary Society and the Department have agreed to a change in teaching services on the first of May. This action has been taken after careful consideration.\n\nI have received also a letter from Mrs. A. F. Jacobs, Mr. and Mrs. Charley White and Mr. and Mrs. Martin. They also recommended that Mr. Boucher's services be retained.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChief Noah Corinthe,\nOka, P.Q.\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago a Mr. Brown came to me asking that Mr. Butten of the County School at Oka be dismissed. I asked him for cause and he was much embarrassed but finally admitted it was only because of a certain individual. I told him that the teacher was hired for a year that he could not be dismissed without cause; that it would be unbecoming to do so.\n\nI gave him some good advice and sent him away. I thought pains to inquire of a disappointed man. I thought pains to inquire of him was any ground for the gossip was informed by those in a position to know that there was absolutely no truth in his story.\n\nJudge my surprise and being informed by Dr. Manning that Mr. Butten's services will not be required after April 30th. I want to say that if the Department has no more evidence than Mr. Brown could give for the discharge of Mr. Butten's services, it has been done to a young man in the discharge of his duty.\n\nMr. Butten has been suspected of the same talent that every other teacher for years has suffered railway fines for same parties whom I knew well for they visited me two or three times a year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRobert Smith\nOttawa, April 1, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education, with reference to the services of Mr. Selby Boutcher, teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School. The Department agrees that this teacher's services have been fairly satisfactory, and Dr. Manning and Mr. Boutcher have been so informed. However, there is a strong clique of Indian parents that refuse to send their children to the school as long as he is the incumbent. The Department has had three or four delegations from Oka, two visits from Mr. Boutcher and considerable correspondence with the Methodist Missionary Society - all in this connection. And the decision to try a new teacher as from the first proximo was made after due consideration and with, I believe, a full knowledge of all the facts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I am this morning in receipt of a letter from Mr. Robert Cowling, of 704 Logan Avenue, Toronto, accepting the position of Teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School for the months of May and June, on the terms specified in your letter. I enclose herewith a copy of his letter.\n\nYou will note that he asks for information regarding the subjects taught, or any other matter which might be a help in the work.

We are pleased to note that he has accepted the position as teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School for the months of May and June, next.\n\nWe are writing Mr. Cowling and giving him the information asked for regarding the subjects taught and the enrolment and instruction regarding any textbooks and classroom supplies which he may require.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dr. Manning has forwarded your communication to him of the 30th ultimo in which you request information regarding the subjects taught or any other matters which might be of help in your work at the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that this is a small day school, with an enrolment of approximately 20 pupils. The curriculum followed is that of the separate schools in the province of Quebec and is of an elementary character. The last return received showed that there were 14 pupils in Grade I; 2 in Grade II; 1 in Grade III; 2 in Grade IV and 1 in Grade V. There will, no doubt, be a sufficient supply of textbooks and school material on hand, but should you require any further quantity, you should prepare a requisition for same and forward it to the local Indian Agent, Mr. Frank Harbour, who resides in the village of Oka. The programme of studies is set forth on the back page of the Daily Register, which you will find in the school.\n\nWe are pleased to note that you have accepted the position for the months of May and June, at the salary offered, viz., $55 per month. We hope you will meet with success in the work in the classroom and in your relations with the Indian parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, April 4, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Methodist Church authorities have nominated Mr. Robert Cowling to succeed Mr. Selby Boucher as teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School for the months of May and June, next. Mr. Cowling has a Second Class Professional Certificate for the Province of Ontario and has had 23 years' experience. We are allowing him salary during the two months he will teach at the rate of $65 per month. Mr. Cowling has been requested to report to you as soon as he arrives at Oka and I shall be pleased if you will explain local conditions to him and assist him in any way you can upon his taking up duties. If he requires any school supplies, you should obtain a list of same from him and forward it to the Department for attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAset. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P.Q.\nIn reply to your letter dated ultimo re Mr Boutcher we would say that your letter does not convince us that he has been given British fair play. Knowing the situation it is evident the Department is entirely misinformed and is not in possession of facts to enable it to deal fairly. We would therefore submit the following facts.\n\n1. It is a clique as the Department truly says, but it is a clique primarily against the Department, law and order and only secondarily against Mr Boutcher. In other words it is an auxiliary of Levi Generals clique for independance to which already they have given financial support.\n\n2. It is a clique against school attendance. They have fought against compulsory law and the present agitation against the teacher is only an indirect attack against it.\n\n3. It is a clique for no education, no religion and no morality. They stand opposed to all these institutions and ready to sacrifice all the gains of civilized life.\n\n4. It is a clique that has lost all sense of honor and self respect. Revelling in immorality and dishonor is it surprising that its women should insinuate with out shame to themselves such barefaced falsehoods against the teacher? In its code truth-telling and chastity have no existence.\n\nIn view of the above we who have been loyal and true ask the Dept. to re-consider its action and allow Mr Boutcher to finish out the scholastic year. We do not share the view of the Dept. that school under a new teacher in May and June would be a fair test of the loyalty of this clique. Submission to the demands of this organization could only work harm to the interests of the whole.\n\nWe are your obedient servants.\n\nChiefs\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6096, file 323-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with further reference to the Oka Country Indian Day School. The facts presented in your letter are known to the Department and it was only after careful consideration that we agreed to the appointment of a new teacher as on the first proximo. I regret that I have nothing to add to my letter of the 30th ultimo and wish to inform you that there is no merit in continuing the correspondence in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention. The teacher appointed should possess, besides professional qualifications, the necessary tact in order to meet with success in his associations with the Indian parents. The salary allowed will depend upon the qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you. Please forward for the approval of the Department full particulars regarding the teacher whom you recommend for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. C. H. Manning, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary of Home Missions,\nWesley Buildings,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir;-\n\nRE OKA COUNTRY SCHOOL.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 14th, asking me to nominate a teacher for the Oka Country Indian Day School, to begin his duties about September 1st next.\n\nSoon after your letter came to the office, Mr. H.E. Eburne, who taught for some years in the Brandon Industrial School, called at the office and applied for a position as teacher in one of our Indian schools, - preferably an industrial school. I told him that I did not know of any opening such as he would like to have, and enquired whether he would be willing to serve as teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School. While preferring an industrial school position, he has agreed to take the Oka Country School if you see fit to sanction his appointment.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier knows Eburne well, and is familiar with his work as an educationalist. The Rev. Thompson Ferrier, Principal of Brandon Indian Residential school has often commended his work, when in conversation with me. He has been unfortunate in not being able to keep out of debt, but personally I am disposed to give him another chance and would nominate him for the Oka Country Indian Day School. From an educational standpoint, and from every other standpoint except his liability to get into debt, he would make a good supply for that school. I do not urge his appointment, but will not feel that any mistake has been made if you agree to it.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 18, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, in which you recommend Mr. H. E. Eburne for the position of teacher at the Oka Country Indian Day School. The Superintendent of Indian Education knows this teacher's capabilities and is pleased to approve of his appointment. I consider it advisable for you to urge Mr. Eburne to pay particular attention to his personal finances. Neither the Missionary Society nor this Department can afford to have a field worker at a day school who is unable to secure the confidence of the local business community.\n\nWhen Mr. Eburne is proceeding to his work on the first of September, if convenient he should call and see Mr. Ferrier at 561, Booth Building. There are special difficulties at the Oka Country Day School and these can be discussed with advantage.\n\nA salary of $90.00 per teaching month will be allowed in this case.

Ferrier,\nOka, Quebec,\nDec. 4th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nIt has taken me a long time to avail myself of your invitation to write you personally about the work here, but I was waiting to see how things were going. I am not sure yet, but I really am hoping that the \"little more than an opportunity,\" of which you told me in your office, is going to be realized.\n\nThe average attendance at the country school so far are as follows:\n\n- September: 11.42\n- October: 14.50\n- November: 16.42\n- To date in December: 20.80\n\nI have now 37 children on the roll, and I know of only three more children of school age in my district.\n\nThe children are doing good work, and the school is properly graded up to grade five. I decided to get the children down to good hard slogzing work at reading, writing, arithmetic and English, and although the going was up-hill, it proved a successful policy.\n\nNow as to methods.\n\nI soon realized that the real problem was not with the children, but with the parents, and I decided to tackle the job.\n\nI began by writing a letter to the agent to be read at the council of chiefs, quite recently elected. I pointed out in my letter that the chiefs had a great opportunity to co-operate with the schools, and asked two...\nthings:\n\n1. that they would urge upon the people the importance of sending the children to school every day.\n2. that they - with the parents - would back up the teacher in every way possible.\n\nThe chiefs responded unanimously and enthusiastically. They asked the agent to write me a letter of appreciation (which he didn't do) and promised me, separately and collectively, their full support. And they have given it, and are honestly using their influence for the school in every way.\n\nThe next move was to establish direct contact with the people. So we arranged an exhibition of school work. I sent out by post invitations (as per the enclosed) to all the parents to come to the school one Friday afternoon, an invitation to which only the parents of one child did not respond. We had about forty of them at the school, in addition to the mayor and council who were also invited.\n\nThe programme is enclosed. The children did all their work in the presence of their parents and did it well. They added a dignified little programme - it really was a gem - after the exhibition of work, and after that the senior girls served refreshments.\n\nThe parents were swept off their feet, and were loud in their praises. They used more complimentary adjectives than I thought they knew, and quite eloquent speeches were made by the chiefs. The feeling abroad is fine, and I really believe that I have the full confidence of the people. In some cases older pupils who had given up school are coming back.\n\nOf course, on an Indian reserve all things are possible. I would not like to prophesy how long I shall be able to hold this. But I am working hard. The parents really realize that the children are making progress, and are quite delighted.\n\nAs regards the future,\n\nMr. Oke and I are contemplating a house to house visitation soon, and at Christmas I shall send out properly made out reports on each child's work. In the\nNew Year I am contemplating another gathering of parents which shall be of a more social character. In the early summer I am planning for an exhibition of games, etc.\n\nHere is one phase of all this which suggests itself to me. I wonder whether if I wrote an official letter I could get a grant\u2014a small one\u2014towards these efforts to put the community behind the school. Surely it is worth while & is having excellent results. My school has asked for nothing else, so far not even for school supplies. What do you think? Would a request for a grant of $20 or so, be considered? I am about that much out of pocket, anyway. Furthermore, we shall not be asking for large grants or things of that kind.\n\nPlease excuse so long a letter, but I was anxious to let you see what we are really doing.

The Department is pleased to learn that you are arousing interest on the part of the parents and that you have had a successful exhibition of school work. I am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of official letter of today's date to Mr. Indian Agent Harbour.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Perrier,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe the councillors and parents wish to express our hearty thanks and appreciation of the valuable service the Department has rendered us in appointing Mr. Eburne as teacher to the country school.\n\nFor many years the work of the school at this end of the Reserve has been most unsatisfactory and no doubt the cause of much trouble to the Indian Department. Even though we were not to blame for this state of things yet it is no secret we got the blame.\n\nWe complained and doubtless we should do the same thing again if like conditions prevailed. In doing this we were doing what every intelligent parent would do if they have any ambitions for their children.\n\nThe Department will no doubt have noted from the school returns that a great work is being done by Mr. Eburne. There has been wonderful progress made by the children under his efficient service. It may be thought that we have no sense of value for education but the response on our part and of our children to the efforts of an efficient teacher such as Mr. Eburne will give the lie to that idea.\n\nRecognising in our humble way the value Mr. Eburne is as a man and as a teacher to the school and to this neighbourhood we would therefore pray that the Department use every inducement to have him return to us next year. We venture even to think that the Department fully recognizes his value to it.\n\nWe are,\n\nYour humble petitioners,\n\nChief Peter Angus\nChief Paul X. Nelson\nChief Joseph A. Bonspiel\nChief Angus Beaucroix\nChief Jos Denis\n\nIndian Affairs.

I hope you will find it satisfactory.\n\nI would like to thank the parents for the help and support they have given the teacher during the past six months. It is because of this help that the children have made progress.\n\nBecause I know that you are interested, I venture to suggest the following ways in which the parents can help the children at school:\n\n**ATTENDANCE:**\n\nThe attendance has dropped a little during the past few weeks, and I am anxious that it shall increase again.\n\nAlmost the best way to help the teacher is to send the children to school EVERY DAY. The greatest trouble we have is with children who come for a day or two, and then stay away for a day or half day. The children can only do well in school if they attend regularly every day. When one child in a grade is away, it interferes with the work of every child in the grade. It is hoped that the parents will continue to help by seeing that the children come EVERY DAY.\n\n**ENGLISH:**\n\nAnother way in which the parents can help is by encouraging the children to speak English. English is the language in which the children are taught, and the language in which they do their lessons. The better they understand English the quicker they will learn other subjects. You can help in this matter in the following three ways:\n\n1. By encouraging the children to speak in English to the teacher, and to each other, when they are in school.\n2. By allowing them sometimes to speak in English when they are at home.\n3. By letting them try to read books and papers at home.\n\n**HOMEWORK:**\n\nSome of the children are given a little work to do at home at night. This is never very much, but it helps the children to study when they are away from the teacher. The parents can help much by allowing the children to do this work, and by encouraging them to do it well.\n\nIn addition to the above, I shall be glad if the parents will ask the children sometimes to show them their school work books, so that the children may know that their parents are interested in their work. The children are always allowed to take home any book they like.\n\nIf there is any way in which I can be of use, I shall be glad if you will let me know. I am generally in the school from four o'clock in the afternoon to half past four, and from seven o'clock to nine o'clock at night. At these times I am always glad to meet any of the parents.\n\nI hope that we shall continue to work in the future as well as we have in the past.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nIndian Affairs.

E. Eburne, the teacher of the Oka Country School:\n\n\"Now next is as I forget to say in my first letter about Rev. H. E. Eburne, who is our teacher now at the Oka Country School. - Now our wish here is that Rev. Eburne would also remain here with us as long as he wishes, as our children are just on a fly in the way they are learning. We never yet had such a good teacher here in Oka. Every parent is really well pleased of his good work and our belief is that if he is to be taken away from here there will be great loss to the children. So this is why I beg to have him remain with us. Also to kindly fix it up for me with the Indian Department to kindly pay Mr. Eburne what he would want for his good work for he well earn what he will ask for his work. Also our wish is that the Indian Department would kindly start a new school house here in the country, as it is in the village, so that Rev. Eburne would stay right there for his home, then no rent is to be paid after. Now I am in great hopes that it will be requested to us as it is needed badly for our children.\"\n\nI thought you would be pleased to have this testimony of Mr. Eburne's success as an educationalist on your files.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1926.\n\nRev.

I should not be altogether adverse to so doing if it were possible to have the salary increased; or, failing this, a grant made in lieu of residence, provided, of course, that the increase or grant was sufficiently decisive.\n\nIn this connection, I am sure you will pardon a reminder that I am entering on my twelfth year of service in Indian Schools.\n\nI shall very much appreciate any suggestion you may care to make.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.

I believe that the work you are doing at the Oka Country School is of sufficient importance to warrant another year's effort and the Department will be pleased to learn that you will continue next year. Our funds are extremely limited at the present time and I regret that I cannot give a hopeful answer in connection with an increase in salary or a grant in lieu of residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I note that you advised the parents of the closing of the school.\n\nThe action taken by you in this instance is approved, but, in future, you should endeavour to notify the local Indian Agent, as well as the parents, before closing school.

Q.\nThe Indian Country School,\nOka, P.Q., Aug. 25, 1926\n\nR\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter working for a year at the above school, I venture to suggest that the Department take under consideration making provision for the following things: In making these suggestions I have in view the fact that the people of the community are genuinely interested in all educational matters and it looks to me as if there will be considerable advance in the near future, and I am desirous that this advance shall be made along the broadest possible lines.\n\nMEDICAL INSPECTION: Can the Department arrange to have the children examined by a doctor or qualified nurse? An examination of this kind was recently made in a nearby school, by Dr. A. Prevost. It would be very satisfactory if the same doctor be employed for this school. I would suggest, however, that the examination be a thorough one, including examination of eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs. Unless the examination is thorough it would defeat its own purpose. Speaking roughly, it would seem to me that an examination along the lines generally given to applicants for admission to a residential school would be what is needed. I shall be very glad if the Department will consider this matter.\n\nINSTRUCTION IN SEWING: For some time I have been considering ways and means to give to the girl pupils instruction in sewing. Would it be possible for the Department to employ the services of Miss Myrtle Oke for this purpose? I would suggest that Miss Oke be asked to give one hour a week for this purpose, with a fair remuneration and provision for travelling from Oka Village to the country school. I have reason to believe that such provision would be very welcome to the parents and children. Miss Oke has had previous experience of this kind of work in one of the Indian residential schools in British Columbia.\nSEATING ACCOMMODATION: It would seem to be a wise course to supply to the school a different kind of desk for the scholars. At present they are supplied with double desks of an antiquated design, and in many cases not at all fitted to the size of the child. Most of these desks are throw-outs from another school which is now adequately equipped. At the country school there are all kinds of desks, all of an obsolete pattern, many of them broken, none of them fastened to the floor, and practically all the same size. It would be a very wise proceeding to install about two dozen single desks such as have been installed in the Oka Village school and in many other Indian schools of which I have knowledge. I would ask the Department to take this matter very seriously under consideration.\n\nI desire to emphasize that in making these requests I am not doing so without sufficient reason, and more particularly because I am sure that the people of the community are seized with the need for an advance, educationally, and that if properly guided and adequately equipped, the school will exercise a very great influence in the next few years.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. E. Eburne,\nTeacher\nOttawa, August 30, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to the programme at the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nThe question of medical inspection at day schools on Indian reserves has often engaged the attention of the Department. Our present practice is to make arrangements in this connection, only when the health and vitality of the pupils of the school in question are such that an examination is needed.\n\nI have noted your recommendation concerning the supplying of single seats, and wish to suggest that you requisition to the Indian Agent some time next year. At the present time our funds are completely assigned and I cannot authorize expenditure which is not provided for by Governor General's Warrant.\n\nWith reference to instruction in sewing, I would ask you to ascertain what would be the cost of having Miss Myrtle Oke undertake the work. You might send your statement to Mr. Indian Agent Harbour and ask him to attach his recommendation thereto before forwarding it to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. E. Eburne, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nOka Country Indian Day School,\nOka, P. Q.\nIndian Country School,\nOKA, Que.,\nSept. 6th., 1926.\n\nMr. F. Harbour,\nIndian Agent,\nOKA, Que.\n\nDear Mr. Harbour,\n\nIn a letter from the Department of Indian Affairs, dated August 30th. (Ref. 20-I-I.) I was asked to ascertain the cost of having Miss Myrtle Oke undertake to give instruction in sewing to the girls at the Country School. I was also instructed to forward this statement to you for you to attach your recommendation and to forward it to the Department.\n\nMy suggestion in the matter is that Miss Oke be paid the sum of $40.00 (Forty Dollars) a year for this work. I have made this suggestion to Miss Oke, and she is agreeable. The sum is arrived at by calculating on the basis of one dollar an hour for one lesson a week during a period of two hundred days. I think this is about the usual rate to teachers of special subjects not continuously employed.\n\nIn addition to this a further grant of about fifteen dollars a year would be necessary for the purchase of material, etc. I believe this is the custom at the Village School.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will forward this with your recommendation attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H. E. Eburne.\n\nTeacher.\nIndian Country School,\nOKA, Que.,\nSept. 6th., 1926.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRef. 20-I-I.\n\nI have your letter of August 30th., and I have to thank you for the consideration of the matters I brought to your attention.\n\nWith reference to the medical inspection that I suggested, since writing you I have received word from Mr. Agent Harbour that the doctor will be visiting the school one day this week to vaccinate those children who have not been vaccinated. It occurs to me that this would have been a good opportunity to carry out the medical inspection for which I asked, but as there will not be time between now and then to obtain your authorisation, we shall not of course proceed with the inspection. I could not make out any case for an inspection on the special grounds mentioned in your letter, but I think that a very good case could be made out on more general grounds, such as the undoubted guidance such an inspection would give, if properly followed up, both to parents and teacher. I shall be obliged if I may take this matter up with you again at some later date.\n\nI note your suggestion with regard to single seats for this school, and I will make the necessary requisition in the early part of next year.\n\nWith reference to instruction in sewing, I enclose a copy of a letter I have sent to Mr. Agent Harbour. He will, no doubt, be writing you shortly.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. E. Eburne.\nTeacher.\n\nEnclo.\nIndian Country School,\nOKA, Que.\nSept. 6th., 1926.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring the last twelve months I have, with the assistance of the Rev. J. J. Oke, gone very carefully into the situation in this settlement as far as the schools are concerned.\n\nI beg to submit the following statement:\n\nNumber of children of school age in the settlement: 86\nNumber of children attending school: (This is the total average attendance at both village school and country school combined) 35\n\nPercentage of children who should attend the Village School: ------------------------ 60%\nPercentage of children who should attend the Country School: ------------------------ 40%\n\nAverage attendance at the Village School in relation to the number of children of school age in its constituency,------------------------ 30%\n\nAverage attendance at the Country School, in relation to the number of children of school age in its constituency,------------------------ 60%\n\nThe above figures are based upon the position at the end of the June quarter. I have reason to believe that the number of children attending the schools will improve a little during the coming term.\n\nIt should be pointed out that there are a number of children who live in a part of the settlement from which it is at times exceedingly difficult to reach either of the schools without some method of transportation. There is, indeed, a\nMy good case for an additional school in this particular part of the settlement.\n\nAnother fact that enters into the situation is that there is coming into being a very decided \"school consciousness\" among the people. They are extremely interested in all school matters, and one is frequently met with the request that the children be sent away to school. As an indication of this decided interest it can be mentioned that at the Country School there has been since the opening of school on the Ist. inst. what is practically a hundred per cent attendance from its own constituency. The Village school will open to-morrow, and, I expect, will also see a decided increase in attendance.\n\nThe foregoing facts, together with other considerations which can be brought forward at a later time if required, seem to me to point very definitely in the direction of a consolidation at one point of all school work, with adequate provision for the transportation of pupils to and from school.\n\nThis appears to be the more desirable now that there is in the village a building which with certain alterations could be made into a very satisfactory consolidated school.\n\nTwo points seem to me to emphasise this need. One is that the growth in attendance at the schools is parallel with the necessity of taking up the work of the higher grades of the Public School course. When a school goes much beyond sixteen or seventeen pupils, it is a very difficult thing to do the work of the higher grades, and at the same time do efficient work in English in the lower grades. Of course I would not make this statement apply to all schools, but I think it does very definitely apply to schools like ours where the language difficulty has to be met.\n\nThe other point is this: it appears to have been the custom in the past to send away to school all children who reached Grade 5 standing. This has entailed a series of grants from the Department which will not be necessary if the work is done here. In this connection I should point out that there are quite a number of scholars now about to enter these higher grades. By teaching them here we are saving the Department the necessity of a grant, but I feel that the teaching here would be of far better a quality under a consolidated system. It can also be stated that the custom of sending children away is not only expensive to the Department but also to the parents.\n\nYou will, of course, understand that I am not looking forward to any immediate change, but I am asking whether the Department will give us the assurance that we may work towards this end. The advantage of at least a two roomed school with separate teachers for the Junior and Senior work, and with provision for teaching domestic and handicraft subjects seems very obvious.\nI do not think that the people of the settlement are ready for the change. It will be a matter both of education and demonstration before they really see its value. It is along these lines, though, that, if the Department gives us any encouragement, we can do a good deal of quiet preparatory work.\n\nThe extremely tentative nature of this letter has prevented me from putting the case at all fully, but I shall be quite glad to give any further information or to render any assistance in my power.\n\nI should add that I have not discussed this matter with anyone except the Rev. J. J. Oke, and Mr. Agent Harbour.\n\nI hope that the Department will not consider this letter at all presumptuous. It has been written solely because of the obvious need and the more obvious possibilities.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. E. Elburne\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, Sept. 13, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the general educational problem on the Oka reserve.

Harbour,\nIndian Agent,\nOKA, Que.\n\nDear Mr. Harbour,\n\nIn a letter from the Department of Indian Affairs, dated August 30th. (Ref. 20-1-1.) I was asked to ascertain the cost of having Miss Myrtle Oke undertake to give instruction in sewing to the girls at the Country School. I was also instructed to forward this statement to you for you to attach your recommendation and to forward it to the Department.\n\nMy suggestion in the matter is that Miss Oke be paid the sum of $40.00 (forty Dollars) a year for this work.

E. Elburne,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, September 22nd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the engaging of the services of Miss Myrtle Oke to instruct the girls of the Oka Country School in sewing.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Oke, and will allow her salary at the rate of $40 for the present academic year for this work. She is to give the girls lessons in sewing one hour each week at a time to be agreed upon by the teacher. Care should be taken to see that no unnecessary interference with the regular classroom duties is occasioned. Payment of Miss Oke's salary will be made at the end of each quarter upon receipt of vouchers from you, properly certified, for the amount due. Miss Oke should be ready to begin duties on or about the 1st of October, next.\n\nIt will, no doubt, be necessary to obtain some material for the sewing class, and you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $15 in the purchase of the supplies required. Before making the purchase, however, you should consult Miss Oke as to what she will require. You should also forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nIndian Country School,\nOKA, Que.,\nFebruary 22nd, 1927.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI desire to inform you that matters in connection with the above school are not as satisfactory as they have been.\n\nAs an indication, I may say that the average attendance at school is now only seventeen as compared with 27 two weeks ago, and it will probably drop a little lower yet.\n\nThere seems to be dissatisfaction with me partly because I am a servant of the Department, and partly because I desire to act impartially in my dealings with the children and the parents. The people seem quite unable to understand the latter attitude, while, as regards the former, I believe that you are fully cognisant of the difficulty of the situation.\n\nIt may illustrate the position to say that at a recent meeting of the parents objection was taken to my obtaining supplies and equipment for the school without previously consulting the band. (It should be understood that this has no reference to the properly elected council.) In reply to this objection, I suggested the appointment of a small advisory committee of parents to act with me. I was then asked if this committee could run the school entirely independently of the Department, and when I replied very definitely in the negative, the suggestion was refused. However, my apparent advocacy of the policy of the Department has brought about an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust.\n\nAnother difficulty has been that in a recent distribution of clothing grants from the Department, I acted with impartiality, and prepared a list of those who were actually in need. This has brought about obvious results, and I have had to put up with a good deal of nastiness.\nI am the more apprehensive because this kind of atmosphere often breeds minor grievances and complaints\u2014real and imaginary\u2014which can undo very much really hard work. This has already proved to be the case to some degree.\n\nI do not think there is anything in the situation that cannot be overcome with patience and a kindly and consistent firmness, but I feel it incumbent upon me to advise you of the existing tendency.\n\nI am also anxious, of course, to safeguard my work in the event of any complaints that may reach the Department, and at the same time hopeful that you will send me any instructions or advice that you would desire me to follow.\n\nI regret that I have had to trouble you in the matter.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.E. Burne\nTeacher.\nOttawa, February 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to certain school matters in connection with the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has noted the difficulty at present existing between the parents and yourself. The Department relies on you to use the utmost tact in all dealings with the Indian parents and agrees with you that there is nothing in the present situation that cannot be overcome with patience and a kindly and consistent firmness.\n\nWith reference to the supplies and equipment for the school, I would point out that all expenditure in connection with the operating of this school is provided by Parliamentary Appropriation and no part is chargeable to band funds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We have lost from our enrolment two or three children who are now receiving their education elsewhere, and one or two more are away for the time being, but I have no doubt that these latter pupils will return to school before long.\n\nI note your injunction to use the utmost tact in all dealings with the parents, and I will endeavour to do so.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nN.

I did not accede to their request because my time was taken up with other work. The request is being made again for next winter, and I am anxious to know what support the Department will give me if I undertake this work.\n\nI would suggest that the Department allows me to include in my requisition for supplies any additional supplies I may need for this work. I shall be quite willing to do the work without any additional remuneration, unless you should consider it permissible to give such remuneration, in which case I presume to suggest that this should be at the same rate as ordinary teaching work, viz., 75 cents an hour. I should be teaching in this extra work for about 4 hours a week.\n\nThe subjects to be taught would be only common school subjects, English, French, and practical arithmetic, and if I found that the work was not meeting with sufficient support I should discontinue it.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The purchase of two bracket lamps, to cost about not more than five dollars.\n2. The cost of coal oil.\n3.

Such notice will give the scheme something of an official, instead of a personal, character. For the purpose of this notice I may say that the school will be held on Tuesday and Friday evenings from 7.30 to 9.30.\nThe establishment of this school is part of a wider scheme of community work, and I am sure that, if I can make it successful, the Department will have reason to be satisfied that it has given its approval.\n\nI shall be very glad to have instructions from you in the matter, and shall also appreciate any information you may have of such work on other reserves.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, December 1st, 1927.\n\nNIGHT CLASSES.\n\nOka Country Indian Day School.\n\nThis is to certify that Mr. H.

I find your schools doing well and I would mention specially the work of Mr. Eboume, who has been doing a lot of patient, efficient teaching with a very slow-to-appreciate class of pupils. His results are very creditable, indeed, not only for what the pupils know of the work assigned them to do, but also for their lively interest in\nwhat they have been doing. This interest is evident in all branches of study and the pupils show all samples of their progress with smiles of delight and well they may for such samples are uniformly good.\n\nIt may be that you have a scale of salary increases, and only proceed accordingly, but I feel quite justified in bringing to your attention the merits of Mr. Ebenezer's work and giving your Dept. an opportunity to reward the worthy teacher for his faithful work.\n\nHis is a lonely position indeed, deprived of all society but his own, he even holds service on Sunday among these lonely people and thus further tries to lift them toward a better life.\n\nKindly receive my observations.\nin the spirit of co-operation and do what you can under the circumstances. I may say that I have said nothing to any person regarding this matter, which is and will continue to be solely in your own hands.\n\nMay I ask you once more to your kindness in sending your teachers to my conference in September. Their nearest conference will be held in La-Chute, i.e., 22 miles distant from Oka. It will cost them the price of a car for one day and permission to close their schools. I shall provide them meals and notify them of the date. Will you give them such instruction as they need re expenses? Yours truly,\n\nJ. W.

The girl found the teacher still in possession, and a girl pupil with him, as usual, and as she started to sweep the school he told her not to sweep or do anything and told her to get out. And when my daughter pointed to the two and asked him that it was her right to go the work and that his pupil and the girl pupil were the ones that should be expelled, he flew into a rage and he sent my daughter out of doors. Now he has been keeping this same girl pupil in after hours time and twice again last year and this year he was starting the same thing again. He comes to me often to tell me my girl...\nand told me that my name was on the school list and that the teacher was going to appoint me to help and that he had taken the work of cleaning the school away from me. He had done this without telling me the reason why so I asked him why my pay for the whole year.\n\nfrom Mrs. A. Jacobs\nIndian Country School,\nOka, Quebec,\nOctober 9th, 1928.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have today forwarded to you, through Mr. Indian Agent Harbour, a letter of complaint with reference to the conduct of the school janitor. You will doubtless receive this letter in due course.\n\nAs the janitor - Mrs. Angus Jacobs - has on several occasions, in matters unconnected with the school, taken various matters direct to the Department at Ottawa, I am writing to ask that if she adopts this course on this occasion and visits the Department, you will be good enough to uphold the authority of the teacher, - at least until such time as you receive my letter or the report of the Indian Agent.\n\nI have no desire that you shall pre-judge the case, but I know sufficient about matters here to know that the teacher needs every vestige of official support he can get.\n\nI shall very much appreciate this favour.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.

I quite understand that you may wish me to carry conciliation so far as to give way on almost anything so long as I can get the children to school, in which case I will loyally follow your wishes. On the other hand you may prefer to support me in a reasonable and just firmness of attitude which may bring better results in the long run.\n\nIf you prefer to support me in the latter attitude I beg to remind you that I have been sufficiently long in school work and among Indians to know how to act tactfully and I will not...\nI may add that I believe I have the solid support of 90% of the people, and that the attendance in school is better than ever.\n\nI really need guidance from the Department in this matter, and I shall be most grateful if it can be given. The present uncertainty is causing me considerable worry, and I find it most difficult to do the efficient work I desire to do.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. E. Elmore,\nTeacher.\nOct 10\n\nI am now writing to drop you a few lines to let you know that I have had some trouble with Mr. Irvine, the school teacher here at Oka Country School. He sent my daughter out of school without any cause. He also came over to my house and gave me some advice and told me that he has taken my child of the work and for me not to go there anymore. So I want to know just why had he done so? He said that he was busy and no one could help him. Now I want to know he has no right to say anything about the cleaning at my place. The work is short and dark at five o'clock, he can't keep and teach our girl all the time. I have her every night he keeps her. He keeps our tribe from working. I'll go to the Department and tell it just what I want you will understand it clearly.\nyour self. But I thought he was a man but now I don't think he is at all he said that if we would go and ask forgiveness he'd take the daughter back. But he has a right to do that for what he said is a lie and the best thing for him to do as to fix that matter with me before it goes on further with him I think it better for him to go over seas and not to take a Canadian place here there is a lot of badana girls or women to teacher in this place we don't want him no longer I do my work and don't want him to bother me when I can't go myself I sent my daughters and it's well done just the same her and I are one in our work.\n\nNow this all for now the rest will be told later on.\n\nI remain as ever your servant Mrs A F Jackson.\nIndian Country School,\nOka, Quebec.\nOctober 9th, 1928.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Schools,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret very much to report the most unusual and aggravating conduct of the school janitor at the above school. The janitor, I believe, is Mrs. Angus Jacobs, although it is her children who do the work.\n\nFor some time past these people have been acting in a very obtrusive manner, and endeavouring to annoy in a number of small ways, particularly regarding leaving undone small things which I ask to be done until they amount to larger jobs, which, if they are done at all, would require a day's work.\n\nThey are almost the only opponents of the teachers and do a great deal of talking against the school.\n\nThe latest method of annoyance consists of insisting that I vacate the school.\npromptly at four o'clock, and instructing their children to disobey my instructions to wait until I am ready. As I am in the habit of sometimes doing some extra work with my entire grade at this time I naturally resent their intrusion. Today, for example, I had to stand for deliberate impudence because I asked them to wait for a few minutes. They continued sweeping even as I was working.\n\nI have been very patient for a long while because they have two children attending school, and I knew they would keep their children from school if I took any action. In addition, as these people are very unpopular in the neighborhood, I did not wish to appear to add to their unpopularity.\n\nI have given considerable assistance in many ways to them and they have received many contracts from the Department, often on my recommendation.\n\nI would earnestly beg the Department to request these people to work in harmony with me, or else allow someone else to undertake their work.\nI think I may trust the Department to understand that I would not make such a report without much provocation, and only when the best interests of the school require it.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH. E. Oborne\nTeacher.\nOka, October 10th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am sending you herewith a report which was given to me by the Oka Country school teacher in regard with the janitor.\n\nI understand that a teacher might use the school house after class hours, as it is generally done in almost all schools.\n\nI allowed the teacher to keep the school room for his use every night if he wants until a quarter to five o'clock.\n\nI would then ask you to write a letter to the janitor or to myself, instructing the janitor not to begin his cleaning work before a quarter to five and also request him to work in harmony with the teacher.\n\nThis morning, Mrs. Jacobs, the janitor's wife reported me that the teacher had sent her daughter away from school; I will go to the school today and enquire about this complaint and make further report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arthur Barner, Superintendent of United Church Indian Missions, who visited Oka on the 15th instant. I asked him to give me what information he could, following his visit. His personal letter is now to hand, and he reports that the people are turning against Mr. Eburne somewhat. Mr. Barner writes in part as follows: \"I cannot see any reason for dismissing him at Christmas... but I do think the Department will be well advised to dispense with his services next June. I dislike to say this, for there are so many admirable qualities in the man; but I fear there will be continuous trouble ahead if he is continued longer than the present school year.\" Mr. Barner states that Mr. Eburne hopes to be married next year, in England, and is scheming to have his future wife appointed to the Village school. I believe this proposal should not receive the Department's favourable consideration.\nOttawa, October 19, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a report from the teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School, in connection with difficulty he is having with the janitor's family. Please inform Mr. Eburne that his letters directed to the Department have also been received, and you should inform Mrs. A. F. Jacobs that her letters have been given consideration. Mrs. Jacobs should be given to understand that Mr. Eburne is in charge of the Oka Country Indian Day School and that the janitor services must be performed to his satisfaction as well as your own. If the Jacobs family will not do as instructed, other arrangements will have to be made for the cleaning of the school. You should also inform her that her children should attend regularly and that they must be instructed to obey the teacher in all matters.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Eburne concerning the Department's instructions to Mrs. Jacobs, and you should tell him that the Department considers it unwise to give special coaching to girl Entrance pupils after the regular class hours.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P. Q.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe Chief Joe Bonaparte and Chief Paul Nelson are writing to the Department of Indian Affairs concerning Mr. Ebenezer our teacher whose work we are very pleased with.\n\nHe is a very good teacher in every way. He teaches all alike and does not mind staying after school to help those who are backward in their work. He is always willing to those who ask for his help even out of school hours. We are pleased with all Mr. Ebenezer's work.\n\nLast spring we wrote to the Department concerning Mr. Ebenezer. We wrote because we were pleased with his teaching. The work for us is of the best. Again we are writing expressing our full satisfaction of his teaching and good works.\nAnother thing we want to say is the trouble and accusation against Mr. Ebene caused by Angus Jacot. This latter man is not chosen by the people because he is not a man to work for the school nor the church. We have plenty of well-able men who live in Oka and belong here, natives of Oka, not forty people from Muskoka who have no business to hold any positions here. Besides, Angus Jacot was not chosen by the people only by a few who belong to the same forty tribe. We chiefs are the ones to choose who into do the works of the school. Also we the natives of this place are the ones to run our business not people from Muskoka who have no business here at all. If we can't do what we like here without being interrupted by Angus Jacot, he best go back to his native\nplace. Because he doesn't belong here, he is always trying to meddle into our affairs. We like and appreciate our teacher so let Angus Jacobs go and meddle with the affairs of Muskoka, and let us do what we pleased as Oka belongs to us not to the people of Muskoka.\n\nIf you want the names of the people who like the work of Mr. Church, we will forward it. Also the chiefs are all against Angus Jacobs and all in favour of Mr. Church. Anything that is said against the latter are all false.\n\nWe want and we know its right the best thing for us.\n\nWe want you to tell Angus Jacobs to let go off all the position he holds in the school to let it all go. We don't want him to have anything more to do in\nWe have Mr. Joseph Simon, a native of Oka and a straightforward forward man and who is voted by the people and our chiefs to be the caretaker of the school.\n\nWe want you to straighten things up as soon as possible. We want the right: We won't have Oka run by any natives of Oka. We, the ones, the family inhabitants of Oka that the Department of Indian Affairs is to listen to.\n\nWe would be glad to hear from you soon and the good results.\n\nWe wait for your answer.\n\nWe would be much obliged if you will listen to us chiefs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Joe Bonaparte,\nChief Paul Nelson.\nOttawa, October 22, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication, signed by Joe Bonapille and Paul Nelson, in which they indicate the majority of the Indians are satisfied with the services of Mr. Eburne. They request that another janitor be appointed at the Oka Country Indian Day School. You may inform these Indians that their letter has been received and the contents noted by the Department. If you consider that a change should be made in the janitor services, I know you will make a report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF.

Laziness and idleness are to be condemned.\n2. Every man should work for everything he gets.\n3. To receive things without working for them is objectionable.\n4.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received an application from Miss Vera Simons for a position as teacher on the Oka Reserve. As you are, no doubt, aware, Miss Simons taught the Oka Village School from September 1st to October 31st, 1922. This Department has no information as to why she gave up duties after teaching only two months. Miss Simons has a good academic training, but has no professional qualifications. She was formerly in deaconess work, but lately has been engaged in Y.W.C.A. work in London, Ont. There will be a vacancy for a teacher at the Oka Country School for the next school year.\n\nYou will, no doubt, be aware as to her services at the Oka Village School during the brief period she taught there and also the reason for her giving up the work, and I shall be pleased to hear from you as soon as possible regarding her services when at Oka and whether you are of the opinion that she would be a suitable teacher for the Country School for next year. Any information you can furnish regarding Miss Simons will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. J. Oke,\nOka,\nP.

The Department is considering her for the Oka Country Indian Day School, and I am today writing the Rev. Mr. Oke for his recommendation.\n\nBest wishes for a successful summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Arthur Barnet,\n97 Craigieburn Ave.,\nToronto 12.\n\nDear Mr. Barnet\u2014\n\nOne of our deaconesses, Miss Vera Simons, is anxious to secure a position of teacher in the Indian School at Oka, Que. I believe that Mr. Oke is also hoping that she may be given this appointment. They have asked me to write you of Miss Simon's qualifications for Church work.\n\nMiss Simons is a graduate of the former Methodist Training School, where she spent two years. Before entering the Training School she had done a considerable amount of study, taking courses at Public and Continuation School and at Albion College. She had some study in Art and Music and received teacher's certificates in both of these subjects. On graduation Miss Simons was admitted to the Deaconess Order and has held a number of positions including a year's work in the Mission School at Oka. She has been for the longest period in Travellers' Aid work under the I.W.C.A., where she has been I believe very successful. Miss Simons had considerable experience in teaching prior to her course at the Training School and has also had the advantage of travel in Europe.\n\nMr. Oke will know of Miss Simon's qualifications for this particular position. I can speak only in a general way of her character and ability. She has an attractive personality and seems to be possessed of the ability necessary for success in Church work of this kind. As she is anxious to return again to a position under the United Church of Canada, I am hoping that she may secure this particular appointment. She is deeply interested in the department of the Church's work which you represent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWinnifred Thomas\nExecutive Secretary.\n\nT/H.\nLACHINE, P.Q.\n59 LaSalle Street,\nJune 21st, 1929.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Oka Country School.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter No. 20-1-1 dated June 17th, and in reply I may say that Miss Vera Simons taught two months in the Village School in the year 1922 and seemed a very efficient teacher. She impressed me as being a very highly cultured and well educated lady. She fitted into the work as only a few can, moreover, I thought she was highly gifted as a leader.\n\nI am under the impression that the Chairman of the Montreal District, at that time, released her to enable her to go to Italy. It was thought by him that it was an opportunity that she could ill afford to lose. She did not return to the work because there was no opening for her, much as she wanted to enter our work again. I have no doubt she will fit into the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As soon after the first of September as convenient, you should report to Oka for duty, provided you have been able to secure suitable living accommodation, after correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Harbour.

FOR FILE:\n\nI have examined the old files which have reference to the beginning of the OKA COUNTRY Indian Day School, and I find that two members of the Band each gave a part of a lot to the Department of Indian Affairs and the Methodist Church for a mission and the school. It is probable that the first building, which was erected in 1880, was constructed by the members of the Band, assisted by the Department from Band funds or other monies and by the Methodist Church. In 1897, when there was practically a reconstruction, $100 only was charged to Band Funds, the rest being taken from Vote. In 1912, there was a further reconstruction and the funds were taken from Vote.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will, I think, shortly receive a letter from the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society making enquiries with reference to my abilities in educational matters. Quite unexpectedly there has come to me an opportunity to work in educational matters under the Government of Gambia, and the appointment is made through the above named missionary society.\n\nI have naturally given the Department a reference for I have worked for no one else for a long time, and I shall be very greatly obliged if the Department will reply to the society's letter as favourably as possible.\n\nThe appointment under consideration has to do with the training of teachers and the organisation of elementary education. The society is therefore desirous to know, chiefly, I think, whether I am abreast of modern educational thought and whether I have shown knowledge of educational matters while under your direction.\n\nThe Department has been good enough in letter\nto me to write quite favourably in this respect and I have told the Society that I prefer to stand or fall by the Department's report upon my educational knowledge. I think that the Superintendent of Indian education will very fully bear out any claim I might make to ability in this particular direction.\n\nMay I remind the Department that during the thirteen years I have worked under its direction, my recommendations have often been favourably considered and I have been allowed considerable freedom, while there have been times when I have been of some slight service in giving information on educational matters. I hope, very respectfully, that this will not be considered an exaggerated claim.\n\nAny recommendation that the Department is good enough to give to the Missionary Society will be very grateful acknowledged.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.

The principal thing is that the Indians here would like a man teacher.\n\nI must tell that the teacher could not teach as she could have done, on account of the school having started very late last fall, and I would find it only fair to the teacher, in letting her teach another year.\n\nAs to the two French girls, I beg to say that Miss Simons has with her two young girls, one from Mount-Laurier, Quebec, and another from Montreal. These two girls are relatives to the teacher and are living with her in the school house, and also attend school. This case gives the Indians a ground of complaint, and perhaps would it be good to let the teacher know it.\n\nAs to say that this Miss does not know how to teach I beg to say that the writers of the letter to the Department are very poor judges in education, to have any weight.\n\nI am returning you herewith the petition and I think that Miss Simons is well qualified to teach school on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, August 14th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to Miss Simons, the teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School. The Department considers that she is doing good work and there is no intention of making a change at the present time. With reference to the two French girls who are living with her at the present time, I may say that they are good company for the teacher. Their presence in the classroom should have a good effect on the Indian pupils rather than otherwise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Simon K. Simon,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, August 14th, 1930.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has received a petition signed by certain Indians which has reference to your services at the Oka Country Indian Day School. Serious consideration is not being given to the complaints but I write to inform you of the matter so that you can bend every energy towards the elimination of whatever misunderstandings may arise.\n\nIt is stated that two girls are living with you in the residence who are not members of the band. The Department has no objection to one girl for company and, of course, she may attend classes in the school, but I believe that a second outsider might be considered unnecessary. You should give this a little thought and, if one of the girls can be returned to her home at your convenience, it might be advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Vera Simons,\nTeacher,\nIndian Country School,\nOka, Que.\nDear Sirs:\n\nAt a meeting held by the parents of the children attending the Oka Indian Country School.\n\nThe meeting was held because of the teacher's work being not satisfactory. And the answer to our request of August 14th. The Government think that Miss Simon's work is quite alright and a change is unnecessary.\n\nThe Government does not see the fault of the teacher. We see it every day, and we know what is good and what is not for our own good. Why did she refuse to teach the 12 children all of them school age and who have no means of obtaining education any other way but going to the school which the Government went to so much expense to build, and now these children can't go?\n\nWe are sure the big building wasn't built for kindergarten classes. Most of the said twelve are in Part II, none of them are finished the Public School Work. The only reason we can find is that she is not able to teach.\nclass any higher than Part II. Also she is very nervous and worse than all she is lazy. The children often see her asleep.\n\nWe might say things went just as far as Mr. H. E. Eburne left off and no further. The children were learning very well and with good results. Since Miss W. Simon's started there hasn't been any results. They just go over the same thing every day, and waste the children's time since she started.\n\nWe are writing that Miss Simon go away right away. We don't want her to try to teach our children. We won't send them while she's here. We want a teacher a man teacher. Somebody with the knowledge of teaching who has the experience of a teacher not a have-aller's aid. We want somebody like Mr. Eburne who managed everything. We kept an eye on the children inside and outside when they are playing. Now Miss Simon says she has no business outside, that is why Mr. Simon & Simon's apples are all gone, no one is outside to watch the children what they are doing.\n\nWe know that's not the rule when we\nsend our children to school they are under\nthe teacher's control and it is her duty to\nwatch them.\n\nThe ones that think her work is satisfac-\ntory have no children and therefore have\nno say in the management of the school.\nWho are always contrary. We who have chil-\ndren and want our children educated are the\nones who have the business to say what\nwe think and we Indians have a govern-\nment to do what we request and to\nfulfil our requirements.\n\nAnother, Mr Joseph Bonsfield's two boys\nwho aren't through our country School yet\nhave to go to Hudson to school because\nMiss Simon won't have them children at\nleast have a right to our Indian schools\ntill they are sixteen.\n\nWhat's the reason? The only reason we\ncan think of, is she is not able to teach\ntheir grade; but how are the ones who haven't\nthe means, what are they going to do and\nwe who now are interested in the welfare of\nour children.\n\nNow we will ask you Sirs; what are the\ntwelve said children, who are turned out of school going to do? What school will they go to? Will the Department pay for the education of these children if they attend another school? Because they are human not animals, they have to be taken into consideration.\n\nIf the Department is not willing to pay all these expenses, which is unnecessary if we had a decent teacher. Please send us a man with a teacher's degree and all well behaved. If you white people had Miss Simon teaching in your schools you wouldn't have hole long so will. You please send her away right away and send us a man teacher somebody like Mr. O'Burne. Why waste money, our money to pay her when she is not doing work to be worthy of a payment. We are sure that you are clever enough to understand what we want because is very easy to understand.\n\nUnderstand Sir's we don't want her here anymore because she is not fit to be a teacher. The next thing, In school we learn\nabout health, it is not very healthful to be in a bedroom; her residence does not seem big enough to hold her French family, so they sleep in the schoolroom. Why do the Department like to give to Indians things that are no good? Why do they like to worry and torment little Indians?\n\nAs friend to friend, we beg you, Sirs, to use justice and peace in what we ask you and use your very best judgement. We sincerely beg you to grant our request. We are not troublesome whenever we are done a good turn. We never made any trouble when Mr. Burne was here, because he was doing good work for us, and we were pleased with all his kind doings. The reason we did not send this complaint before is because Miss Simons made known that she was leaving, that she could not teach. She claimed that she got into the routine after Easter but to us she is not in the routine of teaching yet.\n\nThe last thing when the Easter report...\nfrom the Department came in March, the end of the school year, she was not able to fulfill all the questions. Evelyn Simon very kindly helped her. She didn't even know how much coal was brought to the school, very small matters she could not answer herself; and it said on the report sheets - \"A teacher that cannot answer all these questions is unfit to be a teacher\" or such words to that effect.\n\nSo we beg you to comply to our requests and fulfill it as quickly as possible as our children want to go to school this term.\n\nRequest of the Parents of the Oka Indian Country School:\n\nPlease send the answer to,\nChief Simon N. Simon,\nOka P.O.,\nQuebec,\nCanada.\n\nTo Thos. A. Starewsky.\nOttawa, September 10, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, relative to the services of Miss Vera Simons, teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Departments understands that Miss Simons is performing her duties satisfactorily, and we are not prepared at the present time to consider the making of any change in the teacher at this school. I would point out that the full cost of Miss Simons' salary and the other expenses in conducting this school are paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education and no charge is made against Band Funds in the carrying on of the work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Simon K. Simon,\nOka, P.Q.\nOttawa, September 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nTravelling Nurse Cousins reports that a few older pupils at the Oka Country Indian Day School have been refused admission. Miss Simons spoke to Mr. Ferrier in this connection and I am not sure just what decision was reached. You might make enquiries concerning the Indian children who wish to attend school and who have been refused admission, and let the Department have a report and recommendation. You might also investigate other causes in connection with the unpopularity of Miss Simons. If the feeling of the Indians is interfering seriously with the attendance at the school, it might be necessary to consider a change. The Department wishes you to give this serious consideration and to make an early report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P.Q.\nOttawa, September 18th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nPursuant to my letter of the 16th instant regarding complaints that reached the Department concerning Miss Simons, teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School, I have now to inform you that the Department has decided to hold an investigation. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, will be at the Oka Country School at two o'clock daylight saving time or one o'clock standard time on Wednesday next, the twenty-fourth instant, and wishes to meet yourself, Miss Simons and all parents of children of school age that should be attending the Country School. Please inform as many of the Country Indians as possible and post a notice on the school door as soon as you receive this letter. I may say that it is not intended to have Indians other than parents or guardians of children of school age in the vicinity attend the meeting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, September 18th, 1930.\n\nMadam,\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, copy of official letter of today's date to Mr. Indian Agent Harbour. Several complaints have recently reached the Department concerning your services and it is the intention of Mr. Ferrier to have an investigation so that the Department can get as near the truth concerning conditions as possible.\n\nYou will please dismiss school on Wednesday, the 24th, at noon and leave the schoolroom and one other room free for the investigation in the afternoon. Your presence is required during the investigation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Vera Simons,\nTeacher,\nCountry Indian School,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, September 18th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to inform you that the Superintendent of Indian Education will be at the Oka Country Indian Day School at two o'clock daylight saving time (one o'clock standard time) on Wednesday, the twenty-fourth instant, for the purpose of holding an investigation into the unpopularity of Miss Simons, teacher of the school. Will you please inform Mrs. Ernest Simon and Miss Evelyn Simon, who visited the Department today in this connection. Will you, also, make known to all parents of children who should attend this school that they are urged to be present at the investigation? Indians other than parents or guardians of school age children are not required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Mitchell Cole,\nOka, Que.\nSend the following Day Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nRev. Dr. R. B. COCHRANE,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nContinued complaints and petitions concerning services of Miss Simon Steacher of Oka Country Indian Day School have reached the Department -STOP- Mr. Ferrier will visit Oka Wednesday afternoon next for the purpose of investigating - STOP- Would your board consider instructing Reverend Mr. Oke who is familiar with conditions to represent the Missionary Society on that occasion.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I will have the school house and residence at your service on Wednesday, Sept. 24, as requested.\n\nI regret very much that any unpleasantness should have arisen. But since the circumstances are what they are, I appreciate the investigation being made at the seat of the trouble.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVera Simons\nMr. R. T. Ferrier\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nAs stated in any other letter of the same date, I appreciate an investigation being made here.\n\nThere are some things I have wanted to talk with you about, but hope that things would smooth out without troubling you.\n\nThe present difficulty originated I believe with Eva Simms, daughter of the former janitor. They continued during the weeks in September. I clean the building after four o'clock and they came in the morning.\n\nOne the morning of Friday Sept 6th I remarked that there seemed to be some misunderstanding and suggested that we see Mr. Harboer. She went out but came back bringing her aunt Simms who was apparently bent on quarreling. I refused to stand.\n\nEva accused me of turning children out of school and ordered...\nGenesis Nelson. I replied \"I will not quarrel.\" Genesis is the only one of the twins whose names were mentioned when I visited your office last spring, who has wanted to come back to school this year. His people took it well and kept his sister in school.\n\nGenesis is this fall; has been in school regularly over five years and is still in Part IV. His habits are not good and I consider him an evil influence in the school.\n\nWhen Eva and Mrs. Earnest Simon said they would not quarrel, they left here and got busy among the people. Then Drang the fell at 9 o'clock there were no children here. I stayed at the desk. About 9.20 Mrs. Gabriel and Mrs. Nicholas came with their children to find out if it were true that there was no school, as they had been told so by Eva and Louis Simon. While they were there Martha (Genesis sister) came. She had heard the fall. Paul Simon's little girl came at noon.\n\nLast June I talked with the girls about not coming to school this year, and insisted taking up the sewing, cooking and other work I want to teach the school and C.H.I.T., together.\nThey seemed to be pleased. One mother also regarded it as a good thing.\n\nI am quite sure that the matter of their not attending daily would have caused no trouble but for Eva Simon, who wished to make trouble and choose that as a talking point. I believe they hold that if the children are kept from coming to school they can then be rid of the teacher.\n\nI am sorry to be a disturbing element, let I hope, and am giving my best them any best.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nEva Simon.\n\nP.S. I have just learned that Eva Simon has hopes of securing the position as teacher of the country school.\n\nV.E.S.\nSeptember 20th,\n1930.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nYour telegram with regard to conditions existing at the Oka Country Indian Day School was received yesterday afternoon. Acting on your suggestion, I immediately wired Rev. J. J. Oke, asking him to arrange to meet Mr. Ferrier at the school on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nI hope that Mr. Ferrier will be successful in finding a way out of the difficulties which have arisen and that Mr. Oke may be of service to him in his investigations.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nMLT.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lack of supervision during play hours (Mrs. Rivers).\n2. Those over 14 told they may stay home (Joe Bonspiel's 2 boys)\n3. Clara Martin sent home June 14th for trivial reason.\n4. She makes older girls teach juniors.\n5. Unfair punishment for Laura Martin for writing obscene words on desk.\n6. Two French girls living in the school residence and attending classes.\n7. Teacher does not know how to teach - no results since last teacher left.\n8. Teacher is nervous, not strong and sometimes goes to sleep in class - perhaps lazy.\n9. Simon K. Simon's apples all stolen.\n10. French children sleep in the classroom.\n11. Miss Simons said she was leaving at the end of June, so complaints did not come in earlier.\n12. Evelyn Simons had to help her make out her report.\n13. The general complaint of the Janitor.\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nAfter close study and observation of the situation in the Country School I discovered that the complaint had no reference to Miss Simmons' character or her ability as teacher.\n\nThe trouble is a keen sense of frustration.\n\nIt was thought Miss Simmons' health would never stand the strain of the work and would eventually resign as a result. It was hoped then that one of her own would be appointed but events proved otherwise. Added to the disappointment the Caretaker's services were dispensed with and all this affecting the same family. Then came the decision of the Dept. that pupils at the age of fifteen or over and backward in their studies should be graduated from school. Thus the sense of frustration spread almost over the entire community.\n\nThe pupils and parents had hoped that by returning to school for a short while in the fall they would be granted clothing boots and so forth. The majority of whom as a rule never returned to school after receiving them.\nunder these circumstances it was quite natural to blame somebody. They might have blamed the Agent, Mr. Harbour or myself with so much truth behind the complaint as against Miss Simcoe. She became the victim though no fault of hers.\n\nOnce a few of them suffered a sense of frustration it was quite easy for the feeling to spread by contagion and suggestion and sympathy.\n\nI have had a talk with some of the most interested I saw the futility of argument when the emotions were so aroused. The feelings can only be overcome by letting them see the facts of the case. Only then can we hope the people to react normally again.\n\nI am giving you my observations for what they are worth.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The Reverend Mr. Oke, representing your Society, was present, and it was decided that the difficulties at this school were a little too much for the present teacher, Miss V. Simons. She understands the situation herself and is quite ready to be transferred to some other post. The Department is seriously considering a new teacher for the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School, and Mr. Oke is of the opinion that she would do well there. Her qualifications and experience are such that I am satisfied she can do good work in another Indian community.\n\nI write now to suggest that your office nominate someone for the Oka country School. I believe a man would have a better chance for success than a lady teacher. Is there someone already in our service who could be transferred there? Miss Simons should leave as soon as possible, so I urge immediate consideration. If you suggest someone already in our work and a new teacher could be easily secured for his post, then Miss Simons could go to Caughnawaga to teach the young children. In the meantime, the Department will give some thought to the vacancy at Oka and you will receive a further communication.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Miss Simons should leave as soon as possible, so I urge immediate consideration. If you suggest someone already in our work and a new teacher could be easily secured for his post, then Miss Simons could go to Caughnawaga to teach the junior children.

If your opening had been in the province of Ontario I would have accepted it. I was talking to the Public School Inspector here and he advised me that if the school had been in Ont. it would likely have counted as years taught on the Ontario Superannuation fund and that teaching in Quebec would not likely be counted.

This post demands a man of experience and tact. There is a new teacher's residence there, which is furnished and heated by the Department. A salary of from $800 to $1,000 per academic year, depending on the qualifications of the incumbent, will be paid.\n\nIf you know of any teacher who would like this position, I should be grateful if you would telegraph, collect. The vacancy at this school should be filled as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Principal,\nMacdonald College,\nSte. Anne de Bellevue,\nP. Q.\n13th October, 1930.\n\nMr. J.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter addressed to the Principal, Macdonald College has been handed to me. In reply, I regret to state that there are no male teachers available at this time of the year. All Protestant teachers make engagements in the spring for the following year.\n\nIn the Province of Quebec, school contracts are yearly contracts, terminating on the 1st June. Therefore, all school boards and all teachers making changes make up their minds, and enter into new contracts long before that date. For this reason, it is impossible to get teachers after the 1st June. I would, therefore, advise your Department to follow at Oka the procedure of the rest of the Province, and engage teachers in the spring, when they are available.\n\nYou state that you desire a male teacher of experience and tact at a salary of $600 to $1000 per annum, together with a heated apartment.\n\nIn reply, I may say you are very unlikely to get any male teacher, with a Protestant diploma at any rate, to accept this position at this small salary. I do not think in fact that you are likely to get any applications from any Protestants, as better positions and higher salaries are available in our regular schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDean.\nOttawa, October 30, 1930:\n\nSir:\n\nPlease inform those interested that the Department has finally secured the services of a suitable teacher for the Oka Country Indian Day School. I am not sure yet what date he will arrive to take over his new duties but will let you know in the early future. It will be in about two weeks' time. I am writing Miss Simons today, advising her that you should inform any interested Indians in the Country section of the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, November 4, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nThere is an official letter going forward today to Mr. Indian Agent Harbour, concerning the new teacher at the Oka Country Indian Day School. Mr. Albert Smith will take up his new duties on the 11th instant. You should transfer to Caughnawaga this week-end. Rev. Mr. Oke and the Rev. A. J. Macdonald, of Lachine, will give you any assistance that they can. The Department is considering securing a second classroom and will have to rent a building which was formerly used for school purposes. I believe it better for you to board than to live alone in the upper part of this building, but you can be guided by your own wishes and the advice of those interested. Mr. Letourneau, the Indian Agent for Caughnawaga (his address is St. Constant, Que.), has been informed of your appointment and is looking into the advisability of renting the building in question for use as a second classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Smith has been appointed. He will commence his new duties on the 11th instant. Please inform Miss Simons without delay that she should arrange to move to Caughnawaga this next week-end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nDept. Indian Education.\n\nDear sir:\n\nI wish to consult you with regard to the\nbole children. These children have always attended the County\nIndian School (or at least during the three years I have\nbeen at Oka). Now they wish to attend the Village\nSchool, under the pretense that it is nearer. Their home\nis situated about mid-way between the two schools.\n\nNow, Mr. Smith and I both feel that it\nwill be detrimental to the discipline of both schools\nif these children are allowed to attend the Village\nSchool. It is simply a rule to avoid submitting\nto Mr. Smith's discipline and if they carry their\npoint others may wish to follow their example and\nwe shall be at the mercy of every rebellious child's\ncaprice.\n\nAlso, I may add that I have thirty-one on the\nroll with an average of about twenty-seven and three\nmore children will crowd us inconveniently.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nB. Tupper\nOka Village Indian School\nOttawa, November 26, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the Cole children, pupils of the Country School on the Oka Reserve, who now wish to attend the Village School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department cannot grant permission for these children to transfer from the Country to the Village School. It is expected that these children will continue regularly in attendance at the Country School, and Mr. Agent Harbour is being requested to see that the parents are so informed. You may refuse their admission to the Village School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. B.

The Department considers, in the interest of discipline, that these children should continue in attendance at the Country School. You will please advise the parents accordingly and see that these children attend regularly at the Country School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

Smith\nCountry Indian Day School,\nOka, Que., Feb., 6th., 1934.\n\nThe Superintendent,\nIndian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:-\n\nLast fall when the agent, Mr. F. Brisbois, gave news of there being no distribution of clothing, a few families provided their children with clothing. These children came regularly last fall and are still doing so, weather permitting. Since Christmas Mrs. S. Nicholas wrote to the Dept. and got clothing for their children. These children did not come regularly last fall and they have never come this year. I am of the opinion that since these children have been provided for, the ones who are coming regularly should be treated likewise. Their clothing and footwear is not so good for this cold weather. I want you to understand that I am not in favour of giving clothing to the children. Those who really want their children to have an education will provide for them, and anyway 80% of those who get the clothing do not attend school, as in the case of the Nicholas family. Your Dept. does exceptionally well when it provides books, etc., but since the one family has been helped, the others should be also. I believe in either no distribution or a distribution to all, as the one family is as well off as the other here.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that your council here, the chief of which is Harry Oke, has been purposely withholding the distribution of clothing of those children who are regular in attendance. It has also been the cause of the discontinuance of the mid-day bowl of soup which all the children need as they come from a distance of from one half to three miles to school. In this connection I would like to inform you that it has been done with an end in view. Harry Oke has a sister who he wishes to have appointed teacher here. Last spring this council reported me to the Department as closing school early in the afternoon. This was a falsehood as can be proved by my wife and myself. It was done with the same purpose in view, and several people were asked to report me for imagined misdemeanours so that I should be asked to resign.\nBy this means he also stands a chance of being appointed Truant Officer. I may say that a local truant officer would be of no use here. That has been tried before and it did not work. I would like to suggest that the Dept. write to the defaulting parents and warn them. Then if that did no good, a Provincial could be sent once a month, get my report and visit the parents concerned. These parents say that they have nothing against me and they always promise to send their children to school any time that I ask them. But the children never arrive. As the attendance is the lowest it has ever been I advise some steps be taken by the Department.\n\nFurther, I have pretty good proof that Mr. Whitebean, the minister, has said that this is my last year here because I do not have a Sunday School. When I came here I looked over previous Sunday School records and found them far from favourable, and as there was a Sunday School in the village, I saw no reason for it here. Last winter I consulted with Dr. Barner on this topic and he agreed with me. Mr. Whitebeans tried it last fall and it fell flat. Of course the minister wants his daughter to have the position here. Mine seems to be a heavenly task when so many covet it.\n\nI should like to know if it is really necessary for the people to have prayer meetings in the school here twice a week. On Thursday afternoon we lose 10 or 15 minutes gathering up the books, pencils, erasers etc., getting ready for services in the evening. Friday we lose the same amount of time distributing them in the morning. Then we collect them again at night and give them out Monday morning. We lose nearly an hour a week in this way and we have a short enough day as it is, especially when I have an Entrance class.(Grade VII). There have been two seats broken, hymn books torn in two, and obscene words and pictures written in them. They are continually scratching their names on the desks with nails and pins. I have coaxed, warned, and threatened. I have reported it to the agent but it still continues.\n\nCan you advise me what I can do to prevent the damaging of the school property at these meetings.\n\nSome time ago I sent in a requisition for books, etc. I have received the envelopes asked for. Is it your intention to let me have the books asked for?\n\nI am studying extra-murally for my Ontario First class certificate. May I have time off in June to write these examinations somewhere else in Ontario?\n\nI am enclosing a report of parents and pupils with a note on each one. Thanking you for your courtesy and awaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nOka, February 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant enclosing a communication received at Ottawa from Mr. A. E. Smith of Oka in which the teacher deals with different subjects. As requested by yours I submit you a report and return the letter herewith.\n\nMr. Smith claims that last Fall when I gave news that there would not be any general clothing distribution a few families provided their children with clothing. According to the teacher these children are attending regularly when weather permits. Mr. Smith seems to be displeased because some children who have been supplied with shoes etc., are not attending regularly and he gives as example the case of Mrs. Samuel Nicolas' children who are not regular at School after having been provided with clothing. Mr. Smith is of the opinion that the children attending regularly should be treated like the Nicolas and he believes in a distribution to all or nothing at all.\n\nRelative to the above mentioned statements by the teacher I beg to say that I do not agree on every point with him. I am against a general distribution of clothing to the children because when it takes place we help every child regardless of the fact that a good number of them are not very needy and also because the parents would not supply anything to their children in future, even if they could afford to, as they are inclined to rely only on the Dept. for everything they need, but I am in favor of considering each case individually taking into consideration the circumstances and the needs of every particular case. In December 1930 a general distribution was made for all the Indian children attending the Schools at Oka. This necessitated an expense of over $900 and the attendance was lower than last year 1933 when not more than $175.00 was spent for these same pupils.\n\nIn connection with the case of Mrs. S. Nicolas I beg to refer you to my letter 64-20 dated January 16th last. Because these children who were in need were supplied with shoes and did not go to School after is not a reason to supply those going regularly and not in need of clothing nor footwear.\n\nThe teacher also informs you that the Council and especially Harry Oke have been withholding the distribution of clothing and is also the cause of the discontinuance of the mid-day lunch. He claims that Oke is working his way to have his sister appointed at his place etc. Mr. Smith claims that the report made by the council last Spring pertaining to the early closing of the School was a falsehood. The teacher also reports that Mr. Whitehead is supposed to have said.\n\nIn reply to this I beg to say that the teacher's statement relative to H. Oke is apt to give you the impression that your Agent is influenced by some Indians when making reports and recommendations. The recommendations against a general distribution of clothing to the children and for the discontinuance of the mid-day lunch\nwere not made by the Council nor H. Oke but solely by myself as Agent and without consulting any of the Councillors. I do not need any Indians to advise me as to reports and recommendations as I am aware of my responsibilities.\n\nRelative to the Council resolution last Spring against the early closing of the School I beg to let you know that this protest was founded and that the School was closed too early in the afternoon.\n\nMr. Smith does not seem to be in very good terms with Rev. Mr. Whitebean and H. Oke, but as this has not anything to do with the affairs of this Agency I do not want to have anything to do with it. As to Mr. Smith's statement that several persons are after his position I beg to say that it is the first time I hear about it. This man seems to pay too much attention to gossip.\n\nThe teacher also asks you as to the necessity of the prayer meetings at the School. He claims that the children are losing at least one hour a week on account of that and that the Indians make damages in the class. The aim of the teacher, who is also the janitor, in reporting this is to have the meetings stopped by the Department. I have often visited the School and I have noticed that the class where the meetings are held are not more damaged than any other class where there is not any gatherings. I have often been approached by Mr. Smith to make recommendations to the Dept. in order to prevent these prayer meetings at the Country School.\n\nIf, to please the teacher, the Department was ordering the discontinuance of the prayer meetings at the School, it would certainly bring some protestations from the Board of the Church and would also give ground to very unpleasant publicity. The majority of the Indians belonging to the United Church are living in the country near the School, and it is more convenient for them to go there for the meetings during the week than to come to the Church located in the Village, four miles from the School. The less we interfere with religious matters the better it is.\n\nAs to the time Mr. Smith the teacher claims the children are loosing I do not see why this is allowed by him, as Mr. Smith the teacher should teach until four o'clock in the afternoon and after four Mr. Smith the janitor should fix everything up himself for the meetings. The only reason for such a complaint from Mr. Smith is that it gives him a little more work as janitor being obliged to sweep the floors after each meeting.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, February 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, reporting on the communication recently received by the Department from Mr. A. E. Smith, teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nPlease advise Mr. Smith that the Department received his letter of the 6th instant and that we are not prepared at the present time to direct that the prayer meetings held at the school be discontinued.\n\nYou may also inform the teacher that the Department is satisfied with the arrangements that have been made regarding the distribution of clothing.\n\nIf Mr. Smith continues to perform his duties as teacher satisfactorily, he need not be afraid that he will lose his position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith the resolutions passed at the meeting of the Okn Elected Council held on the 7th instant for the month of March 1934. The members present were Harry Oke, Willie Cree and Laurence Etienne.\n\nIt was proposed by Harry Oke and seconded by Willie Cree; that the Dept be asked to investigate the way the Country School is conducted by the actual teacher Mr.A.E.Smith. This Council is of the opinion that the attendance is very low at this School owing to improper methods of teaching; the teacher does not encourage the children attending the School. We, the Councillors, claim that recently one pupil, Walter Martin, received bruises on the back from the teacher and previous to this there has been several similar cases; we also claim that the teacher locks the class-room doors and that some children have been kept from attending the toilets the result of this being that some pupils have wet themselves in class. The teacher has impressed the people that he is not working for their welfare but for his own. We find by the children that he has not made any progress in educating and teaching them. He has found to be inclined to laziness. He does not give his full attention to his pupils while in class; he goes in and out of the class-room as he pleases. Furthermore we claim that he has no respect for religion. For over forty years a prayer service is held in the School house and we never had any trouble. Lately he spoke of having these meetings discontinued. Now he annoys the people while the meetings are held by opening his radio full blast, banging the doors and other mean things. The congregation can hardly hear the preaching an account of the radio. The Council believe its duty to report to the Department such proceedings. We believe something should be done. In the past the Dept.has moved a teacher for less complaints. We believe the only remedy is to move him from here. He has been here for over three years and that is much too long as we think that the children are only loosing time.\n\nI am sending you the above resolution without omitting a word of the Council's claims but I beg to inform you that I investigated as to the veracity of the statements made in this resolution.\n\nIt is true that the attendance is very low at this School; one day only one pupil was present, but according to the teacher this is due to the work of some Indians who are against him. Mr.Smith claims that this is due to the fact that he refused to teach Sunday School.\n\nRelative to the bruises that Walter Martin is supposed to have received the teacher claims that he never slapped him on the back but only on the hands when this boy disobeyed him. He also denied to have refused to his pupils the attending of the toilets. As to his going in and out of the class room he claims that when he leaves the class it is only for a moment and only when necessary.\n\nThe teacher admitted that he opened his radio while the prayer meetings were held but denied that it was playing full blast; Mr.Smith claims that there\nthere are prayer services on the air, that he wants to hear at the same hour the local meetings are held. He also stated that he particularly likes the program \"Amos and Andy\" but this that this program is at the same hour of the meeting. The teacher told me that he would not keep his radio closed on account of the meeting.\n\nHowever since I went at the School for the investigation Mr. Smith did not open his radio during the meetings. As told in a previous letter the teacher is not going along very well with some Indians of this Band and also with the local minister Mr. Whitehead. This stated when Mr. Smith refused to teach Sunday School and the result of this ill-feeling is that the parents are not sending their children to School regularly. The Indians of this Band also seem to be under the impression that a three years stage at this School is the limit.\n\nOn the other hand, although the Council's protest seems to contain some exaggerations, I believe the teacher has not always done what he should have.\n\nHowever if things do not improve within a month from now I will ask you to send an official of the Department to visit the School as it is impossible to let things go as they are now.\n\nI would also kindly suggest you to get a report from Mr. Brady Provincial Inspector for the Protestant Schools of this Province relative to the progress made by the pupils of the Oka Country School.\n\nResolution...\n\nIt was proposed by H. Oke seconded by W. Cree; that the Department be asked to Mary Ann Angus and Martin Martin with sufficient shingles to cover the roofs of their houses and also to pay the amount of $34.00 to Hodgins Bros.; this being the require amount for the sawing of Jos. Andrew's lumber and also to supply this same Indian with two doors and eleven windows to enable him to build a house.\n\nI do not recommend any of these requests as the two roofs of M.A. Angus and M. Martin are not in urgent need of repairs and moreover Martin is not the owner of the house he is occupying but only the renter. Relative to Jos. Andrew I do not recommend his request as this man should wait to have some money before starting to build a house instead of relying only on the Department to pay for everything.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Frs.

These two children both boys Walter aged 13 and Llewellyn aged 9 are a continual source of trouble not only for me but for the rest of the children in the school. They are not respectful to me. When I punish them as at times all children must be punished, they call me names in school and shout vile language at me not only in English but in Indian and in French. When they are made to behave in school they go home and tell their parents and they take the children's part. Last winter when I whipped the oldest boy his mother came down to the school and called me such vile names that I cannot send them through the mail and I would at any time hesitate to repeat them. Mr. Martin has threatened dire things to me should I report the children to the Department. Shortly after Mrs. Martin had visited me last winter I found a note pinned on the school door. It was printed with lead pencil on wrapping paper and read, \"You go soon or you be sorry.\" This bothered me for some time and at last I burnt it but I am of the opinion that it came from the Martins. I cannot prove this however, and we may let it pass. Well last Monday I just had to use the strap on Llewellyn Martin. He would not do anything that I asked him and he kept everyone else in a turmoil in school. He went home and has never come back. Neither has Walter. Of course they do that every time that I resort to corporal punishment. People have told me that they are not coming back again.\n\nI am writing to tell you and the Department that I now refuse to allow these children to come to this school any longer. I do not feel that we should be expected to put up with children in school when their presence tends to lower the moral tone of the school. I must look after the morals of the other children.\nand I feel that the children of Martin Martin are not fit to associate with the others. I hope that you and the Department will take into consideration the fact that the Martins are and always have been a breeding place for trouble. The children are only following in the footsteps of their parents. If I could teach the children to be anything higher I wouldn't mind them at school. But it is impossible for me to teach them anything because they know that they do not have to do as I say. However if they stay at home they are a nuisance to the other children when they are coming to or going from the school. Last fall when I had some trouble with them I mentioned to Mr. Martin that they should be in a reform school. He replied to the effect that he would not send them and that the Government could not do anything without his permission. He said they could do as they liked here and the Government had no control of them because they belonged to the Life or old custom chiefs. I doubt this but did not tell him.\n\nMrs. Smith has been a witness to all these doings for the past four years and she can say that I am not exaggerating any. In fact I am putting the facts as mild as possible.\n\nHaving stated the case as clearly as I can in such a short space I now leave the outcome to you and the Department of Indian Affairs. I refuse to have anything more to do either with the children or with the parents in question. If they want to come to school there will have to be a new teacher and that will not please the rest of the parents in this section of the reserve.\n\nThanking you and the Department for all past favours and wishing you both the compliments of the Season,\n\nI am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAlbert E. Smith,\nTeacher-in-charge.\nOka December 18th, 1934\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will find a letter received from A.M.

Delage,\nSuperintendent.\nOka April 26, 1936\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nYou will find herewith a letter received at the office from Mr. Albert E Smith teacher in charge at the Country Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont,\nMy dear Mr. Fenner,\n\nMany years have passed since I saw you at Ottawa the last time. It is such a long time that I doubt you will have difficulty in remembering me. Let me introduce myself. I was educated eleven or twelve years ago and was employed by your department as teacher at the Oka County School. I received the appointment through the Rev. Mr. Smith, then a pastor at Montreal. I came to him seeking employment from my home in New Hampshire, he answered my request and kindly offered me the position. I accepted his offer and moved away from home or friend and took up teaching at Oka County School.\n\nI have been there two years now and was appointed as teacher at Oka County School and taking an active part in church work under the leadership of the Rev. Mr. Smith. I feel that over these two years I have met a difficult task, but I have not faltered. I have felt that position was a difficult one, and how unfulfilled I feel for that position. My education was insufficient but my experience with life was pitifully small. It required a man with more experience than I had with a broader understanding of the people and their mode of living and thinking. Mr. Smith has never forgotten the debt of gratitude I feel after a more experienced and older man took my place. I gave my best but at the time my best was not good enough. Mr. Smith understood and I will always remember his last words to me; they have helped me many times during the past year, and in spite of everything I have seen in Boston ever since, I have enjoyed a fair measure of success, but I have never been happy there, and can never forget my promise to my God made many years ago and every day I feel a stronger urge to leave it all and return to the work I love and to a complete fulfillment of that purpose.\n\nMay I hope I have lived up to your expectations? I have written you this letter. I hope you will understand, if I could talk with you I could express myself more freely. I am now very busy with my family and a little girl. I am married with one child, she is five years old, and as I watch her day by day I am convinced that she will grow into a fine young woman. I am grateful for the opportunity to start over again and make of my life what God would have it.\n\nSincerely yours,\nSelby Boucher\n1331 Huntington Ave.\nBoston, Mass.\nOttawa, June 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 14th instant addressed to the late Mr. Ferrier has been received.\n\nAt the present time there is no vacancy at the Oka Country School.\n\nI might add that there are a number of Canadian teachers out of employment, and, of course, these receive the preference when a vacancy occurs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn writing this letter to you I feel that no apology is necessary. By a perusal of the following pages you will find (1) My report of what I have successfully accomplished in the teaching of Agriculture in the school on the Lake of Two Mountains Reserve here. (2) My reasons for making the teaching of Agriculture obligatory in all Indian Schools. (3) My success in the organization of the School Fair which I have conducted since 1932. (4) My plan for the organization and supervision of the subject in all its aspects in the schools.\n\n(1) During my past six years experience as teacher here I feel that I have made an impression not only on the farming habits of the child but also upon those of the parent. In the rotation of crops, care of farm animals and working in the right season there has been a decided change for the better. It has furnished many points of contact between the parents and myself. It has been to a great extent responsible for the high average attendance of pupils at school because the pupils have enjoyed the discussions and the after class work which they have been called upon to perform. Both pupils and parents see that there is nothing degrading in farming as a life work. These are a few of the benefits which I have derived from the teaching of Agriculture.\n\n(2) (a) In the first place the indian must be, not coaxed or wheedled into farming, but must be brought to realize the advantages of farming. This can best be done by the teaching and supervision of Agriculture in the Day schools on the reserves. This can be done only by sympathetic teachers who understand the indian and who are satisfied to \"Make haste slowly.\"\n\n(b) While the course of study and the school fair scheme is fine for white schools it is not fair to expect the indian children to join a white school fair and compete with the children of that school whose forefathers were farming before the indian was discovered. However, under correct guidance, coaching, and teaching there is no doubt that the indian will in the near\nfuture measure up to and in many ways surpass his white neighbour as a farmer.\n\n(c) We are continually exhorting the Indians to be as far as possible, self-supporting. This can better be done by teaching the future Indians in our schools of today.\n\n(d) As an aid to the class-room work of the teacher, the School Fair must take a prominent place because Indian children more than any others must learn to do by doing, and they, by earning a little prize money, see the economic value of farm labour.\n\n(e) The care of school plants and fence border flower beds tends to lighten the tedium of every day classes and makes for more beautiful surroundings.\n\n(f) There are very few children who do not relish a discussion on farm animals and their care. I can truthfully say that the lessons in Agriculture have assisted me greatly in the keeping up of the attendance.\n\n(g) Next to the three R's comes Agriculture. Because it will be of greatest value in after life owing to the fact that so few Indian children have the perseverance to continue studies past the public or elementary schools.\n\n(3) After being appointed as teacher in this school in the fall of 1930 it did not take me long to see that here the need for the teaching of Agriculture was very great. Accordingly I mapped out a course which was in many ways similar to that as set forth in the Ontario Teacher's Manual on the subject. (Copy is enclosed.) Hatch and Haslewood's text was, I thought, unsuitable for the pupils' use so I have used The New Agriculture by Waters, which we used in the training classes at the North Bay Normal School. I find that I have had more success in giving a well prepared lesson than in the use of the text book in the hands of the pupils.\n\nDuring the Fall of 1931 I saw that something more was necessary than just the class-room lessons. The School Fair was the answer. By this they would be able to put into practice some of the ideas gained in class. Here I was handicapped because the Quebec Dept. of Education and Agriculture does not foster the idea of school fairs as does the Ontario Government. However during my ten years experience in the Ontario Public Schools I had had a great deal of experience in the work of the school fair.\n\nA private School Fair was the answer to my quest. I talked it over with different ones on the Reserve and got very little encouragement, but having the courage of my convictions I obtained the help of three young men and we put on a play. Nothing very uplifting, but it brought the necessary funds for the idea.\nUsing this money I bought seeds and distributed them to the children in the Spring of 1932. I saved $5.75 for prize money in September and with the balance I purchased a small silver cup with the words OKA COUNTRY SCHOOL FAIR suitably engraved upon it. I typed out the prize list and instructions, one for each child. They have been similar to the one for this year which is enclosed.\n\nJudging is done by three of the Indians who show more of an interest than the others. I usually spend a few hours coaching them the day before the fair. My system of numbers on the exhibits makes it difficult for the judges to tell to whom the exhibits belong. The prize money is given out the day of the Fair, the announcement is made as to who is the holder of the cup for the coming year. I give a short talk on why such an exhibit got First prize and another one none and so on. I also give as much information as I can to the grown ups regarding their work on the farm and in the garden. This year Mrs. Smith and I gave a practical demonstration of the canning machine. Last year it was a talk on drying vegetables and fruits for winter use.\n\nConcerts, suppers and socials are means of raising money for the Fair. Every year more parents visit the school on Fair Day to examine the exhibits and every year there is greater competition for the cup. The School Fair has come to be considered a permanent fixture here and is thought to be as necessary as the Day or Sunday Schools. I hold with that opinion myself.\n\nBesides the School Fair I have, contrary to the general opinion, made a success of fence border flower plots. A farmer loaned us a few barrowfuls of manure. The bigger boys and I do the digging. I bought a dozen gladioli and different Indians offered parts of their pet perennials. We have now a lovely border on one side consisting of Gladioli and Delphiniums. On the other side we have Sweet William, Gaillardia, and Dianthus with a rose tree in the centre. A small lilac bush is expected to bloom near the flagpole next spring. The front border as yet is just mixed annuals but we have sufficient perennial plants in a neighbouring garden to make a nice show along the front next year and in years to come.\n\nIt is surprising how carefully the children avoid the border beds when at play. They know that the flowers not only give joy to them but also to passing tourists who stop to remark on the beauty of the borders. And Indians do like to be noticed and show not only themselves but their handiwork.\nIn respect to the organization and supervision of the subject in the Indian Schools I may make the following statements which are merely suggestions of what might be done.\n\nAn experienced teacher of the subject could be appointed as Director and stationed at Brantford or London so that he could visit the schools in that area at least once a year. He would be supplied with a mimeograph with which he would make copies of lesson plans on different topics on the course of study. He would be in a position to spend a certain amount of time answering letters from teachers regarding the subject. Other schools in the dominion could be kept track of by means of communication with the teachers. When funds were available the director could visit other schools in other provinces or a director could be appointed for each of the provinces. But for the present to see how the thing would work it would be possible for one man to handle it and if he could not visit the schools personally he could do a great deal by letter to make the teachers and pupils Agriculture conscious. The salary and expenses would, perhaps, amount to $2,500 or $3,000 per year but I feel that it would be money well spent.\n\nAfter having read these reports and suggestions should you and your Department see it advisable to go into the matter more fully and at length I should be willing, on any Saturday, to arrange with you and those members of your Department who have control of Indian Education and funds.\n\nReferences as to my ability may be had by writing to my present inspector W.H. Brady, 4222 Old Orchard Ave., Montreal. As to my character you might inquire of Colonel, the Honourable James Arthurs our past member for my home constituency of Parry Sound and who has since been appointed to the Senate.\n\nPlease believe me when I state that this communication is being written with a view to the betterment of the indian and his status as a member of the community. We must bear in mind that the true missionary should teach the indian to live without him not with him.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and may you give this your earnest consideration,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted you suggest that an experienced teacher of the subject be appointed as director, stationed at Brantford or London, in order to visit the Indian schools and instruct the teachers and pupils in the subject of agriculture, school fairs, etc.\n\nIn reply I desire to thank you for the interest you have taken in this work at the Oka Country School. No doubt, it will prove of benefit to the Indian children in their future.\n\nRegarding your suggestion that a director be appointed, I would say that, at the present time, the Department has two field officers, who visit the Indian reserves and schools, instruct and give lectures and talks on agricultural subjects. Besides, school fairs are conducted on the greater number of the Indian reserves in western Ontario and around the Georgian Bay and Manitoulin Island. These fairs are under the auspices of one of these field officers. It would not be possible to consider the appointment of another\n\nEncl. - officer\n\nAlbert E.

I am not aware if the list showing the prize money paid, which you enclosed in your letter, was for the fair held this year. If so, the Department would be pleased to reimburse the expenditure incurred, which, it is noted, amounted to $3.75. I am returning the list of prize winners which you submitted and would request, if the money was paid for the fair held this year, that you will obtain receipts from the individual prize winners for the amount paid them; attach same to the enclosed list and return to the Department.

I wish to thank you for your offer of reimbursement of the amount.\n\nWould it be possible for you to have the secretary write me letting me know what amount we might have for next year so that I could make plans for the amount of the grant. I am informed that the Quebec Dept. of Agriculture gives seeds now to school children. I shall write them for their support also. The school Fair is a wonderful plan for interesting the pupils in this work.\n\nWith reference to my letter to you dated Sept. 22nd, would you please keep it on file and when there should happen to be an opening on another reserve in the line of agricultural work in the education of the indian children would you also try to give me an opportunity to give it a try. While I have not a degree in the subject I have an Agriculture certificate granted by the Ontario Dept. of Education in 1927 and made permanent in 1932. I have taught the public school course for six years in Ontario. While I was principal of the two rooted school at Connaught Ontario I taught Lower School Agriculture in lieu of Botany and Zoology. I would be glad of an opportunity to prove my worth in this line.\n\nThanking you very much for past favours, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should like to enlarge the prize list for the coming years and it would take an expenditure of $11.25 for prize money. It is quite likely that some entries might not be patronized as heavily as others and of course prize money would not need to be paid if not earned. However we would have to build upon the above amount and it is sure that that amount would be quite sufficient.\n\nReference your letter dated Sept. #20-1-1 regarding the painting of shed. It has been done and I saw to it that the job was well done. I used the remainder of the paint on the two toilets which improves the looks of the yard a great deal. Then Mrs. Smith used what still remained in touching up the table and chairs and the wood-work in the kitchen.\n\nReference the hot lunch which was discontinued a few years ago. I should like to see this carried on. There are a great number of underprivileged children in this school they need it. There are 20 pupils who live an average of 1 and 1/2 miles from the school. They need it very badly when we consider the weather and roads they have to contend with in the winter here. In past years Mrs. Smith served the lunch supplying everything herself and being paid at the rate of $15. per month. When she counted up at the end of the term she had an average of $4.80 a month for her work. She served soup which was a good nourishing meal in itself. Why not consider the lunch as in former years for the four months of Dec., Jan., Feb., March. It really is needed badly here.\n\nYesterday marked my sixth anniversary of commencing work here. Fairly successful too. How about a bonus this year of 75 or 100 dollars? I think I've deserved it.\n\nThank you for past favours,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P.Q.\nOttawa, March 9, 1937.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe following report on my recent visit of inspection to the Oka, P.Q., Agency is respectfully submitted.\n\nOKA COUNTRY SCHOOL.\n\nHas 55 on the roll. The average attendance for February was 24. This is lower than usual owing to an epidemic of whooping cough, measles and colds. Attendance is irregular. There is no truant officer and the agent gives little attention to this part of his duty. The School buildings are in good repair and well kept up.\n\nAt this school some handicraft work is taught. The pupils are very clever at this work and enjoy it. Mr. Smith is enthusiastic about developing it. He expressed his intention of taking the summer course in vocational training for teachers in Toronto this summer.\n\nPupils at both schools are comfortably clothed. Cod liver oil is given daily and hot soup at noon. There are no signs of undernourishment among them. On the whole they are doing very well and making progress in their work. It would mean much to these boys and girls in after life if they could be given more instruction to develop their active ability along manual training lines.\n\nThosl McGookin,\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 26, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am in receipt of recent letter addressed to you by the teacher of the Oka Country School, in which he states that he will be unable to resume duties during the next three weeks owing to illness.\n\nIt has been decided to allow the Oka Country School to remain closed until Mr. Smith recovers.\n\nYou should make enquiries regarding Mr. Smith's health about December 20th and advise me at that time if he will be able to resume duties on January 3, 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Quebec.\nOka, December 27th, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter, I beg to say that Mr. Smith's health has improved and he will be in a position to teach school after the present holidays.\n\nLast year, Mrs. Smith was allowed $8.00 per month to serve soup to the school children and she was supplying all the materials herself. Mr. Smith is asking that soup would be served again this year, for the months of January, February and March, and his wife would be ready to make this soup, supplying the materials herself, but he claims that last year, Mrs. Smith just broke even on expenses, having nothing for her work, and he is asking for a salary of $10 or $12 per month.\n\nI understand that the serving of soup to the school children is a very good thing and I would recommend that it be served for the three above mentioned months and that Mrs. Smith be paid $10 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. P. Phelan,\nSup't Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\n[Stamp: Department of Mines & Resources]\n[Stamp: Indian Affairs Branch]\n[Stamp: DEC 30 1937]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As I reside just across the lake from these people and have been asked by them to apply for the position, I trust that you will kindly consider this application.\n\nI have received a first-class,\nintermediate diploma at Macdonald College and have been teaching for three years in Elementary Schools of the province; two years in Kenholm, one in Restigouche and at present in Metis.\n\nReferences may be obtained from Inspector, S.V. Cattermell, New Carlisle, Que.\n\nInstructing you will please inform me at your earliest convenience concerning this matter, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n(Diss) Catherine Moore,\nHudson Heights, Que.\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo applying for appointment as teacher of the Oka Country School.\n\nThe present teacher of this school, who has given good services, has not yet intimated any intention of giving up duties at the end of the current academic year. Under these circumstances we are not aware whether or not there will be a vacancy for a teacher at this school for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Catherine Nussey,\nHudson Heights, Que.\nThe Indian Country Day School,\nOka, Tue., Jan. 18, 1939.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to thank you for your work in having the furnace installed in this building. It is proving entirely satisfactory and keeps the residence and school very comfortable. It also saves us a great deal of time and labour and will, I believe, save on the fuel bill also.\n\nI should like, also, to express my gratitude to both you and Miss K. Moodie for having sent the loom here. It has given us a great deal of extra work and caused us to have to crowd our living quarters somewhat but it has proved its worth to us. We are instructing four of the school children in the work of setting up the loom and weaving. There is only one woman, as yet, who has asked to learn it. Others come and see it and either think it would be too hard to learn or else they are afraid to learn it for fear they would lose their relief if they did do so. We have finished the towels which Miss Moodie left on the loom for us and we have set on another warp for sharpening bars. The design is the Monk's Belt. Our variations of the pattern are working out very beautifully. We will need more warp of some kind as soon as we get the bars finished. The boys have made a warping board, spool rack and spools, winder, and raddle. I believe that the small looms would be better for a place like this. If one was sent we could duplicate it any number of times so that each house could have one. I have bought sufficient lumber to make a large loom and will start on it as soon as I get caught up with the work in the classes in school. Then you can send this big loom to another reserve and we will have one like it of our own.\nA couple of years ago I mentioned the fact to you that I would soon have to get to another centre where my son could attend High School. He really should have gone this year but we didn't want to send him to a town and among strangers. I spoke to Miss Moodie about our predicament and she seemed to realize that something would have to be done about us. I like the Indian work and would like to remain in Indian schools as I believe I have the knack of giving them what they need. I have made a success of the work here in the past eight years and I feel that I could do the same elsewhere. I'd like you to write to an inspector and get his idea of my work here. His address is W.H. Brady, T.A., 4222 Old Orchard Ave., Montreal, P.Q. Is there any possibility of there being a handicraft centre opened on one of the bigger reserves where I might fit in as an instructor in handwork, weaving, etc. I hate to give up here now that we have been made so comfortable and have worked so hard to get the pupils along to where they are manageable. The people, too, like me because they elected me to the Board of Stewards of the church with three votes more than were polled for anyone else. I find that we will have to move by September so that Gerald may go to High School. He has spent two years in Grade VII now. I'd like him to take a technical course if possible. I'm sure that you and Miss Moodie will try to solve my problem for me.\n\nWhen I got your last letter I went to see Dunice Laforce. She was busy and was having a lesson made for herself and did not see interested so we went ahead alone. Made a couple of blunders but eventually got it under way and now we understand the work better. We have Worst's book now and have sent Miss Moodie to Rev. C.D. Strapp as you requested.\n\nIn woodwork I am having the boys specialize in the making of wooden toys and lawn ornaments. There is a good future in that line. The girls are doing cloth toys. They sure enjoy it. I have very good books on toy making.\n\nIn closing please let me thank you again for all you have done for us.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nOttawa, January 20, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by me from Mr. Albert E. Smith, teacher at the Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nMay I direct your attention particularly to Mr. Smith's request to be placed in a district where he can secure high school instruction for his boy. I have discussed this request with the officials here. May I suggest that, if possible, he be transferred to Moraviantown. This could only be done, of course, provided the transfer was acceptable to the United Church authorities. If Mr. Smith were placed in charge of the school at Moraviantown, I am anxious that the house now occupied by the missionary teacher would be available for him or if it is your intention to appoint a missionary to this reserve to succeed the man now in charge. Mr. McGookin, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario, informs me that there are a number of United Churches comparatively close to this reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJanuary 30th,\n1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of January 20th relative to the possibility of transferring Mr. Albert E. Smith from Oka to Moraviantown. I can quite understand his desire to be in a place where he could secure High School instruction for the boy, but no doubt you are aware that he would have to send him away at Moraviantown, although possibly not so far as at Oka.\n\nIn any case, I think this and other such transfers had better wait until I have the opportunity of discussing the whole list with you personally in Ottawa. I shall be going to Montreal some time next month and will arrange to call to see you at that time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would be preferable if a married man could be secured for this position, and in that event he could take up residence at the Oka Country school early in August, as the property will be vacant by that time. There are furnished living quarters for the teacher, attached to this school.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would nominate a suitable teacher for this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

It has been so during the entire school year and more especially in May and June.\n\nWhen the Schools reopen in the Fall I would suggest that the help of the R.C.M.P. Police be obtained at least once a week for a few weeks and that procedures be taken against the parents who would not see that their children attend School. It is believed that if an example or a few examples were given that this would remedy the situation.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(Prs.

We cannot, however, allow the school to remain closed and it would be deeply appreciated if you could nominate a teacher, preferably a male teacher, for the position.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAugust 19th,\n1943.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe have no teacher in sight, but we have an application from Mr. John Thomas Angus to teach the school. I believe that the Agent, Mr. Brisebois, and he have had a talk about it.\n\nMr. Angus is not a qualified teacher. He was born at Oka; attended the Indian Day Schools there; went one year to Macdonald College High School for entrance; and was for five years at Pointe-aux-Trembles, where he obtained his High School Leaving Certificate. His marks were good. In 1927-28, he was at the Theological College, but evidently gave up the idea of following that vocation. He worked for your Department as Reserve Custodian from December, 1939, to December, 1942. He was called up for the Army and was placed in Category \"E\". Since then he has been working in Montreal in The United Shipyards. His references seem to be good. I wrote to Inspector Brady and enclose a copy of his reply.\n\nWould you consider our nomination of Mr. Angus for the position of teacher for one year?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6096, file 323-1, part 3)\n4228 Old Orchard Ave.,\nMontreal, Que.,\nAugust 7th, 1943.\n\nRev. Dr. Geo. Dorey,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of August 4th, with reference to the appointment of Mr. John Angus as Missionary and Teacher at Oka, presumably for the \"Country\" school.\n\nI have met Mr. Angus several times but have no idea of his teaching ability. Perhaps the Indians will be willing to send their children to school for him, which is more than they would do for the last two white teachers. They have attended much better the last year with Dorris Diebo as teacher in the village school.\n\nAt any rate, I know of no one else for the position. I am told that he has had a fairly good education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) W. H. Brady,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa,\nAugust 20, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Oka Country School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 19th instant, in which you ask me to express an opinion with respect to the employment of John Thomas Angus as teacher at the Oka Country School.\n\nMr. Angus was, as you state, employed by this Department under my direction on the Doneaster Reserve from 1939 to 1942. I have corresponded with him from time to time and have, on one or two occasions, discussed Indian problems with him. Like Inspector Brady, I have no idea whatever of his teaching ability and I find it somewhat difficult to convince myself that a man such as Mr. Angus, who has not been closely associated with educational work for a number of years, could do effective work in the classroom. The Oka Reserve is, as you know, one of our problem reserves and a reserve at which we should have good, fully qualified teachers, if we can secure them. If, however, such teachers are not available, it might be better to employ Mr. Angus than to allow the school to remain closed. You might turn the matter over again in your mind and let me have a definite recommendation in due course.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 20th and our conversation, I should be glad if you would let us know officially whether you will appoint Mr. John T. Angus as teacher of the Oka Country School. We have no one else to suggest. The terms of his appointment should be such as will make it clear that he is only temporarily employed, pending the possibility of getting a fully certificated teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLP\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, it has been decided to appoint Mr. J.T. Angus temporarily as teacher of the Oka Country School.

Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nOn several occasions during the past two months I have been in touch with the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada with a view to obtaining a qualified teacher for the Oka Country School. However, he has been unable to secure anyone and has recently suggested that we engage Mr. John T. Angus as a temporary teacher for this school. I feel that it is better to have the school in operation and it has, therefore, been decided to appoint Mr. Angus at a salary of $80.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. You should notify him at once and have him open the school as soon as possible. You should point out very definitely to him that this is only a temporary appointment pending the securing of a fully certificated teacher. I enclose the necessary forms which you should have him complete and return to this office.\n\nR.A.

I enclose T.D. 1 form and copy of letter of appointment.\n\nMr. Angus is an Indian.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nRe: Visit to the Oka Village and Oka Country Schools\n\nThe Oka Country School under the direction of John Thomas Angus was inspected in the morning, between nine and twelve-thirty. Mr. Angus, although possessing no professional training is making a success of this school. The attendance seems better than when I visited the first time and the spirit in the classroom has changed for the better. The attendance, however, could still be greatly improved. I advised Mr. Angus to take a normal training as soon as he possibly could, as it would be to his advantage if he really wishes to remain in the teaching profession. The school itself is greatly in need of decoration, the exterior and the interior. In order to protect the building it should be painted exteriorly as soon as funds are available. The interior is a natural finish in dull brown. A light color would greatly increase the light in this classroom. I have asked Mr. Angus to give Agent Brisebois an estimate for the painting of both the Country and the Village School. Screens should be provided for the windows.\n\nIt might be advisable to divide our schools into three or four groups and have one group completely repaired one year, the second group another year, etc. The fifth year the cycle would start over. This, I believe, would prove less expensive and our buildings would be in a better condition. Surroundings have a great deal of influence on pupils.\n\nMr. Angus is going to take charge of the school gardens, both for the Village and the Country Schools during the summer holidays.\n\nOKA VILLAGE SCHOOL\n\nThe Oka Village School under the direction of Miss Doris Mary Diabo was visited during the afternoon of the same day. Miss Diabo is making a success of this school. The attendance has increased since she has taken charge, but still an improvement could be made. Her pupils are progressing satisfactorily. Screens for six windows of the Oka Village School are required.\n\nReading tests were taken in both schools, in grades two, three and four. The pupils of second grade have done exceptionally well in reading grade and reading age. This applies to both schools. Grades three and four are well classified in reading grade but are rather old as far as reading age.\nThe following table will show these facts:\n\n**OKA COUNTRY: Gates Basic Reading Test Type A**\n\n| Grade | Reading Grade | Age | Reading Age |\n|-------|---------------|-----|-------------|\n| Peggy Joan Oke | 4 | 8.0 | 10 | 13.9 |\n| Elizabeth Nelson | 2 | 3.2 | 10 | 8.8 |\n| S.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Brisbois,\n\nMost of the children here have been marked up into grades they definitely do not qualify for. Since January I have tried much as was possible to bring them ahead all the world about. What I would like to know now is how you would like best that this situation be handled. Will I put them back where they really belong. Which might have effect of killing their interest completely. Or do you wish me to continue & try gradually build them up to fit their grade same as I have been doing. Which method if I make a good job of it. I would need to drop some other subject and have two arithmetic periods a day. Having one as a game of varied types of arithmetic. So they would not lose interest or weary. They are children who do not seem to care whether they pass or not. And are very hard to get to study. Making a guessing game out of lessons I get them to repeat. Pretending I don't think they can remember. Seems to get more results than anything I have tried. And the use of colored stars for work. But I have such a large group & little ones who need personal help. That it does not leave time I need to devote to my older ones.\n\nCountry Day School\nOka\nJune 3/47\nas I would like + need to get results. Only way I see\nI could get around that problem is if the Dept. would\nallow me to use older girls, because little ones are all\ngirls except three. To write out work in their books & help\nthem form their letters & study their reading etc.\nThis I could do between lessons of their own and rotate\nit so there would be no time to develop favoritism.\nAnother thing this would teach older ones to be more\ntidy with their own work. If I could get some simple\npuzzles for these little ones with printing on. It would help\nthem a lot too I think. Below I am listing all their\nnames and data. So you can see the whole picture here\nI would like to get all these things planned & start me\nright away in Sept. with a definite plan & see it through\n\n| Age | Name          |\n|-----|--------------|\n| 8   | Rose Nelson  |\n| 11  | Francis Blake |\n| 13  | Elizabeth Nelson |\n| 6   | Judy Simon   |\n| 5   | Lucy Simon   |\n| 11  | Jessie Jacobs |\n| 6   | Myrtle Jacobs |\n| 9   | Gladys Jacobs |\n| 14  | Angeline Etienne |\n| 12  | Minnie Bonapille |\n| 12  | Nancy Etienne |\n| 12  | Annie Nicholas |\n| 7   | Kathleen Nicholas |\n| 8   | Nilda Bonapille |\n| 10  | Joyce Nicholas |\n| 7   | Janet        |\n\nComments:\n- Requires continued watching (Disturbed)\n- Unable to work without help\n- Knows no English - very dull\n- Reading good - back fair 3rd grade\n- Very dull - giddy left school\n- Knows no English - slow mind\n- Knows no English - tries hard\n- Very dull stubborn - fair 1st grade\n- Knows little English - dull\n- Good prospects - if attendance regular nice smart child\n- Quiet nice girl gives no trouble\n- Just dull - gain 2nd grade\n- Bright but troublesome & lazy worker.

When I took this job I was aware of the fact that I would be paid only every three months and thought I would get used to the system. However it worries me more and more every term to run bills which I cannot pay until the end of three months. I'm afraid I shall have to give up the position unless I be allowed a certain amount monthly to meet expenses. Will you please give this your consideration and let me know the result.\n\nI still have not got my September cheque and can think of no reason for delay.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nAlbert E.

I regret very much the delay in issuing the cheques for the month of October, but they have now gone forward and yours has no doubt reached you by this time. The delay was due to two factors; first, the increase in the cost-of-living bonus and, second, the new deductions for income tax. These two changes involve a great deal of computation and, as a result, issue of the cheques was delayed. I am assured that there will be no further difficulty in this regard during the balance of the academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C.J.

I desire to ask if the Department will allow me the privilege of making these suggestions for what they are worth, unless the matter is already settled beyond possibility of alteration.\n\nIf the Department cares to receive these suggestions I shall consider it a very great favour.\n\nIn the meantime there are three matters in connection with the project which I am sure you will not mind my bringing to your attention, the more so because I know of no-one else who will do so if I do not. They are as follows:\n\n1. The necessity for an enlarged or new site.\n   The present school grounds are only 78 ft x 64 ft., and we have not sufficient room for recreational purposes. The school is less than thirty feet from the road, and the toilets are only ten feet away from the school. In some ways, an enlarged playground is even more necessary than a new building.\n\n2. An arrangement whereby school can be continued in the old building while the new building is in course of erection.\n   If the new school is on another site this will be easy enough, but I draw attention to the matter.\nbecause I do not wish the children to lose time if it can be avoided and because once they get out of the habit of attending it is a difficult matter to bring them back. It would be a very satisfactory situation if we could start school as usual in September 1st, either in the old building or the new, and, if in the old building, move to the new when it is ready.\n\n3. The disposal of the old building.\n\nThis question is bound to arise and the solution may not be easy to find. A certain section of the people,\u2014the reactionary element\u2014are quite anxious to be able to use it for their own purposes, which would include activities not in favour of the Department. Furthermore, the question as to the actual ownership of the building may arise, a question about which I am not competent to write but of which the Department should be informed.\n\nI have placed these matters before the Department somewhat hesitatingly, and I shall be very much obliged if you will inform me if the suggestions I mention in the first part of my letter will be acceptable.\n\nYour respectfully,\n\nH. E. Eburne.\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, April 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, relative to the suggestions which you desire to offer in connection with the construction of the new Oka Country Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department has plans for Indian day schools, we will be pleased to have any suggestions you care to offer. Your remarks regarding a new site and the disposal of the old building have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. E.

I am not quite sure now whether such is advisable. I cannot help thinking that if a lady teacher should be appointed to the school at some late date, it would certainly not be advisable for her to live alone, especially if she is young. On the other hand, a man generally prefers not to be bothered with a residence, and prefers to board. If it were possible to build a residence large enough for a man and his wife, both of whom would be engaged in teaching, with the library and domestic subjects, such would be a very satisfactory solution, but I doubt whether the Department contemplate such action.\n\nWhether the school contains a residence or not, I would very earnestly plead for additional rooms to be used as work rooms and recreation rooms. I suggest one room as a work room for the girls, which could also be used as a dining room and a recreation room in wet weather (a rarely needed provision), and one room for the boys, perhaps located in the basement, which would serve the same purpose except that it is a dining room and might also be used for scout and club purposes. A kitchenette or hutchette should be attached to the girls' room. While I have done as good work as I could do here, yet I feel that our methods have been a little too bookish and I would be delighted to have the\nprovision of these additional rooms to work out some larger projects. The cost of such rooms would add only slightly to the cost of the school, while the saving to the town from itself and its equipment would make up for it in a few years. If an additional room or two is still thought necessary, it could be placed above the other in somewhat the same way (on a smaller scale) as the school at Hubert River (Man.).\n\nIn the same connection, I would suggest a really adequate basement, to be used as a playground in wet weather and for a furnace if the Department desires to install one. While the question of a furnace may be closed up with the question of a basement, yet if there is to be a basement, which I very much hope, I am afraid that the floor would be flooded if the schoolhouse was only stove heated.\n\nMay I add that the question of protection in wet weather is a very live question, and I seriously doubt whether any school should be built without such provision. The schoolroom itself is certainly not the place for it.\n\nIs it possible to install electric light in the school? At present, while the wires do not pass by the school, they come to within 15 miles west of us and 2 miles east of us, although operated by separate companies. If the school were to make common cause with neighboring farmers, I think the thing could be quite easily done.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Harbour is in a position in which he could quite conveniently raise the matter with both the farmers concerned and the Electric Lighting Companies. The advantages are so obvious that I do not need to explain them, especially if we do as I have done for three years\u2014night work with students over school age. But my real reason is that I could operate a lantern and picture and give to the children a much wider knowledge of general things than I have so far been able to do. I worked out these lantern lessons a few years ago and I have found nothing since that equals them.\n\nI desire to add one or two minor suggestions which might possibly be overlooked if they are not mentioned:\n\n1. The necessity for a well.\n   - At present we have no choice of two wells belonging to the house. One gives us very bad smelling water and the other is just outside a stable.\n\n2. Plenty of cupboard space.\n   - This can be so much more easily provided when\nThe school is being built now at a later time.\n\nThe provision of a map case, or at least, spring rollers for our maps.\n\nThis is a little expensive at first, but the saving on the maps themselves is surely made up in a few years.\n\nThere are many things that I have not mentioned, such as blackboard space, window space, window shades, etc., but these things you will not expect me to mention, as I well know that the Department takes them all into consideration when building schools. I would not have presumed to make the suggestions I have made except for the fact that I am in a position to see things from the local standpoint, and that I know that both the suggestions I have made and the circumstances here are a little unusual.\n\nI apologize for writing a letter and thank the Department for giving me the opportunity. I hope that what I have said may be of some slight service.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.E.

As far as I can understand his only object is to support a close relative who recently lost the post of joker at the school.\n\nI have to advise you that Mr. Coronthi represents - in this instance - no-one but himself.

As I shall not personally use these forms and as they will be left here for the use of the new teacher, I venture to ask whether I may submit this bill to the Indian Agent for payment by the Department.\n\nAt the same time I incurred an expenditure of $10. by taking a party of my children to Montreal to attend an educational exhibition, - an international gymnasia. The result of their visit, which included twelve scholars, has been very gratifying indeed and from every point of view was well justified. Seeing that I am not continuing as teacher I shall not reap any advantage from the expenditure and I should like to be able to send this bill also to the Indian Agent.\n\nI am fully aware that these expenditures were not authorized, but at the time I incurred them I expected to benefit by the expenditure which I intended to meet myself. Now that circumstances have changed I shall be obliged if you will permit me to charge them to the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nN. E.

FOR FILE:\n\nI have examined the old files which have reference to the beginning of the OKA COUNTRY Indian Day School, and I find that two members of the Band each gave a part of a lot to the Department of Indian Affairs and the Methodist Church for a mission and the school. It is probable that the first building, which was erected in 1880, was constructed by the members of the Band, assisted by the Department from Band funds or other monies and by the Methodist Church. In 1897, when there was practically a reconstruction, $100 only was charged to Band Funds, the rest being taken from Vote. In 1912, there was a further reconstruction and the funds were taken from Vote.\nLake of Two Mountains\nIndian Reserve\n\nTo Mr. Terry,\n\nMay 16th, 1927.\n\nThe Chiefs and the band of the\nInnu Indians residing in the Lake of Two\nMountains Reserve have duly assembled this\n16th day May 1927.

Therefore we strictly protest any one to tear down the old school house which our forefathers had build for our own use. We the Chiefs and the band of Indians will wait for your earliest reply.

Q.\nIndian Country School\nOka Oka\nDecember 21, 1929\nSecretary of Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you kindly let me know if it is the custom of the Department that meals are to be served for the children during the winter months, as has been done other years?\n\nThank you.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nVera Simmons.\nOttawa, December 27th, 1929.\n\nMadam,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd instant, I beg to say that the Department is requesting Mr. Agent Harbour to arrange for the purchase and delivery of the supplies required for the serving of a midday meal to the pupils of the Oka Country Indian Day School during the winter months. He has been instructed to consult you regarding the supplies required and you should communicate with him in the matter.\n\nIn future, I shall be pleased if you will forward all requests in connection with your school through the office of your local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Vera Simons,\nTeacher,\nOka Country Indian Day School,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa, December 27th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nAn inquiry has been received from the teacher of the Oka Country Indian Day School, requesting to be informed whether or not a midday meal will be served to the pupils during the winter months, the same as was done last year. In this connection I beg to say that, if the teacher can arrange for the preparation and serving of a midday lunch, the Department will approve of this arrangement being carried out and you may purchase and have delivered the necessary supplies. You should take up this matter with the teacher. It is thought that a warm drink served with biscuits would be sufficient for this purpose. If any utensils are required, you may also arrange for their purchase and delivery. Miss Simons is being informed that the question of purchasing the supplies required for the serving of the midday lunch has been placed in your hands.\n\nPlease forward certified accounts, in duplicate, from time to time, covering the cost of the supplies which you furnish for the serving of a midday meal at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If expenditure was incurred kindly submit a credit voucher. You should of course refund any balance remaining in your hands, as the fiscal year (1929-1930) in which the advances were made has expired, and the Department's books for that year are about to close.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Harbour, Indian Agent, Oka, P.Q., a voucher dated the 25th November, 1929, for $35.00, for a coal heater for the new Oka Country School, class room. The voucher was made out in favour of your firm, at Quebec, but on the face was written, \"Please send the cheque to the Oka Indian Office.\" This request was overlooked, and consequently the cheque went direct to you. It seems advisable for you to send the cheque to Mr Harbour, with a view to adjustment of the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant.\n\nP.T.

McQuat,\ndated April 10th, 1930, on his inspection of the\nOka Country Indian Day School.\n\nThere is a new school building and a pair of\nouthouses.\n\nThere was a bad mistake made by some one in planning\nyour classroom. The teacher has to have her desk at the en-\ntrance between the two entrance doors, where she is in the\nmidst of the cold and all the noise of pupils coming and going,\nwhile she can see nothing going on. The school should have had\nthe light on the opposite side and the teacher at the rear of\nthe room. I am informed that the plan was drawn right but that\nit was reversed in its erection.\n\nBesides, the new well is too near the privy pits,\nthat were closed. There was water in the basement on Apr. 10/30.\n\nSome of the seats are too near the stove. The stove\nneeds a tin or galvanized jacket to protect pupils who sit near\nit from the excessive heat. It is no place for the stove up in\nthe middle of the classroom. Its place is a schoolroom is near\nthe front door, where the cold air is found. But that is where\nthe teacher has to have her desk according to the plan of the\nschool. People, who presume to plan a schoolroom, should know\nbetter than to outline such a contradiction of schoolroom\nprinciples, for everything has been misplaced, the teacher, the\npupils, the stove, the windows, the entrances, all turned around.\nOttawa, May 13, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to official 20-1-5 of December 17th, last, authorizing you to expend $5.50 installing a rural mail box at the Oka Country Indian Day School. I am informed that this box has not yet been installed. Please take early steps in this connection.\n\nYou should also see that the lock on the boys' door is repaired and should report on the school clock. If you believe this could be repaired and properly placed on a shelf, you may take the necessary steps. If you are of the opinion that a new clock is necessary, please let me know at what price you can make purchase.\n\nIt is reported that water is lying in the basement of the new school. Will you please take immediate steps to ascertain what is wrong with the drain and let the Department have a report and recommendation without delay. Your early attention is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P. Q.\nOttawa, May 15, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to point out that on the 5th April the Department wrote bringing to your attention that you should account for $2,103.87 in connection with work on the Oka Country School Building. You were asked to give the matter your immediate attention. The vouchers in this matter have not as yet been received at the Department. You should send them in at once with explanation regarding the delay which has occurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.

The others are the old style double seat, they are broken and are very unsatisfactory. The new building will accommodate 150 pupils without difficulty. I have looked up the backs records and find that there has been as high as 36, 37, and 40 pupils on the register.\n\nLast year, on days when the attendance was large, I found the seating difficult, so that only two of the double seat that could be suitably placed for use. The Inspector Mr. J. W. McEwen spoke of the seats and will likely mention them in his report.\n\nThe new desks with seats and 2 seats without desks, will prove very satisfactory.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have selected seeds to the value of $4.00 nine dollars from Macdonald seed catalogue from Ottawa. Would your department be willing to this amount for the seeds. I should like to know what you can do before March 1st as the potatoes will have to be planted in hot beds then. We have some window boxes made and am making the hot bed frame this month and lumber used to build a platform on the school for the Christmas tree. I will use more lumber however for the border boxes.\n\nYour advice and help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith,\nTeacher-in-charge.\nOttawa, February 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting to be supplied with lumber to make fence border boxes for flowers, garden seeds and hauling earth.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that you are teaching agriculture to the pupils of the Oka Indian Day School, and beautifying the school grounds. If you will make an estimate of the cost of the lumber required and hauling of the earth, and forward same through the office of your local Indian Agent, Mr. F. Harbour, favourable consideration will be given to authorizing him to make the purchase, etc. It is considered unnecessary that a large number of fence boxes be installed. A few arranged along the fence in front of the school should be sufficient.\n\nRegarding the seeds, it is thought that it would not require an expenditure to the amount mentioned by you, viz., $9. You should prepare a list of the seeds required and place the order for same. If you forward payment with the order for the seeds, you should obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, which should be properly receipted, and hand same to the Agent, when a cheque in payment will be forwarded to reimburse you. If it is intended that the Department pay the firm for the seeds, you should also hand the account, in duplicate, to Mr. Harbour, as it is necessary that he certify same.\n\nIn future, I would request that you forward all requests for supplies of any nature, and also in regard to any matters in connection with the school, through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I believe this had the approval of the department last year but was not done. The heat of the afternoon sun makes the kitchen very warm. Suggested size is 7' x 10'.\n\n(b) That a small window be placed in the large clothes-closet of the bed-room upstairs. At present my wife and son and myself occupy the one room which is small and has no system of air circulation. A small window in the store-room on the south side would allow more air to enter the bed-room.\n\n(c) That a garage be built at the back of the lot to serve not only as a garage but as a store-room for storm windows and doors, etc.\n\n(d) That rain-troughs be placed on the kitchen and a barrel be supplied to hold rain-water for washing.\n\n(e) That a sliding couch be supplied for the kitchen.\nPage 2.\n\n(8) That I be supplied with 300 feet length of boards 10 inches wide to be used in building border boxes to hold flowers. Also approximately 8 loads of earth to fill these boxes and window boxes.\n\nIn regard to this please refer to your letter of Feb. 4th, number 20-1-5 to me. I have cut the original amount to almost one half. I am not sure as to value of lumber or earth. The seeds are already planted in a hot bed of my own construction.\n\n(9) That we be supplied with a wash stand, basin and bowl for the bed-room.\n\n(10) Your earnest consideration would be acceptable on the idea of varnishing the walls of the residence. This would make the walls easier to clean and would save them from darkening.\n\nWith your permission & humbly submit the above, and ask the approval of the department.\n\nThanking you for past favours,\n\nI am,\nYours truly,\nAlbert E. Smith.\nOka, April 16th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you herewith a letter from the teacher of the Country School, for your consideration and approval.\n\nI must say that the lumber is being sent to the school, as it has already been approved.\n\nYour prompt answer will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Harbour,\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, April 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Harbour has forwarded your letter dated the 27th ultimo, in which you request that a verandah be built on the kitchen of the teacher's residence at the Oka Country Indian Day School, also that a garage be built, eaves troughing placed on the kitchen, walls of the residence varnished and a sliding couch supplied. In reply I have to say that our funds are extremely limited, and we will be unable to provide the expenditure required in carrying out the above work at the present time.\n\nI have to request that you will obtain a price for the installing of a small window in the clothes closet in the bedroom, also in the storeroom on the south side of the building. You should also obtain a price on an inexpensive washstand and for a basin and bowl for the bedroom. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the above.\n\nAuthority has already been granted for the supplying of the lumber required in building border boxes to hold flowers. You may arrange to supply the quantity of earth required to fill these boxes and window boxes. No unnecessary expense for the purpose should be incurred.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of the following: 1 watering can, 1 hoe, 1 rake, 2 brooms, 4 lamp glasses, 1 small brush for cleaning windows, 4 pair shelf brackets, 2 lbs. 2\u00bd\" nails, 1 quart green paint, 1 pint oil, 1 quart linseed floor varnish and 1 drying pan. You should purchase this equipment as cheaply as possible, and obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, from the merchant who supplies same.

Smith, Esq.,\nTeacher, Country Indian Day School,\nOka, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 20-125 dated Apr. 24, I wish to state in reply regarding window. If I may be supplied with a small window sash and glass and a few boards I would be willing to install the window in my spare time. The cost of material I am sure would be not more than $4. Only one window is necessary. I have no means of ascertaining the cost of wash stand except a mail order catalogue which quotes the cheapest at $7.25. Basin and Bowl at $3.60.\n\nRegarding earth for flower boxes, I am enclose a bill for same dust Mr. John Angue for $9.50. It required 6 loads costing $1.55 each. Of these this was the cheapest. His bill also shows 23 cords wood @ $3.50 per cord delivered here. Mr. Harbour & Winter authorized me to order this wood. I shall need nearly five cords of dry wood for summer use. May I order same at the lowest price possible.\n\nIn closing let me say that all good faith and by me in the future will be done so at the lowest price possible. In every way I shall practice the strictest economy.\n\nThanking you for past and future consideration.\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may also arrange for the purchase of a washstand and basin and bowl, at a cost not exceeding approximately the amount mentioned in your letter. After you have had the window installed and the above purchases made, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost. You should certify on the accounts as follows: \"Goods received. Prices charged fair and just\".\n\nRegarding the account which you forwarded in favour of John Angus covering 6 loads of earth for the flower boxes and 2\u00bd cords dry wood at $3.50 per cord, I would point out that the amount charged for the wood is incorrect. 2\u00bd cords at $3.50 per cord is $8.75. I am returning the account herewith for correction, either as to the quantity of wood supplied or the cost of same.\n\nIt is noted that you will require 5 cords dry wood for summer use. You may order same at the lowest possible price. You should see that a good grade of the full quantity of wood is supplied and, after same has been delivered to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, certified as above, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There is a well here from which the water is pumped into the kitchen. It has been dug near an old privy and at present the water does not smell very good. We have never drunk it. We have been getting water from a well near a barn but that also started to taste strong so we have transferred to a well near here which is filled with surface water.\n\nSince I came here last November Mr. Harbour, the agent, has been going to have a new well dug but has been putting it off all along.

Cadieux covering the cost of goods bought for the use of the Oka Country Indian Day School. A cheque in payment will be sent to Mr. Cadieux in due course.\n\nIn connection with accounts covering the cost of supplies which you were authorized to obtain, I have to request that, in future, you will obtain accounts in duplicate from the merchant from whom you make purchase. You should certify both copies of the account and forward same to the Department. I would point out that only one copy of the account of Mr. Cadieux was forwarded, and it is necessary in such cases to have a duplicate copy prepared in the Department.\n\nRegarding your request to be granted authority to purchase lumber to erect a small garage and also to hire a man for one day to assist with the framework, I have to request that you will inform the Department of the approximate cost of the lumber required and the labour in assisting in the work. Our funds this year are very limited, and it is necessary to cut down expenses as low as possible. When we have information as to the cost, consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase of the lumber required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nAlbert E.

That is the cheapest and at the same time the best material I can get for the purpose. Carpenter's labour will cost about $6. Having looked up prices on garages elsewhere I consider this estimate to be quite low in comparison.\n\nThis material will be wasted.\n\nLooking forward to your reply,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E.

He recommends that Mrs. Smith, who prepared the lunch and washed the dishes without remuneration last year, be allowed the sum of $15 per month, which is to include the supplying of the food required.\n\nThe Department considers that this would be a satisfactory arrangement, and will allow Mrs. Smith payment at the rate of $15 per month as from December 1st, next, for her work in preparing and serving the lunch and supplying the food required for the purpose. I have to request that you will inform Mr. Smith accordingly, and he may arrange that the serving of the lunch commence on the date mentioned. This lunch should be served to the pupils until the end of March, next.\n\nYou may prepare a voucher, in duplicate, from time to time for the amount due Mrs. Smith at the above rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is leaking and has been since November 7th. I informed him of it Nov. 9th and he said he would see to it. I can not get him to do anything unless I threaten to resign and am tired doing that.\n\nYou have told me to communicate through the agent. I have tried that several times and it had no effect. Therefore I write direct to you when I want service. If this is not satisfactory other arrangement will have to be made for communications.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith,\nTeacher-in-Charge.\nOttawa, November 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, and in reply have to inform you that an advance of $100 on your salary for the current quarter will be sent you as requested.\n\nRelative to the request contained in your letter of the 5th instant that a midday lunch for the pupils of the Oka Country Indian Day School be started from December 1st, next, I have to inform you that Mr. Agent Harbour was informed on the 9th instant that the Department would approve of Mrs. Smith preparing and serving the lunch from the date mentioned and would be allowed the sum of $15 per month for this service, which is to include the supplying of the food required. Mr. Harbour was instructed to inform you accordingly, and that you might arrange for the serving of same, commencing on the date mentioned and continuing until the end of March, next. The Agent is to prepare a voucher, in duplicate, from time to time, for the amount due Mrs. Smith, which he is to forward to the Department for payment.\n\nRegarding the repairs required to the pump, I have to say that we are requesting Mr. Agent Harbour to have this pump placed in good condition at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nAlbert E. Smith, Esq.,\nTeacher, Oka Country Indian Day School,\nOka, P.Q.\nOttawa, November 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of the 9th instant, regarding the serving of a midday lunch to the pupils of the Oka Country Indian Day School from December 1st, next. The teacher has again written the Department in connection with this matter. You will please be good enough to inform Mr. Smith, the teacher, of the arrangement approved in the above mentioned letter regarding the preparing and serving of the lunch from December 1st, next, to the end of March, following. The Department cannot understand your delay in complying with instructions.\n\nThe pump in the residence at the Country School is leaking. You will please be good enough to arrange to have this pump repaired and placed in good condition at the earliest possible date. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and when the pump has been repaired, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Harbour, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, P.Q.\n16th November, 1931.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nOn a recent visit to Oka my attention was drawn to the need of a garage at the Country Indian Day School. Mr. Smith has to rent an old building from an adjoining Indian to keep his car in during the winter. A garage is really a necessity here and I would recommend that one be built as soon as funds are available.\n\nAttendance is irregular at this school, some families not sending their children to school. In my report upon this agency I have recommended a monthly patrol by a member of the R.C.M.P. Police in the capacity of truant officer. I believe this would have a very good effect upon the average attendance, particularly of those pupils whose parents are neglectful or in some cases opposed to sending their children.\n\nInspector.\nCountry School,\nOka, Que.,\nDec. 3, 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs soon as possible I should like to know the amount your department is prepared to allow this school for the purchase of candy for the children's tree at Christmas.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert T. Smith.\n\nIndian Affairs.
