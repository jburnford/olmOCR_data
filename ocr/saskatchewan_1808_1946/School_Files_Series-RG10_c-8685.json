Star, to the File Hills Residential School. The application form stated that the girl's religion is \"Protestant\", and the form was apparently signed by the father. Therefore, the application form appeared in order and her admission was approved.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of a protest against her admission to that school. Our informant states that both the parents of this girl are Roman Catholic.\n\nPlease make immediate enquiries and let the Department have any information you obtain. In replying, you should state what action you took before signing the application for her admission to File Hills to assure yourself that the statements made on the application form were correct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His wife was a Roman Catholic. These mixed marriages, are, as you know, the cause of a great deal of trouble with regard to the religion of the children as both denominations claim them. In the far greater number of cases the children attend the R.C. School. In the case of these mixed marriages I have always found it wisest not to interfere at all but to allow the parents to choose which school they would send their children to.\n\nEdith Starr started to attend File Hills School in August, 1932, but she was not a residential pupil as she came home to her meals and slept at home. He mother died last September and her father afterwards had her admitted to File Hills School. Both Father Comeau and Father Leonard have been to see Starr with regard to his daughter and have asked him to sign application forms to have her admitted to Qu'Appelle School and he has consistently refused to do so. I have him in the office again this morning, read him your letter and asked him if he was a Roman Catholic. He denied it and stated further that he does not intend to allow to have his child taken away from File Hills School. I recommend that she be left where she is.\n\nI might add that Mrs. Starr was a widow when she married Edward Starr and had three children by her former husband. Ed. Starr never interfered with these children in any way and they were educated at Qu'Appelle School. The girl above referred to is Starr's only own child.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 14, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, protesting against the admission of Edith Starr to the File Hills Residential School, I beg to say that the following report has been received from Mr. Agent Dodds\u2014\n\n\"This man is a Protestant and is a graduate of File Hills Residential School.

If so, you should let me know if the father signed the application for her admission to the File Hills School of his own free will.

He was baptized and married by a Roman Catholic Priest, and registered at the Mission of Lebret some years before I was charged of the Mission. He was attending at the Church every chance he had; when he was missing some times at the service, I was asking his Mrs. why he was not present? She told me that it was on account of his work and afraid to lose his position, for you know she added: \"being Catholic...\" Edith, his daughter, was baptized by the Missionary and Edward never objected to it, as a good catholic. So, If there is a change now, it is only since a year or two, under the influences of others, because all the 10 years, I knew him, he was always well disposed, showed himself a true Catholic and attended the Church every chance he had.\n\nRev. Geo. Jeannotte, O.M.I.\n\nAnd I make this statement believing it to be of the same force and effect as if made under oath, by virtue of the Canada Evidence Act.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6308, file 653-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.,\nApril 5th, 1934.\n\nLetter # 10733.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 14th, No.111-1-10, with regard to the admission of Ethel Star to the File Hills School, I note that Mr. Fodde refers to Ms. Star as a Protestant and to his marriage as a \"mixed marriage\". This is not the case. Ms. Star was converted before her marriage and was received into the Roman Catholic Church on May 7th, 1919, by Rev. Father Kalmas, his Godparents were John Bellegarde and Marie Louise Dumont. On the same day he married Eliza Cayen, witnesses - Magloire Bellegarde and William Desnami. This is recorded in the Church Register and can be supported by Statutory Declarations, if necessary, from the parties above mentioned. This, then, was not a mixed marriage as both parties were Roman Catholics.\n\nI am enclosing Statutory Declaration from Rev. Father Jeannotte to show that he was practicing the Catholic Religion and was considered a Catholic by the other Indians. Rev. Father Comeau, who succeeded Rev. Father Jeannotte as missionary at File Hills, also certifies that he has been practicing his religion during the two years he has been in charge. If further proof were needed to establish his religion it would be found in the fact that his nephew, Donald Star, born June 1930, (son of Sidney Star, a Protestant, and Jane Wake Up), whom he adopted, was baptized a Roman Catholic Oct. 5th, 1931. There was surely no reason for him having the boy brought up a Catholic if he himself was not a Catholic.\n\nIt would seem incredible that Mr. Fodde was not aware that Star was a Catholic, as he worked at the Agency and the Catholic Church is only a few yams from the Agency.\n\nMr. Fodde also makes the statement with reference to the children of mixed marriages: \"In the far greater number of cases the children attend the R.C.School\". It would be interesting to know where he got the statistics on this, certainly not from the records of his Agency. I can say that we have not a single pupil here who is the offspring of a mixed marriage, and the Department need only examine our Quarterly Returns to verify this. On the other hand we are aware of several attending not only File Hills School but other Protestant schools.\n\nMr. Fodde told Father Comeau that Ethel was only going to school during the day as her health was poor. Mr. Shores, Principal of File Hills School, made a similar statement to me. From this it would appear that they recognized her as a Roman Catholic.\n\nI never asked Ms. Star to sign any form of admission but I simply told him he should bring his daughter to Lebret and he never gave me a definite answer, and said that his daughter was only a day pupil at File Hills.\n\nTrusting you will reconsider your decision in this case.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Star as Protestant and to his marriage as a \"mixed marriage\". This is not the case. Ed. Star was converted before his marriage and was received into the Roman Catholic Church on May 7th, 1895, by Rev. Father Kemez. His godparents were John Bellagarde and Louise Leclerc Dumont. On the same day he married Elisa Cayen, witnesses - Maglorie Bellagarde and William Desmarchais. This is recorded in the Church Register and can be supported by Statutory Declarations, if necessary, from the parties above mentioned. This, then, was not a mixed marriage as both parties were Roman Catholics.\n\n\"I am enclosing Statutory Declaration from Rev.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. Dodds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSTATUTORY DECLARATION\n\nCanada\n\nProvince of Saskatchewan\n\nTo wit:\n\nI, Edward Starr of the post office of Balcarres, in the Province of Saskatchewan, Do solemnly Declare\n\nThat I, Edward Starr, am a member of the United Church of Canada, at the present time, April 18th, 1934, and am not a member of the Roman Catholic Faith, that I want my child, Edith Starr, admitted to File Hills Residential School, and that there has been no pressure of any kind put on me to sign this declaration, which I am doing of my own free will.\n\nSolemnly declared before me at Balcarres, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 18th day of April, 1934\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge Doree\nIndian Agent\nSchool, his parents will want him to attend File Hills School, as both his parents attended File Hills School as also did his stepfather. According to the Rev. Father Lomax this boy is now a Roman Catholic but it is easy to see that it would be unfair to place the child in a Roman Catholic School.\n\nI consider that the whole of the Rev. Father's argument beside the point. What I take into consideration is that Edward Starr was brought up in an United Church residential school. He now swears he is a Protestant and he wishes that his child be admitted to a United Church School. I think we should accede to his request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBalcarres, Sask.,\nApril 19, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter lll-l-10, dated the 13th instant, regarding Edith Starr.\n\nI do not want to enter into any controversy with the priests or any other missionaries regarding the admittance of children to school because it will only lead to ill feeling. I think I am in the best position to judge which school a child should be sent to and I have already told the Department that I think Edith Starr should be admitted to File Hills School.\n\nWe have, on this Agency both a Roman Catholic and a United Church missionary and in a great number of cases both of them can produce records to show Indians have been baptised and are members of their church. What naturally happens is that Indians that have attended Protestant schools often attend Roman Catholic church services and those that have attended Roman Catholic schools often attend United Church services. I have seen this myself on many occasions. When this has occurred it seems that the priests have got the Indians to be baptised and then entered them as members as their church and it is this proof that the Rev. Father Leonard is advancing.\n\nThe attitude I have always taken is this. In the case where the parents are pagan I allow the children to enter any school the parents wishes. In the case where both parents have attended a Protestant School I see that the children attend the same kind of school and in the case of Roman Catholics I see the children attend a Roman Catholic School. When one of the parents is a Roman Catholic and the other a Protestant I allow the parents to decide. In far the most cases they decide to send their children to Lebret and in that case there is no trouble. When however, as in the present case, the parents decide to send the children to File Hills School the admission is always protested by the R.C. missionary or the Principal of Qu'Appelle School.\n\nI never told the Rev. Father Comeau that Edith Starr was attending File Hills School because she was in poor health. She attended File Hills School because of the wishes of her parents and she was not admitted as a residential pupil until after her mother died. It was the desire of her mother as well as her father that Edith should attend File Hills School and she spoke to me about on many occasions.\n\nI have had Starr in the office again today and have him to state definitely what religious denomination he belongs to and what school he wishes Edith to attend. I have had him sign a declaration to the effect that he belongs to the United Church and wishes Edith to attend File Hills School.\n\nI also spoke to him about Donald, the child of Sidney Star he kept for a year or so and he says that if Donald was baptised as a Roman Catholic he never knew anything about it. As a matter of fact this boy has now gone home to his parents and undoubtedly when the time for him comes to attend...\nOttawa, May 1st, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 5th ultimo, regarding Edward Starr, father of Edith Starr, Mr. Agent Dedds was again written. His reply has just been received and also a statutory declaration from Edward Starr, in which he (Edward Starr) states definitely that he is not a member of the Roman Catholic Church. He further states that there has been no pressure of any kind put on him to sign a statutory declaration.\n\nIn view of the above information from the father and keeping in mind the intention of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act, the Department considers that his daughter, Edith Starr, is eligible for admission to the File Hills School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I wish to draw your special attention to the last paragraph of circular letter of November 12th, 1926, which reads as follows:\n\n\"I am particularly desirous, at the present time, of impressing on you that pupils whose eligibility is doubtful - either for religious or other reasons - must not be placed in a residential school until all the facts are known to the Department and a decision has been given.\"\n\nThe Department trusts that you will watch all applications in future for the admission of children to any Indian residential school, and if there is any doubt whatever regarding the eligibility of a child, the matter should be reported to the Department and our decision obtained before the child is placed in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He, Bear has a stiff knee and is unable to walk without a strong cane (stick) and cannot do any heavy work, hence their reason for asking to place their children in a Residential School, as they become of age. Which I recommend.\n\nOn August the 9th., I called on the Bears at their home where they, Bear and his wife, signed application for admission. These I immediately forwarded to Mr. F. Rhodes, Principal of the School, suggesting that he have the boys examined, and certificate of health completed before leaving Prince Albert when he came there for other pupils returning to School after the vacations.\n\nThough informed to do so on a certain date Bear's two boys did not come to Prince Albert, and were left behind. I later saw Bear who stated he had no means of transportation from the reserve to Prince Albert, and that although he had asked another Indian to bring the boys along with his children he had not called for them. The two boys are still at the reserve, and are attending the day school there.\n\nMr. F. Rhodes called me on long distance phone this P.M. stating he would be at Prince Albert on Wednesday the 27th., instant, and would go from there to John Smith's Reserve for the boys, provided there is no objection to them being placed in his school, adding that he had been informed in writing that his Lordship Bishop Board, of Prince Albert objected to Anglican children from another reserve and agency being placed in his school. In reply to Mr. Rhodes I said that I had never heard of such an objection.\n\nMr. Rhodes then asked me if I would inform the Department on the matter, and let him know their decision before he came to Prince Albert on the 27th., stating he did not want to bring the children to File Hills, and then have them transferred somewhere else.\n\n(1)\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, November 23, 1935\n\nC.

And that's what I was looking for.\n\nWell as times went on, we had a visit from Miss French, the Deaconess, telling us that our children were to be Rechristened, and she wanted me to be christened also. She said that time if I did it so that the Protestant minister would put my children out of their School, and another time I was visiting my children at the School. The Principal told me that he was training the children in Religion, which he did not want them to drop when they leave School. So this is not what I wanted him to do. I guess he thought I had forgotten what application we had, when I was leaving my children in his care. So I thought it was time for me to do something for my children.\n\nAnd another time this Summer Mr. Dodds.\nOur Indian Agent drove up to my place and I asked about a transfer for my children. He told me he would too if he was in my place, while he was still here the Principal and Miss French drove up, and the Agent told him about it. The Principal said he could not do anything, it was up to the Parents.\n\nSeeing it was up to me I thought I would kindly ask in His Majesty Service the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to granted me a transfer for my children from the File Hills Indian School to Kebet Indian School, so we won't have anymore trouble with our children.\n\nWishing this transfer will be granted.\n\nYours,\n\nValley Nikassin\nCOPY OF STATUTARY DECLARATION.\n\nPROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nI, Alex. Nokusis, of Peepeekisis Band, File Hills Indian Agency, do solemnly declare that I have applied for admission to the File Hills Residential School for my two children, Morris Nokusis and Mildred Nokusis, that I have made this application of my own free will and accord and that I have not been influenced in any way either by any of the staff of the File Hills School or the staff of the File Hills Agency. That my wife is a member of the United Church and I am a member of the Roman Catholic Church but that I have agreed to have our children be educated by the File Hills Residential School.\n\nAs signed.....George A.Dodds.\nIndian Agent.\n\nDeclared before me at the File Hills Agency, in the said Province of Saskatchewan, this 17th day of November 1930.\n\nAs signed...Alex Nokusis.\nBalcarres, Sask.\nJan. 8th. 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter lll-1-10 dated the 29th ultimo, in connection with application of Mildred and Maurice Nokusis for admission to File Hills Residential School.\n\nThe father of these children is an ex-pupil of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School and the mother is an ex-pupil of File Hills Residential School. It appears that the parents do not seem particular what service they attend, Mrs. Nokusis has been to the R.C. service and her husband has been to the United Church service. I would say though that each is still a member of the church in which they were raised. I am aware of the extreme caution that must be exercised in cases of this nature, consequently when the application came forward and I noticed that it was signed by Alex. Nokusis, I had him sign a declaration which I am attaching hereto. I also brought the matter to your attention.\n\nBefore I forwarded the applications, I considered this matter very carefully and came to the conclusion that where the different churches have equal claims, the wishes of the parents should be the deciding factor. I am satisfied that these people have been influenced by no one and have made the decision themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAs signed....George A Dodds.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter No.111-1-10 of the 14th instant, regarding letter from Alex. Nokusis of this Reserve re education of his children.\n\nI am attaching herewith a declaration and letter dated 1930 which were sent to the Department, proving the care taken in the first place in placing these children in school. I am also attaching a letter dated Octr.20th,1936 from Nokusis giving his reasons why he wants his children transferred to the Qu'Appelle Indian School.\n\nI have conferred with Mr. Rhodes, the Principal of the File Hills School on this matter, and he informed me that no concessions were given to the Nokusis children when they were placed in school, that they were to be taught the same as the other pupils and to which Alex. Nokusis agreed. Mr. Rhodes repudiates the statements in Nokusis's letter, which I do too.\n\nIn view of previous correspondence and in all fairness to the children, I would recommend they be kept in the File Hills School.\n\nOn Octr. 12th,1936 I received from the Qu'Appelle Indian School for admission of George, another son of this man. I wrote to the Principal of this school stating I was holding the forms here meanwhile, and explained to him that three of the Nokusis children were in the File Hills School and I did not like to see the family split up so. I now learn that Nokusis signed an application for the same child to be admitted to the File Hills School near the end of July 1936. The Qu'Appelle school application is dated Sept.15th,1936.\n\nTrusting to have your verdict on this matter as soon as convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. A. Dodds,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

I.\n\nIn reviewing all the correspondence in connection with these applications, it will be noted that all parties concerned were agreed that the father, Alex Nokusis, is recognized as a Roman Catholic but, apparently, both the father and mother wished their children at that time admitted in the File Hills Residential School and it will be specially noted that, in the letter addressed to Rev. Father Leonard on February 16, 1931, the decision to approve their admission to the File Hills School was based on the wishes of the parents.\n\nOn this file will be found a letter dated October 6, 1936, from Alex Nokusis, requesting the transfer of his children from the File Hills School to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is, also, on this file, Agent Dodds' letter of October 19, 1936.\n\nIt appears from this correspondence that Nokusis is now desirous of having his children educated under the religious auspices of the Church to which he himself belongs. It has not been our practice in the past to transfer children from one Indian residential school to another conducted under different religious auspices, but we have, in cases such as this, discharged the children.\n\nIn view of the fact that Nokusis has been recognized as a Roman Catholic for years and the further fact that our first decision regarding the placing of the two older children in the File Hills School was based on the wishes of the parents, I consider that when Nokusis now wishes his younger child placed in the Qu'Appelle School, the Department should accede to this request. Accordingly, official letter of today's date is being directed to the Agent.\nOttawa, February 16, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your 10487 of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the application of the children of Alex. Nokusia for the File Hills Residential School. When the Department has before it an application where the religion is in doubt, we first give prominence to the belief of the parents. If the parents are in disagreement, the father has the right to direct the religious education of his child. In this case, the father is Catholic and the mother, Protestant; but they are not in disagreement, as the father has asked for a Protestant education for his children, without being influenced by anyone. If a case like this were taken to court, you would find that in law it is the wishes of the parents that would be regarded. In the Stonechild case, the parents were not in entire agreement - the father having signed a statement that he wanted his boy in the File Hills School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

If the provisions of the Indian Act had been strictly followed, his children would not have been placed in the File Hills Indian Residential School. However, at that time the Department decided, in view of the express desire of the father to send them to File Hills, to approve the admission of the children to that school.\n\nIt is now definitely established that Nokusis desires his children educated in a school conducted under the auspices of the religion to which he belongs. It is felt that his wishes should now be respected in the same manner as they were respected in 1931 and, consequently, the Department is prepared to approve the admission of George Nokusis to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. You should, therefore, forward the usual application form and certificate of health for our consideration.\n\nWhen children are once admitted to a residential school, it has not been our practice to transfer them to another school conducted under different religious auspices. However, when the parents insist, the Department will always granted the discharge of the children. You should, therefore, inform the Principal of the File Hills Residential School that we desire Maurice Nokusis - No. 164; and Mildred Nokusis - No. 0190; to be returned to their father at the end of December.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Being a half-breed he is a little difficult for us to look after, and we were wondering if he could be put in the File Hills Indian Reserve School at Balcarres. He is a Protestant. Several of the Catholic Indian Schools will accept our Catholic half-breed children and we thought that perhaps all we had to do was to write Mr. Rodes and make arrangements for the keep of this boy. However, he advises that he could not take the boy without your consent. We are willing, of course, to pay a reasonable amount by way of maintenance. We pay the Catholic schools $12.50 per month.\n\nWe should be glad to know whether or not we can make such arrangements with this particular school or any other Protestant schools in the province.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nL.B.

You request that he be admitted to the File Hills Indian Residential School and state that the Province of Saskatchewan will allow $12.50 a month for his maintenance. In this regard, I may say that the File Hills School has the full number of pupils for which accommodation can be provided and, therefore, this boy cannot be accepted.\n\nIt is noted that you state that you have placed several half-breed children in other Indian residential schools and it is presumed that you are paying for the maintenance of each of these.

I beg to inform you,\nWhen I made the application for admission of\nmy children to the File Hills school, I made\nit understand between the principal and\nmyself, that I was putting my children in\nhis care not for Religion. Because if I was\nputting them for religion I would put them\ndown at Lebret Indian school and he took\nit up all well me that he would take them\nin for Education only and that was what\nI was looking for.

And another time I was\nmeeting my children at the school, the principal told me that he was training them a religion which he did not want them to drop when they leave school. So this is not what I wanted him to do. I guess he thought I had forgotten what application we had made when I was leaving my children in his care and so I thought it was time for me to do something for my children. One day the Indian agent drove up to my place. I asked him about a transfer of my children. Well he told me he would too if he was in my place. While he was still here the Principal and Miss French drove up. So the Indian agent told him the story. The principal said he could not do anything it was up to the parents. Seeing it was up to me, I thought I would kindly ask in His Majesty's service. The Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs granted me a transfer for my children from the File Hills Indian School to the Lebret Indian School.\nSo we won't have any more trouble with my children.\n\nWishing this transfer will be granted\n\nYours\n[Signature]\n\n(P.S.)\nThis is the letter I wrote when you asked for my reason through the Indian office at File Hills.

I may say that this boy is a half-breed and not a ward of your Department. We find it very difficult to handle half-breed children, and that is the reason we were trying to get him into the Indian School. I may say that at the present time we have several half-breed children in the Muscowequan Indian School at Lestock. We have also boarded some at times in the Indian School at Lebret.\n\nI am sorry that you cannot allow us to place this boy in the File Hills School.

If this Department adopted as a general principle the acceptance of half-breeds for whose maintenance the provincial department is responsible, many difficulties are very likely to arise. Although it is our desire to co-operate with provincial departments as far as possible, it is not considered advisable to use accommodation for this purpose that is required for treaty Indian children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

It is noted from this correspondence that all parties concerned at that time were agreed that the father, Alex Nokusis, was recognized as a Roman Catholic. If the provisions of the Indian Act had been strictly followed, his children would not have been placed in the File Hills Indian Residential School. However, in view of the express desire of the father to send them to File Hills, the Department decided to approve their admission, at that time, to the File Hills School.\n\nIt is now definitely established that Nokusis desires his children educated in a school conducted under the auspices of the religion to which he belongs. It is felt that his wishes should now be respected in the same manner as they were respected in 1931. When similar cases arise in connection with other Indian residential schools, it has been our practice to grant the discharge of the children and, therefore, Mr. Agent Dodds was notified to advise you that the Nokusis children should be discharged from the File Hills Residential School at the end of December. I feel certain that you will cooperate with the Department in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nF. Rhodes, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nFile Hills Indian Res.

The pension which is administered by the agent includes allowances for his wife and children. The children are attending the Indian Residential School and are therefore wards of the state. From enquiries at the Department of Pensions and National Health it would appear that it is not customary to pay pension allowances for children who are otherwise provided for by the state. The children's proportion of the pension should be paid the department for the period the children are attending the residential school.\nJanuary 14, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nWith reference to your recent memorandum, it is noted that the official of the Auditor General's Department points out that, when the children of Alex. Nokis are attending an Indian residential school, the pension money allowed for their maintenance should be paid to the Department rather than to the father.\n\nAs far as the Department is aware at the present time, none of this man's children are at an Indian residential school. Two of them were attending the File Hills School but were supposed to leave that school at the end of December, 1936.\n\nA note is being made on our file and, in the event of Nokis applying for the admission of his children to any Indian residential school in future, it will be kept in mind that arrangements must be made to have any pension allowed for these children forwarded to the Department rather than to the father.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJanuary 1st 1937\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the FILE HILLS Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: James Keepness.\nAge: 8 Years.\nName of Band: Muscowpetung.\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 115.\nFather's full name and No.: John Keepness #160 Pasqua Band.\nMother's full name and No.: Elsie Keepness #115 Muscowpetung Band.\nParents living or dead: Living.\nState of child's health: Good.\nReligion: Protestant (United Church).\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes.\nPreviously attended: None.\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Mr. Rhodes requested that I apprehend this truant.\n\n1. PASUA was described as 13 years, slim build, 105-110 pounds, wearing blue overalls, brown suit coat, dirty brown cap and leather boots. The boots and clothing would be stamped with the school number \"21\".\n\n2. I patrolled immediately per Pol. Car Ford Code 1629 to the Pasqua Reserve where I contacted Mr. Platman, Labourer at the Qu'Appelle Agency and questioned him as to whether he had seen PASUA. Patrol then continued to the home of Mr. PASUA. Victor's father, but the boy had not yet arrived there and although several other homes on the reserve at which this boy might be found were visited, we were unable to locate him.\n\n3. Patrol then returned to the detachment, arriving here at approximately 5 p.m. On the return home the police car became stuck in a mud hole, necessitating the hire of a team to pull it out of the hole.\n\nIn the p.m. of this date while returning from the Muscowpetung Reserve on other police business I called at John PASUA's home and found Victor there. The boy was then returned to this detachment, and because of the pressing nature of police business I applied the 1629 to Balcarres Detachment and requested that a member of that detachment patrol to Fort Qu'Appelle to escort this truant to the File Hills School. This request was granted and in the late p.m. of this date Cst. Woodward arrived at this detachment and PASUA was handed over to him for escort to the school.\n\nExtra copy of this report attached for the information of Balcarres Detachment.\n\nHANDED OVER TO DEPT.

I have also to refer to that portion of your letter of the same file number, in which you state that steps should be taken to remove the tubercular cattle at once and to put the new milch cows in their place as soon as possible. I have to inform you that, in the opinion of the Department, it would be better to arrange for the shipment of the new stock when the barn is completed. The danger of infection in an old barn, where tubercular cattle have been, makes such action advisable.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn from you whether Balcarree is the most suitable point for unloading. It would be necessary for Mr. Agent Deacon to arrange for an officer and boys from each school to take the cattle to their final destinations. Twenty animals will be for the Qu'Appelle School and ten for the File Hills Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st inst. with reference to the supplying of milch cows for the Qu'Appelle and File Hills Residential Schools.\n\nYou seem to have some concern about the cattle coming in contact with the existing barns at the latter institution. In reply I would say that during the summer months the cattle need not go near the barns at all, but would be pastured and brought to corral at night for milking purposes.\n\nBalcarres would be the most suitable place to unload the cattle, being about nine miles to Lebrat. However, I do not think that ten cows will be sufficient for the File Hills School. I would ask that this be placed at fifteen, and at least 25 be sent to Qu'Appelle. Care should be taken however to see that some of the cows will come in to milk in the late fall, as I do not wish to have all of the cows milking at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 7, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 306-11A of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the new milch cows for the Qu'Appelle and Pine Hills Indian Residential Schools. I have noted that it will be quite in order to arrange for the shipment of these cattle before the new barn at Qu'Appelle is completed. It would be advisable to instruct the principal at this institution not to permit these cattle to be placed in the old barn, if they arrive before the new one is completed. I have also noted your recommendation that 40 head be purchased and I have to inform you that, if the funds at our disposal for this purpose are sufficient to cover the purchase price of the extra cattle, they will be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 12-1 of the 28th instant, with reference to the purchase of Holstein cattle for two Indian residential schools in Saskatchewan. I have noted your estimate, and in reply I beg to state you are authorized to arrange for the purchase of 40 head. These animals should be tubercular tested and should be shipped some time within the next six weeks, if possible. Please requisition for an accountable cheque, when you are ready to make the purchases and arrange for the transportation to the West.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aest.

As Balcarres is the best destination for the shipment, they are being addressed to you and en route will be cared for by a man engaged for the purpose. The freight charges are prepaid and it will be necessary for you to get in touch with the principals of the two institutions and arrange to have a member of the staff and boys, in each case, at Balcarres to drive the cattle to the schools. I should be pleased if you would ensure proper care for these animals when they arrive at their destination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. L.

Arrangements have been made to have the animals detrain at Balcarres, Sask., under the supervision of Mr. Indian Agent Deacon. You should get in touch with Mr. Deacon, who will advise you when the cattle arrive. You would do well to arrange for a member of your staff and several boys to be at Balcarres, for the purpose of driving the cattle to the File Hills School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I was informed by Mr. R.H. Abraham, the Department's Agricultural Representative, that only forty head had been purchased, fifteen of which were for the File Hills Boarding and twenty-five for the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. As forty-two arrived I gave File Hills sixteen and Qu'Appelle School twenty-six.\n\nIn making the distribution I took care that each school had their correct proportion of cows coming fresh each month. Both Father Leonard and Mr Rhodes were satisfied with the division.\n\nThe cattle arrived here in excellent condition.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nWhm.

We note that both Principals were satisfied with the distribution, and that the cows arrived at Balcarres in excellent condition. It is hoped, now that the cattle have been delivered, that there will be a sufficient and regular supply of milk for the pupils of each of these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The increase effected in garden acreage is due to a great extent to the co-operation given this Office by the Principals of the Qu'Appelle and File Hills Residential Schools. Every family who had children attending either of these two schools, and had prepared a suitable garden plot in time in May were permitted to have their children home to assist in planting. The Principal of each school accompanied me on a separate tour of inspection of the plots prepared for this purpose. The children were permitted to be home from Friday until Sunday of the same week. Only one child failed to return to school within the allotted time. It is planned to follow up by a similar inspection before the children complete their summer vacation.\n\nS.H.

I am aware that, at the United Church Conference, there was a resolution in this connection, but it is my opinion that the intention was to discourage cadet corps in the public schools in Canada. Residential schools are another proposition, and I believe you will find that a cadet corps at an Indian institution will assist greatly with both the esprit de corps and the discipline. You, of course, are on the ground and know what is best for the File Hills School, but I am of the opinion that you should seriously consider the matter before taking drastic action. Might I have a report from you in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nF.

I may say that at this School there is a certain amount of military discipline maintained at all times, more so than in Public Schools, as there the Boys only gather together for a short period each day, whilst in the Residential Schools they are together all the time and are constantly under supervision.\n\nI cannot quite understand the concern of the District Cadet Officer for M.D.12 at the disbanding of our Corps, he seemed to be quite perturbed when I was talking the matter over with him last August. I explained to him that we had no facilities at this School for carrying on Drills, Musketry etc., the only room of any size in this Building is the Dining room which is 16 feet wide and 75 feet long, to prepare this room for Cadet activities necessitates removing 9 large Dining tables and 18 Benches, quite a lot of exercise in itself, regarding Musketry practice, we have not any place where this can be carried out, true we might take up theory but that becomes very dry and uninteresting in time as I know from practical experience, I have made several requests for an addition to the Building with the view of having a large playroom or Gymnasium in the Basement, this would give us training facilities without the necessity of the Boys having to do such extensive manual labour to prepare the room.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Tea and 50 lbs of dried apples, this ought to be done, anyway until the parents are in a better position and are able to start their children off to school, with their dinners, for some of the children live four miles away from...\nthe school and cannot go home on the\nfestival days.\n\nI should also ask for an appropriation\nof $200 for each school.\n\nIf there was a doubt at all in my\nmind as to whether these schools will\nprove a success I would not make\nthis demand, but the matter of educat-\ning the children is going to change the\nways of the Indians and half-breeds\naltogether, as they will have something\nmore to keep them constantly on their\nReserve.\n\nI visited Mr. Owen's today on Cowan\nReserve and was really pleased to see\nthe children; how eager they were to\nlearn, and how happy they seemed to be.\n\nMy object in having such a good\nupstairs to the houses I propose erect-\ning is, because I am sure that if we\nmake the school teachers comfortable\nthey will take so much more interest\nin their work.\n\nSince commencing this letter I\nhave received yours of the 15th inst.

In taking this matter into consideration I suppose the boarding school already established in the Touchwood Hills District under the auspices of your Church, and the fact that Elkhorn Institution, also under the auspices of your Church, (which, I may say, by the way, has very few pupils in it,) were both considered.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSargent.\n\nQu'Appelle.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSt. John's College,\nQu'Appelle Station\nN.W.T.

La Huppe\nSir,\n\nI beg to remind you that you gave me to understand when I saw you at Qu'Appelle that you would do something to restore the salary to me which was taken away some time ago. What you did then was simply this, with one hand you gave a possible $240.00 and with the other you immediately withdrew a certain $400.00. A reduction to me of $160.00 for no other reason than because I had undertaken to do three times my previous work, in fact because I sought to do real work in advancing the Department's work instead of the uncertain and unsatisfactory work of a day school.\n\nI should have stated above that it is impossible now to obtain $240 for teaching here as the school has been reduced by five taken to Elkhorn last Spring and two others withdrawn for fear we should send them there. There are also three more likely to be sent there soon again, also one already withdrawn through\nthrough fear that we meant to send him away. Elkhorn ought, with its superior grant and its larger numbers and the cost of depleting ours and others, be a paying concern from a business point of view. But this school has to provide pupils there and replenish our number from a distance with less per capita and no salary. How this is to be done I cannot quite see for I cannot go even as far as Poor Man's free altogether from expense.\n\nThe church has not hitherto offered to bear my extra expense on any such expedition and in justice they should not be asked.\n\nWhen I was appointed here I was made to understand that the Government would (give?) half my stipend.\n\nI am not aware that Mr Dennehey is (in?) any better fix, but I do know that with less efficient and expensive help than mine he cannot make both ends meet, but is getting like myself deeper and deeper and deeper into debt on account of his school. There are others too who receive more help than we do from church sources no better off as far as debts are concerned.\n\nThe matter will I hope receive your best and most favourable consideration. I see that in granting aid to the Industrial schools you adopt the plan of considering their cost of living at the places. Some such plan ought to be found of paying these schools too. But by all means let us know your scale of payments and also let us that have the work to do receive regular salaries.\nsalaries and not be dependent on the caprices of Indian parents for our sustenance. Our expenses too in procuring children from a distance should not fall upon us even when we do receive salaries. Say so much for each child secured from Poor Man and Day Star and more from Fishing Lake and Nut Lake or refund our expenses.\n\nThe scheme of Boarding schools is undoubtedly worth carrying on, but they cannot be carried on properly unless the Department will come to their rescue. The churches are doing all in their power.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nOwen Owens.\n\nHayter Reed Esq.\nDept Supt General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOFFICE OF THE\nIndian Commissioner,\nNORTH-WEST TERRITORIES\n\nOctober 19th 1893\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith\nthe copy of a letter received this morning from the\nRev Owen Owens, Principal of the Boarding School\non Gordon's Reserve in the Torchwood Agency.

It has been fixed after careful consideration, and after experience has proved that it is sufficient to provide for what is expected from schools of the class.\n\nThe Department cannot undertake to make any special provision for canvassing the Reserves for pupils, but through its Agents and employees does all it can to persuade parents to send their children, and will bring such pressure to bear upon them under recently acquired powers as its knowledge of the condition of the Bands concerned shows to be advisable; and in fact heartily co-operate with the church in every way within its power.\n\nAlthough no special provision can be made for teaching farming a large garden should be cultivated and some farming done, not only with a view to teaching the pupils, but also as a means of contributing to the maintenance of the school, and no doubt occasional direction and assistance could be had from the Reserve Farming Instructor. The Department would willingly do more in various educational directions, but the aggregate cost throughout the country has become so large that it is with great difficulty that it can find the funds to pay for what is already being done, and what money is available\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, and in reply to point out that such as the Department regrets that Your Lordship should be disappointed with regard to the Day Schools; it is, for the reason already given, powerless to remedy the matter.\n\nThe policy of establishing Boarding Schools was adopted for the very purpose of absorbing and doing away with Day Schools, and even when that is strictly carried out the additional cost of maintaining Boarding Schools is very heavy. To open Day Schools at Touchwood Hills would therefore be to stultify our own policy, and also to militate against the success of the Boarding School.\n\nTo show that there is no discrimination against the Touchwood Agency I may mention that when a Boarding School in connection with the Roman Catholic Church was recently opened at Duck Lake three of their Day Schools on Reserves were closed, although they had a much more successful record than the one at Poor Man's ever enjoyed.\n\nWith regard to additional assistance of the Boarding School at Gordon's Reserve, what was meant was that provision would be made to increase the\n\nHis Lordship\n\nThe Bishop of Qu'Appelle,\n\nBishop's Court,\n\nQu'Appelle, N.W.T.\n131947\n\nDear Mr. Reid,\n\nI hope you are doing well.\n\nI have heard of your difficulties and delays in getting the school started.

I regret that it cannot at present meet Your Lordship's wishes at present and make further provision in this direction unless the school at Day Star's is closed when the sum thus saved might be applied to Gordon's and thus give an addition of 5 pupils, bringing the number up to 27.\n\nThe Department regrets that, as it laid down a principle that the per capita grant was to meet all charges in connection with Boarding Schools, it cannot contribute towards furnishing, and if it departs from this rule, the extra cost entailed would be great.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant,\n\nHis Lordship\n\nThe Bishop of Qu'Appelle\n\nQu'Appelle, N.W.T\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\nIndian School Opened.\n\nTouchwood, Oct. 15.\u2014The opening of the new Church of England school building at Touchwood took place on Friday last, 15th, in the presence of Mr. Wright, the missionary of Touchwood, and the English settlers.\n\nThe building, which has just been finished, is an imposing structure of stone 30 ft. by 40 ft. The interior arrangement is very commodious in all details, containing two large classrooms, a library, a drill room, work room, dairy and store rooms, and separate rooms for the principal, matron and teacher; in short, everything necessary for the best Indian school building in the North-west. We have seen nothing of the quality work that is being done there.\n\nWe may congratulate the government represented as we do, on the admirable work done by Mr. Wright, and Rev. Mr. Owens, who have laboured so hard to bring the Indians to the school. They have worked there for many years, on its commencement they were called upon to select also on the contractor, Mr. Chas. Turner, the mason. The progress of the building was watched with interest by the students, writing, spelling, and maps, which were used in the instruction of such schools.\n\nThere is an air of homeliness and comfort which seems to pervade the whole school.\n\nAs evidence of the interest that is awakened among the Indians, 200 people assembled to take part in the opening exercises of the new Fort Qu'Appelle. In the amiable absence of Mr. Wright, Mr. Owens presided over the service, which was performed by the principal, Mr. Wright, and Rev. Mr. Johnson, of Fort Qu'Appelle, who spoke in a manner which was impressive and was certainly heard by every one of the natives. During the afternoon Mr. Davies, who is an artist of territorial fame took photographs of the missionary and group of the school staff and children run and in the evening Mr. Wright, Mr. Owens, in their well-known hospitable manner invited the Indians to a bounteous supper. After this visitors, particularly those from Fort Qu'Appelle enjoyed an evening, including dancing, so that when the music finally died down it was time to go home. Without referring to the pleasing fact that the new school will benefit the Indians, including several of the chiefs, we may say that the future possibilities of both Christian and heathen which should be realized are great. The future possibilities of this school, and we believe that the same care and support will be given to this the most important mission work of the future, is the real solution to the question of the Indians. It is the only way to bring the Indians into the fold of Christ, and to make them Christians in the land.\u2014(Continued.)\nOttawa, 30th March, 1866.\n\nDear Mr. Davin,\n\nReplying to your note relative to Russell's children being allowed to attend one of the Boarding Schools at Touchwood, I would say that the Department will have no objection to the school he selects taking his children, provided he can make a satisfactory arrangement as to the remuneration to be paid, which will be small. Of course the arrangement can only last so long as there is room in the institution and the presence of Mr. Russell's children will not keep out children of Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have the honour most respectfully to request, that you will kindly inform me why but 30 of the pupils in this school are grand earners. The returns show 34 pupils, but only 30 are paid for. The 34 being authorized by the Department to admission as grand earners.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, February 2nd, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo I beg to say that provision is made in the Parliamentary estimates for 30 pupils at the Gordon's Boarding School, and no grant for any in excess of this number can be paid. The Department pays only for the number provided for, not for the number enrolled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nM. Williams, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Boarding School,\nPunnichy P.O., Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the Department's letter of above date and number inclosing a memorandum of information relating to Indian Boarding schools, also a copy of the contract which the Department proposes to enter into with the Church Authorities for the conduct of such schools,-\n\nI notice the Boarding school on Gordon's reserve is classified as Church Property. I think you will find that this is a government building. This matter has probably been brought to your notice by the Church authorities before this. I shall, after hearing from you on this point, give you all the information I can, so that the building may be put into shape to comply with the Department's requirements.\n\nAs the contract calls for competent farm instructors at the different schools, I think it would be wise to inform the Church authorities at once that a farmer will have to be appointed at Gordon's, so that they could take steps to be\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\non the look out for a good man, and also to provide proper equipment for him to carry on his work. If this matter is left till April we may not get a man till midsummer, and this will mean a summer lost for this line of work.\n\nI hope the Department will be firm and not pay the new grant until the terms of the contract are fully complied with, and I think it is only fair that the church should be notified as to what we expect them to have in the way of a staff, so that they can be ready to earn the grant offered. This school should have a teacher, as I pointed out in my last report on this subject.\n\nI would ask if it is the intention of the Department to insist on qualified teachers being employed. I notice the agreement does not specially mention this.\n\nThere is another matter that I wish to bring to your attention. I notice that the contract states that children under seven years of age are not to be admitted to Boarding schools, notwithstanding the fact that the printed regulations I have today received state specifically that all Indian children between the age of six and fifteen should attend some school. I would point out that unless the Department insists on Industrial and Boarding schools following the same rule, it will seriously work to the disadvantage of the latter. I am satisfied that if\nif the Boarding school here, for instance,\nwaits till every child is seven years of age,\nit will run a very poor chance of getting children\nof Pagan Indians. I think there should be some\nway of stopping children of all schools from\ntaking children into school before they reach\nthe proper age limit, which I think should be\nthe same for all schools. This is often done so\nas to make sure of getting the child. I have\non different occasions pointed out that all\napplications for admission of children to school\nshould come through the Agent of the District\nin which the child lives. If this rule were followed,\nthere would be no children admitted to any school\nbefore the age limit set by the Department. Then\nthere is another point\u2014if children are admitted\nto school without reference to the resident Agent,\nhave to guess the child's age, and a\nchild of five might be taken into the school as\nseven, in order to secure it and make it a wage-\ngrant earner. The Agent's office has a complete record\nof all births and if the plan of admitting children\nto school through that office were followed, the\ndifficulties I have referred to would be obviated.\n\nI hope before very long to make you a report\non the different Boarding schools in this\nInspectorate, so that the Department will be in a\nposition to let the different church authorities\nknow what is required in order to comply with the\ncontract.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 12, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is making further inquiries in reference to the Gordon's Boarding School. This school was erected by the Department, but it would appear to be on Church property, however Mr. Morrison was communicated with sometime ago and a reply is expected from him at any time.\n\nThe question of the appointment of an farming instructor at this school will be left till the whole matter of equipment, staff, etc., is being dealt with.\n\nIn reference to the qualifications of teachers I may say that it is the intention of the Department to insist upon the appointment of competent teachers.\n\nIn regard to the age limit I beg to say that the contract states specifically that children under seven years of age will not be admitted to boarding schools. The Regulations relating to the Education of Indian children state that all children between the ages of 6 and 15 shall attend a day school, but 7 years is the minimum at which they will be admitted to boarding schools.\n\nWherever practicable all applications for admission of Indian children to industrial schools are either sent through the office of the Indian Agent from whose agency the children are recruited or else approved by these officers.\n\nThe Department will await reports on the different\n\nV.

Deputy and Secretary.\nsurprise at your remarks.\n\nI gave you from time to time my reasons for thinking that applications should come through Agents and until such a course is adopted there is bound to be trouble and I think if you were on the ground you would readily see the advantage of acting on the suggestions I have made.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp. of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted and in reply to say that your remarks in the fourth paragraph do not agree with the copy of the regulations sent me. Under Section 9 of the Regulations, a child between the ages of six and fifteen, who is not being educated may be placed in an Industrial or Boarding school until the age of eighteen years.\n\nNow what I wished to point out is that your contract distinctly says one thing and your regulations another, and Industrial schools not covered by the Contract have a decided advantage over the school that is.\n\nI quite understand that it is your intention that these regulations are not to be acted upon without first obtaining your sanction, but I would point out that the Department have furnished Principals of schools and Agents with copies of these regulations, and all a Principal or Agent has to do in nine cases out of ten, when children are found not attending school, is to read clause No 9.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nof the regulations, and the parents at once realize that they must send their children to school. In doing this there is no violation of the regulations. My main object in writing as I did was to point out that children are being admitted to Industrial and Boarding schools at the age of six years and under, and to point out that schools under the contract will be at a disadvantage if they are not placed on the same basis as the schools not under the contract.\n\nI am surprised to learn that you think all applications for admissions to Indian Schools are either sent through the office of the Indian Agent, from whose Agency the children are recruited, or approved by these officers, as this is far from being the case. I have been living quite close to the Qu'Appelle Industrial school for the last fifteen years, and I have never yet known of a single case where the application came through the office. There are over one hundred and fifty children in this Institution from File Hills and Qu'Appelle Agencies, and I am safe in saying none of these children have been admitted through the course you suggest, although it was quite practicable.\n\nThe Department will, I think, find letters on file from me from time to time urging that applications for admissions should go through the Agent's office, and you will naturally understand my surprise.\nmore messages referred to Agent\n3 more messages by Agent at Pasqua\n(see Principal's case)\n13 more received promptly returned\nOttawa, February 21, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the admission of children to boarding and industrial schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Section 9 of the Regulations refers to the committal of children between six and fifteen years of age, not to the \"placing\" of them in industrial and boarding schools. Cases may arise in which it may, in the opinion of the Department, be advisable to enforce this section of the Regulations and in such cases children may be sent to either boarding or industrial schools.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that boarding and industrial schools should be on the same footing and it is proposed to issue instructions to the Principals of industrial schools that in future no children under the age of seven years shall be admitted as grant earners to these institutions, unless they are committed under the Regulations with the approval of the Department.\n\nIn regard to applications for admission of children to schools in your inspectorate I beg to say that an examination of the records has been made and the only school which has been delinquent in carrying out the wishes of the Department in this respect is the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. On April 22nd, 1910, Rev. Father Hugonard was informed that from that time forward all applications would have\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nhave to come through the respective Agents. Since that time one application was returned to be referred to the Agent and three others were admitted, as Father Hugonard stated that they had been passed upon by the Agent, although there was nothing to show that this was the case. Sometime before the receipt of your letter thirteen new applications were received and they were promptly returned. You will see from the above that the Department is carrying out this policy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\nhave at different times secured special funds to wipe out deficits. Gordon School has never received any such special grant so far as I am aware.\n\nWe have now a deficit which has been slowly and gradually accumulating for some years of about $2,000. Do you think the Department will help us, as I understand it has helped other schools, to meet this deficit?\n\nIs there a possibility of an early increase of the per capita grant to the scholars in Gordon? It seems to be expected that the grant will be increased from $75 to say $100 per pupil; if you can send me at your earliest convenience definite information on these two points, I shall be very much obliged.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn Bisdale\nBishop of the Appellee\n\nThe Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nP.S. I may be personally known to you in your dept; as I have been in touch with Indian affairs on the prairie for 37 years.\nSir,\n\nFor a considerable time correspondence has been going on between the Department and the various Christian Bodies, on the subject of the Indian Industrial, Boarding, and Day Schools. This has created an impression on the minds of some that the Government is likely to make important changes in reference to these schools, and, among other things, to increase the per capita grant to the Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nIn this scheme we are specially interested in the Indian Boarding School on Gordon's Reserve in the Touchwood District. Since I became Bishop of Wapella in 1896, I have taken a special personal interest in this school, and have watched its working very closely.\n\nThe per capita grant has been $72 for 30 pupils. Before the building of new railways, the expense of freight from Wapella Station was very great. Articles bought at the nearest stores were expensive. The maintenance and salaries of the necessary staff cost considerable.\n\nFrom church sources, we have depended a lot. Everything is the same undertaking to make both ends meet. I understand that some schools...\nOttawa, March 17th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant, in which you ask the Department to assist in paying off a deficit of $2000.00 incurred by the management of the Gordon's Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that it is regretted that there are no funds available which might be used for this purpose.\n\nIn reference to Your Lordship's enquiry in regard to an increase in the per capita grant to these schools I beg to say that no arrangement for a general increase to boarding schools has been decided upon.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

It is not expected that they would be under the supervision of the school authorities while in their homes, but it is reasonable to require that they should be under supervision while on the road.\n\nIt would be a great convenience to the Department if you would in future send your remarks on the schools in separate communications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Mr. Mark Williams, the Principal of the School, resigned his position in March of this year, and Mr. Dudley Ward has been appointed as Principal and his wife as Matron. Miss Smalley is assistant Matron. We regret that since his appointment Mr. Ward has had a very serious illness, which has incapacitated him for work. Last year Mr. Cooper was appointed to the teaching staff of the School, and Mr. Murison, the Indian Agent, reports very favorably of his work. There is a full complement of scholars, and no difficulty is anticipated in keeping the numbers up to thirty. A new agreement has been entered into with the Indian Department, by which the School will now receive one hundred dollars grant per capita. Part of the new agreement provides that the male pupils are to be instructed in gardening, farming, the care of stock or such industries as are suitable to their local requirements. Steps will have to be taken by the Committee to carry out this part of the agreement.\n\nIt is interesting to note that for the year ending March, 1911, the Principal was able to report a clean bill of health amongst the pupils.\n\nOur best thanks are due to some branches of the Diocesan W. A., and especially to the W. A. in Eastern Canada, for their valuable and generous assistance.\n\nAll the outstanding accounts have been paid.\n\nJ. P. SARGENT, Chairman.\nHe has given much valuable help to the principals during his tenure of office as form instructor and has enabled us to grapple successfully with one of our most difficult problems. Indeed I may say, that had it not been for Mr. Monk's untiring efforts during Mr. Ward's illness we should have to have faced the dilemma of utter disorganisation or a closed school.\n\nMr. Monk is in all respects what we need, as matron & is most strongly recommended by Mr. Morrison.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to each member of the Committee and would suggest that in the event of your acquiescence in the action proposed, you write directly to the Bishop, thus saving time & relieving Mr. Hollis himself of the local pressure.\n\nI am yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Very Reverend\n\nThe Dean\n\nThe Dean\n\nS.

He is quite unfit mentally or physically to be at the head of such an institution; his mental balance is quite gone and something incident occurring yesterday makes it necessary to take immediate action.\n\nI enclose copy of a letter from the medical attendant at the school.\n\nOur mails being so slow and the distance so great it has been suggested that we waive a formal meeting just now, and ask the Bishop to appoint Mr. Amos Monk as present form instructor on the Gordon Reserve principal vice Mr. Ward retiring.\n\nMr. Monk (whose application is endorsed by Mr. Morrison (the Indian agent) & by Mr. Joseph Hollis-Harrison (members of the Indian Committee)) is a man in the prime of life, in good health and of very pleasing address, of clean upright life & thoroughly practical.

Dudley Ward as Principal of Gordon School, Sask. Mr. Williams, the late Principal, resigned quite unexpectedly, and the Indian Committee appointed by the Synod of Qu'Appelle, advertised for a Principal. Something had to be done hurriedly, and Mr. Ward's application was accepted among many. He was engaged for six months on probation. Since his appointment he has been seriously ill, and now we are asking for his resignation. I understood from the Arch-Deacon of Regina, who is now in England, that both Mr. Graham and Mr. Murison, understood the circumstances that surrounded the appointment; but I regret extremely if in the confusion and hurry, the Indian Department was not notified of the change. The Indian Committee is now asking for the removal of Mr. Ward and permission from the Department of Indian Affairs to appoint Mr. Anson Monk, who has been acting as Farm Instructor on the Gordon Reserve and recommended for the appointment by Mr. Murison. The enclosed letter reveals a serious situation, and I have telegraphed the Rev. J. W. Harrison, Acting Secretary and Treasurer of the Indian Committee, to appoint Mr. Monk Principal.\nSubject to the approval of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Chairman of the Indian Committee of the Diocese, the Very Rev. the Dean, also recommends this appointment.

He is a man with little education, but as he is to have a teacher for the class room work, he might be able to fill the position satisfactorily. Mr. Monk has an excellent wife who will do well as a Matron, but I think I would rather express my opinion of Mr. Monk's fitness for the position after he has served some time. In the meantime I would strongly advise that his appointment be temporary. On the occasion of my next visit to Touchwood I hope to be able to give you further information on the subject in question.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 20, 1913.\n\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nI have pleasure in acknowledging your letter of November 28th, with reference to the work of Indian education in your diocese. The Department had come to the same conclusion as Your Lordship with reference to the desirability of having a new school building for Gordon's boarding school. The plans will be prepared during the winter; as for the site of the school, that must be given further consideration. It was proposed to use the old building as an adjunct to the new one, for certain purposes of the school, but this would not be possible if we moved the school to a new site. I note that you may have some further information after visiting the Indian reserve in the early part of January, and I shall esteem highly suggestions you may see fit to make after your visit.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop M. M. Harding,\nBishop's Court, 2126 McIntyre Street,\nRegina, Sask.\nYou mention the salaries of two day school teachers and I have taken that matter up with the Department: Mr. Montgomery is to receive $400.00 as initial salary, but, if he proves his capabilities within a reasonable time, say six months, his salary will be increased to $500.00. Instructions have been given to increase the salary of Mr. Markham, Teacher of the Keys reserve, Fort Pelly, from $400.00 to $500.00 per annum. I trust this will be satisfactory to you.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the Season and every success in the New Year, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(WJ) W.J. Rocha\nGordons Rd. Day School,\nPunnichy, Ont.,\nNov. 11, 1914.\n\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs authorized the admission of two new children to continue the thirty already provided for, and they were at once brought to the school by their parents - one from Gordon's Reserve, and the other from 758 years ago.\n\nThere are two little girls for whom applications have been made, in writing both the authorities and as they cannot take much space, the Agent will recommend that they be admitted. Your Lordship will act the Dept.\n\n472025\nmuch to provide for them.\n\nThe new school building should accommodate at least 25 pupils. There are small children in Grade 7 year old, three twin boys who will be placed in the school, and many are German. This should be in school.\n\nMr. Ogilvie, the principal, from Ottawa, was here yesterday, and spoke encouragingly of the prospects for the new school. He said everything here has a very different appearance from 1911 when he was here last.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Archdeacon asks that the authorized number of pupils for Gordon's school be increased to fifty, and in my opinion, his reasons for asking this are good. No additional staff would be required for these three extra children. The cost of living has increased to such an extent that I doubt if the school can keep out of debt. Staple articles such as beef, flour, butter etc., have almost doubled in price since the present grant of $100.00 per Capita was fixed. As there are children on the Agency who should be sent to school, it seems to me it would be helping the school out and at the same time giving the Department full return for the money, if the extra three were allowed.\n\nI inspected this school last March and was particularly pleased with the work that was going on at the school and the interest that was taken by the children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nDuncan C.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBelcarrae.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn my recent visit of inspection to Gordon's Boarding School and discussing various matters with Mr. Atwater, the Principal, I suggested to him that it would be a good thing to bring the number of pupils up to fifty. He has now forty-seven, and he told me that he would be very glad if this could be done as he has the room for them and children available and parents anxious to send them. As you are well aware the increased cost of living in the last two months makes it somewhat difficult to finance the school with the present per capita grant, and naturally the increase in numbers would help us in that direction. I shall be grateful therefore if you will interest yourself in the matter to have the number of pupils increased to fifty and the grant made accordingly. Everything is going on very satisfactorily at the school so far as the teaching is concerned and the other work. The farming operations have been very successful and they had a very good crop of cereals and roots.\n\nIn company with the Agent and Francis Sears, one of the head men of the Reserve, I went over the land which it is proposed to exchange for the half-section which we own to the west of the school. This exchange has been hanging fire for some time and it would be a great advantage every way if the matter could be put through without further delay.\nThe Principal is anxious to have a little more land under cultivation. He is a bit circumscribed in that respect at the present time and it would be a great advantage if he had the land which has been surrendered by the Indians in order that he might fence pastures and cultivate a little more of the land immediately round the school.\n\nI shall be grateful therefore if you can do anything to expedite the above matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman of the Indian Committee,\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle.\nMr. Officer,\n\nMr. Gordon & C.

(RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nREPORT OF THE INDIAN COMMITTEE\n\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE:\n\nMY LORD AND GENTLEMEN:\n\nOn St. John the Baptist's Day, June 24th, an important step in connection with the Indian Work of the Diocese was taken when Mr. W. H. B. Scharpe and Mr. A. J. Laves were ordained in St. Luke's Church, Gordon's Reserve, for work amongst the Indians. There was a large gathering of Clergy, who took part in the service, and the Church was filled with a congregation, Indians and white people from the surrounding district. It was an event to which many in the Diocese had looked forward with much interest and it was felt to be a step in the right direction for the extension of the Church's work amongst the Indians committed to our care.\n\nOn the same day a Meeting of the Indian Committee of the Diocese was held at Gordon's Indian School. All the Members of the Committee were present, together with the Principal of the School.\n\nMatters connected with the School and with the Indian Work generally were thoroughly discussed, and as some of these concerned the Department of Indian Affairs it was deemed expedient that the Chairman of the Indian Committee present a report of the meeting to the Executive Committee for their action thereon.\n\nFor some time past an effort has been made for a transfer of land belonging to the Synod for an equal amount belonging to the Indians and it was recommended that the East half of section 4-27-17 W2 consisting of 316 acres be exchanged for the N. E. \u00bc of section 3 and the N. W. \u00bc of section 2 in the same township and range. Mr. Murison, the Indian Agent, has since informed me that he has obtained the sanction of the Indians to this exchange. It was arranged that the Government should retain ten acres of the N. E. of section 3 by metes and bounds, being the site on which Gordon's School stands, together with a road allowance connecting the said ten acres with the nearest government road allowance.\nAccommodation having had to be provided for the Rev. A. J. Lawson by the addition of a room to the new wing of the School, this being done with the consent of the Indian Agent, it was decided to ask the Department to defray the cost of the same.\n\nThe present method of lighting the school is very unsatisfactory and according to the report of School Inspector McKechnie dangerous. In his official report he makes the following statement: \"The danger of fire in the present building, lighted as it is by kerosene lamps and heated by stoves and without an adequate water supply, is very great. It is providential that no tragedy has so far occurred. The Federal authorities should be vigorously informed that a new and up-to-date school building is absolutely necessary for the carrying on of this important work\". The Committee felt that the Department should be urged to instal the Delco system of electro-lighting.\n\nThe crying need at the present time is a new school building. It was stated by the Indian Agent that at least thirty more children could be brought into the school if the accommodation were provided. The present accommodation is for fifty. The need is for a school to accommodate eighty to one hundred children. There are twenty-three children of school age on the Fishing Lake Reserve and the parents of these children are anxious for a school. There are fifty-four children at Nut Mountain Reserve but the parents are against education for their children. The Committee feel that the children from Day Star School should be brought to Gordon's at the age of fourteen. The advantage of a boarding school over a day school is that from the day school children can be discharged from the age of fourteen whilst at a boarding school they can be retained until the age of eighteen.\n\nA Cottage Hospital is another great need for the children during illness and for necessitous cases from the Reserve and particularly maternity cases. Already $142.25 have been spent this year for a pupil having to be taken to a hospital at Saskatoon. Under present conditions the Matron has to give up her room for any case requiring isolation and has herself to undertake the nursing. The Department should be asked to make some provision along the lines suggested.\nThe question of providing a school at Fishing Lake was discussed by the Committee and after hearing what the Indian Agent had to say it was felt that the best solution was the providing of a larger school at Gordon's Reserve and bringing the children from Fishing Lake to the latter place. Further information, however, on the subject has led to a different conclusion and I now feel that it is important that we should have a school at Fishing Lake. The urgency of the need is all the more evident when the fact is known that constantly children have to be refused admission to Gordon's for lack of room. The confidence of the Indians in the school is very great and makes it all the more incumbent upon the Church to do all in Her power to further the interests of the school and through the Executive Committee to bring these facts before the Department of Indian Affairs, praying them to take immediate steps to provide accommodation for the children of school age on these Reserves.\n\nIn view of the loss of such Indian Schools as Elkhorn, Middlechurch, Battleford, Calgary, to the Church of England, the Committee should view with alarm the possibility of the effective work of Gordon's Indian School being retarded through lack of proper provision by the Department, and in asking on behalf of the Indian Committee for the adoption of this Report, I would respectfully request the Executive Committee through the Bishop of the Diocese to bring these facts before the Department of Indian Affairs with a view to steps being taken for the improvement of existing conditions.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nChairman of the Indian Committee.\n\nRegina, Saskatchewan, July 16, 1918.\nRESOLUTION PASSED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AT THE QUARTERLY MEETING HELD JULY 17, 1918, IN THE CITY OF REGINA.\n\nMOVED by the Ven.

It is hardly necessary for me to repeat information already conveyed to the effect that our Parliamentary appropriation for Indian Education has been materially reduced, and the exercise of the strictest economy in the administration of our work is absolutely necessary. The charges for the residence to accommodate the Missionary should be borne by the church authorities, and, at the present time, I am very sorry we cannot consider the erection\n\nRev. G. H.

The first named is what is called a Christian settlement, while Day Star Reserve remains pagan and is still held in the dark by superstition and heathenism.\n\nBoth Reserves come under the jurisdiction of the Church of England, but they are also under the Diocese of Qu'Appelle. This being the case, it was with peculiar interest that the writer accepted an invitation to visit the Reserves. I wish I could tell my readers that Gordon Reserve possesses a boarding school for Indians, but it is not so. It is a normal school in Brandon. Such is not the case. He never saw a more dilapidated and insanitary building. The roof is low pitched and very badly ventilated\u2014if at all. Conveniences here are none; sleeping apartments with no air, kitchens and dining-hall are underground, and conditions here are abominable\u2014fit breeding places for disease. Floors and walls are covered with everything. In one dormitory containing some twenty beds, but which has only been occupied for three weeks, there is a pump by which rain water is brought into the room for washing purposes from an old tank. A damp and unhealthy atmosphere. The State and Church are content that these things should remain so. It is disgusting! It is impossible to remain longer, and hurriedly sought the pure air of the rolling prairie; but not before we had heard the story of the Indians whose white faces clearly show the effects of such insanitary and dismal accommodation.\n\nThe only saving grace about the place is the very real sacrifice being made by the Rev. Mr. Atwater and his wife, who are working among their lives in an endeavor to educate and Christianize the boys and girls of the Reserve. These servants of God share the same hard work and dangers with the brown-skinned charges. Apparently Bishop Harding is powerless to remedy these disgraceful conditions, and the State Department of Ojibwa is too deaf and too blind to hear the pleas and see the needs of these poor Indians.\n\nThe good Bishop admits that conditions at Gordon School have caused him much anxiety during the past few years. Plans for new schools, we are told, have been drawn and furnished the Indian Committee\u2014but this story he has been told for years past and cannot be true.\n\nI shall never forget my visit to Day Star Reserve. An Overland stage passed through the rolling trails through the huge settlement, which for natural beauty beggars description. The huts, huts of the horrid, dirty Indians, from the open sheds and lairs. We were told these were pure pagans and all efforts to Christianize them had proven fruitless. Mrs. Turner, a missionary educated, and trained medical missionary from England, and her husband have been sent to help Bishop Harding and other American missionary bishops. Their task is a difficult one, and as yet little results are seen to encourage them. They have been here for seven months and it has been impossible to get the natives together for any kind of service. The work among the children attending the attendance day school is also slow and sadly disappointing. Mr. Turner tells us that the Indians do not improve in the religious sense as he has cultivated than anything else. They will come to his little place and sit for hours smoking their pipes and talking or however mumbling to themselves the while. Here the Indians live in all their primitive condition. Shacks are very rambunctious. The influence started many of them to the \"happy hunting ground,\" one woman alone killing her children and burying them in the chil- dren's plot. Miss Turner informs us that the Indian very quickly gives himself up to death. When sick, he says to himself, \"I am going to die.\" He does because he thinks he must die. He will squat on the floor of his tent, put his hands around his knees, drop his head, and say, \"I am going to die.\" He may\u2014it may be for weeks\u2014and in this posture he is buried.\n\nHere again is the question of Church and State. Why? Let us hope that as a result of the American Forward Movement, the Indian Mission will be strengthened and our country should vig- orously \"bombard\" the Indian Department with de- mands for better equipment and more facilities in which to carry on mission work and education work among the Indians on Gordon and Day Star Reserves.\n624 Sixteenth Street\nBrandon, Man.\nSept. 17, 1920\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nThe accompanying article is being published in the Manitoba Magazine.

Mr. Atwater, the Principal, is now well advanced in years. He has done good work, and for many years conducted the management of the school with energy. He recently underwent an operation, and I think that his age is now militating against the success of this Institution, and that the time has come when a change ought to be made.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW.

Mr. Atwater, I have to inform you that this Department has had communication with the M. S. C. C. authorities in this connection. I wish to assure you that the advisability of making an addition to the staff, or even a change in principals, is not being overlooked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMy dear Mr McLean,\n\nI have appointed the Revd. Geo. Turner to the parish of Limerick and he will be leaving Day Star Reserve at the end of this month. I feel that this is the best solution of an awkward situation and I sincerely hope that we may be able to find an efficient teacher to succeed him in September next, according to your expressed wish in your letter of May 8th.\n\nI wish now to call your attention to the capitation grant to Gordon School. You will remember the capitation is $30 dollars per annum and it is on the Estimates that Gordon School shall receive the capitation up to 80 pupils. The number was increased first to 7 above the 80, and is now increased to a total of 98. I understand that it will not be long until it is up to 100. The Reverend Principal was in to see me a few days ago, and speaks most encouragingly of the progress being made by the pupils of the School, but he also informs me that the Department has only paid the grant for 80 pupils, stating as an excuse that that was the number that was on the Estimates; I understand that children were brought from other Reserves to Gordon School at the express request of the Department, and, seeing that this is the case, I feel that the Department should certainly pay the capitation grant for every pupil above the 80. We are taking children in our School from other Reserves at the request of the Department, we are clothing them at great expense, and I ask for the capitation at the rate of $30 per annum for all pupils, as many as we are permitted to take in. I think the Department will see the justice of paying the balance due to the School for addition-\nMay 18th 1923\n\nJ. Mc Lean. (contd).\n\nal pupils above the 50 for the previous quarter. We are most anxious to do our very best in maintaining the efficiency of our Boarding and Day Schools in the Diocese. For many years we have spent large sums of money on our Indian work and only last year decided to shoulder the responsibility, as a Diocese, for maintaining the work carried on in Gordon Indian Boarding School, and in the Indian day class. The Department has always been ready to deal justly and generously with us, and I sincerely hope that my request will be granted on this occasion.\n\nI am\n\nVery sincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 18th instant, in which you request that the pupilage at the Gordon's Indian Boarding School be increased. As you have been informed, provision was made for 86 pupils in the Estimates for the past fiscal year. The per capita grant was paid on an average attendance for the June quarter of $5.4; September quarter, $6.15; and December quarter, $7.25. The average attendance for the last quarter of the fiscal year - that ended March 31st, 1923 - was 81.03 and grant was paid for the pupilage that was provided, namely 80. It is noted, however, that the enrolment for this quarter was 93.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Department has provided for the present year a pupilage of 90 in the case of the Gordon's Indian Boarding School and it may be necessary in the future to still further increase the grant to the limit of the building's accommodation. The Rev. Principal will find that his average attendance will be in the neighborhood of 90 when he has an enrolment of roughly 100 pupils.\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that the per capita grant is at the rate of $140 per annum, the same as obtained last year. The Rev. Principal and the Indian Agent are being informed of the increase in pupilage for the present fiscal year.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to draw Your Lordship's attention to the advisability of appointing, without delay, a competent gentleman to assist and relieve the Rev. Mr. Atwater, Principal of the Gordon's Indian Boarding School. For many years, the present principal has successfully conducted and administered this institution. Some months ago this Department completed a modern main building, and I am somewhat concerned in view of Mr. Atwater's advanced age, which will militate against successful administration on his part. My suggestion is that a younger man of real capacity be appointed to the position of assistant principal. Such an officer could, in the near future, take over the principalship when the Rev. Mr. Atwater retires from active service.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle, D.D.,\nSynod House,\nRegina, Sask.\nMr Duncan Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr Scott,\n\nI am very glad indeed to know that you have regained your health and are able to attend to your duties.

(RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn May last seven of the senior girls of the Gordon's Boarding School, at Punnichy, ran away from that Institution one evening. For this they were punished by the Principal, and it would appear that the Indian Agent, Mr. Hardinge, told two of the girls, Nora Cyr and Jane Bird, who would in due course be discharged this year, that their term of residence would be extended six months. The Reverend Principal wrote to me asking me to endorse the action of the Agent, suggesting that it would have a salutary effect upon others. I have, however, informed the Principal that the Agent had no authority to discipline pupils in this manner, and that I could not, therefore, issue authority for their retention at the school. I have also written to the Agent informing him that he had no right to issue such instructions for the correction of pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 23, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham has drawn the attention of the Department to your ruling that Nora Cyr and Jane Bird, two pupils of the Gordon's Indian Boarding School, be kept in residence six months after their normal tuition period. I have to inform you that the Department doubts the advisability of administering this type of punishment, as a disciplinary measure.\n\nHowever, as the girls in question have been advised of your action, I consider it in the best interests of the school to uphold the ruling. In the case of Nora Cyr (No. 052) and Jane Bird (No. 0148), you are authorized to ask for their discharge six months after the regular tuition period is over.\n\nIn future, please refer difficulties of this nature to the Department for decision.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am taking the liberty of applying to you as the head of the Department of Indian Affairs, for approval of a course I felt compelled to adopt in connection with an incident which was unique in the history of Gordon's School from the time of my appointment as Principal, eleven years ago.\n\nIn the month of June, seven girls were missing when the bell rang for them to come in from the playground at eight o'clock one evening. They were at once followed, and brought back, having walked entirely by themselves, twelve miles to Red Rock.\n\nI sent for the Indian Agent, and we enquired into the reasons for such an unusual truancy, and found it was for nothing; one girl had\nproposed the remarriage, and the others agreed.\n\nOne of them, Rosa Cope (No. 112), is eighteen years of age; the other, Annie Hill, Jane Reid (No. 148) is said by her father to be fifteen, but this is doubtful. These girls have some good character through their whole school career, but for discipline, for them, and for the others, the Indian Agent and I decided to ask the Department to extend the time in school of these two children six months.\n\nThis, the Indian Agent and the School Board be done, and I presume that in this letter to matter up with the Department, that I may learn to seek your approval of this course, as failure to secure your concurrence would satisfy me, and oblige me to consider my resignation.\n\nI am the honor to, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.G. Baxter\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 25, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 16th instant, addressed to the Honourable the Superintendent General, with reference to certain disciplinary measures taken by the Indian Agent and yourself at the Gordon's Indian Boarding School. I have to inform you, in reply, that an official communication was directed in this connection to Mr. Indian Agent Hardinge, under cover of the 23rd instant.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter #121-1-10 dated December 3rd 1923 in reference to truancy at Gordon School.\n\nI beg to inform you that for the last two or three months a number of the pupils have been running away and in many cases some of the boys have run away several times, as soon as they were brought back to school they would be away again in a few days time.\n\nI beg to say that sometime ago I held an investigation at the School to try and get to the bottom of the trouble. I had a good talk to the children and a number of the parents were present.\n\nThe conclusion I came to was that Mr Atwater is hardly capable of handling the situation at present as Principal and in consequence too much of the management is left to Mr Handly.\n\nThis man is certainly not the stamp that should be employed at an Indian Boarding School he is officious and domineering and the boys complained to me about the way he treated them.\n\nI informed the Principal about this as he was present at the time and he quite agreed with me, and I was under the impression that he was going to get rid of him.\n\nI am quite aware that Mr Atwater has done splendid work amongst the Indians on Gordon Reserve and of course he cannot help his health or age. The Department should insist on Mr Handly being removed from the School and that a man with proper qualifications be sent to assist Mr Atwater with the work. I would also recommend that one or two of the boys be sent to some other School as a lesson to the other children. As this state of affairs cannot go on I trust the Department will act on my recommendation.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 19, 1923.\n\nDear Bishop Harding:\n\nI regret that it is necessary to call Your Lordship's attention to a serious condition at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. Truancy on the part of pupils is of such frequent occurrence, that I fear the usefulness of the institution is much impaired. Since October first, last, the Department has received 19 reports from the Royal Mounted Police, which are relative to efforts to return absentees.\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson, of the Indian Commissioner's office in your city, was asked to make a special report and it is with regret that I quote from his communication: \"Mr. Atwater is hardly capable of handling the situation at present, and, in consequence, too much of the management is left to Mr. Handly. This man is certainly not the stamp that should be employed at an Indian boarding school - he is officious and domineering.\" Our Inspector also states that the Principal agreed Mr. Handly was not the proper type; and I have to request that Your Lordship take steps to have a properly qualified incumbent appointed to assist Mr. Atwater in his important work. As I suggested in my letter of June 19th, last, an officer of real capacity and worth should be secured. Perhaps it would be well, at this time, to appoint a Rev. Gentleman who could take over the principalship in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I found the Principal much improved in health and in general satisfactory - at that time it was also arranged that Mr Atwater should receive further assistance by the appointment of a young Englishman to assist in teaching the boys &c; this provision was made after consultation with the Indian Commissioner here. Since October there has evidently been some irritation existing in some quarter in the School, but I was hoping that truancy in the part of the pupils had come to an end. On Saturday last I asked the Chairman of our Indian Committee, The Ven. Archdeacon Knowles, to proceed at once to the School and make further enquiries concerning Mr Atwater's condition, Mr Handley's position and work, &c., and to report to me here on his return. I now simply write to acknowledge your letter of Decr 18th, and to assure the Department that the complaint made by Mr Inspector Christiansen is being carefully considered, and that we shall do our very best to fall in with the suggestions made in your letter.\n\nI am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo the Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle sent Archdeacon Knowles up last week to investigate the cause of the truancy of pupils of Gordon's School during the past summer, the alleged cause being the attitude of my engineer, Mr. Handley, towards the boys.\n\nAs twice as many girls as boys ran away, even small girls seven years of age, with whom Mr. Handley has nothing to do, a prima facie case against him could scarcely be considered.\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson was asked by me to come to the school and investigate matters, and I invited the parents of the children here to make their complaints, instead of running to the Agency with them. The complaint they had to make against Handley was, that he had a rough way of speaking to the boys, but the boys themselves, who had run away, made no complaint against Handley. They gave various reasons for truancy. Two of them ran away because they did not like picking up potatoes after the potato digger, others, that they were not paid for doing work outside; another that he had to cut some wood two or three times.\n\nAt the close of the investigation, Mr. Christianson, in speaking to the children assembled in the schoolroom with members of the Staff, stated that although he had been informed by some of the people that Mr. Handley's attitude to the children had been the cause of their\ntruaney, he had found no proof that such was the case.\n\nTwo of the parents were more disposed to make complaints against me, one, that I made the children take their meals lying on the floor, with their hands tied behind their backs, another, that I was spiteful to children whose parents I did not like, but when asked to specify cases, had only heard it.\n\nThe Indians always have complaints galore about Indian Agents, and about each other, which they would weary me with if I had patience to listen to them, or thought it wise to do so.\n\nI have always aimed at a strict line of duty, rather than pleasing the people, which, everywhere is impossible.\n\nThe only objection to Mr. Handley is that his temper gets the better of him at times, as for instance when, as on two occasions, boys have gone to the engine room and broken the wire connecting the magneto with the spark plug, or stolen tarred tape off the electric wire; but he merely talks forcibly, and never on any occasion has used any objectionable language.\n\nThe doctor, who is the Department's Medical Health Officer, secured Handley's services for me three years ago, and it is his opinion that life in the trenches is responsible for his erratic temper, which, however, affects the Staff more than it does the pupils.\n\nHe is a most useful man and is always ready to do any kind of work for the school or for the good of the pupils.\n\nHe now understands the heating and lighting system and manages the plumbing also, and his services could not be replaced at the salary he\nis getting, viz. $50 a month.\n\nI am surprised that his dismissal should have been recommended on account of the boys, as the investigation showed that they had no complaint against him, and as to the parents, the substance of their objections was his rough way of speaking. They alleged more substantial grievances against me, but these existed only in their own imaginations.\n\nAs I told them afterwards, I invited them to make real complaints, if they had any, not to make false statements.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReport re Gordon's School - Dec. 31st, 1923.\n\nMr. Bishop,\n\nIn accordance with your Lordship's instructions I visited Gordon's School on Saturday Evening Dec. 29th, and remained until the Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Rev. Atwater seemed in very good spirits and assisted me in every possible way in regard to obtaining information regarding the questions of Truancy and the trouble about Mr. Handly.\n\nWith regard to Truancy I found that, as stated by the Department, there had been a number of cases since May 1923. It is most difficult for me to report upon each occurrence as the school does not keep a diary, and it would be necessary to obtain information from the Police reports.\n\nTruancy has been a frequent occurrence in many Indian Boarding Schools for some time past, and perhaps the trouble at Gordon's has been accentuated by the fact that until this Summer there had very few cases as compared with other schools. Another factor which may have accentuated the matter may be that in some other schools the culprits may be left for several days before the Police are notified\u2014during which time many may return or be brought back by parents or others.\n\nTruancy to some extent is a natural offence in that Indian children are apt to take advantage of a sudden impulse for adventure, or to see their parents. Also there appear to have been certain ringleaders who have dared the others to follow them. In every case reported to me it was the staff of the school which had taken the initiative in seeking the truants, and in particular Mr. John Handly, using his own car, had immediately sought for them. On some occasions he was accompanied by the Police.\n\nMr. Rhodes of the File Hill School called on the Rev. Atwater and spoke of his difficulties in regard to runaways. Archdeacon McKay also visited Gordon's and spoke of his troubles in this regard. Muscowikans and Lebret have also had similar difficulties.\n\nThe punishment for this offence is now to be increased by six months the term of attendance at the school, which in the case of the older pupils it is expected will have a salutary effect. There have been no cases during the last month.\n\nRe John Handly:- I spent considerable time with the Rev. Atwater, Miss Atwater and Miss McLeish regarding the charges made by the Department that \"he is certainly not the stamp of man that should be employed in an Indian Boarding School\u2014 he is officious and domineering\". As far as I could find, Handly seems to have been an energetic and faithful servant. Working on the comparatively small salary of $50 per month and board he has been used in the capacity of the Principal's right-hand.\n\nEnlisting in the 26th Batt from Regina in 1915 he served in the Great War and rose to the position of Sergeant. He was at Mons on Nov. 11th, 1918 and served in Germany till July 1919. He came to Gordon's in July 1921. Of a quick temper and rather nervous disposition, perhaps due to his service, he must be blamed for many acts of impatience, but in most cases under some provocation.\n\nThe condition of affairs at the School has been that Handly has occupied a place above his position as regards education, but this cannot be said to be his fault. In many ways the staff has depended upon him, until it has become the habit to go to him rather than to the Principal.\n\nIn the end of November, after the investigation held by Inspector Christianson, the Principal gave him a month's notice. The man was terribly upset and went away weeping, blaming himself for his hasty temper and foolishness. He returned to the Principal apologizing, and stating his whole heart was in the work of the school, asked to be given another chance. Dr. Phillips commenting on the situation said \"If Handly goes the Rev. Atwater will not be able to continue. The Principal asked that Handly be kept on until say the end of June.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI saw Mr. Hick, the acting Agent at Tunnichy who supported the statement of the Department that Handly had spoken roughly to the Indians calling at the school, but did not associate his actions with any of the truancy cases. He stated definitely that the position Handly occupied was beyond his ability and education, but admitted that if he were kept in his position by an Assistant Principal he would prove a valuable servant.\n\nUnder the circumstances, my Lord, and from all the information I could gather, the situation indicates that the Rev. Atwater would be able to carry on without serious difficulty to himself, and that further trouble with Handly would be obviated by the appointment, as recommended by the Department, of a man in \"Holy Orders\" either Deacon or Priest, who could act at the Principal's right-hand, both in the school and on the reserve.\n\nThe Principal attends St. Luke's Church once a month, for Celebrations, Mr. Hick acting as Reader for the other Services during the month. I do not think Mr. Brownlee could take just the position in the School or on the Reserve which the situation requires. As regards education he does not appear to have sufficient advancement to be able to take up a course of study under the Principal, and apparently no progress has been made in that way.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman, Indian Committee.\nOn December the 3rd I reported to the Department concerning the fact that there were several cases of truancy at the Gordon School. One of the reasons that I gave for this state of affairs was the domineering treatment of the boys on the part of Mr. Handley, one of the employees.\n\nThere are a number of boys at the School from the Duck Lake Agency, and four of them ran away last summer. During the time I was at the Agency, Corporal James McNeil of the Prince Albert R.C.M.P. brought them back to the School. I did not see the Corporal, as he got off the train at night and went direct to the School, and returned to Prince Albert the next morning, but I found out the next morning through Constable Omanding of the Detachment at Ponoka, that Corp. McNeil had had some trouble with Mr. Handley. I wrote to the Corporal at Prince Albert to find out just what had taken place, and I beg to quote from his letter as follows:\n\n\"I was admitted by one of the ladies who showed us to the office and who then went away to get something to eat for the four boys. She had hardly left the office when this man entered the office. He never spoke to me but started on John Daniels who was standing close to the office door, along with Moses Sanderson the other boy, who had run away from the school.\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nHe started questioning Daniels concerning why he had run away from the school, the boy never answered him, then he told the boy to take the smile off his face or that he would take it off for him, and he drew his arm back in a threatening manner as if he was going to strike the boy. Then I butted in and asked him if he was one of the staff, meaning the teaching staff and he answered yes, so I said no more at the time not knowing the system that they used at the school for handling the boys. Shortly afterwards Rev. A.W. Atwater, the Principal, came in the office, and I noticed that this man's manner changed. Later the principal questioned the boys in a kind way, in a different manner to what this other man had done. I was going to speak to the Principal concerning this matter but changed my mind thinking that he was one of the teachers. I did not like his manner as it was nothing else but bullying the boys, and at the time I considered that the boys were still in my charge until such time as I had handed them over to the Principal, and I might say that I didn't have the least bit of trouble with any of the boys all the time that I had them, which was since the previous night, and I didn't see any reason why he started on Daniels as he did. On the way back to town I was informed by the driver that this man was the engineer. Later that evening I passed the remark to Gosset. Owing that if I had of known at the time that this man was the engineer and not one of the teachers, I would of had more to say to him. I told one of the teachers about what had happened, and I also passed the remark that I didn't blame the boys for running away if this man was in the habit of treating them as he did that night.\n\nThis bears out my opinion of Mr. Handley, and I think that the Department should lose no time in seeing that this man is relieved of any responsibility he has in connection with the administration of the affairs at the Gordon School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, Jan. 19, 1924.\n\nDear Bishop Harding:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant, with further reference to conditions at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I have examined the report of the Ven. Archdeacon Knowles and am pleased to learn it is agreed that a strong assistant principal must be appointed without delay. Pursuant to your request, I showed the Archdeacon's report to Mr. Commissioner Graham and had an opportunity of discussing it thoroughly with him.\n\nRelative to the services of Mr. Handley, it is clear that he is not fitted for the position he occupies. In confirmation of this opinion I wish to quote from a supplementary report, received today from Mr. Inspector Christianson. Corporal McNeil, of the R. C. M. P., who returned some truants to the school, writes to our officer as follows:\n\n\"I was admitted by one of the ladies who showed us to the office and who then went away to get something to eat for the four boys. She had hardly left the office when this man entered the office. He never spoke to me but started on John Daniels who was standing close to the office door along with Moses Sanderson, the other boy who had run away from the school. He started questioning Daniels concerning why he had run away from the school - the boy never answered him - then he told the boy to take the smile off his face or that he would take it off for him and he drew his arm back in a threatening manner as if he was going to strike the boy. Then I butted in and asked if he was one of the staff, meaning the teaching staff, and he answered 'Yes' so I said no more at the time, not knowing the system that they used at the school for handling the boys. Shortly afterwards Rev. A. W. Atwater, the Principal, came in the office and I noticed that the man's manner changed.\"\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle, D.D.,\nSynod House,\nREGINA, SASK.\n\"Later that evening I passed the remark to Const. Cumming that if I had known at the time that this man was the engineer and not one of the teachers, I would have had more to say to him. I told one of the teachers about what had happened and I also passed the remark that I didn't blame the boys for running away if this man was in the habit of treating them as he did that night.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances I can only request that Your Lordship make a change at the earliest possible moment and engage an engineer more suited to institutional life. Further, the installation of an assistant principal, who will relieve the Rev. Mr. Atwater of some of his work, should be attended to as soon as you can secure a proper incumbent.\n\nI wish to thank Your Lordship for your cooperation in this unpleasant and difficult situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, Jan. 19, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to the subject matter of official communication of the 11th instant.

Moreover, the acceptance of the statements of an outsider, in preference to the accurate information which I gave the Department, implies that my report was unreliable.\n\nPersonally, it is a matter of indifference to me as to what person is engineer, provided that his competency is assured, but the summary dismissal of any member of my staff, appointed and approved by me, without alleged cause, seems to me unfair.\n\nWere I disposed to make a report derogatory to any individual, I should feel in honor bound to send him a copy of that report, whereas\nin this case, I as Principal, have no information of the Department's reason for dismissing the engineer, Handley.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. and Mrs. Cooper will I feel confident, be of great comfort and assistance to both the good Principal and his efficient staff.\n\nJohn Handley is still here as engineer, carpenter, cobbler, butcher etc., and I find on inquiry, has profited by warning and is of really much value to the Staff and school. I have told the Principal that I have asked the Department to permit of his continuing in his present position during good behaviour. The Department may feel confident under the present arrangement there will be no further cause of complaint.\n\nIt is not easy to obtain the services of one who is so generally useful and adaptable as Handley.\n\nI am,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Inasmuch as we asked for the dismissal of Mr. Handley, I believe it would be unwise to acknowledge His Lordship's letter and approve of his action as he has evidently given Mr. Handley to understand that his services will be retained during good behavior.

I think the Dept. should forward me copies of such reports after taking steps to order my dismissal.\n\nI am ready to stand with witnesses that the runaway was no fault of mine. I might add that the three years I have been at the school, my car has been at the disposal of the school. The school having no\nTelephone, my car has several times been the means of getting the doctor here in time to attend to sick children.\n\nLast fall my car was greatly used in getting runaway children at my expense. I ruined my car completely would not the school allow a sum of money to help cover the expenses of my car.\n\nI would not ask the school to cover it as I know the school could not do it and my interest is in the school, and I know the school cannot afford a car or the upkeep of one.\n\nI know that this school was not the only school which had runaways last year.

It appears that the battery was in use only six months after it was installed in 1922. As the life of this equipment, with proper treatment, is approximately six years, the only conclusion is an incompetent engineer.\n\nIn the light of this and earlier developments relative to the competency of Mr. Handley, I feel the time has come when he should be replaced without delay.

The Gordon School has 108 pupils attending at the present time, and the Principal informed me that the last quarter the Department had only paid the grant for 100. He could not understand why he was not getting the grant for the other eight. The school was in good order and the children all looked exceptionally well.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., May 19th, 1925\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI beg to inform you that the matter of increasing the pupilage at the Gordon Residential School is one that I think the Department should give consideration to without delay.\n\nWhile this school has not got the prescribed air space of 500 cubic ft. per pupil, it has sufficient air space to meet the requirements of the Health Department of the Province of Saskatchewan. I may say I took this matter up with the Deputy Minister of Health, and he agreed with me that 400 cubic ft. was quite ample, in fact less if proper attention was given to ventilation, such as keeping the windows open, etc. I venture to say there are very few white boarding schools in this Province, or in any other province of the West that provide 500 cubic ft. of air per pupil; certainly the hotels or public places that are under Government control do not.\n\nNow the question is simply this; we have accommodation here for more children than the school is paid a grant for; the school authorities are undertaking to give these children an education, and I may say that they are not going out through the country to hunt for these children; they are brought to the school and they have simply taken them in. It seems to me the Department would be doing the best thing in paying a grant for the children thus brought in, in order that we may make use of all the space available in the schools which are now in existence, before undertaking to build any more.\n\nAll that this school is asking for is a grant for 115 pupils. They are now receiving a grant for 100.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Canon Atwater who engaged me asked for reasons that my dismissal was based upon but as far as I know he got not satisfactory reply only that the reports were confidential.\n\nI wrote the hon Duncan Scott and he wrote asking me to address my communication through his lordship the Bishop which I did and I also saw him and got the same answer that it was the Dept wish and the reports were confidential.\n\nI saw the commissioner Mr Graham and he showed me one report and the only one he had about me, and as I told him it was a false report and I was willing to defend myself if given the chance.\nThe Commissioner said personally he had nothing to do with me.\n\nI am a returned soldier of four years service and my record clear and have never been discharged from a position in my life before.\n\nI would like to know just what the dept has against me. I am willing to stand and defend myself if it could come down to an investigation.\n\nI do not see how the reports should be confidential and the dept acting upon them. I think I should be given a copy of them or the ones who made them cannot back them up. It does not speak very well for them.\n\nI believe the honorable Duncan Scott has had a lot of correspondence from the Rev. Canon Atwater on this matter.\n\nHoping you will be able to give me a satisfactory answer to my enquiries again excusing myself for the liberty taken.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Handley\nOttawa, Sept. 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed by the Honourable the Superintendent General to reply to your letter of the 17th ultimo, relative to your dismissal from the staff of the Gordon's Indian Residential School. Your enquiry should properly be addressed to the school management or to the Church authorities, by whom you were employed.\n\nI may say, however, that the Department, after considerable correspondence and thought, asked the Church authorities to arrange for a suitable engineer at the school. You need not feel any disgrace in the matter, as there was nothing against you personally. Our officers considered - and the Church authorities agreed - that you were not fitted for the position you held.\n\nThere is no merit in continuing the correspondence, as the Department has nothing to add to this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.121-1-1 of the 24th instant, I beg to inform you that the Reverend T.J. Davies took over his duties as Principal of the Gordon's Residential School on October last. He was appointed Assistant Principal in June last by His Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle to take some of the work from the shoulders of the then Principal, Canon Atwater. At the time of this appointment the understanding was that Mr. Davies would take over the Principalship on October last when Canon Atwater would retire.\n\nIt is surprising that you have never been advised of the change as Mr. Davies tells me that His Lordship was in Ottawa some time ago and was to have taken the matter up personally with the Department. Mr. Davies also tells me that in June he interviewed Mr. Commissioner Graham and advised him of his appointment. Mr. Davies has asked me to inform you that he has handed in his resignation to the Bishop as he does not feel that he can bear the continual worry and responsibility of managing this large school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 7, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Moore reports that the Rev. T. J. Davies, Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School, has handed his resignation to the Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle. There has been no official communication addressed to the Department concerning Mr. Davies' appointment as principal. Please communicate with His Lordship and suggest that official letters should be directed to the Department in connection with changes in the principaship at this institution. Also enquire if the Rev. Mr. Davies is to be relieved of his duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your #121-1-1 dated the 7th instant, I have to advise you that it was through an inadvertence the Department was not advised that the Rev. T.J. Davies had taken over the Principalship of the Gordon Indian Residential School. Last spring when the late Canon Atwater was ill Rev. T.J. Davies was appointed by the Church Authorities as Vice-Principal, and later when the former died the latter took over the duties of Principal. I was under the impression that the Church Authorities had so advised the Department.\n\nThe Rev. T.J. Davies is being withdrawn, and his place as Principal will be taken by Rev. Canon Irwin, M.A., at present Rector of Swift Current, and his Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle has informed me that this information has been communicated to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.W.

It is rather departing from her work, and I am inclined to think that the Bishop would resent this. Let her confine herself to her own work, which is the care of sick children. We got into trouble with the Roman Catholic School Authorities for a good deal less than this, and the result is that none of our Nurses are allowed to visit the R.C. Schools. There is enough work for Miss Brandon to do without bothering about matters that do not concern her. I find this Nurse very hard to suppress. The Department may think that she is within her rights. Personally I do not think she is.\n\nI might say that there are members of the staff at this school who are quite capable of deciding what is best in the interests of the work, without Miss Brandon's assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

The new school, round which there are only three acres of open land, is one and one half miles distant from our other fields and my desire is to link up the two and have a farm on which we can grow all our own feed and so move a step nearer self-support. Last summer and fall we cleared and plowed about four acres.\n\nYou can well understand that clearing will be a very slow process but I intend doing as much as possible each year and so gradually increase our acreage. Meanwhile I have to buy all my hay, and also some oats, as we must summerfallow a certain number of acres each year.\nOttawa, March 2, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 24th ultimo, urging that an increased per capita grant be allowed in the case of the Gordon's Indian Residential School.

McLean, Assistant Deputy and Secretary, informing me that from the first proxime - the beginning of the fiscal year - grant at the rate of $155.00 per child will be paid.\n\nI had hoped that the Department would see their way clear to give us $160.00 and very much wish it could yet be granted.\n\nHowever, I sincerely thank you for the very much needed assistance and trust that the first time you take a trip West you will find it convenient to visit us and see what we have been able to do as a result of your kind consideration of my request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.K.

Percival - Principal,\nGORDON INDIAN SCHOOL / Punnichy, Sask.\n\nOn the A.M. of the 16th instant, a phone call was received from the Principal, Gordon Indian School, requesting that I come at once to the school, as he wished the assistance of the Police.\n\nI immediately patrolled with livery to Gordon Indian School, situated on Co-op Indian Reserve, and on arrival at the school, interviewed the Rev. Percival; and he informed me that an attempt had been made the night previous, by some person or parties unknown, to gain entrance to the school, and that a hasp and padlock which he had placed on the boys dormitory door on the afternoon of the 15th instant had been cut; and he was of the opinion, that it had been done with the object in view, that the senior boys could make effect a breakaway, and attend a dance that was being held on the reserve that night (15th). The hasp and lock was on the door leading to the fire escape, and was on the outside. The hasp was found broken about 9-00 P.M.\n\nAbout 11-00 P.M., Rev. Percival placed a Member of the staff outside to watch the building, armed with a shot-gun and instructions that if anyone was seen approaching the building from the outside, he was to halt them and fire a shot into the air (which would be a signal to the staff inside). All was well until about 11-30 P.M., when Mr. Snowden, outside guard, noticed three faces at the window of the boys dormitory and the one of the screens of the window was being taken off; at the same time, he noticed five men approaching from the direction of the school stables, and as he was afraid they would detect him, he fired two shots into the air, the men from the direction of the stables disappeared into know the bushes, the screen window was replaced on the dormitory, and when the dormitory was checked a few minutes after the shot, all appeared to be quiet and no one was absent from the dormitory.\n\nI examined the door leading onto the fire escape, and found the hasp had been cut, apparently by a chisel or other sharp instrument, and the lock was still hanging in the staple. The door is fastened with a Yale night latch; this would not unlock with the key, as some obstructions appeared in the lock.\n\nWith this information, I discussed the situation with Rev. Percival, and he agreed that it might be well to leave the matter for another day, and he would endeavor to secure information from the school-children, and I arranged that I would come to the school the following morning, with the Indian Agent and we would have a thorough investigation; I then returned to detachment.\nOn the A.M. of the 16th instant, accompanied by Mr. Moore, Indian Agent, I patrolled to Gordon School, and assisted by Mr. Moore, Indian Agent, Rev. Percival, Principal of Gordon School. I questioned all the senior boys of the school, but no light whatever could be learned as to who cut the hemp the night previous, or who was implicated in the taking off of the screen the night previous, but during the inquiry, I learned that one Billy Brittain, school-boy was in the habit of picking various locks with a wire, and he had on a number of occasions picked the Yale lock of the dormitory door leading to the fire escape; and by this means, a couple of the senior boys had on two occasions left the school during the night, returning early and had not been missed.\n\nBilly Brittain when questioned at first denied everything, claiming he had never at any time opened any locks, but when faced with one of the other boys, admitted that he was the one that had been picking the locks around the school, and when this admission was obtained, the Principal and Rev. Percival stated that he would have this boy severely punished for his actions, as well as the two boys who had left the school during the night, but all the boys were emphatic in their denial that they were not, or did not know of any party that had cut the hemp; however, further inquiries will be made from time to time, and if information of a reliable source can be obtained, a further investigation will be made, and report submitted in due course.\n\nAs regards the five men seen approaching from the stables, I have been unable to find out who they might have been, but no doubt, it was some Indians who were endeavoring to assist the school boys in making an escape from the school; and the Principal of the School will endeavor to find out, if possible, who they may have been, and if successful, report accordingly.\n\nSgt.,\nV.C.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nThe Ven. Archdeacon Knowles, Chairman\nof our Indian Committee, and the Rev. M.C.T.\nPercivall, Principal of Gordon's Indian Residential\nSchool, have being considering with me the real\nneed for an increase in the per capita grant which\nnow stands at $155.00 per annum.\n\nI have just returned from a visitation\nat Gordon's, Fishing Lake and Day Star's Schools\nand have considered carefully in particular with\nthe Principal and Chairman of our Indian Committee\nthe present position and needs of Gordon's School.\nWe feel we must ask the Department to increase the\nper capita grant to $170.00 per annum per pupil for\nthe following reasons:\n\n1. That the School is now receiving a minimum of\n   100 pupils. The number on the roll at present\n   is 106. This necessitates an increase in the staff.\n2. It is necessary to appoint a resident Farm Instructor for work all the year round in order to increase the instruction of the boys in agriculture and oversee their practical work in the field and garden. This will mean both an additional cost and also much additional to the instruction given in the School.\n\n3. We find the assistance we have previously received from the Dominion Woman's Auxiliary may be seriously decreased in 1929.\n\n4. An increased amount must also be expended by the School in connection with the clothing of the Children, particularly the boys.\n\n5. We wish to call the Departments attention to the fact that the School is situated 7\u00bd miles South of the town of Punnichy. The annual consumption of coal is 1400 to 1450 tons per annum, 15 tons of flour, besides groceries gasoline, oil and other supplied. This requires daily teaming from the Town to the School and is an expensive item on the School account.\n\n6. We notice also the per capita grant to other Schools in the vicinity is considerably larger than the per capita grant to Gordon's.\nFor these reasons I feel we may justly ask the Department of Indian Affairs to increase the per capita grant to Gordon's School by $15.00 for each pupil for the year.\n\nI am,\nDear Dr. Scott,\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI hope to be in Ottawa towards the end of the month.\nSeptember 12, 1928.\n\nDear Bishop Harding:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the per capita grant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I have examined the scale of grants allowed to institutions of this class, and I find that, of the six schools within 150 miles of Gordon's, five are in receipt of $155 per child. However, I shall be glad to discuss this question with Your Lordship towards the end of the month, when you are in Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRt. Rev. M. T.

I looked into this matter as thoroughly as possible and the conclusion I came to was that the children really had no reason for doing this, as I do not think they are being mistreated in any way. In my opinion it is caused by lack of proper supervision; there has been no Farming Instructor there during the summer and no boys' supervisor. As a consequence, with bluffs all around the school, the children have every opportunity of getting out of sight of the school in a short time. The reason some of the boys gave for their misconduct was that they wanted to get out and make some money during the harvest and threshing. I might, however, say that there is a boys' supervisor at the school now who was taken on a few days ago so a closer watch is being kept over the boys.\n\nWith regard to the interior of the school, I went all over this and have no fault to find. Everything is in order.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nthing was in fairly good shape, both up and downstairs. Their engine and boiler rooms were in splendid shape too - everything was tidy and in order, but it is in the outside management where a decided change will have to take place. I will just outline a few of the things that have happened there.\n\nWhen the Rev. Mr. Percivall took charge of the school in April, he found that the Farming Instructor was a drunkard and evidently a morally bad character, not only drinking himself, but giving liquor to the boys. He was given 30 days notice by the Rev. Mr. Percivall, but was there to put in the crop etc. It is now alleged by the Principal that the Farming Instructor dipped the seed potatoes in formalin so that they would not grow. As a consequence 6 acres of potatoes only yielded approximately 100 bushels and it will be necessary for the school to purchase about 700 bushels of potatoes. The smaller seeds, such as carrots, turnips etc., were planted 9\" deep so that they would not grow. The result is that they have very few vegetables. Since this man was discharged they have had no Farming Instructor at all, with the exception of the Indian who is working there.\n\nThe outbuildings are gradually going to pieces - a board gets knocked off, leaving a hole, and it is not long before the boys tear off another board; window panes are broken and not replaced; the yard between the stable and the school is littered with sticks, etc., and fences need repairing. The yard around the farmer's cottage, which was finished two or three weeks ago, is still littered with chips and boards etc.\n\nNo new land\nNo new land has been broken up and the school is only farming 65 acres which has got so badly polluted with weeds that it would not raise a crop. Mr. Percival took the only course with the farming this spring that he could and put in rye and oats mixed. He cut this crop green and is using it for feed. There is 75 acres of land which can be broken up without doing any brushing at all, but one year goes by after another without any effort being made to break this land. I would also point out that absolutely no effort has been made, since the school was built, to beautify the grounds.\n\nI pointed these matters out to the Ven. Archdeacon Knowles and the Rev. Principal, and the words I used to the Principal were these - \"If I were here and it was necessary, I would close up the senior school room for several days so as to enable me to use all the boys to get the grounds cleaned up.\" The remark made by the Principal was, \"I took away 175 loads of rubbish from around the school after I arrived here last spring\".\n\nIn conclusion, I might say that the outside work at this school could not be worse. There is no supervision there at all and the school is not meeting the object for which it was established. I was pleased to note and have always known that the girls in the school get a good training. This is due to the work of the two Miss Atwaters. They are splendid women and have been there a long time and are efficient in their work. The boys are supposed to receive a training in farming.\nin farming and stock raising, etc., but this they are not getting, and the Department should insist on a man being placed in charge of the outside work who is capable of performing his duties.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christiansen,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nW. REGINA, SASK., 5th October, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose herewith a most discouraging report on the conditions existing at the Gordon's Boarding School. This situation has existed for some time covering, perhaps, a period of three years. The outside work here is not at all what it should be, and I have been making complaints to the Church authorities here, from time to time, and insist that a proper man be put in charge at this institution, as well as a good Farming Instructor. Mr. Percivall, the present Principal, is retiring and I am commencing to think it is almost impossible to get a suitable man. We have had three successive failures. There is no excuse for not having a reliable man and the Department should insist on the Church authorities putting one there without delay. The boys are not getting the training they should and there is no discipline. I had Mr. Christiansen go up and make a special inspection of this school and investigate the cause of so much truancy. I may say His Lordship, the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, was in to see me today and I have told him of the situation and he advises me that the matter of the Gordon's School is under discussion at Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOctober 13, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 312-11 of the 5th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Gordon's Indian Residential School. This report is very discouraging, and I am satisfied the Department will have to give special assistance in the matter of supervision. His Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle is much concerned in connection with this school and is trying to get a good principal to take the Reverend Mr. Perceval's place. When a suitable incumbent has been found and is to be installed, I believe you should send one of the inspectors to the school. If you concur, please inform His Lordship and continue to give him the benefit of your advice.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOctober 27th, 1928\n\nThe Reverend,\nRural Dean Stanford,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nMy dear Rural Dean,\n\nAfter long and careful consideration with the Chairman of the Diocese Indian Committee, the Indian Department, and the Indian Commissioner, and your own desire to give yourself to Indian Work as Principal of Gordon's Indian Residential School, I have both pleasure and confidence in asking you to accept and discharge the duties attached to the Principalship of that Institution as from Monday, November 26th, next, when I shall hope formally to introduce you to the Staff, and install you in your Office.\n\nWhile doing this, I feel it will be helpful to you if I notice certain things the Indian Commissioner, the Chairman of the Indian Committee, and the Bishop himself have had in mind for some time.\n\nFirst: it has been evident that there is a pressing need for a Vice Principal, a man upon whom the Principal could rely, and who could perform his duties when the Principal is absent. The Vice Principal might be a man in Holy Orders, or a capable Layman. If a clergyman filled that position it might be possible for him to act as Curate-in-Charge of Punished Mission. It is proposed to initiate such an arrangement the Bishop has approved a grant at the rate of $500.00 a year, and an increase of the Principal's Stipend from $900.00 as it is now to $1000.00 on condition of his devoting his energies to the Indians and their Children in the School and on the Indian Reserve.\n\nSecond; the Committee and the Indian Commissioner have frequently stressed the need of a competent farm instructor to have charge of the farm, the garden, and all outdoor work with the distinct approval and support of the Principal. This they feel would provide for the increase of outdoor work and activities for the boys. Such an appointment, the Committee feels, would be a great help to the Principal, and considerably increase the production of vegetables.\nand grain for the benefit of the School. Mr. W. Graham, the Indian Commissioner will be glad to assist you in procuring such an officer, while the Department has already provided a comfortable house for himself and family. A decided development of the boys' interests in Agriculture, gardening, and outdoor sports will mean much for them and the School.\n\nThe Committee feels considerable care should be exercised in emphasizing the importance of the position of the Head Matron within the Institution, and among the Staff. Seeing a house has been provided by the Department for the Principal and his family the Principal's Wife will not now feel she holds a responsible position on the Staff of the School, or than any other woman required of her more than is acquired of the wife of a Parish Priest; such interest and assistance as she may be able, as the wife of a clergyman, to give her husband. Naturally, the wife will expect all the regard and esteem she would enjoy in a Parish, but the Committee feel she should be spared the responsibility that belongs to the Office of Matron or a member of the Staff.\n\nThe School, as you know, is one of the most important institutions in the Diocese, and has for many years called forth the greatest interest of the Church, and the headmaid of the Church, the Queen's Auxiliary. The Principal will naturally work in the closest association with the Indian Department, and will need to remember that it is important that the Department's requirements are met in every particular. The Department has shown itself ready at all times in the past to support the Church in her Indian work, and I feel that both the Diocese and the Principal of the School may rely upon its whole hearted support in the future.\n\nThe Indian Committee feels the financial arrangements at the School will at all times demand the strictest care and attention from the Principal, as otherwise it will be easy for large debts to accumulate. Indeed, I feel the Principal will need to see that the financial arrangements are under his direct jurisdiction and oversight.\n\nYour appointment to this position gives us much confidence because you have felt called to undertake work in one of the widest spheres of influence, and certainly prayer shall be made that you may be given health and grace to do the Institution what the Church and the Department wish it to be. The affairs of the School necessarily will be largely left in your hands under the direction of the Venerable Archdeacon Knowles, the Chairman of the Diocesan Indian Committee.\n\nIn making the appointment I wish to thank you for long and valuable assistance given me as Rural Dean of Regina, and as Chairman of our Diocesan Sunday School Committee. I shall miss your ready help and loyal support in these offices, but I shall gladly spare you further great work upon which we are now entering, and hope you will still be able to give your brethren the benefit of sympathy and experience when the duties upon which you will shortly enter permit you to do so.\n\nBelieve me, my dear Mr. Stanford,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was surprised on my arrival to find that no less than 17 of the boys, pupils of the school, had deserted during the week, and at the time of my visit, ten of them were still at large. I am in receipt of a letter this morning from a party at Saskatoon, asking what is the matter at the school. I have no idea where the balance of the boys are, but I am having the Police notified at all points throughout the province. Conditions at this school really could not be worse, and it shows that the Principal is absolutely incompetent to manage an institution of this kind. I found the water down pipes at every corner of the building were battered flat, so that the water could only leak through. Where the pipes leave the building I found holes deep enough to bury a couple of washtubs, and the water had all summer been running in against the foundation, showing absolute neglect. The new stables which we built there a short time ago I found with the doors off the hinges and smashed up, and nearly all the glass broken. The manure carriers which were installed have disappeared. They have been deliberately torn down and apparently lost. The whole picture presented was one of neglect and destruction, and the Principal has completely lost control of the staff. In trying to get at the reason for these wholesale desertions the\n\n-Principal-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPrincipal told me that this was to be expected, in view of the manner in which the Department and the Agent handled the case of one of the boys, a lad of 16, who recently deserted from the school. When I heard that this boy was giving trouble I instructed that he be taken at once to Elkhorn. This was done, but he was only there a short time when he deserted and came back to Gordon's, and instead of having him sent back to Elkhorn, or to some other Anglican School at a distance, the Department authorized that he be discharged. Of course, this was a victory for the boy, and the discipline at the school, instead of improving, was made much worse, and I agree with the Principal in this that the boy should not have been discharged. He has been visiting the school two or three times a week, and the other boys, seeing what this boy did, will naturally follow his example, hoping that they will receive the same treatment and be discharged. I find fault with the Agent for recommending this. He knew perfectly well that had he called me up I would have insisted on the boy returning to Elkhorn. He also knew that it was on my instructions he was sent to Elkhorn in the first place. Mr. Moore did not report these desertions until he was forced to do so. He must share some of the responsibility for the conditions at the school, as he is in charge of the agency in which it is situated. My files show that he has never reported anything. Now, no matter what management this school is under it cannot function properly with this kind of supervision from the Agent, and I think you will agree with me that a mistake was made in handling this case of truancy in this way. However, I am not attributing all the difficulty we are having to this. The management is lax.\n\nHis Lordship was in to see me last week, and he has made another appointment to this post. The man who has been chosen has absolutely no knowledge of agriculture and I do not know what the result will be, and have told the Bishop so. The Church authorities are going to allow me to appoint a man as Farming Instructor, who will be given more responsibility than any former Instructor had in connection with the management of the outside affairs at the school. The Bishop insists on having a clergyman in charge, which, to my mind is a mistake. I have no doubt there are clergymen who are capable of handling a job of this kind, but this is the fourth appointment at the Gordon School since Mr. Atwater died, and three of them have been absolute failures.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nNovember 3, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 312-11 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to conditions at the Gordon Indian Residential School. I am pleased to learn that you were able to make a personal inspection. The present management has certainly been unsatisfactory and the Rev. Mr. Stanford should be given every possible assistance after he takes charge on the 26th of this month. I note with satisfaction that you have been asked to secure a fully qualified farming instructor, and I am hopeful that conditions at the school will be much improved in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Rev. Mr. Elery, principal of the Elkhorn school, was in Regina this morning on his way North.\n\nOf the remaining children, some are being housed temporarily in the Gordon, Poorman and Daystar reserves and some will be housed in the old Gordon school, now served as the former Gordon's Indian School before the new building was erected.\n\nInvestigative Cause\nS. S. Moore, Indian agent at Punnichy, is at the scene the fire Friday investigating the cause. The school, which is situated about seven miles southeast of Punnichy, was totally destroyed by the fire which broke out shortly after 3 o'clock Friday afternoon. The loss estimated at $200,000.\n\nNone of the 106 Indian children attending the school, nor the staff of ten, were injured.\n\nThe fire was discovered near the boy's dormitory by the section of the school Miss Atwater, the matron, who first called the firemen and to give the alarm.\n\nProperty Saved\nThe children's clothing and bedding were saved by the older children, the staff and helpers. After the children had marched to safety, Rev. Frederic Stanford, previously stationed temporarily went from the rectoryship of St. Peter's Anglican Church, in charge, saved the furniture of the chapel, chapel equipment and church records.\n\nBoys and Girls\nUnder the supervision of two of the teachers, a number of the older boys and girls assisted in salvaging what they could from their section of the school and engaged in similar work in the girls' section of the building.\n\nIn the meantime the other children were in the old stone building which was used as a gymnasium and auditorium. It was here the entire school was gathered when the little roll call was made to see that all were accounted for. The 6 o'clock meal was served there.\n\nGordon's Indian School, which was conducted under the Anglican church, was one of the oldest Anglican missions in Canada. The building was owned by the Federal Government. Classes were held there and conducted there. In 1921 the old stone building in use was replaced by a modern brick-veneer structure with water and electricity installed. The school was erected by Smith Bros. and Wilson, Regina.\n\nA number of townsmen from Punnichy went by car to the scene of the fire to see what they heard of it and assisted with the work of salvaging.\n\nNo decision has yet been made concerning the erection of a new school.\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nMr. Eley left Punnichy this morning at 3 o'clock for Elkhorn, taking with him forty children from the Gordon's school. It will be necessary for him to stop over at a place called Nokomis from 4 a.m. until 10 a.m. and then take a train for Elkhorn, which will arrive there at nine o'clock tonight. I have arranged with the C.N.R. to put a heated car on the train passing through Punnichy and to have a heated car on from Nokomis to Elkhorn for their accommodation. I have also arranged to have the children fed at Nokomis this morning and a supply of food put on the train taking them from Nokomis to Elkhorn.\n\nThese children will take with them a certain amount of quilts and blankets, but the mattresses were not fit to move, being very old, and the beds were all destroyed, so I am purchasing new beds and mattresses to accommodate them at Elkhorn; and if any additional members of staff are required they will be taken over from the Gordon School.\n\nWe still have sixty children to provide for on the reserve, some of them in homes that are not very good, and until the question of re-building\u2014\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nre-building is settled I am afraid we will have to take some of them into the File Hills School. I do not think there would be any objection on the part of the Church authorities to this move. If I find that these children cannot be handled at home I intend sending them to File Hills but before doing so I would acquaint the Church authorities with the circumstances and get their approval.\n\nI expect Mr. Moore's report on his investigation as to the cause of the fire very soon, but in conversation over the phone I gathered that there was little hope of being able to say exactly what the cause was - probably a match or cigarette thrown into the wall.\n\nSome of the children are housed in a lean-to annex which was next to the school, where the staff hope to carry on class-room work for the time being. I do not know whether this will be a success or not, as I fear the building is not fit for that sort of work. The work of looking after the stock and farming arrangements is being carried on by the staff that remains at the school.\n\nMr. Swan, who was the building inspector when this school was erected, and who was in my office yesterday was an eye witness of the fire, and from what I can gather it was a long time before the building burst out in flames. Smoke was seen coming from under the floors and they started chopping holes here and there but were unable to get to the main body of the fire, which spread so much that it soon got between the studs and ran up past the first and second floors.\n\nIt may be necessary for me to grant some assistance to these parents who have had their children sent home. However, this will be inquired into and handled in the best way possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFebruary 9, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 512-11B of the 5th instant, with reference to the arrangements you are making for the pupils of the Gordon's Indian Residential School. Care should be taken at Elkhorn that there is plenty of air space in the dormitories. Your action in purchasing extra beds is approved. If there is any other equipment at Gordon's, that was saved from fire, which should be forwarded with these pupils to Elkhorn, you should see that the necessary action is taken.\n\nIf any more of the former pupils at Gordon's have no proper home on the reserve, we should consider enrolling them at the Onion Lake C. E. School. According to the last return, there is room here for approximately 15. None of the children should be sent to File Hills without the full concurrence of the church authorities.\n\nI note that some of the children are being accommodated in an annex and that the staff hope to carry on classroom work in the buildings that remain after the fire. You might discuss this with the church authorities and see that proper arrangements are made for whatever activity you consider possible under the circumstances.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Three girl pupils were with me. We went out to the hall and up to the senior class-room and saw smoke coming up through the floor by the radiator. Mr Sinclair was stooping down over where the smoke was. I grabbed an extinguisher from the guest-room opposite the staff sitting-room and took it to the radiator by the stairs leading down to the boys' play-room and used it on the place where I saw smoke coming through. Miss Atwater and I took the fire hose off the bracket on the main floor and ran it out towards the classroom, playing the water at the same time that I played water on the classroom floor. We were then relieved by the men and I went up to the girls dormitory with the girls and Mrs Collins, and threw bedding etc out of the windows.\n\nSigned,\n\nIvy Butcher.\n\nMr. E.A. HOLYCOK, Farming Instructor.\n\nOn Friday afternoon last (February 1st, 1929), Mr Stanford and myself drove over to the Old School right after dinner, and were returning when we were told that the school was on fire. Driving up to the school I saw smoke coming from the playrooms on the south side. I went right into the senior boys' playroom and saw flames in the ceiling near the radiator pipes. I then put an extra length on the fire hose and played on the fire there. After getting this out someone called that flames were showing on the main floor in the candy-room. A bucket brigade played on this and I also placed hose on it and put it out. Then a call came from the junior playground where the fire was burning between the ceiling and floor of the bale-room. I then was called to the senior boys lavatory where fire was raging near the register. Whilst there, the partition between the two lavatories collapsed. I then went to the bale-room which was thick with smoke and played the hose there, but the smoke was too thick so I took the hose outside and played through the bale-room window. The whole room suddenly burst into flames which were uncontrollable. I then went to the senior classroom and played on it until forced out by smoke, and then to the junior classroom until the fire drove me out. I then turned to salvaging as much as possible from the building. As to the cause, possibly a short-circuit; if, as is rumoured, a blow-torch had been used to thaw out water pipes this may have been the origin.\n\nSigned,\n\nE.A. Holycook.\nMiss. ATWATER. Matron.\n\nThe first intimation I had that the school was on fire was when the alarm rang. Mr Sinclair, Miss Lou Atwater and myself got the children from the school in good order and handed them over to Mr Williams, the boys' supervisor. Mr Sinclair, Miss Butcher and the two Miss Atwaters got the extinguishers and threw them around the register in the senior boys' classroom and in the hall where the smoke was puffing out. Making no headway, Mr Sinclair cut a hole in the floor near the register and played water on it, but hose was not really long enough. By this time other people had arrived so we turned to salvaging. The first sign of smoke showed near register in senior classroom. The steam pipes on the south side had been repeatedly frozen during the severe cold spell and I was informed that the engineer used to use a blow-torch to thaw them out.\n\nMiss. E. ATWATER. Senior Teacher.\n\nI am the teacher in the senior classroom, which is situated in the south end of the building, immediately over the senior boys' playroom. At 2:10 o'clock, school time, on the afternoon of the fire I was with my class in the classroom when I noticed smoke coming up by the register which was situated along the south wall. I immediately sounded the alarm and filed the children from the room. This was done in perfect order. After turning the children over to the matron I went down to the senior boys' playroom and wash-room, immediately under my classroom. There was considerable smoke in the wash-room and I then went around to the junior boys' playroom and wash-room. In this wash-room I saw flames in a hole which was in the partition between the two wash-rooms. Two boys went at once for fire extinguishers and by this time Mr Sinclair had come down to see the fire, and I was asked by the matron to go to the other end of the building to assist with saving bedding from the dormitories.\n\nSigned.- Elizabeth Atwater.\n\nJOHN KAPAY.\n\nI was on duty in the engine room when the fire started. I did not hear the alarm. Some children outside told me that the school was on fire. Mr Snowden, the engineer came to the engine room and told me to get the pumps working and keep the fires going. The water pressure gauge registered 40 lbs. The pipes in the junior boys' wash-room in the basement were quite often frozen and a blow-torch was used to thaw them out. Sometimes I used the blow-torch alone for this purpose, and sometimes the engineer. I was called the assistant engineer, and was told by the engineer that I should look over the building in very cold weather and if I found pipes were frozen, I was to take a blow-torch and thaw them out. The last time I used a blow-torch was on the Wednesday preceding the fire, I used it on the return pipe in the sewing-room. I never took a shield to place behind the torch when I was using it. I was not told to do so.\n\nSigned.- John Kapay\nEvidence in connection with fire at Gordon's School, on Friday February 1st, 1929.\n\nMr. A.W. Sinclair, Junior Teacher.\n\nAt 2:05 p.m., by the schoolclock clock the fire alarm was sounded. My children filed out in perfect order thinking no doubt it was a fire drill. Miss Atwater informed me that there was a fire in the senior classroom, whereupon I rushed to the said room and noticed smoke coming up through the floor boards. Fire extinguishers were brought which were of no use; we manned the hose which was not long enough; started a bucket brigade consisting of Lawrence Anderson, Colin Pratt and Peter Bird. I bashed in the floor in the hall but there was no chance as the fire had already gained headway. Same procedure in the boys' playroom but it seemed beyond control. By this time more people had arrived, so I went to the dormitories with two boys to save beds. From the time these people arrived I was employed saving what was possible. As to the origin of the fire I can only surmise. It may have been matches, but I think not as they could have been too much draught between the boards to allow a match or matches to remain alight. Again it might have been the electric wires, as the smoke was coming out of the floor boards in both stories, also out of the turret. As to the use of the blow-torch, I am in no position to testify or surmise as to whether it was in use that day or not. There is a rumour to that effect. From the time of the fire alarm it could not have been more than two hours before the school fell in.\n\nSigned,\n\nA.W. Sinclair\nJunior Teacher.\n\nMr. E.W. Snowden, Engineer.\n\nI was in my house (the old laundry) when the fire started. It was about fifteen minutes after I left the engine room that I was sent for. The boy who called me said there was fire in the senior play-room. I immediately went to engineeroom and ordered the boy on duty to start the pump. I took an axe and broke windows in senior wash-room and took four extinguishers with me; Peter Bird was with me. The flames were in the partition between the wash-rooms and came right up to the top of the partition to the ceiling. The flames were about two and a half feet up the partition. There was a hole in the partition right through to the junior wash-room. We threw extinguishers on flames but with no effect, and the heat and flames drove us out. I then went to hose on basement floor and turned on water. The hose was too short to reach the wash-room, so I shut off the valve in the basement and took two lengths of the basement hose and added it to the main floor hose and turned on standard on main floor. I then put the garden hose on the tap in the junior wash-room and played this on the flames there. Tommy Bird told me that Kenneth started the fire. The last time I used the blow-torch was in the sewing-room on Wednesday, and the last time I used the blow-torch in the senior wash-rooms was on Monday evening at about 10:30 p.m. At 5 a.m. on Friday I inspected radiator and trap in junior wash-room and found them all right. I did not use blow-torch at any place in the building on Friday. I had sixty pounds water pressure on. There was no short-circuit in electric wiring. The lights were not on.\n\nSigned,\n\nErnest William Snowden\nEngineer\n\nIndian Affairs.

About 1:15 p.m., I went with the Farm Instructor and Alex Geddes to the Old School to inspect it with a view of making it more comfortable as the Parish Hall. We were not there more than half an hour, after which we returned to the School. On the way back we met some boys who had been sent by the Matron, telling us that there was a fire at the school. We hurried the horses and went direct to the School. We saw the members of the staff working with the chemical fire extinguishers when we went to the attic to see if the fire was there or smoke was seen coming from the upstairs. There was no sign of fire or smoke in the attic at that time. We descended to the main floor and saw smoke coming up from the floor through a broken board. Water was poured into this hole from the fire hose which had been started in the meantime. Then we heard that fire was seen in the senior wash room down stairs and we went down to work on that. As the fire hose was not long enough we disconnected the length on the floor above and joined it on to the length in the basement and the farm instructor played a stream of water through a hole in the ceiling on the joists which were blazing. We thought we had subdued the fire there and gave attention to the Junior play room. Then we were called to bring the hose to the Senior Schoolroom on the floor above. We disconnected the hose and took it to the main floor connected it to the main water pipe and the farm instructor deluged the School room. Then we were called to the Bale room where the fire seemed to be breaking out. Could not enter by the door, so obtained a ladder, broke a window and poured water into the bale room from the hose. Called indoors again to fight fire in Junior play room and main hall. Fire gained and eventually the workers were called out as the interior of the building was becoming impossible owing to flames and dense smoke.\n\nWe then decided to fight the fire from outside, but the hose was too short and to make matters worse one length inside the building broke and we could not get to the hydrant to turn off the water to make repairs.\n\nWhile the fire was being fought in this manner by some of the men, others were using buckets and doing what they could, others with the women and some of the pupils of the school were clearing the building, with the result that almost everything movable was saved. The workers went on until it was dangerous to continue and they were ordered to stand off and carry away the salvaged good to a safe distance. Great praise is due to the staff and the voluntary helpers who came from the Reserve and from Munnichy for their strenuous efforts.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the fire which destroyed the Gordon's Residential School on Friday last, February 1st, I beg to enclose herewith statements which I have obtained from the various members of the staff. I obtained statements only from those who actually saw the fire in its inception. Miss Bray, laundry, Mrs. Collins' kitchen and Mr. Williams' boy's supervision were not engaged at any time in fighting the actual fire, having devoted their time to the work of salvaging as much as possible of the contents of the building.\n\nI received a telephone message at shortly after 1:30 P.M., town time which is about forty minutes later than the Gordon's School time, to the effect that the school was on fire. I immediately made arrangements for the Agency team and bobleigh to proceed through the town to the school, picking up as many helpers as possible from the village. I then received a call from Dr. Phillips that he had engaged a livery team to drive out, so after notifying the R.C.M.P. to look after the matter of getting as many volunteers as possible to go out with our team I proceeded to the school armed with a large sized extinguisher and went out to the school with the doctor. We made very good time galloping all the way out. Passed several Indians on their way to town and turned them back towards the school.\n\nArrived at the school smoke was to be seen pouring out through the turret at the top of the building. The children and some of the staff were taking stuff from the building and the bedding was practically all out. I went straight in to the senior class room where the smoke appeared to be heaviest and cut hole in floor in effort to locate fire, and then heard someone call that fire had broken out in the candy room which was some ten or twelve yards [?] North of the class room. I went there to investigate and found the place in a blaze. Some of the children and some Indians were lifted up with pails and jugs and held the fire until the hose was brought up from the main floor.\n\nThe flames here were extinguished and the hose then taken down to the Junior boys playroom where the ceiling was now burning fiercely. Mr. Stanford and Mr. Holyoak were making desperate efforts to hold the fire here and I took a look at the other side of the partition in to the senior boys playroom. Fire was showing through the top of the partition and in to the ceiling on this side, but with the help of some Indians with pails sufficient water was scooped up from the floor in this room to check the blaze, and then went up to the main floor to see if it would be possible to play on the fire from the top side. The tale room which is over the Junior playroom was forced into but was filled with dense smoke. The hose was turned on this for a short while, but the smoke was too heavy and an attempt was then made to play the hose from the outside of the building through the bale room window. At this stage the whole roof burst into flames, and it was then that I saw Mr. W. Swan who is quite familiar with the lay of the whole building. I asked him if it were possible to save the rest of the building in any way and he said it was impossible as he had just come down from the top storey and that the fire had a strong hold up there. Everyone then turned to the task of getting as much stuff from...\nthe building as possible. The hose on the main floor was too short to reach right up to the south side of the class room where the first smoke was seen, but there was sufficient pressure to enable one to throw a stream of water across the room. Those who first saw the fire are quite agreed that the first actual flame appeared in the partition between the washrooms on the ground floor on the south side of the building. About two and a half feet from the ground in this partition was a hole where once had been a toilet fixture. It is here that both Miss Lou Atwood and Engineer Snowden saw the first signs of naked flame. The partition wall was of lath and plaster construction and it is my opinion that some of the boys may have been smoking cigarettes after dinner and perhaps the supervisor had come in to the playroom and they had then thrown the remains down into this hole in order to get it out of sight.\n\nIn one or two of the statements mention was made of the fact that the engineer had been in the habit of using a blow torch to thaw out frozen pipes. When I heard this first I thought that here was the immediate cause, but if the engineer and his assistant are telling the truth there was no blow torch used in these rooms since the Monday preceding the fire of Friday. It is a fact that Friday was a comparatively mild day and there should have been no frozen pipes on that day. I had no personal knowledge that the engineer was resorting to this highly dangerous practice of using a blow torch in the building else it would have been immediately stopped. Some mention has been made as to the possibility that Kenneth McNab, aged five years, who was adopted by the school when a baby, was responsible for putting lighted matches down into the hole in the partition, but this boy was up on the second storey all morning in the infirmary. I have this from both the doctor and also from one of the boys who was with him. I can find no one who actually saw the engineer using a blow torch in the boys' washrooms on the day of the fire, but there was a rumour to this effect going the rounds.\n\nThe power plant might have been saved had there been a hydrant on the outside of the building. The furnaces and boilers I believe are uninjured, and the filter tank and pressure tanks do not appear to be badly damaged. The main building was completely gutted, only portions of the outside wall remaining standing, and these are being pulled down for the sake of safety.\n\nThe children were filed out in perfect order, and the younger ones taken over to the old school annex where they were made as comfortable as possible; the older ones remaining to assist with the work of saving as much of the contents of the building as was possible.\n\nThe cigarette theory, in the absence of any more tangible, appears to be reasonable for the following reasons. The boys would have come from their dinner at 12:30 going direct to their playroom. School would commence again at 1:30 P.M. A cigarette which is lit to the head of the partition at any time during the forty-minute interval would take some time to set fire to the lath, and it was shortly after 2:00 P.M. that smoke was first discovered. The supervisor has both the senior and junior playrooms to watch and it is not at all improbable that a boy could smoke unknown to him, by going in to the washroom. I shall make further inquiries and if anything new is discovered I will immediately advise you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI should like to have some of the staff questioned, also some of the pupils, as to whether they had seen the Engineer, Mr. Snowden, using a blow torch that particular day, and I am directing that this be done. However, I am of the opinion that the fire started in the hole in the wall between the lavatories, where there must have been an accumulation of rubbish, especially as the hole had been there such a long time.\n\nRegarding the foundations, boilers, and laundry machinery, I am asking Mr. Swan who was the Engineer in charge of the construction of this school, to go out and make a report, and ascertain if anything should be done to salvage the stuff that is there. Mr. Swan will give a very full report, which will be forwarded to you in due course.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that 44 children are now safely housed at Elkhorn School and I have made arrangements to procure the extra equipment necessary to carry on the work with these additional children. I shall make a further report as to how the children remaining on the reserve are getting along at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an investigation with reference to the fire at the Gordon's School which occurred last Friday. The report gives a good deal of information, but I regret to say there is nothing definite brought out as to the cause of the fire. In addition to the report there are the signed statements of the various members of the staff, as well as a rough sketch of the school showing where the fire is supposed to have started, and this can be studied after reading the report of the Agent. My own opinion is that there is no doubt the fire started in the frame partition dividing the junior and senior boys' lavatories. The first indication of a fire was smoke coming out of the register immediately above the lavatories and as the outside walls of the basement are of concrete construction the only place it could start would be where there was something that would burn. Once the fire started it would naturally run up between the studding and then along the floor joists in the direction of the bale room where the fire seemed to be the hottest. You will notice that the fire must have been burning for a long time before the flames actually broke out and became visible. People were able to drive out the eight miles from Punnichy with horses before the flames had really broken out through the roof. As for the smoke coming out of the cupola when the Agent arrived, this can be easily understood as there would be a straight draft from the spot where the fire was located to the cupola.\n\n-I should-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nMr. Snowden, who was Engineer in charge at the Gordon Indian Residential School, has just been in my office and has given me an account of the fire that took place there. Mr. Snowden went on duty on Friday morning at 4:45. He inspected the lavatories at about six o'clock and found everything in working order. He again visited them about nine o'clock. He went off duty at noon and after his meal he retired to his room, and had only been there a very short time when a boy ran up to him and told him that the school was on fire. He states that inside of two minutes he was back at the building, and gave his assistant, an Indian boy, instructions to start the engines, which the boy did without any difficulty, and kept the pumps going at sixty pounds pressure all through the fire. He then went to the classroom and found it full of smoke, and Mr. Sinclair, a young, junior teacher, playing the hose on the floor where there were no flames. He rushed outside and broke through the outside window of the lavatory and saw the flames working in the wooden partition dividing the two lavatories\u2014not in the outside wall. He took with him several fire extinguishers but they had little effect on the flames. At the time he was there he was quite satisfied that the flames had not reached the first floor above, and this was the floor they were applying the water on. He told Sinclair, who had the hose upstairs, that it was useless to play the water there, and that he should get the hose around where the fire was. However, this was not done he claims and it was a long time after this before the fire broke through the flooring\u2014probably 35 minutes.\n\n-He claims-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHe claims that the fire was in the partition, and the partition only, for a long time. He also informs me that there was a hole in the partition dividing the senior and junior boys' lavatories. This hole was about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. from the ground, and he states that no doubt it was filled with rubbish and that, in his opinion, this is where the fire originated.\n\nI was surprised to learn from Mr. Snowden, who has been at the Gordon School since April, that he had never witnessed a fire drill at the school and did not think there had been one. I am writing to the Principal to ascertain if this is correct. I may say that the school authorities have been told repeatedly that they were to have fire drill. The Agent has also been advised to this effect and if it is true that there has been no drill in that length of time there is severe censure coming to someone. Of course, there have been several changes in the staff there in the last two years, too many in fact, and it is possible that one Principal has just followed the practice of the other. Why they ever left this hole in the partition, knowing that boys do often smoke cigarettes and play with matches, is hard to understand. This, in my opinion, shows that someone has been careless.\n\nAs I have told you, I am having Mr. Moore make further inquiries regarding the report that Mr. Snowden had used a blow-torch on the day of the fire. Up to date we have had no evidence that he did use it. Mr. Snowden emphatically denies having used a torch that day or the day before, and he seemed to me to be a truthful young man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

Moore, Indian Agent came to this detachment and requested me to take charge of a relief party enroute to the Gordon Indian residential School as the School was in flames and he was leaving immediately with the medical surgeon.\n\nAt his request and upon the instructions of the N.C.O. I/C of this Detachment I gathered together a party of volunteer fire fighters and patrolled to the scene of the fire with the Indian Agency team and sleigh.\n\nUpon my arrival Mr. S.S. Moore with the aid of the Indians of the Gordon Reserve was desperately endeavouring to check the fire which was gutting the north wing of the school which comprised the boys dormitory and playground. From the information I received I gathered that the fire had started between the ceiling of the first floor and the floor of the second. There was only one hose available and this was steadily pouring water into the blaze. The fire was already well under way and although fire extinguishers were applied they were of no avail. After a short time the one water hose broke at the connections and while it was being repaired the flames broke out beyond control and swept the building.\n\nThe staff and pupils had been steadily removing the contents of the building and the party of Punnichy Citizens rendered every possible aid in this respect so that the loss was reduced to a minimum. After it became quite evident that the fire had got beyond control I satisfied myself that there were no pupils or others remaining in the School and when the larger portion of the contents were removed I closed the front door into the school to bar further entrance.\n\nWhile I endeavoured to remove the children to a safe distance from the fire, the Citizens of Punnichy hastily removed the furniture and other contents to a reasonably safe distance and in a short while everything was cleared away from the doomed building and the children were conveyed by team to a place of shelter.\n\nEvery effort was put forth by Mr. S.S. Moore, Indian Agent to save the building but his arrival had been too late owing to the school being six miles distant from the town and the slow means of transport as the roads were blocked with snow and it was necessary to drive by team. Within four hours of the first report the flames had completely gutted the building and it was soon a ruined mass.\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nOffice of the Commissioner.\n\nRef.

He states that the rumour evidently started amongst the pupils who had seen the torch being used on other occasions. Mr. Snowden, the Engineer, stated that it would not have been possible for him to use the torch on Friday, the day of the fire, as it was broken on Wednesday and had not been repaired. The Agent says he saw the torch and that it could not be used in its present condition.\n\nThe Agent informs me that he also spoke to Mr. Williams, the boys' supervisor, and he informed him that he often noticed the smell of tobacco smoke in the boys' playrooms, but had never been able to find any traces of cigarettes in either of the rooms, and this lends strength to the theory that a cigarette was dropped in the hole in the partition where it would be out of sight.\n\nThis is all the information I have been able to obtain in connection with the fire up to date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I am inclined to concur with your opinion that the fire started in the partition between the boys' washrooms. I note that Mr. Williams, the boys' supervisor, informed Mr. Indian Agent Moore that he often smelled tobacco smoke in the boys' playrooms but had never been able to find any trace of cigarettes. This leads me to wonder if the supervision was all it should have been.\n\nI am at a loss to understand why the hole, left when the fixtures were removed, was not boarded up and finished. Our own officers who visit this school should have insisted on the necessary repair.\n\nI shall be glad to have your report, concerning what machinery, etc., can be salvaged, and I should also like to have your recommendation regarding any educational activity that can be carried on in the buildings that remain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, No. 121-1-1, regarding arrangements that have been made for the care of pupils at the Gordon's Residential School. I may say that, while the Elkhorn School would be considered crowded according to the rules of the Department, I think that with the instructions I have given Mr. Eley there will be ample fresh air supplied the pupils while in the dormitories and the classrooms. Mr. Eley is very particular with regard to matters of this kind and assures me that the windows will be kept well open and good ventilation provided.\n\nI have not been called upon to buy very much stuff other than beds and mattresses, and a few cups and saucers. All the blankets and quilts saved from the fire were transferred to the Elkhorn School.\n\nI note that you are considering enrolling some of the children at the Onion Lake School, should there be any that are not in proper homes on the reserve. I did give this matter thought, but I know it will meet with opposition by the Indians and I do not think it wise to insist on the children being sent so long a distance from home. As a matter of fact, it would be almost impossible to do this during the winter, as there is a long fifty mile drive across the country to the school.\n\nI have already suggested to the Bishop that it might be possible to have to send some children to File Hills, to which he readily agreed, but he would not like to send them into Alberta or any distance from home.\n\nI am doing the very best I can and using the best judgment to straighten out the problems that arise from day to day regarding this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are about 36 children that will be in attendance at this school, and most of them live within walking distance. The Misses Atwater, who have been connected with the Gordon School for the last 16 or 15 years, one as a teacher and the other as head matron, will take charge of the class room work. The Principal, Mr. Stanford, will remain at the school and look after the situation as well as it can be looked after. As you are aware, the care of the stock and the matter of farming will have to be carried on.\n\nArchdeacon Knowles informs me that he is of the same opinion as Mr. Swan regarding the condition of the boilers, pressure tanks and other machinery, i.e.\u2014that it can be salvaged and made use of again. He is very anxious for the Department to put up a building that can be used later on as a storehouse, but for the present used as living quarters for the Misses Atwater and a couple of the girls who will be kept at the school for the purpose of assisting in preparing meals for the farm boys.

A building 24 x 15, strongly constructed, would cost between $500.00 and $600.00, and I should be glad to have your authority to proceed with the work. At the present time these two young women are living in one small room which is scarcely large enough for one person, let alone two. The matter of placing this building on a concrete foundation would have to be left in abeyance until the weather became milder. In the meantime it could be erected so that the foundation could be put in later on and the building dropped down on it.\n\nAttached is a list of material that will be required if this school is to be started up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFebruary 27, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your S12-11A C.B. of the 18th instant. I note that Reverend Mr. Stanford is remaining at the Gordon School and that arrangements are being made to carry on with the farming there. I have also noted that the church authorities would like to conduct a day class in the frame annex to the old school.\n\nThe Department approves of this arrangement and you may erect a small building at an estimated cost of $550 as a temporary teacher's residence. This building can be used, later, as a warehouse in the event of reconstruction of the school. You may purchase the desks, blackboards, etc., on the list which accompanied your letter. The books, however, which form the second part of the list, will be ordered from the King's Printer. The Department will allow salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month in the case of the two Misses Atwater.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 28, 1929.\n\nMy dear Bishop Harding,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant sending me a copy of a resolution passed by the Executive Committee of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle with reference to the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nIt was a matter of deep regret to me to hear of the total loss of the Gordon School by fire. I understand that the best possible arrangements under these untoward circumstances have been made by the Department for the pupils of the school and the continuance of educational work on the reserve. The necessity for the erection of a new school and the provision of the funds comes unfortunately at a very inopportune time. Our estimates for the year have been completed and I am not able to promise that it will be possible to obtain any further grants for Indian education for the next fiscal year. This will necessitate a postponement, but I will note the matter for sympathetic consideration in connection with some future estimate. Meanwhile I have instructed the Department to make every effort to minimize the effect of the loss of this building upon your work on the Gordon's reserve.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Rev.

This question has received careful consideration, but I wrote the Lord Bishop of Gasp\u00e9 a few weeks ago that, unfortunately, nothing could be done this coming building season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[C.

In reply to this I would point out that the suggestion that the fire was caused by the dropping of a match into a crack in the plaster in the boys' play room was entirely theoretical. I have visited the School and from the evidence obtained there am of the opinion that the fire commenced in the centre of the building and very close to the bake room and not at the east angle of the building as suggested; also that it is quite possible the origin of the fire may very well have been from exposed wiring caused by mice. The fact that the bake room was unapproachable from the very first seems to support this theory.\n\nWith regard to the action of the staff my information is that the children were removed under perfect discipline and with the utmost promptitude and entirely without injury.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply to this I beg to point out that the suggestion that the fire was caused by the dropping of a match into a crack in the plaster in the bale room was entirely theoretical. I have visited the school and from the evidence obtained there am of the opinion that the fire commenced in the centre of the building and very close to the bale room and not at the east angle of the building as suggested; also that it is quite possible the origin of the fire may very well have been from exposed wiring caused by mice. The fact that the bale room was unapproachable from the very first seems to support this theory.\n\nWith regard to the action of the staff my information is that the children were removed under perfect discipline and with the utmost promptitude and entirely without injury.\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle,\n\nWe understand that reference has been made to lack of fire-drill. We have on our files a letter from the previous Principal stating the methods of fire-drill used, which effectually dispenses of this charge.\n\nAs the fire was entirely concealed by the inner walls and as it was not a fire proof building the fire defied the utmost efforts of not only the staff but a number of men who immediately came down from Punnichy. So devoted were the efforts of the staff towards the suppression of the fire that they lost practically all their personal effects. It is very doubtful if even an experienced fire brigade could have controlled this fire.\n\nMention could also be made that with a single hose for each floor and with smoke pouring out in parts of each flat it would not have been possible for a hose to reach every angle of the building on any one flat without securing a hose from another floor. That the water pressure from the engine room was fully maintained is evidenced by the fact that one of the hose was burst in the operation. It all goes to show the positive need of a fire proof building. Our Committee is persuaded that every effort was made on behalf of the staff working under extreme difficulties with the temperature at 25 degrees below zero.\n\nThe matter which most deeply concerns the Diocesan Committee at this time is the suggestion of any delay in the matter of re-building the School as we cannot think such a policy would be compatible with the best interests of the Indian children and their parents on our three reserves, viz., Gordon's Indian Reserve, Bay Stars I.R., and Poorman's I.R., nor with the great efforts the Church in this Diocese has made on behalf of Indian Work; nor with the condition of things as they stand as regards expenditure of money and equipment belonging to both the Department and to the Diocese at Gordon's School.\n\nIn addition to the school building there is on the school site the following buildings:\n\n1. Large horse barn, with 11 high-grade farm horses\n2. Large cattle barn, with pure bred Holstein bull, four pure bred holstein cows, 19 high-grade cows, 6 colts and 1 calf.\n3.

Large horse barn, with 11 high-grade farm horses\n2. Large cattle barn, with pure bred Holstein bull, four pure bred holstein cows, 19 high-grade cows, 8 yearlings and 1 calf,\n3. Large quantity of harness and farm machinery\n4. Principal's residence\n5. School Farm Instructor's residence\n6. Poultry buildings.\n7. Laundry buildings.\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle:\n\nThe Diocese has a half section of land adjoining the School on which there are 63 acres under cultivation. There is also a five acre garden and 9 acres of new breaking on the Department's land around the buildings and permission has recently been granted to break 40 acres on an adjoining quarter belonging to the Department.\n\nWe have an Farm Instructor\n\nMr. John Holyoak, recently of Indian Head, and one of the most experienced cattle men in the Province. During the past year a considerable sum of money has been expended at his request on both implements and stock and he is prepared for most progressive work on our farm land during the ensuing year, with the assistance of the larger boys of the school. If there is to be any delay in proceeding with the re-erection of the school this excellent work behalf of the Indians on the Reserve and the boys in the school will be curtailed. The wages of the School Farm Instructor are entirely provided by the Diocese with a view to establishing a model farm both as to a support towards the School and also as a most effective way of instruction to the boys of the institution. In the opinion of this Committee it would be a very serious matter to delay the progress of this great work.\n\nThe suggestion that a Day School should be carried on is to our mind a very temporary measure, the only building available for such use being the old school building situated about a mile from the School. There are over forty children of the school on Gordon's Reserve and many of these would be at a very considerable distance from the old school, so much so that arrangements for conveyance would have to be made. We also have nine children of school age on Poorman's Reserve and nine children of school age on Day Stars Reserve who were attending Gordon's School, together with 44 children from other Reserves who have been removed to Elkhorn School since the fire.\n\nA suggestion has been made as to frequent changes of Principals but we would like to point out that the late Rev. Canon Atwater was thirteen years Principal and although it is true there have been three principals who have left the school since 1925, yet those who have much experience in Indian school work it would indicate that the Diocese is making its utmost efforts to obtain the most efficient man in all the branch of the work entailed in an Indian Residential School and that the fact of having had several changes in evidence that the Diocese has been ceaseless in its efforts to keep in this position only a man of superlative attainments.\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle.\n\nIn the present Principal, the Rev. F. Stanford, we believe we have found such a man.\n\nIn evidence of the splendid work that the Church has done on this Indian Reserve and in this School we would point out that from the information we are able to obtain it is considered to be the healthiest school and the nearest Reserve of any in Western Canada and that this is largely due to the Principals and their devoted staff in the last twenty years. The absolute devotion of the graduates of this Institution on these Reserves is a living testimony to the excellent work of the Church in the past forty years. During the past two years we have completed and equipped a large Church capable of seating some three hundred and everything surrounding it bears witness to the devotion of the Indians.\n\nNot the least of the most serious effects which would arise out of delay in re-building the school would be the impression left upon the minds of many thousands of parishioners of the Church in this Diocese who have shown their devotion and generosity to our Indian work at Gordon's School, hundreds of whom have visited the School and have seen and appreciated all that we are doing. Almost every branch of the Woman's Auxiliary in our Parish has taken a share in clothing a child of the School by direct yearly contributions. The loss of the School came as a personal shock to many hundreds of our people and it would be an unthinkable thing to them that the most mature and sympathetic consideration would not be given in response to such an appeal on their behalf.\n\nIt should be pointed out that if immediate steps can be taken a good deal of the material would be available for the erection of the School, much of which would be spoiled through weathering if there is delay. The boilers, high pressure tanks, and large water filter, together with pumps, pipes and equipment are uninjured, also some of the inner walls, smoke stacks, etc., also the batteries were salvaged, in fact practically all the machinery excepting dynamo and dynamo engine. Immediate care will be necessary to save this portion of the equipment.\n\nYour committee feels that it has your Lordship's deepest sympathy in appealing on behalf of a work which lies very close to the hearts of thousands of our people on the prairie and which has such a real place in the lives of so many as one of the most important Institutions in Western Canada.\nThe Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle.\n\nWe strongly appeal for the erection of a fire proof building with adequate and frequently tested fire equipment.\n\nBelieve me, my Lord,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman, Indian Committee.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nSADDLE LAKE LAND SALES\n\nE. \u00a7 36., TWP. 57., RGE.

L. MacKenzie King,\nPrime Minister of Canada,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie King,\n\nThe destruction of our Indian Residential School by fire last January inflicted a terrible loss upon the Church in this Diocese of Qu'Appelle. Gordon's Indian School has been the constant care and pride of the Church for seventy years; and now most of the children are scattered, the teachers living in shacks, and the situation very serious as far as our Indian Work is concerned.\n\nThe Indian Department and our Church Societies have given us sympathy and ready help, but I have been distressed today in meeting Dr. Duncan Scott in Regina, and in hearing from the Hon. Chas. Stewart, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, that the Department is not able to promise further grants for Indian Education for the next fiscal year, and that we may be left without our Indian Residential School for some time.\n\nI wish to most earnestly plead, in the name of the Indians, the Clergy, and the Laity throughout this Diocese, living in close upon 500 centres, for the obtaining of a further grant for Indian Education which will allow of the immediate reconstruction of Gordon's School. The situation which the postponement of the reconstruction of the school will create is serious in the extreme. The Staff must be provided for; the farm instruction work must be carried on; the stock must be attended to, and forty children living around must be provided for. Moreover, the foundations of the school are intact, and the furnace and boilers can now be utilized. I should say that an additional sum of ninety to one hundred thousand dollars will make the necessary provision. I feel the situation is so serious that I am leaving for Ottawa after my Confirmations on Sunday to interview the\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nMay I ask your interest and concern in this matter of vital importance to the Indian work and the Church in this Diocese.\n\nWith dutiful respects,\n\nI am,\n\nObdiently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the end of the March quarter, the actual residential school earnings were $1,763.51, based on an average attendance of 45.51. The June quarter earnings are $1,032.69 - the average attendance being 26.65. I believe that this per capita payment should be made and then, later, upon request, the $90 per teaching month for the two teachers could be allowed. It is possible that they may ask for an additional payment in lieu of unearned per capita grant, but perhaps the Department had better cross this bridge when it comes to it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Holyoak was taken on the staff at the Gordon's school as Farming Instructor on the 1st December, 1928. On the 10th July last he was seriously gored by a bull and was brought to the Grey Nuns' hospital in Regina, where he died the following day. Mr. Henry William Holyoak, concerning whom Mr. Paget gave you a memorandum, is a brother of the deceased above named.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMarch 14, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Miller,\n\nYou inquired the other day about a Mr. Holyoak who you understood was at one time in the service of the Department. I find that he was a school employee and not an employee of the Department. I have received a report from Mr. W. H. Graham who states: \"Mr. R. A. Holyoak was taken on the staff at the Gordon's school as Farming Instructor on the 1st December, 1928. On the 10th July last he was seriously gored by a bull and was brought to the Grey Nuns' Hospital in Regina, where he died the following day.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn Millar, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nGordon's School.\n\nI am not surprised at the report on the Gordon School. The Principal here is not measuring up, and I hate to see a beautiful building like the new school placed under the management of Mr. Stanford. He is untidy in himself, and in my opinion he could not tell whether children were clean or dirty. This is a bad example to the Indians. The Misses Atwater are not overly particular along this line either, and it seems a pity to see a building so modern and up-to-date placed in the hands of such people. There is no excuse for the school grounds being in the untidy condition described by the Inspector. This country is overrun with tourists since the automobile has come into general use, and it is not right that our institutions should come in for the criticism that they do from time to time. It is absolutely unnecessary; we can get proper men to put in charge of these schools if we insist on it. I do not think Mr. Stanford could earn $50.00 a month in any other occupation.\nGORDON'S SCHOOL\n\nThe classroom work is carried on in the old boarding school, and I found 28 children on the roll. There were 21 present, 10 boys and 11 girls. The grades range as follows:\n\nGrade I - 3\n\" II - 1\n\" III - 6\n\" IV - 1\n\" V - 9\n\" VI - 5\n\" VII - 3\n\nMiss L. Atwater is in charge of the work, and fair progress is being made. The children appear fairly well along in their grades, but they do not speak out well.\n\nThe children\nGORDON'S SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe children were well clothed, but some were very untidy. Their hands were dirty, and only one or two had their hair neatly combed. I spoke to the pupils about this condition, and had them clean up before the noon meal was served. I do not think some of the children could get such dirty hands unless they had been neglected for a number of days.\n\nThe meal is served upstairs, and consisted of potatoes boiled with a small piece of meat, and slices of brown bread spread with lard. Each child had one potato, a small portion of meat, and two slices of bread. They were given water to drink, but I understand sometimes they have milk.\n\nThe yard about the school was very untidy, but before I left the Agency, the boys had raked and cleaned away all the dirt and rubbish that had collected during the winter, and the place was in a much better condition.\n\nThe new school is an excellent building, and presents a very fine appearance. The brick work was finished, except for the chimney, and part of the cement floors had been laid. I understand the work is progressing satisfactorily.\nMay 19, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to refer to your 312-11A of the 8th instant, reporting on the Gordon Indian Residential School. Perhaps you had better discuss this situation with the Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle, with a view to arranging for a really competent principal and staff before the new building is occupied. You might let me know what progress you make.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\u2014\nI beg to report on the Gordon Indian Residential School as follows.\n\nOn my visit to the classroom of this school the register showed thirty pupils, twenty one being present, seven working at the school, one away sick, one recently discharged. The classroom was well aired, and fairly tidy but overcrowded. Two of the boys had dirty hands; they did not appear to have been washed this morning so I made them wash before I left. The other boys were clean, and the girls were clean and tidy. The outside of the school is untidy, one closet being perched up on a frame of logs makes it look worse. The principal was asked last month to get the closets put in shape but only one has been moved.\n\nA new boys supervisor named Mr. Mullins has lately taken over the work here, I told him about the boys being dirty.\n\nThe kitchen and girls dormitory building was very tidy and clean.\n\nThe boys dormitory upstairs from the laundry was clean, having just been scrubbed, but looks very untidy being badly overcrowded.\n\nOn my January report I stated that the class room was the dirtiest I ever examined, February and March returns stated matters were in better shape. April return stated that appearance of school was improved classrooms untidy. The conditions make it hard to keep this place spotless and span but I state again as I did in my April return that the pupils could be kept cleaner with very little supervision. The supervision of this place is slack, the Principal seems to be too easy going and good natured.\n\nEach time I have reported anything about this school I have also told the Principal what to do, but I have not time myself to continually having to tell him things he should see himself.\n\nThe old ice house and the old laundry at this place should be moved or they will be out of place when the new school is built. The new ice house, girls dormitory, garage, laundry, three barns and dwelling require painting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It clearly indicates that the Principal and the staff are not qualified to manage a residential school, and as this staff is shortly to take charge of the new school I fear that the results will be anything but satisfactory.\n\nI wrote to you on the 8th May regarding Mr. Stanford, and forwarded Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the school, and I received a reply from you dated the 19th May, saying that I should take the matter up with the Bishop. Unfortunately, the Bishop of this Diocese has not been successful, in my opinion, in selecting a staff for this school in the past. We have had four very incompetent Principals, and the present one is perhaps as poor as any we have had. He is untidy and a poor example to the Indians, and I do not consider he is capable of managing the school as it should be managed. The Bishop is away at the present time and will not be back until next Fall.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is expending a large sum of money for physical equipment at Gordon's. It is wise to insist on a highly qualified principal, a good engineer and a generally satisfactory staff.

Just fancy a school being carried on for three months without having the floor of the classroom scrubbed. This should not pass the Department. I am writing to the Principal myself on this matter, because I think it is terrible.\n\nThe Agent reports that the general management is slack. This is the Principal whom the Department is allowing to take charge of one of our most important schools in the West. I have already drawn the Department's attention to this matter, and the only thing left for me to do is to take it up with the Bishop, which will mean a long controversy. The man is incompetent and I think the Department should insist on having someone else appointed. You state in your letter of the 11th ultimo that you will write to Archdeacon Knowles, but I have not been told what has been written to him.

As you are aware, the Department has recently undertaken a large expenditure at this institution and we should be very grateful if the Diocesan authorities would see that a really competent man is appointed without delay.

Dobie, D.D., of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, indicating the necessity of engaging a thoroughly competent man. I suggested that the engineer that they selected should interview either you or Mr. Waddy at Punnichy, if a local man. I note that a Mr. Angel has applied to you for the post.

I found the work was just about being wound up, but nothing had been done to clean up the surroundings, and there is a big job ahead. The workmanship, as far as I could see, was first class.\n\nThe object of my visit to the school was to arrange for the erection of an implement shed, storehouse, hen house, and repairs to other out-buildings.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Stanford's management, I may say that the yard surrounding his own house was in a disgraceful condition - all littered up, and weeds all over the place. In fact, if an Indian kept his yard in such shape, he would be found fault with by the Agent. The Agent took me over to a field of potatoes a mile away, which were put in for the use of the school. You would have to get out of your car and walk in to find the potatoes. The whole enclosure was one seething mass of weeds. The garden surrounding the school was not much better. A cultivator had been drawn between the rows of potatoes and the weeds. It is a disgraceful situation. This school is situated on the reserve with the idea of developing the Indians along the proper lines, and all I can say is that, having this school under the present management is nothing more than a menace to the progress of the Indians. It also makes it difficult for the Agent to say anything to the Indians about the way in which\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nway in which they keep their premises when they can turn around and point to the school, which is supposed to be an example. Mr. Stanford is not only careless about matters of this kind, but also his own personal appearance. He is not particular. I would ask the Department not to open this school or allow the pupils to return to school until the church appoint a proper Principal to take charge. It is not fair to the Indians, nor to anybody connected with the Department.\n\nI would again point out that Mr. Stanford has been furnishing a list of fixtures and equipment required at the school. Surely the Department are not taking advice from a man they know is incompetent and likely to be dismissed from the service. I wonder if all branches of the Department at Ottawa, that have dealings with this school, know what the situation is at this point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

It was my intention, after consultation with them, first, to see our Indian Commissioner here and take up the charges made with him and obtain his advice and counsel. After seeing the Commissioner I was asking the Chairman of the Indian Committee and the Dean to accompany me to Gordon's interview the Principal.

I have known this man for years. He was in this summer asking me for the position and I told him at the time that I did not consider he was qualified for it, but that he could go and be interviewed by a party here who knew all about engines. This he did, and the report I received from this party was that Mr. Fyre did not have the necessary qualifications to handle the plant. I gave this information to Mr. Stanford, but in the face of it I am told that he has gone ahead and engaged Mr. Fyre.\n\nBefore writing this letter I called up the R.A. Lister Company who supplied the plant to the Gordon School, and they state that on no account should this man have been placed in charge of it. I also consulted Mr. Swan, who is a practical man, and he too informs me that he would not recommend Mr. Fyre for the job, as he feels he is not capable of handling the plant.\n\nI have instructed Agent Waddy to tell the Principal that Mr. Fyre is not to touch the plant, and I should be glad if you would wire Mr. Stanford, confirming my instructions in this matter.\n\nDuncan C.

General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nMy dear Doctor Scott,\n\nOn Tuesday last I visited Gordon's Indian Residential School and found the school practically finished and the Principal waiting for the arrival of the furniture, shelves, and fittings. The building is a credit to the Department and will I hope serve admirably the purpose for which it has been erected.\n\nThe Principal, himself, has laboured under great difficulty during the last eighteen months but has kept things going and that is about all. He has improved the condition of the land surrounding the school and endeavoured to make the best of things during a most trying period. You will understand the difficulties he has been facing in endeavouring to carry on.\n\nQuite frankly I considered with him, one by one, the objections to his continuing in the office of principal but to each objection made he supplied an explanation and asked for an opportunity for considering with the Indian Commissioner here the charges made. I feel this procedure is wise and necessary. Yesterday I interviewed Mr. Graham and he is arranging for the proposed meeting at an early date. Mr. Stanford is certainly anxious to do his duty and make good but whether he can satisfactorily answer the charges made and prove himself efficient to the satisfaction of the Department remains to be seen.\nDr. Duncan Scott.\n\nAfter Mr. Stanford has presented his case I shall again interview Mr. Graham and then call together the Diocesan Indian Committee for advice concerning future action.\n\nThe Indian Department and the Indian Commissioner here, I feel confident, know the Church in the Diocese is ready and anxious to co-operate with the Department in ensuring efficiency in the Principal and his staff.\n\nThe Bishop and the Diocesan Committee are agreed that efficiency here will be to the last benefit of the Indian and their children and will be ready to do everything reasonable to satisfy the requirements of the Department.\n\nWith highest regard,\n\nI am,\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHM/ER.\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Gordon Indian Residential School yesterday. There were 13 pupils in the classroom, 14 working around the premises, and one sick.\n\nThe new school has been occupied, pupils are sleeping on the floors yet. No furniture has been supplied to this school yet.\n\nThe carpenters informed me that when they moved the old hostel used by the girls for sleeping quarters that they found a quantity of bed bugs. I asked the matron if the matresses had been fumigated before being moved into the new school and she said they had not. She asked me for fine combs to get the lice out of the hair of the pupils, I sent her half a dozen. This shows the condition of the children.\n\nIn the cellar the sewage comes up through the traps and floods the floor when water is let down the drains, I beg to recommend that the contractor be wired to regards this matter, the sewers are not in shape and if used as they are will probably cause typhoid.\n\nThe matron tells me that in her opinion the pupils are not given enough food, especially meat. There is not enough equipment too cook with, not enough cups to go around etc., in fact the whole establishment is out of gear.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nW.M.Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nD REGINA, SASK., Oct. 20th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter that I received this morning from Indian Agent Waddy, dealing with matters at the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nWhy the children were ever moved into this building and allowed to sleep on the floors is hard to understand. It will be little short of a crime if they have moved the dirty mattresses into this new building, as it will mean that the whole place will be infested with vermin, under the type of supervision that is being given now.\n\nWith regard to the sewage backing up, this is a matter on which I do not wish to comment. The Department has been looking after the construction of the building, and all that I know is the name of the contractor.\n\nI have no comment to make regarding the food, as the reports I have received from our Inspectors have never led me to believe that the children were being underfed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

General.\n\nThe resignation of the present Principal of Gordon's Indian Residential School will take place, all being well, the end of next month, and we shall endeavour to find a Principal who will be acceptable to the Department as soon as possible. When the choice has been definitely made, I will inform the Department.\nOttawa, December 3, 1930.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nI wish to refer that portion of your letter of October 31st which stated that you were taking steps to secure a properly qualified principal for the Gordon Indian Residential School. I know his Lordship and yourself are doing what you can in the matter. The recent report from our travelling nurse is fresh evidence that present conditions are not satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nVenerable E. H. Knowles, L.L.B.,\nArchdeacon of Qu'Appelle,\nSynod House,\nRegina,\nSaskatchewan.\nWE, the undersigned Indians belonging to the Poorman Band, plead for higher education for our children. We find that our school officers do not take our children on to the higher grades, but as soon as they are fit to go to a higher grade the child has to set out to work until of age to leave the school. We regret to find that the officials of the Indian Department do not allow an Indian child to have any more than a very poor education. We know that if an Indian child can be trained and given a good education there is no reason why he should not succeed in any profession or business. We would like to say with regard to a boarding school to which our children go that they do not get any education higher than grade 5, and some of them do not go higher than grade 3, and when they come out of school they know nothing to start to make a living with. We do not want our children to go to school to learn to work, but to get an education. We can teach them to work on the Reserve outside of school work, and we do not think our children get good teaching at the school, and we would like the Department to look into the matter.\nDiocese of Qu'Appelle\nSYNOD HOUSE\nREGINA, SASK.,\nCANADA\nDecember 6, 1930.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRE File No. 121-1-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of December 3rd., 1930.\n\nI may say that since the interview of his Lordship, the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, and myself with the Deputy Minister of Indian Affairs at Ottawa on September 17th last at which it was intimated that the Department required the appointment of a layman as Principal of Gordon's Indian Residential School; the Bishop and the Indian Committee of the Diocese have given much time and consideration to the matter with a view to carrying out this requirement.\n\nFor many years the policy has been to have a Principal who was a Priest in Holy Orders, and the requirement that the Principal should now be a Layman has necessarily created a position in which much consideration has had to be given by the Bishop and our Indian Committee to details which this change involves, including the appointment of both a Lay Principal and of a Chaplain to the School; with the consequent division of duties hitherto performed by one person. Great care has also been necessary in order that the changes thus required to be made should be carried out with the least possible effect upon the work of the school, the staff and the Reserve.\n\nAfter most careful consideration of all these matters with Indian Commissioner Graham,\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.\n\nthe Bishop has appointed Mr. Rowland William Frayling as Principal and he will enter upon his duties at once. The writer will accompany Mr. Frayling to the School on Monday next, December 8th.\n\nI visited the School on November 26th and was amazed to find that scarcely any of the furnishings required for the new school had arrived. This delay is of course very serious for us as we are not only keeping a large number of Indian parents anxious about their children who are still in their homes, but it has created complications with the persons we have selected for the new staff and who were expected to have entered upon their duties by September 1st. Some claims in respect of salaries will be made upon us for this period.\n\nThe Bishop and Indian Committee is doing everything in their power to help in these matters, but the situation has been most difficult.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. H. Knowles\n\nChairman, Indian Committee.\nOttawa, December 15, 1930.\n\nVenerable Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, nominating Mr. R. W. Frayling as principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School. I note that Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham has co-operated with you. The Department approves of Mr. Frayling's appointment and trusts there will be a career of much usefulness in this case.\n\nIt is true that there have been delays - some unavoidable - in connection with furnishing the new building, but steps were taken some time ago to complete this business.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nA.

I think perhaps the selection made will be an improvement over anything we have had. Mr. Frayling is going to the school on six months' probation, and he will have authority to dispense with the services of any members of the staff whom he does not consider competent.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. M. Qu'Appelle.\nDecember 23, 1930\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq., D.C.L.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRE Gordon's Indian Residential School\n\nI have to report that Mr. Rowland W. Frayling was duly installed in his duties as the new Principal of this School on the 8th inst. and has now had time to take over complete charge.\n\nHis Lordship has also appointed the Rev. John Rowlands as acting Chaplain of the School and the Church of St. Luke's, Gordon's Indian Reserve, and he has also commenced his duties. The Bishop is preparing for the appointment of a permanent Chaplain in the Spring.\n\nWe have been in the closest touch with the new Principal in regard to the furnishings and equipment of the School and have assisted him as far as possible in overcoming the difficulties which have had to be faced through the serious delay of the same.\n\nIt is now necessary for us to take up with you the matter of the special grants made to us in lieu of the regular per capita grant. Under this arrangement the former Principal, the Rev. F. Stanford, asked us to make requisition to the Department from time to time for the sum necessary to carry on while we kept things going in the best possible way by providing for some 14 boys and 15 girls in the small buildings around the new school.\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.\n\nand by carrying on a Day School in the Parish Hall on the Reserve.\n\nThe Rev. Stanford was required to keep strict account of these monies and an audited statement of account was to be required of him when the system of special grants came to an end by the opening of the new school. These accounts have been kept and this Office is in possession of a statement duly audited by Mr. Sydney A. Brown, the local Auditor at Punnichy. If the Department desires to have this audited statement now, we shall be glad to furnish it.\n\nIt was of course our expectation that the new school would be furnished and ready for occupation by July 1st. at the latest. In view of this our children who had been taken to the Elkhorn Indian Industrial School were not received back into that institution after the Summer Vacation, and since then have been with their parents on the reserves awaiting the notice to come to the new school.\n\nAdditional staff was arranged for and expected to commence their duties on August 1st. The Farm Instructor, the Engineer, the Boy's Supervisor, one teacher, laundry matron, sewing matron, assistant kitchen matron and acting head matron, have been steadily employed since that time, while the senior kitchen matron, and second teacher were engaged at that time and have been claiming their wages since. This heavy expense has had to be incurred as the new school should have been ready for use since the beginning of July. Farm work, garden work, the heating of the school and much of the work of the Staff has had to be carried on just as if the full quota of children had been in residence. A very competent engineer of long experience has been engaged at a larger salary as per your letter of February 24th., 1930. As the Winter was upon us the expenditure of fuel has also had to be the same, and in addition there has had to be the usual expenditure in feed for the horses and stock, the cost of which has been greatly increased owing to the heavy loss to both crops and gardens sustained through the destruction brought about by the terrific hailstorm early in August. Tons of hay have already been purchased from the Indians on the Reserve.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative for us to appeal to the Department for much increased assistance in the amount of the special grant required in lieu of the per capita grant which we should have been able to draw had the necessary equipment been forthcoming at the time the new school was completed. At least 125 children could have been in residence in the school during the past six months. The full capacity of the new school is 140. The per capita grant for 125 children for the quarter would have been $4,843.75, which is the amount we might have received for the last quarter, a sum which would have been sufficient to cover our needs.\n\nIn this connection we would respectfully point out that by the release of 44 children from the Elkhorn Indian School since July the Department was saved the per capita grant for six months at the rate of $170.00 per capita per annum, i.e., $3740.00.\n\nWe have had to give an order to the Bank of Montreal, Punnichy, allowing our Principal to overdraw and have further had to assist the finances of the School by drawing upon Diocesan Funds. It seems to us only reasonable that the Department should at least give us a special grant sufficient to offset this additional expenditure. We, therefore, ask, Sir, that the Department would make a grant of $4000.00 for the quarter ending December 31st., 1930. We have so far in this quarter received only $1500.00 on November 22nd. and sorely need the balance of $2500.00. We would also ask that the special grant at the rate of $4000.00 per quarter may be forthcoming until the full per capita grant for the new school may be drawn.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. H. Knowles.\nChairman, Indian Committee.\nDecember 23, 1930.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., D.C.L.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI have already advised you of the appointment of Mr. Rowland W. Frayling as Principal of Gordon's Indian School.\n\nMr. Frayling has already commenced his duties and has had time to take over the management of everything. Archdeacon Knowles has recently returned from Gordon's School where he installed Mr. Frayling in his new work.\n\nI have asked the Archdeacon to write you fully with regard to the financial situation and he is doing so by this mail. The expenditure for this quarter has necessarily been greatly increased as his communication will explain. I am, therefore, asking the Department to provide an additional sum of $2500.00 for the balance of this quarter, and to give us a special grant at the rate of $4000.00 per quarter until we are in a position to draw the full per capita grant by the incoming of all our children as soon as the furnishings and equipment of the School has been completed.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\n\nThe Diocese has been put to considerable expense in fulfilling the requirements of the Indian Department and I feel we can reasonably ask for the consideration named by the Chairman of the Indian Committee.\n\nWith kind wishes for the Christmas Season.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 2)\nDecember 31st, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Harding:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the current expenses at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. A second advance of $2,500 will be made towards the December quarter expenses. I cannot promise a special grant at any particular rate per quarter as our payments in lieu of per capita grant have to be determined by the actual expenditures which the Department should assume.\n\nIn this connection, I wish, also, to acknowledge Archdeacon Knowles' communication. The audited statement, supported by receipted accounts and paid cheques, should be retained by the Diocesan Office until such time as the school is again placed on a per capita grant basis. Then, all papers should be forwarded to Ottawa for examination and a final payment in lieu of per capita grant will be made. Of course, the Department assumes the major share of the costs. A statement should be attached showing what clothing, food, feed and fuel, etc., are on hand as from the date the per capita grant commences. Unconsumed necessities can hardly be considered a charge on the earlier period.\n\nThe Department expects the school to go on a per capita grant basis at the earliest possible date. As soon as the building is furnished and the institution is in running order again, the per capita grant method of meeting the expenses should be resumed.\n\nI am sure that Dr. Scott joins me and the other officers of the Department in wishing Your Lordship the compliments of the season. I regret that Dr. Scott is ill and is confined to his home at this time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. M.T.McA.

For the quarter beginning April 1st of the ensuing year I hope the Department will return to the per capita grant system. At the time of the fire the per capita grant was $155.00, but I was then pleading with the Department for an increased grant because of the long distance from the railway of the School. You will remember you felt that the matter might well be deferred until the completion of the new school. Will you please now deal with the matter.\n\nThe Chairman of the Indian Committee brings good reports of the School, and I shall be glad if the Department can increase the per capita grant and make conditions easier for the Principal, the Staff, and the children. The Principal is now quite out of funds, and I have been obliged to sign a note for the Bank to enable him to obtain necessary funds for carrying on until the receipt of funds from the Department.\n\nAll being well, the School will be formally opened and a large number of the children confirmed by the Bishop on June 24th, St. John the Baptist's Day, the anniversary of the consecration of the first Bishop of Qu'Appelle.\n\nWith highest regard, and all good wishes,\n\nI am Very sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The report of the Archdeacon to me is that the new Principal, Mr. Frayling, is enthusiastic and that he appears to be carrying on his work in a satisfactory manner. He states that the premises and the interior of the building are immaculate, and that the Church authorities are insisting on a competent staff being appointed. They intend to employ a high-class Farming Instructor as soon as one can be found. They have asked me to assist in locating such a man.\nApril 8, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Harding:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the Gordon's Indian Residential School. A few days ago, as soon as funds were available, I arranged with Mr. Ferrier to send a special grant of $3,000. A final payment, in lieu of per capita grant, will be made as soon as the statement requested in my letter of December 31st, last, is forwarded.\n\nThis school will be on per capita grant as from the first instant. The pupilage allowed at present is 100. The school, of course, should enroll about 104 or 105 pupils, so that they will be sure to show an average of 100. At a later date, when funds are available, the pupilage can be increased somewhat. I find that the air space in the dormitories allows a maximum pupilage of 120.\n\nAs far as the amount of the per capita grant is concerned, the Department has been unable this year to secure any increases in its Estimates, and the rate will have to remain at $155 per child for the current fiscal year. This is the same grant that is paid to other schools in the vicinity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. M. T. McA.

You mention the possibility of 135, or more, pupils being enrolled in the near future; but I wish to point out that the authorized pupilage at this school at the present time is only 100 and that the air space in the dormitories allows only a maximum pupilage of 120.

Our reason for asking for this is that we have now a complete staff, well able to handle in our new school at least 120 pupils, and that for the maintenance of such a staff and to cover the expenses of the large building it is of the greatest importance that we should have a minimum of 120 pupils and receive the per capita grant for that number in order to cover the cost of maintaining the larger building and the staff required which we have on hand now.\nA.S. Williams, Esq.\n\nWe trust, Sir, that the Department will give a favorable consideration to this appeal as it is most important for us that we should maintain the full number of pupils allowed for a school of this capacity.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

This institution seems to be starting out with a good staff according to the Inspector. Some of the staff I know, in fact I recommended that they be appointed. Mr. Angel, the Engineer, is one of the best in the country - highly qualified for his work. I have recommended Mrs. Brady for the position of Matron, but she had not been in charge very long at the time of the Inspector's visit. I expect that she will make a good showing. I suggested to the Church authorities that Mr. Wallace, the Farming Instructor, be appointed, and I believe he will make good.\n\nI may say that I received a rather adverse report from Nurse Wyatt on this school, but in view of the Inspector's report I am inclined to think that the work of the institution was not properly organized at the time Miss Wyatt was there. The Nurse's report in question is going forward today also.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGORDON'S C. of E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe new school is now being occupied, and since my last visit, Mr. R. W. Frayling has been appointed Principal.\n\nThe senior classroom is in charge of Miss Atwater, and the grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | 2   | 3   |\n|-------|-----|-----|\n|       | 3   | 7   |\n|       | 4   | 22  |\n|       | 5   | 9   |\n|       | 6   | 7   |\n|       | 7   | 1   |\n\nTotal 49\n\nI believe the children are making fair progress, although they do not speak out as well as might be expected, and are somewhat shy. They appear to understand their work, and I found their work books very tidy.\n\nThe children were well dressed, clean, and all had their hair neatly combed.\n\nThe classroom\nGORDON'S C. of E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe classroom was bright, well aired, and tidy.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Mr. F. Lumb, and all the pupils are in Grade 1, or beginners. There are fifty on the roll, 23 boys and 27 girls. I understand Mr. Lumb is a qualified teacher, and I would judge from his style and manner of presenting the work, that fair progress is being made.\n\nThe children were neatly dressed and clean. The room was well aired and tidy.\n\nThe kitchen is in charge of Mrs. J. Hughson, and I found the meals well prepared. The menu is made out each month by the Principal, and I understand this is strictly adhered to. A copy of the May menu, both for the staff and the children, is attached to this report. The girls are taught to make bread; in fact, all the bread used up until the present is mixed and worked by hand, and the bread in use during my visits was good. Butter making is also taught, although at present the milk supply is not large. More cows are expected to freshen soon, when the cream supply will be much greater.\n\nThe laundry is in charge of Mrs. C. Boate, and I found the department being operated in an orderly manner. The machinery is all well cared for, and the room was clean and tidy. The soft water tank is almost full, but no provision was made to connect this up with the laundry. Soft water is needed badly, and a pump should be installed.\n\nMiss Quick is the sewing matron, and appeared quite capable. The girls are taught mending,\nGORDON'S C. of E.

The work seen was well done.\n\nMiss Field is the girls' supervisor, and I found the dormitories clean, and the beds neatly made. The girls are provided with nightgowns, which I found neatly folded and placed beneath the pillows. The bedding is washed every two weeks.\n\nMr. P. T. Williams is the boys' supervisor, and I found the dormitory equally as well cared for as the girls'. The toilets were clean and in good working condition.\n\nThe machinery and boiler room is in charge of Mr. Angel, and could scarcely be kept in better condition. He is a good worker, and I believe thoroughly understands machinery. The Principal is very fortunate to have secured this man, and I believe that he (the principal) is quite aware of the fact.\n\nThe children are weighed each month, and a record is kept. Attached will be found a statement showing each child's weight for January, February, March, and April. It will be noted that in April some of the children lost weight, which, I understand, resulted from the effects of influenza. On my last visit to the school all the children were well, and for May and June, I would expect to find better gains. The keeping of these records entails considerable work, but by so doing one is able to keep a close check on each child, and if no gains are recorded, steps can be taken to find out the trouble before serious sickness sets in.\n\nThe dispensary\nGORDON'S C. of E. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe dispensary has been painted white, and I found the drugs neatly arranged on the shelves. The Principal's residence is in good condition, and is well furnished and well cared for.\n\nThe Farming Instructor's residence has been re-decorated, and is in excellent condition. I understand the work in connection with the cleaning of this house was all done by the staff and pupils.\n\nThe outbuildings, I found to be in good repair except for some of the cement foundation under the barn. This should be repaired.\n\nA great amount of work is needed on the grounds and roadways to give this school the surroundings it should have. The Principal has had considerable work done, and hopes, within the next month, to have the place greatly improved. I understand he has secured trees and shrubs to be planted in front of the school and along the main drive, and I have no doubt that within a few years, these surroundings will present a fine appearance.\n\nThe Farming Instructor, Mr. S. J. Wallace, appeared to be a good worker, and I believe understands farming. He has a hard task to perform as the farm land is very dirty, and much work will be needed before it is cleaned up and put in good condition.\n\nThe Principal, Mr. R. W. Frayling, appears to be greatly interested in his work and anxious to make the school what the Department desires.\nOttawa, May 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your 312-11 of the 22nd instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his recent inspection of the schools in the Touchwood agency.\n\nMr. Hamilton's report on the Gordon's Indian Residential School has been read with interest and the Department is very pleased to note that the staff and general conditions at this school are satisfactory. It is noted that the Inspector states some repairs are required to the cement foundation under the barn. If you consider that this work should be attended to and will entail no large expenditure, you may arrange to have it done. It may be that the school authorities could carry out the work if the material was supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

The School, as you know, has a capacity for several more pupils than are at present enrolled and as there are several parents who are anxious to have their children attend the School, owing to the excellent reputation which this institution has always enjoyed, we feel that it would be a move in the right direction if it would be possible for you to grant this request.\n\nNaturally I know that you will look at this matter, to a large extent, from the financial side, but if you would pardon me pointing out to you that the younger we get the children the better it is for them and the better for the future of the Reserves from which they come. As an old Principal of the School and one who is still exceedingly interested in it, I have always found that when we have the children early in life it is possible for the school to make something out of them which will endure, as lasting impressions can be created upon their minds when they are young, an opportunity which is lost when they become older.\n\nI would be very glad if you would kindly give this matter your most serious consideration and let me hear from you with regard to same.\n\nI remain,\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJKI/ER.\nChairman, Indian Committee.\nOttawa, May 15, 1936.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, requesting, for the reasons stated by you, a grant for an increase in the pupilage allowed at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year was considerably reduced, and I regret that it will not be possible to favourably consider your request. When our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared, consideration will be given to providing for an increase in the number of pupils at the Gordon's School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

August 3rd, 1937.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe. School Inspector Moir's Report.\n\nI thank you for copy of above mentioned report, which is the first that has been given since my appointment viz; seven years ago.\n\nTaking them in the order as given I will number them from No.1 on.\n\nNo.1 Miss Sullivan is not continuing as Kinder Garten teacher.\nNo.2 Mr. Schunaman and Miss F. Atwater returned to their duties as before.\nNo.3 In 1936 the K.G. teacher Miss Kelly held a first class interim certificate, at the end of the year like most teachers she left, I told Mr. Moir she was leaving on his inspection visit, he immediately suggested a lady known to him in his own home town (Govan) a music teacher, adding that it was not necessary for a certificated teacher for this room, it resulted in this lady continuing her music profession.\nMr. Moir then suggested a younger sister, which I engaged on his recommendation, she was absolutely unfitted for the position, thus in November, qualified teachers hard to get between terms, answering my advertisement was Miss Sullivan who was in charge from the end of December till this June.\n\nIn reference to progress, six of the children in this room entered the school since Easter, and were unable to speak one word of English, when taking this this great handicap into consideration and the short period, there is some excuse. There has been six K.G. teachers in seven years and you will agree that teaching in an Indian School is not always palatable, location and winter...\nIsolation and winter/ isolation makes the average teacher look elsewhere for the coming year. This room is not as desirable as one would wish; it is in a part of a large Playroom, but has five windows in it, wooden partition open top and bottom. Mr. Moir this year suggested that Glass should be put in the top and closed in so that it would be more quiet; this would hinder the present ventilation which is good and obtained from the windows West & North in the other part of the playroom.\n\nThe Senior Class Rooms are of course built to specifications accepted by the department; these do need ventilation, but there are six large windows in each room and four electric lights, so that I cannot find light shortage.\n\nIn reference to the packing case in the K.G. room, it is an open box used for some material the children work with; this room was made and furnished by myself without any cost to the department and solely for the purpose of relieving the other class rooms which were overcrowded, and the senior teachers from having the K.G. children to contend with, which I considered a great hindrance to those more advanced; the fact that exceptional good health prevails shows that the general conditions of the building is not adverse to the children's well-being.\n\nI much appreciate this opportunity of answering the various remarks of the Inspector, as without them, yourself and others may somewhat misconstrue the absolute conditions, both from the teachers' abilities and room facilities.\n\nPrior to my appointment there were only two teachers in the school and Mr. Moir used to take some of the children in a separate room before they would read to him, but the last six years that has not happened. I also did away with mixed class Rooms, on Mr. Moir's next inspection and since he has remarked on the marked progress through this change. Awhile ago on asking for the inspectors report, the reply was that it was not necessary, but I consider it most essential it being the only means of my being able to explain matters and the department knowing the exact conditions. I note the inspectors advice as to the Public School curriculum being carried out more fully, and will have same given more attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Malcaster, K. C., of Prince Albert, outlining some complaints made to him by the Indians of Touchwood Agency. It appears that Mr. Malcaster had a meeting with these Indians some time this Fall.\n\nAmong the complaints they made was that the Principal of Gordon's School, Mr. Frayling, had, as punishment, confined the children in a cell on bread and water, and cut the girls' hair short. They also asked that a Day School be established on the Reserve.\n\nI took the matter up with Mr. Waddy, and find that the children are sometimes confined to a room as punishment, but it is by no means a cell, but a room overlooking the entrance, well-lighted and with a good view. With regard to cutting the girls' hair, Mr. Frayling admits doing this as a second-offence punishment for running away. I advised Mr. Malcaster of these facts, and stated that in my opinion the punishments were not too severe, nor did I think they had any cause for complaint.\n\nMr. Malcaster replied, under date of October 27th, as follows:\n\n\"I have this morning received yours of 25th inst., for which I am very much obliged. I note the information you have received, which is not in accordance with the statements made by you to me.\n\n\"I consider that the cutting of the hair of children is not a proper punishment, and in the case of girls I consider it constitutes an assault; and unless this practice is stopped, at any rate in the case of girls, my advice must be to lay an information against the principal for assault. I trust such may not be necessary, and that you will see your way to advise the principal that in the case of girls this practice should be stopped.\n\n\"The whole difficulty appears to arise in connection with the absence of a Day School, and on behalf of the Chief and Councilors of this Reserve, I hereby make formal demand for a Day School in terms of the Treaty. In this connection I annex copy of a letter I have this morning received from the Chief of Poorman demanding a Day School.\"\n\nIn checking over the Poorman's Reserve, I find there are 30 children attending Muscowequan School, and 14 attending Gordon's, that is, about one-third are Protestant and two-thirds Roman Catholic. The Indians do not live in villages, but scattered all over the Reserve. Under these conditions, with a Protestant and a Roman Catholic School on the Agency, it appears to me that no consideration should be given to the establishment of a Day School on this Reserve at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

HIS WORK was to hand the Hay to the Farm Instructor who feeds the machine which is protected. Whilst the Instructor was looking at the engine belt as it was slipping, Noah Brittain one of the other boys working with him tried to hold the drive shaft from turning but couldn't; then Edward tried the same thing with the above result. This is what Noah says and the other lad who was also on the same work. Edward was thrown to the floor, two fingers and fore arm of the left arm being badly broken.\n\nI immediately telephoned Dr. Nelles, Raymore which is some 22 miles away, who said he would drive down by team, Desiring to have attention with as little delay as possible, I telephoned Dr. Hall, Lestock, who said a mixed train was coming East, and suggested the Hospital. On speaking again to Dr. Nelles of this suggestion, he said it would be the best, and quite in order, also that he would be on the train to accompany the boy to Lestock Hospital.\nMr. Waddy.\nRe. E. Sanderson.\n\nEvery possible attention was given the lad here. The blood was stopped, a splint was put under the arm after being properly dressed and reached Punnichy where the train was waiting.

He was the oldest Indian chief in Canada.\n\nSTOPPED TO REST FOR A TIME\n\nSon of Mr. and Mrs. David Gordon, the boy had apparently left school Saturday morning to visit his parents and had trudged, thinly clad, more than four miles through deep, heavy snow from three to five feet deep.\n\nMarks in the snow indicated he had walked several times before, overcome with exhaustion, fallen into the snow and froze to death. It is expected an inquest will be held.\n\nNeither young Gordon's parents nor pupils knew of his disappearance from school until visitors brought news to Mr. and Mrs. Gordon on Monday evening.\n\nMr. Gordon started out to search for the boy Tuesday morning, and in the afternoon found the frozen body in the woods a mile from home and seven miles from the school.\n\nCorp.

FRAYLING\n\nMarch 14, 1939\n\nRE: ANDREW GORDON\n\nOn Saturday, March 11, at about 1.45 p.m., I left the School with the junior boys - 36 boys - for the lake. Some of them played on the rink and others were sliding on the hills quite near the rink. About 3.00 p.m., Andrew was looking at an aeroplane which was passing over head. About 4.30 p.m., I conducted the boys back to the School and allowed them to play in the playground.\n\nAt about 5.15 p.m., on checking over the boys, it was noticed that Andrew was missing, and at about 5.20 p.m., I reported to the Principal of his absence.

Hoey, Esq.\nSup't. of Welfare & Training\nDep't. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA - Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: ANDREW GORDON.\n\nI am attaching to this letter my report to Indian Agent Mr. J.W. Waddy, Touchwood Agency, Punnichy - regarding the sad death of the above pupil. I heard of the finding of the body about 11.30 A.M. of the 14th and Corp. Band, R.C.M.P. was at this School around 2.30 P.M. The report attached I gave a copy of to this Officer. Since which time I have made no addition or correction.\n\nYour files will show, Jan. 1937 - Reply Reference 121-1-10 regarding the truancy of the pupil Alice Horney when this girl ran away at 28 below zero. In your reply to my report dated Jan. 25/37 you acknowledged that everything possible is done to prevent such occurrences by myself.\n\nThis unfortunate happening is different, as the children were out to play. In the past when Gordon Reserve children have run away from this School the seriousness has not been thought quite in the same light, as in every instance the Parents bring them back to the School. Those from the North (from whence most truants come) I have used every method possible to catch them. Having hired the\n\nPunnichy\nR. A. Hoey - 2 -\nRe: Andrew Gordon.\n\nLivery man sometimes with team from the north to come out toward the School, as when the children hear team or car coming behind them from the south they slip into the bush. I have driven myself with team and sleigh box and with the car up to early hours of the morning on these trips; have notified the Agent and the Police of the Northern Children, but with the Gordon's Reserve children, no, because of their adjacent homes. Nor has any suggestion been made that I should do so.\n\nI deeply regret this sad end, and can only assure you that I did everything I could think of other than notify the parents who live in the bush some 11 miles south, I understand from here, and no one knew which way Andrew had gone. He ran away in the early fall and was then going in an opposite direction to his home, away North. Mr. Waddy was out that way and a farmer I think notified him that four boys from this School were at his house. And on the way back Mr. Waddy brought them to the School.\n\nAndrew's body was found on what is called the Summer Road (never used in the winter). Had he taken the road which they now use he would have been picked up.\n\nIndians were drawing wood from the South end of the Reserve and I asked them if they had seen anything of Andrew. This was around 5:30 P.M of the 14th, before they un-loaded. There was the reply \"No,\" I then asked one, Harry Bitternose, on his way back home to look out for the lad, and bring him back to the School as they have done at other times.\n\nAny one of the Department Officials who know me or the methods used, will I am sure, say I endeavour to carry out my duties.

I have questioned all the boys, more especially his two greatest friends Bennie Childs and Sidney Bird. They have never known any one ill treat Andrew or of any reason for his having run away. He was apparently happy and never complained of any member of the Staff or Pupils being unkind to him.

The following is the report to the best of my knowledge.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon March 11th 1939, Mr. Tooley, the Boys Supervisor at Gordon's School, advised the Principal of the School, Mr. R.W. Prayling, that pupil Andrew Gordon was missing. The Principal asked some Indians who were in the office if they had seen the boy, and they answered \"No\". He told them to bring the boy back if they found him when they went home.\n\nMr. Tooley had been out with 35 boys all afternoon on play grounds near the lake, and the last time he remembers seeing Andrew was about 3 o'clock p.m. He actually checked the boys at 5:15 p.m. and discovered Andrew was missing. He then reported it to the Principal.\n\nIt appears that one old Indian named George Bitternose actually saw the boy a few miles south of the School that evening, but the boy would not stop when he called to him.\n\nAndrew Gordon's home is about seven miles from the School, most of the distance being through heavy bush country. I will call this the first day.\n\nOn the second day, Sunday the 12th, the Principal sent the Supervisor to investigate further, and in the afternoon the latter called at the house of John Fisher, who lives near the School, and was told, he says, that Andrew's grandfather had left for Andrew's home that day. Mr. Tooley understood the boy had returned home, but he does not say what gave him to understand this. Mrs. Fisher stated that on this day Mr. Tooley was at her house and she told him that Andrew was not there. She also told him that David Gordon Senior (a relative) had gone to the \"mountain\", a part of the Reserve near where Andrew's home is situated. She said that David, before he left, did not know that Andrew was missing, and if Andrew had been at their house they would have returned him to the School. The boy playing at Fisher's house was their own boy.\n\nOn the third day, Monday the 13th, David Gordon Sr. came back to Fisher's house, and was told that Andrew was missing. David went back to the hills to Victor Gordon's house and told Mrs. Victor Gordon about it. That night they saw David Gordon Jr., the father of the missing boy, and told him that Andrew was missing. This was late at night.\nOn the fourth day, Tuesday 14th, the father (David Gordon Jr.) went back along a trail towards the School and found the body of his boy frozen to death in a snow drift. He went to the nearest telephone and called this office. I was away on the Poorman's Reserve, but Mr. Stuart immediately notified the Principal of Gordon's School, the local detachment of the R.C.M.P., and Dr. Nelles the coroner. The police drove out and had a lot of difficulty getting through the deep snow, but they brought the body back to Punnichy early in the morning of the fifth day, Wednesday March 15th 1939. The coroner issued a certificate of cause of death from exhaustion and exposure to cold. In the presence of the father and myself, the police stripped the body and found no marks on it. The attached list shows what clothing the boy had on.\n\nThe Principal and Supervisor say the boy had not been corrected for any reason, nor do they know any reason why the boy should have run away. There has been a lot of trouble at this school from desertions, as you know from previous correspondence, and it does not appear to be the fault of the staff. They treat the children well, but that does not seem to prevent them from running away.\n\nIt will be noticed from the reports that nothing much was done to get this boy back, nor to notify the father that he had run away. The Principal thinks he did all he possibly could, but the reports do not bear this out. If he had got a neighbouring Indian to track the boy when it was first discovered that he was missing, he might still be alive. The boy struggled about five or six miles through deep snow until he was exhausted, and a good Indian could have tracked him without trouble.\n\nThe father was not notified at all until a relative told him, and then it was two days too late. Neither the police nor the Indian Agent were notified until the body was discovered.\n\nI am attaching statements from the Principal of Gordon's School and the Boys Supervisor, also the attached list of clothing.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nCONFIRMATION\n\nOttawa March 21 1939\n\nDr Thomas Robertson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nREGINA Sask\n\nREPORTS RECEIVED BY DEPARTMENT ON DEATH OF ANDREW GORDON OF GORDONS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL FROM PRINCIPAL FRAYLING AND INDIAN AGENT WADDY -stop- THESE REPORTS ARE NOT WHOLLY SATISFACTORY -stop- YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROCEED TO THE GORDONS SCHOOL AND TO UNDERTAKE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS LEADING TO THE DEATH OF ANDREW GORDON PUPIL NUMBER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY OF GORDONS BAND AND REPORT FULLY TO DEPARTMENT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION\n\nPhoned by\nN.D.-G.F. &c.

Mr. Waddy at the same time advised me that he had known nothing about it until the finding of the body.\n\nI am today in receipt of reports from both Mr. Waddy and Mr. Frayling, and am attaching Mr. Waddy's report, which you have no doubt seen before this. Mr. Frayling's report simply covered the letter he had already written you on the matter.\n\nThis morning I called the Clerk at Punnichy (Mr. Waddy being absent at Nut Lake). The Clerk informed me that the jury's verdict was \"death from exposure\", with no charges of negligence on the part of anyone. He also advised me that, so far as he knew, there was no criticism in the district or by the Indians.\n\nIt would, however, appear to me that there has been negligence with regard to this case, and that the death should never have occurred. Mr. Tooley took these boys to the lake, yet, despite the fact that running away is not an uncommon occurrence, and they were where they could easily do so without being seen, no check-up was made when he returned them to the school, and it was not until nearly an hour afterwards that it was found he was missing. Even then, the only action that was taken was to make enquiries of some of the Indians as to whether they had seen him or not. If they had made a search around the lake, they could easily have found the boy's tracks and followed them.\n\nEven on........\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nEven on the day following, no actual effort was made to locate him, or to satisfy themselves that he had reached home. It is hard to understand that a boy of his age, under those weather conditions, should be lost without any search being made.\n\nWe are, however, facing this fact\u2014that Mr. Frayling is running a good school, and no doubt feels very badly over the matter. I am satisfied they have got a lesson they will never forget, and nothing of this kind will again happen at that school, consequently, unless the Indians or the people of the district start any agitation, any action on our part would not be in the best interests of anyone.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

(RG 10, Volume 6309, file 654-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 17th, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret to report the death of Andrew Gordon, pupil #280 of Gordon's Indian Residential School, the son of David Gordon Jr. #116 Gordon's Band. The following is the report to the best of my knowledge.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon March 11th 1939, Mr. Teeley, the Boys Supervisor at Gordon's School, advised the Principal of the School, Mr. R.W. Freyling, that pupil Andrew Gordon was missing. The Principal asked some Indians who were in the office if they had seen the boy, and they answered \"No\". He told them to bring the boy back if they found him when they went home.\n\nMr. Teeley had been out with 36 boys all afternoon on play grounds near the lake, and the last time he remembers seeing Andrew was about 3 o'clock p.m. He actually checked the boys at 5.15 p.m. and discovered Andrew was missing. He then reported it to the Principal.\n\nIt appears that one old Indian named George Bitternose actually saw the boy a few miles south of the School that evening, but the boy would not stop when he called to him.\n\nAndrew Gordon's home is about seven miles from the School, most of the distance being through heavy bush country. I will call this the first day.\n\nOn the second day, Sunday the 12th, the Principal sent the Supervisor to investigate further, and in the afternoon the latter called at the house of John Fisher, who lives near the School, and was told, he says, that Andrew's grandfather had left for Andrew's home that day. Mr. Teeley understood the boy had arrived home, but he does not say what gave him to understand this. Mrs Fisher states that on this day Mr. Teeley was at her house and she told him that Andrew was not there. She also told him that David Gordon Senior (a relative) had gone to the \"mountain\", a part of the Reserve near where Andrew's home is situated. She said that David, before he left, did not know that Andrew was missing, and if Andrew had been at their house they would have returned him to the School. The boy playing at Fisher's house was their own boy.\n\nOn the third day, Monday the 13th, David Gordon Sr. came back to Fisher's house, and was told that Andrew was missing. David went back to the hills to Victor Gordon's house and told Mrs. Victor Gordon about it. That night they saw David Gordon Jr., the father of the missing boy, and told him that Andrew was missing. This was late at night.\nOn the fourth day, Tuesday 25th, the father (David Gordon Jr.) went back along a trail toward the School and found the body of his boy frozen to death in a snow drift. He went to the nearest telephone and called his office. I was away on the Poorman's Reserve, but Mr. Stuart immediately notified the Principal of Gordon's School, the local detachment of the R.C.M.P., and Dr. Nelles the coroner. The police drove out and had a lot of difficulty getting through the deep snow, but they brought the body back to Punnichy early in the morning of the fifth day, Wednesday March 15th 1939. The coroner issued a certificate of cause of death from exhaustion and exposure to cold. In the presence of the father and myself, the police stripped the body and found no marks on it. The attached list shows what clothing the boy had on.\n\nThe Principal and Supervisor say the boy had not been corrected for any reason, nor do they know any reason why the boy should have run away. There has been a lot of trouble at this school from desertions, as you know from previous correspondence, and it does not appear to be the fault of the staff. They treat the children well, but that does not seem to prevent them from running away.\n\nIt will be noticed from the reports that nothing much was done to get the boy back, nor to notify the father that he had run away. The Principal thinks he did all he possibly could, but the reports do not bear this out. If he had got a neighbouring Indian to track the boy when it was first discovered that he was missing, he might still be alive. The boy struggled about five or six miles through deep snow until he was exhausted, and a good Indian could have tracked him without trouble.\n\nThe father was not notified at all until a relative told him, and then it was two days too late. Neither the police nor the Indian Agent were notified until the body was discovered.\n\nI am attaching statements from the Principal of Gordon's School and the Boys Supervisor, also the attached list of clothing.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nGordon's Anglican Indian Residential School\n\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nPRINCIPAL\nR.W.

(I had just gone over to the cottage as the Chorl Bell rang at 5 o'clock.)\n\nI came over to the School to make enquiries and some Indians who were drawing wood to the School from the South end of the Reserve (the same direction of Andrew's home) were in the Office. I asked them if they had seen anything of Andrew, to which they replied \"No,\" and if they did on their return home see him to bring him back to the School, as they have done on other occasions, and that I would repay them for the trouble.\n\nSunday I heard that he was at his relatives across the lake near John Fisher's. I asked the Supervisor to investigate. The only thing he could find out from John Fisher was that this relative had gone to Andrew's home and the conclusion was that the lad was at home.\nMr. Waddy,\nRe: Andrew Gordon.\n\nMonday it was storming all day and the first thing I asked the Supervisor this morning about 6:15 A.M. was, had he heard anything of Andrew to which he replied, \"No\".

About 4.30 p.m. I conducted the boys back to the School and allowed them to play in the playground. At about 5.15 p.m., on checking over the boys, it was noticed that Andrew was missing, and at about 5.20 p.m. I reported to the Principal of his absence.\n\nMr Frayling came over to the School from his cottage to make enquiries and instructed me not to allow the boys, in future, to go to the lake as it gave them a chance to escape.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon I made enquiries at John Fisher who lives just across the lake from the School, and was told that Andrew Gordon's Grandfather had left that morning for Andrew's home.

He was the oldest Indian chief in Canada.\n\nSTOPPED TO REST FIVE TIMES\n\nSon of Mr. and Mrs. David Gordon, the boy had apparently left school Saturday afternoon to visit his parents and had trudged, thinly-clad, more than four miles through dense woods and snow from three to five feet deep.\n\nMarks in the snow indicated he had stopped to rest five times before, overcome with exhaustion, he sank into the snow and froze to death. It is expected an inquest will be held.\n\nNeither young Gordon's parents nor police heard of his disappearance from school until visitors brought news to Mr. and Mrs. Gordon on Monday evening.\n\nMr. Gordon started out to search for the boy Tuesday morning and in the afternoon found the frozen body in the woods a mile from home and seven miles from the school.\n\nCorp.

Some of them played on the rink and others were sliding on the hills quite near the rink. About 3:00 P.M., Andrew was looking at an aeroplane which was passing overhead. About 4:30 P.M., I conducted the boys back to the School and allowed them to play in the play-ground. At about 5:15 P.M., on checking over the boys, it was noticed that Andrew was missing, and about 5:20 P.M., I reported to the Principal of his absence.

I understood, then, that Andrew had arrived home.\n\nI asked all the boys if they knew why Andrew had run away, and if they knew the direction he had gone etc. They had no idea on this matter. Andrew had not complained of anybody ill-treating him, nor had he been punished in any way.\n\n(ENDS)\n\n(Sgd.) Linton Tooley\nBoy's Supervisor.\n\n6. While at the Gordon Indian Residential School, telephone message was received from Coroner Dr. Nelles requesting that if as a result of police investigation, the circumstances were that the boy had frozen to death and no other suspicious circumstances surrounding, that the body be conveyed to Punnichy for his personal examination. (These facts were conveyed to S/Sgt. Sub-Division by telephone and concurrence made of transporting the body if\n\n(Continued on page 3).\nRe: Andrew Gordon (Juvenile)\nDecceased\nGordon Indian Residential School\nPunnichy District, Saskatchewan.\n\ncircumstances were found as stated, and no indication of other suspicions).\n\n7. Patrol then continued to the Gordon Indian Reserve and the home of David Gordon, and hence to the body of the deceased. The body was located approximately one mile from the Gordon house in the general direction the youth had taken from the school enroute to his home. It was covered with a light covering of snow and lying face upward in the middle of a roadway (which is used in the summer but not winter) through the bush. The only tracks discernable other than those of his father, were those of the youth where he had followed the father's trail through the deep snow - varying in depth from three to five feet - stumbling and falling several times - especially in the last hundred yards. There were no marks of struggle. The marks of Gordon Jr., were slightly covered with snow due to a storm on Monday March 13th, last. There were also the tracks of Gordon Sr., where he had located his son when on snowshoes. These were fresh however and did not come within eight yards of the body, nor had he walked on the tracks made by his son. The youth had apparently struck out in a straight line across country from the school to his home and had been overcome by exhaustion in forging his way through the great depth of snow.\n\n8. In view of these circumstances during the course of investigation, the body was moved to the Gordon home, preparatory to taking it to the village of Punnichy for the necessary examination by the Coroner, in accordance with his instruction.\n\n9. The following is the statement obtained from David Gordon during the course of Investigation.\n\n(BEGINS)\n\nI am a Treaty Indian of the Gordon Indian Reserve. Andrew Gordon is my son. He was born on October 27th, 1927. I have five other children in the family. Andrew was the second oldest. My wife is living and at my home.\n\nI have two girls going to the Gordon School, Mary - 14 years old and Florence - 7 years. One boy at Muscowequan School - Noel, 10 years old, and then two children, girls at home.\n\nI live about seven miles from the School in a direct path. Andrew started at the age of seven years to go to the Gordon Residential School.\n\nOn Monday at 7 P.M. Baptiste Pelletier told me he said I believe your boy ran away from school and went across the summer trail. Then I didn't quite believe his statement but I had no official notice and on Tuesday morning I figured I would go and see Mr. Frayling about the matter.\n\nThen right after breakfast on Tuesday I started off from my home alone across country for Gordon School on snow shoes. I had gone about a mile from my home when I saw tracks which I was pretty well sure were my boy's tracks, they were going east, I was then headed west. When I discovered the tracks, I followed them up the trail, this is what is now the old trail, and went about fifty yards and discovered a place where it appeared that the boy had first laid down. Then I continued to follow the tracks and about twenty yards saw where the boy had again laid down in the snow, then continued and found a third place where he had laid down again, then I went on about ten yards and found another place where he had laid down. I continued tracking to last but and fifth place where he had laid down. About another ten yards I followed on and the sixth place I found his body. This was about twenty-five yards from the last place where he had laid down. He was right in the centre of the trail and there was a depth of from three to five feet of snow in places. It would be about 100\n\n(Continued on page 4).\nRe: Andrew Gordon (Juvenile)\nDeceased\nGordon Indian Residential School\nPunnichy District, Saskatchewan\n\nyards from the first place where I saw he had laid down to where I discovered his body.\nIt is my opinion that he was tired and could go no further and lay down exhausted.\n\n(Sgd.) David Gordon\n\n10. From this point, return patrol was made with body to Punnichy, and presented to Cor. Dr. Nelles for his examination.\n\n11. The body was stripped of all clothing and given a thorough examination. There were no marks whatsoever on same. It was indicative to the Coroner who gave the cause of death as EXHAUSTION FROM EXPOSURE TO COLD, and deemed an inquest unnecessary.\n\n12. The body was released by the Coroner to the Father - David Gordon, for burial, with necessary certificate Re: Cause of Death, and warrant for Burial.\n\n13. The death has been recorded with D.G.

Yorkton Sub-Div'n.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with your radiogram of March 21st, I have visited Gordon's School and enquired into the circumstances of the death of Andrew Gordon, an 11-year-old pupil of that school. I now beg to submit my report:\n\nAbout 1.45 p.m. on Saturday, March 11th, forty-six boys, including Andrew, were taken by the boys' supervisor, Mr. Tooley, to a lake about 250 yards West of the School, where they skated and slid until about 4.30, when they were taken back to the playground at the School.\n\nAt about 5.15 p.m. Mr. Tooley checked the boys in and found that Andrew was missing. Nothing more was seen or heard of this boy until his body was found within three-quarters of a mile of his father's home, unless it was he that was seen about dusk that same evening by George Bitternose, an Indian living between two and three miles south of the School and on the road leading to Andrew's home.\n\nBitternose at that time saw a boy near his home, but not knowing that one had run away from the School, thought it was some boy who had come to play with his children. When the boy saw Bitternose he started to run away and would not stop, although he, Bitternose, called to him. Bitternose, thinking he was a local boy, thought nothing more about it until after the body was found.\n\nIt is not known whether the boy left from the Lake or the Playground, as they were not checked in until three-quarters of an hour after coming in off the Lake. It is, however, known that he left some time between 3.00 and 5.15 p.m., as an aeroplane passed over at 3.00 p.m. and Mr. Tooley distinctly remembers seeing him looking at the plane, but neither Mr. Tooley nor the other boys remember seeing him after that time.\n\nAt 5.15, upon finding the boy missing, Mr. Tooley reported that fact to Mr. Frayling, the Principal, who then made enquiries of three Indians, namely, Harry Bitternose, John Bitternose, and another, who had just come in with loads of wood from the south, if they had seen anything of Andrew on the road. They stated they had not. Mr. Frayling then asked them to be on the lookout for him and if they saw him to bring him back to the School and he would pay them for so doing. Mr. Tooley also went down to the Lake to see if he could see anything of the boy or find any tracks. He found no trace of the boy and the snow was so tracked over that it was impossible to find anything.\n\nOn Sunday, March 12th, Mr. Frayling heard that the boy was with a relative living near John Fisher, who lives about half a mile from the School, across the Lake west. (The relative referred to is David Gordon Sr., whom they refer to as Grandfather, although he is an uncle, not a grandfather.) He instructed Mr. Tooley to investigate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nMr. Tooley reported that he was told that Andrew Gordon's grandfather had left for Andrew's home, and understood then that Andrew had arrived home. Mr. Tooley, when questioned as to why he came to such a conclusion, offered no reason.\n\nMrs. Fisher, when questioned, made the following statement:\n\n\"On Sunday, March 12th, Mr. Tooley called at my home and asked me if I had seen anything of Andrew Gordon, at the same time telling me that he had seen a boy around my yard that day and thought it might be he. I replied that the boy he saw was my boy, that Andrew had not been here, that if he had his grandfather would have returned him to the School. I told him that grandfather had left for Andrew's home that morning. Mr. Tooley then left.\"\n\nMrs. Fisher then informed me that, although grandfather had started for Andrew's home that morning, that he only went half way and then returned home. However, on finding that the boy was missing he left again on Monday morning to inform the boy's father. She also stated that the members of the Band were very much dissatisfied, that they felt they should have been notified and a search party organized.\n\nMr. Waddy confirms Mrs. Fisher's statement that grandfather carried the information of the missing boy to the boy's father on Monday. Mr. Waddy also informed me that when grandfather reached the home, the father was away and did not return until after dark.\n\nIt will be noted that this disagrees with the police statement, in which they stated that Baptiste Pelletier first gave him the information at 7.00 p.m. Monday. This point, however, is immaterial, as they may both have been there. It, however, confirms the fact that the father knew nothing of the boy's having left the school, until after dark Monday night.\n\nAt daybreak on Tuesday morning, March 14th, the father put on his snowshoes and started out to get information. About a mile from home he discovered tracks leading in the opposite direction to which he was travelling. He decided they were his son's tracks, turned, and followed them. He found that the person had fallen five times in a short distance, and then found his son lying on his back, frozen, with his left arm sticking up.\n\nI might point out here that this man lives in a very isolated place, a considerable distance from any other house, and in the woods. (He is a hunter and trapper.) There are two ways of getting to his place\u2014what they call a summer and a winter road. He is seven miles from the School by the summer road and eleven miles by the winter road. The summer road is impassable for a team in winter, and this is the road the boy took. At that time there was from three to five feet of snow on this road. A rough sketch showing the roads is attached.\n\nThe father, David Gordon Jr., upon finding the body, proceeded to a white farmer's house south of the Reserve and phoned the Agency, about 11.00 a.m. Mr. Waddy was at that time on Poorman's Reserve and did not return until 6.00 p.m. Mr. Stuart, however, immediately got in touch with the Police, the coroner and the School.\n\nThe Police were instructed by the coroner that if there was no evidence of foul play, they were to bring the body to the Agency, which was done, and they arrived there about 4.00 a.m. Wednesday morning. The coroner arrived between 4.00 and 5.00 a.m. and, after viewing the body, decided an inquest was not necessary, and issued a certificate of death, due to exhaustion from exposure to cold.\n\nWhen the body.......\nReport, death of Andrew Gordon.\n\nWhen the body was brought in, the clothing from the waist down was frozen to the body, due, no doubt, to wading through deep wet snow on Saturday, the day he ran away, as the temperature was 35 degrees above zero that day at noon.\n\nThe body was thawed out and the clothing removed. The body was carefully examined for any marks or abrasions of any kind, but none were found. This was done in the presence of Mr. Waddy, the Police, and the boy's father. The father expressed himself as perfectly satisfied that the boy had not been beaten or abused in any way.\n\nIn my enquiry, I carefully checked up with Fr. Frayling the methods he uses to prevent truancy, and I cannot find this boy's escape was due to any negligence on the part of the School officials.\n\nI also attempted to find some reason for the boy's leaving, but failed to find any. I found that the boy had not been punished for anything, that he was apparently happy and contented. I questioned his two closest boy chums, Sydney Bird and Banny Childs, as to whether they knew of any reason, whether they had ever heard him complain of the School or his treatment, or whether they had ever said anything about running away. They stated that they had not, but one of them suggested he might have been homesick. I could not find any reason for his going, none, at least, for which the school or officials could be in any way held responsible.\n\nI informed Mr. Frayling that I could not find that the boy's escape was due to any negligence on their part, or that his running away was due to any fault of the School. The question was, was the boy's death due to lack of action on the part of the School after he had run away?\n\nMr. Frayling stated that in cases of truancy of children from other Reserves, he always notified the Agent, but that in cases of children on that Reserve, he had not done so, and had not thought it necessary, due to their being so near their homes. With regard to following a boy who had run away, his experience had been that it was practically useless, as they were watching for pursuers and, at the first sound of a team, they would take to the woods and hide.\n\n---\n\nThe information received during the course of my enquiry may be summed up as follows:\n\nAndrew Gordon, a pupil of Gordon's School, ran away from the School between the hours of 3.00 and 5.15 p.m. on Saturday, March 11th. His absence was discovered at 5.15 p.m. by the supervisor, who immediately advised Mr. Frayling, the Principal. Mr. Frayling immediately enquired of three Indians who had just come in with loads of wood from the south, in which direction the boy's home lay, if they had seen the boy, and upon their stating that they had not, he asked them to be on the lookout for him\u2014if they saw him, to return him to the School and he would pay them for so doing. The supervisor, Mr. Tooley, also went down to the Lake where the boys had been that afternoon, to see if he could find any trace of him.\n\nOn Sunday, March 11th, Mr. Tooley enquired of Mrs. Fisher, an Indian woman living about one half mile west of the School, if she had seen the boy, and was informed that the boy's so-called grandfather had left for the boy's home that morning.\n\nOn Monday, y...........\nOn Monday, March 13, Mr. Frayling enquired as to whether anything had been heard. At 7.00 p.m. the boy's father was advised by another Indian that his boy had run away. On Tuesday morning the boy's father found the boy's body about three-quarters of a mile from his home, and at about 11.00 a.m. notified the Agency. Mr. Stuart, Agency Clerk, at once notified the Police, coroner and school. The telephone call from the boy's father, saying that he had found his son's body, was the first intimation the Agent or Police had that the boy was missing, and the Farming Instructor first learned of it from the Police when they were after the body.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 15th, the body was taken to the Agency at about 4.00 a.m. and shortly after was viewed by the coroner, who decided an inquest was not necessary.\n\nThe weather conditions at that time were:\nSaturday, temperature 35 above at noon, turning cold at night.\nSunday, cold.\nMonday, cold with a bad blizzard.\n\nThe boy, when found, was wearing the following clothing:\n\n- Pair of Overalls\n- Pair of Trousers\n- Pair of Combinations (Heavy)\n- One heavy Sweater Coat\n- One Leather Coat\n- One Shirt (Winter)\n- One pair of Mitts\n- One pair of Moccasins\n- One pair of Rubbers\n- One Winter Cap\n- One pair of heavy wool Stockings.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder separate cover, I am forwarding report on the fatality at Gordon's School.\n\nYou will note that in this report I have just stated the facts in the case, making no comments. You will note by the report that practically no effort was made to trace this boy; that the boy's uncle (so-called grandfather) lives within half a mile of the School, but no effort was made to advise him until Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Principal made a mistake, there is no question about that. However, nothing can be done now to rectify it, and I do not believe that he will ever make another of that kind. The only question now is, what effect is it going to have on the School? There is considerable dissatisfaction among the Indians. They feel that they should have been notified and a search party got out, and there is no doubt in my mind that, if this had been done, the boy would be alive today.\n\nIn discussing the matter with Mr. Waddy, he feels that Mr. Frayling has lost the confidence of the Indians and that he should be transferred to some other school. Archdeacon Irwin was in yesterday. He also feels that proper efforts were not made to trace the boy. He informs me, however, that they have no other school to which they could transfer him, and he would like to see him given a severe reprimand and left where he is.\n\nIt is my opinion that we should wait for at least another month and find just what the reaction of the Indians is going to be, before making any decision as to what should be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSup't of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMc\nOttawa, April 9, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a report dated March 29, 1939, submitted to the Department by Dr. Robertson, immediately following his investigation of the circumstances that led to the death of Andrew Gordon, an 11 year old pupil enrolled at your school.\n\nDr. Robertson, in his report, states:\n\n\"I informed Mr. Frayling that I could not find that the boy's escape was due to any negligence on his part or that his running away was due to any fault of the school. The question was - was the boy's death due to lack of action on the part of the school staff after he (the boy) had run away?\"\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss the circumstances of this boy's death again with the Agent and, if convenient, with Dr. Robertson. It seems to me that, following the escape of a pupil from a residential school, certain steps should be immediately taken. These steps in my judgment are:\n\n1. The information should be conveyed to the agent and to any police officials that may be available in the community;\n\n2. A search should be instituted at once.\n\nThe fact that a boy may take to the bush or that it may be difficult to find him is in my judgment no reason whatever why a search should not be organized.\n\nIn fact -\n\nR. W. Frayling, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nIn fact, the Principal himself, in his own interests and in the interests of his staff, should take these steps. Public opinion will have very little sympathy with the members of a school staff who refuse to follow an escaped pupil simply because it may be difficult to find him.\n\nOf course, I am not familiar with local conditions, although Dr. Robertson very kindly enclosed a sketch map of the district with his report. I am very anxious, however, that the reputation of our residential schools should be maintained and that Indian parents should be able to send their children to these schools from year to year with the full assurance that they will be protected from all hazards by the members of the teaching staff. In view of the fact that a great many Indian parents appear to be prejudiced against Indian residential schools, it is particularly desirable that we should do everything possible to remove any suspicion or distrust that may exist in the minds of Indian parents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment a report dated March 29, 1939, sent forward by you immediately following your investigation of the circumstances leading to the death of Andrew Gordon, of the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nI note with interest your statement \"that you could not find the boy's escape was due to any negligence on the part of the Principal or that his running away was due to any fault of the school\". In view of all the circumstances, it is just possible that the Principal and the members of the staff did all that they considered necessary to find this boy after his departure from the institution.\n\nI am convinced that when a pupil is missing from a residential school immediate steps should be taken by the Principal to notify the police and in addition to this to institute an immediate search. The fact that the boy may take refuge in the bush or the fact that it may be difficult to find him is in my judgment no justification whatever for not making an immediate search. It has occurred to me that these steps should be taken by the Principal in his own interests. Public opinion will have very little sympathy with a principal who does not do all that is humanly possible to find and bring back to the school pupils who may escape, particularly during the winter months.\n\nI desire to thank you for your report, which seems to cover the circumstances of this case very thoroughly. I am today communicating with Mr. Frayling, the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, May 29, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of March 23, 1939, I am enclosing herewith copy of report submitted by Dr. Thomas Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Saskatchewan, in connection with the death of Andrew Gordon, pupil No. 280 of the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are anxious that the residential schools should have enrolled during this period the full quota of pupils for which they secure a per capita grant from the Department, but we are anxious also that where day schools are established and where home conditions are reasonably good, Indian pupils should attend these schools. I note from the last return that there are 129 pupils enrolled at the Gordon's school. In view of the fact that this institution is receiving a per capita grant for only 120 pupils, I can see no reason why 8 or 9 of the pupils from good homes should not attend the day school. This is a matter, however, that cannot be easily adjusted from Ottawa. It is a piece of constructive work that must be undertaken by the principals of the residential schools and our Indian agents. If the limited time at your disposal will enable you to do so,\n\nI wish -\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nI wish you would point out to these officials the importance of making this adjustment, in view of the difficulty we are likely to experience in securing the funds necessary to maintain the Indian service on an efficient basis during the war period. Anything you can do to help in this regard will be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n## EXPENDITURE AT GORDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n### Fiscal Years 1929-30 to 1938-39\n\n| Fiscal Year | Amount     |\n|-------------|------------|\n| 1929-30     | $59,399.21 |\n| 1930-31     | $113,790.07|\n| 1931-32     | $20,792.41 |\n| 1932-33     | $17,546.43 |\n| 1933-34     | $16,761.17 |\n| 1934-35     | $17,316.11 |\n| 1935-36     | $22,256.11 |\n| 1936-37     | $18,649.00 |\n| 1937-38     | $17,040.38 |\n| 1938-39     | $23,235.66 |\n| **Total**   | **$326,788.55** |\nOttawa, June 8, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Castleden:\n\nIn response to the request contained in your letter of June 5, I am sending forward herewith a statement of the grants made to the Gordon Indian Residential School during the years 1929-30 to 1938-39, inclusive and also the expenditures made for repairs, purchase of equipment, purchase of school supplies - text-books, etc.\n\nThe present Gordon residential school was built during the years 1929-30 and 1939-40 and this fact explains the comparatively large expenditures incurred during these years.\n\nI may state that residential schools, with the exception of a few schools built by the Churches, are built by the Government. The equipment is supplied by the Government and the school buildings are kept in repair by the Government. In the case of the Gordon school, the major portion of the clothing required by the children is, I understand, provided by the Women's Missionary Society of the Anglican Church.\n\nIn a separate communication I shall attempt to answer the other questions in your letter, relating to Indian relief.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nG. H. Castleden, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 13, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInspector Moir, in a recent report on the Gordon's Indian Residential School, states:\n\n\"Some improvement has been made in the kindergarten room. The noises from the adjoining playroom are not now so noticeable, but it is regrettable that in a building of this size better accommodation could not be provided for pupils who spend the greater part of the day in the classroom\".\n\nI should like to have from you a special report on classroom accommodation at the Gordon's Residential School. It would be appreciated if you would explain fully why the Principal finds it necessary to conduct the primary class in the basement of the building. You should also discuss the present enrolment with the Principal and state definitely if in your judgment the present enrolment is too large for the classroom accommodation available.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from G. H. Castleden, Esq., M.P., in which he states that a great deal of dissatisfaction exists amongst the Indian population of the reserve with respect to the Gordon's Residential School, the treatment of the pupils and the inability of the pupils to complete their public school courses. A general report, therefore, on the work of this school would be appreciated by the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. J. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa, November 14, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Castleden:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 11, the last paragraph of which reads as follows:\n\n\"That the school system be altered so that they will have a larger measure of control over the raising of their children. Apparently the Gordon's School is much below par as they claim none of their graduates are admitted into the high school at Brandon\".\n\nThe Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask., is operated by the Government, in cooperation with the Anglican Church. This school, unlike a great many residential schools operated by the Anglican Church, is operated under the direct supervision of the Bishop of Qu'Appelle. The majority of the Anglican schools are operated under the direction of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, with the Secretary's headquarters in Winnipeg.\n\nThis school had at the time of the last Inspector's report an authorized pupil enrolment of 120 and the following members of the staff were in charge of the institution:\n\nMr. R. W. Frayling, Principal;\n\nMiss Vida Winnifred Frost, 27 years of age, permanent first class teacher's certificate, 5 years' experience - took a special course in primary methods in 1939;\n\nG. H. Castleden, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nMr. James Karl Schunaman, 35 years of age, permanent second class certificate, Saskatchewan;\n\nMiss Elizabeth Atwater, 51 years of age, permanent second class certificate, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn addition to the Principal and the teachers, Miss B. Atwater is employed as matron, Mrs. C. Ryel as seamstress and sewing instructor and Mr. L. Tooley boys' supervisor; Mr. J. Wallace is farming instructor and Reverend J. J. Woods, Chaplain.\n\nThe officials find it difficult to understand the reference in your communication to the Brandon High School. It has been the policy of the Department during the last three or four year period to emphasize increasingly the importance of vocational instruction in the training of Indian pupils. It has been suggested in circular letters sent out from time to time that at least one-third of the actual classroom period be devoted to vocational projects. Boys are given instruction in farming, carpentry work, blacksmithing, etc., and girls, in hand loom weaving, crochet work, sewing, home-making, etc. It will thus be seen that it is considered inadvisable for the principals of our schools to follow slavishly the provincial curricula. However, there is no obstacle placed in the way of an Indian pupil who displays an unusual aptitude for abstract study. Such pupils are encouraged to proceed with the regular public school and high school courses.\n\nThe Inspector's reports on the Gordon's School have been uniformly satisfactory over a period of years, with the exception of over-crowding in the kindergarten class, referred to by the Inspector in his report of October 18, 1929. There has not been an adverse report on the classroom work at this school at any time in recent years. The present principal was selected by the Bishop of Qu'Appelle and by Commissioner Graham. It is my understanding that he was selected in the hope that a layman rather than a clergyman would prove more acceptable.\nacceptable to the Indian parents.\n\nThe Indian population on the reserve, however, have never been fully satisfied with the operation of the school. Their demand is for an Indian day school. I find it difficult to convince myself that the course provided in such a school, if it were established, would be superior to the courses of study at present provided at the residential school. In addition to this fact, we must keep in mind that the Gordon's Residential School was rebuilt in the year 1930 at a cost of $118,790.07. In view of the war conditions now confronting us, it is not at all likely that the Government will abandon this school and establish a day school on the reserve at any time in the immediate future.\n\nOur residential schools are, as you know, subject to regular inspection by public school inspectors. In addition to this, the Gordon's Residential School is visited periodically by the Indian Agent and by the General Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nMay I express the hope that you will find it convenient to visit this Department during the course of the session. I feel confident that such a visit would enable you to secure information from the officials that cannot easily be obtained and passed on to you by letter. Such interviews invariably prove helpful to our officials and frequently result in Members obtaining a better understanding of the Indian problems in which they are interested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe letter 121-1-1 of Nov 13th re Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nThere are two large class rooms here which are used for the larger pupils, one for girls and one for boys. A kindergarten was required, so a room is made at the east end of girls play room. This room is well ventilated, but the floor is about three feet or so below ground level, however it has plenty of window space above the ground level and is quite bright. Re the noise. There can be no noise from play room when classes are on as other children are then in their class rooms, and the kindergarten ones are always let out of class prior to closing of the other class rooms for recess etc.\n\nA kindergarten room is necessary in this school, and this room is not hurting the health of the pupils in any manner, the principal says it is necessary to have a kindergarten. The enrolment is already cut down from former years.\n\nSome Indians will always be dissatisfied with the school, one or two families have always been talking about the school, but it is well run.\n\nOur system of having big pupils leave class rooms part of the day to learn house work and to do farm work holds back the pupils, and until this is changed our pupils will not get to higher grades before discharge at proper age.\n\nDr. Ferguson the T.B. San. Supt. just examined the children at Gordons. He told the principal this school had the healthiest lot of pupils and the place was a credit to any institution. He was right.\n\nI am sure that the principal would like to have Mr. Castleden visit the school any time he is in the district, no notice of his visit would be expected, this place is always the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 26, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Castleden:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of November 11, addressed to Dr. McGill, and the Director's reply thereto dated November 14.\n\nI am now in receipt of a special report on the Gordon Indian Residential School, submitted to the Department by Indian Agent Waddy. This report is dated Punichy, November 22, 1940, and reads in part as follows:-\n\n\"There are two large rooms in this school, which are used for the senior pupils - one for girls and one for boys. A kindergarten was required and so a room was constructed at the east end of the girls' play room. This room is bright and well ventilated but the floor is about three feet or so below ground level. However, it has plenty of window space above the ground level. There can be no noise from the play room when classes are assembled, as other children are then in their own classroom and the kindergarten pupils are always let out of class prior to the closing of the other classrooms.\n\n\"A kindergarten room is necessary at this school and this room is not hurting the health of the pupils in any manner. The enrolment in the kindergarten room however is cut down from former years.\n\n\"Some Indians of course will always be dissatisfied with the school; one or two families particularly have always been talking about the\n\nG.

He told the Principal that the school had the healthiest lot of pupils and that the place would be a credit to any institution. The Superintendent was in my judgment correct in this expression of opinion\".\n\nIt has occurred to me that you would like to have this information in your possession, in view of the complaints that have reached you from certain Indian families on the Gordon Reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

His action with regard to the tragedy of the boy who was frozen to death cannot, in my opinion, be justified.\n\nI can readily understand that Dr. Ferguson can give a report with regard to the health of the students, and I am glad to have this information, but the question of the training and the development of the children's lives and their attitude towards the world, and the creation of good citizenship, are also an important part of a school\u2014particularly an Indian school.\n\nI wish to thank you for your prompt attention in these matters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. H. CASTLEDEN, M.P.\n\nGHC/W\nOttawa, November 29, 1940.\n\nDear Bishop Knowles:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from G. H. Castleden, Esq., M.P., which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"I would like to know the qualifications of the Principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School and his experience in the educational field prior to his appointment.\"\n\nIt would appear that we have nothing on file here relating to the qualifications of Mr. Frayling. I note from the correspondence that he was nominated for the position by the Bishop of the Diocese, on the recommendation of Commissioner Graham.\n\nI would feel indebted to you, therefore, if you could send forward a summary of Mr. Frayling's qualifications, his teaching experience, if any, and a summary of the work in which he was engaged prior to his appointment to the principalship of the Gordon School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRight Reverend E. H. Knowles, D.D., LL.B.,\nBishop of Qu'Appelle,\nBishop's Court,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 30, 1940,\n\nDear Mr. Castleden:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 28th instant, in which you seek information with respect to the qualifications and experience of Mr. R. W. Frayling, Principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nPrincipals of Indian residential schools, as you know, are nominated, not by the Department but by the church authorities. I have learned from the correspondence on file here that Mr. Frayling was nominated by the Bishop, on the recommendation of Commissioner Graham. These nominations are of course subject to departmental approval.\n\nI am today communicating with the church authorities, in an attempt to secure complete information with respect to Mr. Frayling's qualifications and experience prior to his appointment. It is just possible that all this information was submitted verbally to the Department at the time of the appointment itself. I shall be glad to communicate with you again, just as soon as this information reaches me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nG. H. Castleden, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 4, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Frayling:\n\nThe General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Mr. Christianson, has sent forward Inspector Moir's report on the Gordon Indian Residential School. This report, I note, is dated October 22, 1940.\n\nIt is difficult to understand why the teacher found it necessary to lock the members of the primary class in the schoolroom. Such action on her part is, as you know, contrary to regulations and should be discontinued at once.\n\nI have been in communication with the Indian Agent in respect to the use of the basement for the kindergarten class. It might be advisable for you to discuss with the Indian Agent or with the General Superintendent of Agencies this basement accommodation, just as soon as you can conveniently do so. It is my understanding that the Gordon School is a comparatively new and up-to-date building. In view of this fact, it appears somewhat regrettable that it has been found necessary to provide classroom accommodation in the basement. The Inspector has never been wholly satisfied with this arrangement.\n\nI feel it is only fair to you to state that a number of letters have reached me within the last year in respect to the Gordon School. It was pointed out in these letters that the pupils in your school seldom, if ever, reached a grade higher than Grade 5, in contrast to other Indian day and residential schools where\n\npupils -\n\nMr. R. W. Frayling,\nPrincipal,\nGordon Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\npupils reach Grade 9 and even Grade 10. I feel confident you will find it difficult, also, to justify the employment of Miss Fidler, who appears to have no professional standing. I should add that prior to the receipt of the Inspector's reports I had prepared a statement for Mr. G. H. Castleden, the member for Yorkton, indicating the academic and professional standing of the teachers at your school and the experience of the teacher in each case.\n\nA full report on the work of your school and the difficulties you may be encountering would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nDecember 3rd., 1940.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRef. No. 121-1-1\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th. ult. Mr. R.W. Frayling, as far as I know had no teaching experience prior to his appointment as Principal of Gordon's Indian School, but was a business man.\n\nHis appointment took place under my predecessor (now Archbishop of Rupert's Land) but I was then his Archdeacon and Chairman of the Indian Committee of the Diocese, hence my knowledge of the matter. I remember very well journeying to Ottawa with Bishop Harding to see Dr. Duncan C. Scott of the Department of Indian Affairs who had requested the removal of the Rev. F. Stanford, Principal of Gordon's Indian Residential School. At this interview Dr. Scott insisted that a new Principal be appointed who would be a business man, a man of executive ability; as he felt that the institution required one of such capacity who would have experience in the purchasing of goods and supplies and who would devote his time entirely to the management of the institution. The bishop urged the appointment of another clergyman, but Dr. Scott was entirely against it; so also was Indian Commissioner Graham.\n\nIt was Commissioner Graham who found and recommended Mr. R.W. Frayling and eventually my predecessor concurred in the appointment.\n\nThere is no question to my mind that Mr. Frayling is a man who has shown marked ability in the management\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nof the financial and executive end of things at Gordon's School, and as far as I know has satisfied the Department in that way.\n\nFor many years the Principal, whether a clergyman or layman, has not been a teacher in the school, as it requires his whole time to be expended upon the management of the institution of this size with a staff of the number required for all its departments, including the farm, the engineering, the clothing, as well as the education and religious training of the pupils.\n\nI am,\nYours very truly,\n\nEdwin Qu'arnelle.\nOttawa, December 6, 1940.\n\nDear Bishop Knowles:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you send forward information with respect to the qualifications of Mr. R. W. Frayling, Principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nYour Lordship's action in sending forward this information is very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRight Rev. E. H. Knowles, LL.B., D.D.,\nBishop of Qu'Appelle,\nBishop's Court,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. G. H. Castleden, M. P. for Yorkton, is anxious to secure from the Department information with respect to the teaching experience and the professional qualifications of Mr. R. W. Frayling, Principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nI have sought this information from the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, the Right Reverend E. H. Knowles. In a letter to the Department dated December 3, 1940, the Bishop states:\n\n\"I remember very well journeying to Ottawa with Bishop Harding to see Dr. Duncan C. Scott, of the Department of Indian Affairs, who had requested the removal of the Reverend F. Stanford. At this interview Dr. Scott insisted that a new principal be appointed who would be a business man and a man of executive ability. The Bishop urged the appointment of another clergyman, but Dr. Scott was entirely against this; so also was Indian Commissioner Graham\".\n\nApart from this however, the Bishop does not state or outline what Mr. Frayling's actual qualifications are. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you could secure a statement from Mr. Frayling, indicating his age, his teaching experience, if any, his professional qualifications and any other information you may consider relevant to the subject. The Department would like to have this information at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMR. J. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nR.A. Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th regarding this school, and more particularly the kindergarten classroom accommodation, school pupils' standing, and Miss Fidler, primary teacher.\n\nIn 1930 the classrooms were mixed, boys and girls, in one running up to Grade III and the other having pupils up to the age limit for discharge, then 18 years, children more especially at that time unable to speak English on entry. Discipline was difficult in both rooms and justice was not done to either teacher or pupils. To remedy this on reassembling after holidays of 1931 I had a part of the girls' large playroom partitioned off for a Primary Room, engaging an extra teacher so that better results might be obtained in the higher grades, also separating the boys from the girls, grading from I to VIII. The change was so marked that Mr. Moir complimented me on the same. Prior to this he\nhad to take some of the children in another room to question and hear them read.\n\nIt is not really a basement or dug-out. It is more of a first floor. Playroom, dining-rooms (both staff and children's) are all on the same floor. They are level with the ground surface. As a matter of fact there is, or can be, a straight current of air from East to West through this Primary Room and the Playroom, whereas in the other two classrooms, one facing North, the other South, there is no outlet whatever when the door is shut. I do not wish to imply that the Primary Room is what it might be, but there is a greater circulation of air there than in either of the others.\n\nThe finding by Mr. Moir of the Primary Room door locked was after he had inspected the room, and after school hours. Miss Kidler, I find, had occasion to leave the room in question for a few moments, and left these little girls to clean it up. It has not happened before nor will it again. Before Mr. Moir left the school he came to the office as usual, and on my asking his findings they were very satisfactory, other than it was a pity changes had to be so frequent in the Boys' Classroom. I reminded him of promising to help me in that direction, which he admitted, and remarked that it was difficult, but that the position here was very much better than the average country school. But the difficulty, as I pointed out to him, is the war, and we all know that every available man's duty is to help to protect our country and win the war, hence the shortage.\n\nMr. Moir on one occasion suggested a Miss Walker as teacher in the Primary Room, who had her Grade XII, but no teaching ability whatsoever, he saying that it was not necessary for that room. I soon had to ask\nfor Miss Walker's resignation, to which I think perhaps Mr. Moir took umbrage. On speaking of Miss Fidler he said he thought she would make good, as she purposes going to Normal this next year. He did not mention having found the door locked, which he might have done. The matter could then have been taken up right away and so dispensed with. It was nothing alarming as no harm could possibly come to them in any way, -no fireplace and the room looking right at the front of the school building.\n\nThe Gordon's School is a new building, built in 1929 and to the specifications of the Department. I think improvement could have been made in respect to the classrooms, but the ordinary visitor when looking over, thinks everything is just wonderful, and that wonderful provision is made for the Indian children.\n\nAnswering the matter of letters having reached you in respect to the learning of the pupils, naming the Grade V as the highest obtained is most untruthful. I have just gone over some of the Discharge Sheets (same will be on your File possibly) and find there were 22 in Grade VI, 24 in Grade VII and 1 in Grade VIII. Many children come into school at ages from 12 to 15, having attended Day School in some cases, and leave at 16 years. How is it possible to show very marked improvement at such age of entry? The reason for this late entry in some cases because here at Gordon's on leaving school (providing there has been good behaviour) we outfit them from head to foot with enough clothes to last for a considerable time.\n\nI have heard that Mr. Glit. Castleden, our Member, has been giving the Indians interviews and to whom they (the Indians) vent their feelings respecting other parts of the Indian Department as well as the schools. There are a few Indians on each Reserve who are agitators. They don't work to try and improve their condition, but just keep on trying to\nraise discord. I would appreciate Mr. Castleden's visit to the school, and can assure you that no special preparations would be made, as I endeavour to keep the school fit for inspection at all times.\n\nThis is a very lengthy epistle, but to give you the facts as though you were here is what I gather you wish. I shall as in the past be most pleased to do anything for the improvement and advancement of the Indian child, and will gladly welcome any suggestion to that end.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waddy,\nTouchwood Agency,\nPunnichy.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs instructed, I am answering the questions asked by the Department.\n\nAge,- born in England, July 3rd, 1871.\n\nTeaching Experience,- Nil.\n\nQualifications,- Business Course; Service in Imperial Army, 1900, Canadian, 1915; Hotel & Catering, London, England and Montreal; Supervisor of Construction; Commercial Traveller; Deputy Sheriff. Grade on leaving School, Standard 10, English Grammar School.\n\nRe Appointment. In 1930 Mr. Commissioner Graham asked me if I would consider such a position. I told him I had not any teaching experience. He replied that was not essential, business acumen and financing were most needed. He recommended me to the Right Rev. M.M. Harding, then Bishop of Qu'Appelle (now Archbishop of Rupert's Land) and to our present bishop, the Right Rev. E.H. Knowles, who was then Secretary of Synod. They took the matter up with Deputy Supt. General Mr. Duncan Scott, an agree-\nable settlement was arranged and at a salary of $100 per month, which is paid by the Synod of Qu'Appelle, and by whom my contract was made. Living quarters etc. are provided by the Department of Indian Affairs out of the per capita grant.\n\nMy instructions on taking over were to put the House in Order and be careful of finances. Mr. Duncan Scott suggested it necessary for a Layman to be Principal (prior to which it had been a Cleric) with business ability and initiative to overcome the difficulties then existing. This has been accomplished, and for many years now a substantial credit balance has been shown, which can be verified by the yearly Principal's Report for Fiscal Year ordered by the Department and also the Department Auditor. For instance, March 31/40 had the Per Capita Grant been in hand a surplus of $4534.87 would be shown with no outstanding accounts. These yearly surpluses go back in up-keep and improvements to buildings etc.\n\nAmong the numerous officials visiting, those from Ottawa are Mr. J. Sutherland, Dr. Harold McGill, Dr. J.J. Wall and Mr. M. Christiansen, Gen. Supt. of Agencies, also many Church Dignitaries. One of more than ordinary knowledge of such institutions said that this school was second to none in the Dominion, and he has visited most of them. All expressed their approval of the condition and general routine here.\n\nTrusting this statement is of the nature required, will remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The \"Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetic\" is in use in practically all Indian schools in Canada and has been found very satisfactory. In checking over requisitions from your school, it is noted that 12 copies of Book I and 12 copies of Book 2 were supplied in February, last. We desire this latter arithmetic used in your school and if additional copies are required, please let us know at once, as we are holding your requisition until we hear from you.\n\nIt is also noted that you request 12 copies of \"Far Away People\", and in this case, too, we desire you to use the \"New Geography\" by Frye-Gamell. You are, no doubt, familiar with this Geography, as copies have already been supplied to your school. Please state if additional copies are required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R. W.

The others were mentioned because we have always been directed to use the texts authorized for the province, and we thought of trying out the possibilities of the \"Everyday Arithmetic.\"\n\nThe same applies in the matter of the Geographies, but we need another dozen copies of the \"New Geography\" by Frye-Gammell. If you will include these in the requisition we shall be much obliged.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal, Gordon School\nMr. P.

He also mentions a shortage of material necessary for handwork and other activities. I find that the last requisition received from the Gordon's School was dated March 7, 1942, and no request was contained on that requisition for supplies for Grade 7. As you are aware, supplies are becoming scarce and the Department cannot always allow all the articles requested by schools. At the same time we do not desire to have any grade without textbooks. However, it is difficult to supply these if we do not receive a requisition.

Our records show that for some years past we have been forwarding 6 copies monthly of this magazine to your school. Please let me know if you are receiving them and, if so, why you did not show them to the Inspector. If, by any chance, you are not receiving them, I will take up the matter with the Red Cross Society on receipt of your reply.\n\nIn addition to recommending the \"Red Cross Junior Magazine\", Inspector Moir recommended a subscription to a nature magazine. Our records indicate we are sending to you \"Canadian Nature Magazine\". This is published quarterly. If you are not receiving it regularly please let me know, so that I can take up the matter with the company.

Miss E. Atwater, our senior teacher, had taken Nature Magazine long before the Department issued it.\n\nPerfume would be given a Male Teacher for the Boys' Classroom.\nMr. P. Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReply to Letter 121-14.\n\nProvincial School Inspector Moir did not mention to either of the teachers or myself anything regarding Junior Red Cross Magazine or Canadian Nature magazine, both of which are received here, and I most certainly did not think it necessary for me to show these magazines to the Inspector, more especially after receiving them for so long a period. It would be interesting to know what is particularly lacking in knowledge by these magazines not being shown to the Inspector, also an outline as to his general findings in the classrooms.\n\nYou will of course know the handicap in procuring teachers since hostilities, and I would much appreciate your assistance in procuring the services of a teacher for the Boys' Classroom, Grades I to VIII, as the present teacher is leaving to study for the higher grades. The salary paid is $65.00 per month with room, board, laundry and white uniforms.\nOttawa,\nNovember 26, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI note from your letter of the 20th instant, that you are receiving the Junior Red Cross Magazine and the Canadian Nature Magazine regularly. Unfortunately these magazines were not in the classrooms where they should be, as otherwise the Inspector would have seen them.\n\nIn his report Inspector Moir wrote as follows regarding teaching methods:\n\n\"Miss Atwater's influence in the school is cumulative. Her long association with these girls and even their parents and her kindness count for more in her success than her methods. She is following Saskatchewan curriculum more closely.\n\n\"Miss Sloan has broadened her work and is using many teaching devices; she has purchased a radio and will use it in the classroom.\n\n\"Miss Welsh is handicapped by cramped quarters and lack of teaching experience. Emphasis mainly on written work and drawing rather than on oral language.\n\n\"Many of the suggestions made in the previous report and in discussions with the teachers are being carried out. Miss Atwater takes music in the two senior rooms and is bringing the work to a satisfactory level. In both rooms the work is approaching the grade\n\nMr. R.W. Frayling,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nlevels of the province in the majority of subjects. The written language exercises were very satisfactory. Oral language remains the chief problem in all three rooms - the out-of-class speech seems at a higher level than the speech in the classrooms, perhaps because much of the classroom work is not adjusted to the felt needs and interests of the children. In the kindergarten there should be more opportunity for speech, more activities in social studies, health, and nature study.\"\n\nMr. Moir suggested that additional supplementary reading material be supplied and an order for this was placed with the Government Stationery Office on the 22nd instant.\n\nI regret that we are not in a position to nominate a teacher for your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: Feb 5, 1944\n\nFor: Gordon's I.Res.

The language books we requisitioned are recommended by the Dept. of Education in Saskatchewan and I could really make good use of them.\n\nThe number required may be confusing to you somewhat but due to the fact that this school has been closed for three\nyears, the pupils are constantly being re-grouped and re-graded. Therefore, to avoid having to requisition more books in the very near future, I have ordered as I see necessary.\n\nSome of the books on the list are urgently needed. I would be very grateful if it is at all possible to favor me with your earliest possible attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs) K. E.

The books, what few there are, are all very much out-of-date. Would it be at all possible for us to obtain a few new ones? We did not qualify for the books as per your circular, not because our percentage of attendance wasn't high but due to the fact that the school has only been in operation since October 1950. This did not give us the year.\n\nUngraded readers would be of much value here. Could we get a few of them for grades two to five?\n\nWe have a phonograph but no records. We would very much like to have a few such as folk dances including the minuet, a few speech training records and phonics which would give the children a change which should be great value to them.\nFor the beginners a few nursery rhyme records suitable for beginners as well as Grade I. Folksongs suitable for primary grades. The Davis book of songs for primary grades would also be appreciated ordered. The Dictograph Workbooks, so per duplicate copy order sheet are a block order.

The carpenter he had engaged for the work, after a careful examination, advised him to the same effect; and the work was in consequence abandoned to be resumed in the Spring, when, it is hoped, a sufficient sum will be allowed to erect a larger and more commodious building.\n\nThe Agent asked for $150.00 for repairs to the old building to make it habitable for the Winter which sum was authorized to be expended.\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nThe lumber and lime already purchased will be kept on hand and can be used in the new building. The window and storm sash charged in voucher No 2202 herewith, can also be used in the new building.\n\nAs to the further grant that might be required for the erection of a new building, the Department's attention will be drawn to this in connection with the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Commissioner\nOffice of the Indian Agent, Touchwood Hills Agency,\nKutawa, Alta., 8th Nov., 1893.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with voucher No. 1838, I have the honour to inform you that the request of the Rev. Owen Owens, who had an authority from the then Indian Commissioner, to push on the work of repairs to George Gordon's school, he instructed Josiah Pratt to burn a kiln of lime, for the purpose of plastering said school. The kiln, which was thoroughly burned out, and supposed to contain 250 bushels, but of which only 200 were bargained for. It is claimed by the contractor, Josiah Pratt, as well as the Rev. O. Owens, that the former is entitled to his pay for the 200 bushels @ 3\u00bd cents per bushel, = $75.00.\n\nThe lime is well secured for the winter, and will be in good shape for next spring's work.\n\nConsidering that lime could not probably be procured in spring, under 40 or 45 cents per bushel, the above is respectfully submitted in favour of the voucher being paid.\n\nInd.

The walls to be stone fitted with furnaces as per your previous requirements.\n\nPrevious figures and estimates now showing that a building 80' x 40' ft of two full stories divided into Schoolroom, Dining-room, Kitchen, Lavatories, Store-room, Work-room, Dormitories, Office rooms, Cellars and furnaces can be built for about $2,500.\n\nThis would\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThis would leave a margin for contingency of $500 which may still or if not that sum need not be drawn.\n\nShould you attempt to add to this building and only expend the grant already made it will only be a temporary settlement at best whereas the present suggestion will settle the matter for many years and will not require nearly so large an amount to be expended annually for repaying.\n\nI therefore trust that you will see your way to provide the additional sum required.\n\nI am writing this at request of the Bishop of Buckingham and those interested in the work here.\n\nI append a rough estimate for your perusal.\n\nShall the honor\n\nYours Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nOwen Davies\n\nVERRY POOR COPY\nGordon's Indian School,\nS.

We therefore have decided to spend a portion of the grant to repair or rather finish the old building and to fit them up for school room and boys' dormitories, office and printing room and boys' lavatory. In short make the place comfortable enough to last a few years till we can procure money to build another cottage for the boys similar to the one we propose to build now for the girls and household accommodation.\n\nWe propose, with your sanction, to build new building detached from the present one, of the character and dimensions shown on plans which we think are most useful, and at the same time the cheapest that can be built.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina,\n\nAssn.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nWe have kept in mind your wish to heat with air, and have made provisions in our plans for the same, to be done by means of a furnace.\n\nTo build a chamber good enough to use a stove would be out of the question so we have decided on one of Gurney's furnaces.\n\nI regret that we cannot heat the old building with air, but it being so long and narrow effectually prevents that. But I am glad to state that the new stoves bought last Fall have been amply sufficient to warm the place even in its present state, the fires always lasting all night and the place warm in the mornings, even on stormy days. I think that when we put in ventilators in the school room and dormitories that place will be warm and sweet at all times.\n\nWe propose to have washhouse and laundry etc. apart from main buildings.\n\nI think it will be found of great advantage to have boys and girls in different houses, so that they are only within reach of each other at school, meals and prayers.\n\nI propose to offer the work and furnishing material and all fixtures for about $2200.00 to $2400.00, stipulating that our Indians shall be employed to haul stone, sand, water and freight at reasonable rates.\n\nI think Chas. Payne of Qu'Appelle will give a bid for less than any one else. However we cannot ask for a bid until we get your sanction to plans and specifications.\n\nVerry Poor Copy\nspecifications. I therefore beg your immediate attention to the matter and would respectfully ask that the plans and specifications be returned at once if approved or if amendments are needed or modifications, that the same be embodied or issued to us as instructions, so that we may have the walls up at least before June 30th next. The Indians are now gathering stones ready to haul.\n\nI may add that we did not consider that we would gain anything by going to Qu'Appelle or Regina as I was able to find as near as possible their prices.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\n(sgd) Owen Owens.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith, plans and specifications for the repair of the old Boarding School buildings at Gordon's Reserve and the erection of an additional building in connection therewith.\n\nIf same are approved, I would draw the Department's attention to the advisability of the commencement of the work being authorized as early as possible in order to permit of the expenditure within the current fiscal year of the $1500.00 available for the purpose; the balance to be paid after 1st July next out of next year's appropriation.\n\nThe Department will please direct whether it wishes the work to be done under the immediate supervision of the Agent or if in view of the distance at which the Agency is from the school and his numerous duties during seeding time, a general supervision on his part would not suffice, leaving Rev Mr Owens the duty of attending to the details.\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nI have the honour to be Sir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nAsst Commissioner\n\nIndian Affairs.

Also digging a ditch cut in the water 20 feet from the edge back to the cistern as well, laying therein a 10# galvanised corrugated pipe for conveyance and refilling same with gravel. The calculations are to build a temporary wharf out in the water and have this dug from the top of the wharf. We believe we can make you a satisfactory job this way.

Putting in 2x12-10 foot lengths and making provision for 4x4 sleepers for the 10 foot gangway running lengthwise of the building and laying thereon 2x12- As well, the cost would be $172.15.\n\nUpon going into this matter in respect to having the same space filled with concrete 6\" deep it comes somewhat cheaper and this could be done for $146.00. This we believe would give you better drainage and better results and it can be arranged so that it will drain into the present gutters behind the cattle in the main part of the building and would go out through your regular tile drainage.\n\nAwaiting your approval of either proposition, We are.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Gordon School and Barns.\n\nI am enclosing prices received from the A.F.W. Heise Co. for improving the water supply to the school; placing plank floor in young stock portion of cow barn; and a letter re the supply of tracks and counter weights for doors.\n\nRegarding the water supply; I personally went over the matter on the site, with Mr. Heise, and he claimed that the driving of cribbing that would withstand the ice in winter, would require a pile driver which would have to be shipped from Saskatoon. I suggested the placing of a 10\" pipe some four or five feet below the surface of the water, leading into the filter bed around the well\u2014covering the intake end with a screen. This I believe would ensure a supply of water in the winter time when under present conditions it might freeze up.\n\nI expect to have the price on the soft water tank etc. within a few days. In the meantime I would appreciate having your decision on the other matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction\n\nIndian Affairs.

Swan, Architect,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon Indian Reserve Cistern and Water-water.\n\nWe have gone into details very carefully in this connection and beg to submit the following to you. Since Mr. Wismer's return and arranging to bring ground pipe line in from the East side along to the cistern, we have made calculation to have the cistern five feet below the ground surface in place of two as according to our original instructions. We trust this is agreeable and understood. We have made provision to have the cistern as per your directions, reinforced with fencing on the walls etc. and three-quarter inch iron on top slab. Also an opening for entering same, labor and material complete $710.80.\n\nWith regard to the tile pipe lines leading into cistern, we have marked two little round o's on the first blue print, as the two beginning points for the tile underground drain it will be understood as the two finishing points for the tins workers.\n\nMaking provision for 6\" glazed pipe well laid and using cement to cork same without running both from the East and West side of the building into the cistern. Also an extra line running from the black O marked near the chimney on the chapel building to take care of the rain water pipe off this building. Also making provision for sixty lineal feet of 10\" glazed tile as an overflow pipe from cistern. This we trust will extend far enough away from the building so as not to interfere with the lay of the grounds.\n\nProvision has also been made for a cast-iron vent pipe from the cistern as well and a cistern pump. This all supplied and in a good workmanlike manner comes to $480.15.\n\nRegarding the timework, Messrs. Wismer and English quotation labor and material complete according to plans agreed upon $255.00.\n\nWe feel confident that ample provision had been made in every respect to overcome your water difficulty.\n\nShould it be convenient to have this cistern installed on the East side of the chapel in place of on the West as originally planned, also in lieu to the ground being lower on the East side than on the West, this would make less excavation and no doubt you could have the cistern as originally planned running two feet under the surface of the ground. It would also make less excavation for the tile drains as well and would not add any extra to the material. So the excavation alone would make a saving of $90.00.\n\nThanking you for this valued inquiry and trust same will meet with final approval. Under separate cover we are returning you the plans.\n\nAwaiting your favorable reply, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. W. Heise Company Limited,\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that he has the figures off, and that the work exclusive of tinsmithing would come to $1100.00, and the tinsmith's figure is $108.50.\n\nIf you wish to have A.W. Heise Co. do this work please wire me instructions before they leave the district.\n\nI may say that I am unable to obtain any other figures on the work, as contractors do not think they could compete with a firm who have their equipment on the job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMR. SCOTT.\n\nSome time ago, the Reverend Principal of the new Gordon's Indian Boarding School asked to have a soft water cistern built in order to conserve the rain water carried from the roofs, for use in the laundry. He was advised at that time that the matter would be given consideration when the barns were being erected.\n\nMr. Swan, Inspector of Construction, was written to recently and asked to obtain and submit to the Department, a price for the building of a proposed concrete cistern. He has submitted a price from the contractors for the barn, of $1,400, also a price from Mr. Hemsworth, for $1,200.00, but Mr. Hemsworth would be unable to undertake the work until next year. I would recommend that Mr. Swan be authorized to have the cistern built by the contractors for the school barns, on a cost plus ten per cent basis.\n\nWhen the water system was provided in building this school, last year, a well was sunk, adjacent to the lake, and it was figured that the water would soak through from the lake to the well, which has not proven satisfactory, and it will therefore be necessary to dig a trench, and fill same with gravel leading from the well to the lake, at an estimated cost of $400.00. This work was not done at the time the water system was installed, as it was hoped that the extra expense might be saved. It is evident, however, that it will be necessary to install this trench, and I would recommend that Mr. Swan be instructed to have this work carried out by the contractors for the barn, on a cost plus ten per cent basis.\n\nARCHITECT.\nSept. 23rd, 1922.\n\nJ.D.

Atwater I may say that the field rheostat was not delivered with the rest of the switch-board equipment, but the electrical contractors assured me that it will be supplied. In regard to the position of the cells it was at first intended to place the stand out from the wall but after it was found that the space was so restricted in the generator room it was placed against the wall. I do not see that this is a very serious matter; but if it is thought necessary the back row could easily be raised an inch or two so that the height of water could be more easily seen. I am of opinion that more installations are placed level than otherwise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction,\nOttawa, October 11, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th inst., regarding the electrical equipment of the Gordon's Indian Boarding School, I would ask you to see that the contractors install the field rheostat required.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon School Barns.\n\nI managed to get the A.W. Heise Co. to leave their foreman and two or three men on the job to do the work on the water supply to the school. I am keeping time sheets for this, and checking amount of gravel and small stone supplied. The figure for putting lights in the barns given by the A.W. Heise Co. is $280.00, and I have secured one from Messrs Motherwell and Swan, a local firm who do all the wiring in Punnichy, for $235.00. Both figures include everything down to globes. The reason for the difference is that the local firm have their electrician and supplies right here, and A.W. Heise will have to ship from Saskatoon. These figures are good as long as the weather permits the digging of the pole holes before the ground is frozen very deep.\n\nMr. Heise informs me that the plumbers have not submitted a figure for the water supply to barns yet, but expects to have it in a day or so. Cannot get a local figure on plumbing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction\nOct. 20th 1922.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon School Barns.\n\nI enclose herewith A.W. Heise's figure for water supply to the barns. To save the tearing up of the concrete floors if water lines were run into each building we considered that a small house with tap and trough outside, but convenient to the buildings would be quite satisfactory. This is the way that Mr. Heise has figured.\n\nYou will of course see that time is a very important factor at this season of the year, so may I ask that if the figure is accepted, you notify me by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMr. Wm. Swan, Architect,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWith regard to extension of water main from school building over to an outhouse between the horse and cow barns.\n\nWe made provision to tap the water pressure in the boiler room and leave the building at the S.E. corner running direct on to the barns with inch and a quarter pipe and 7 foot trench. Then at the terminal we are digging 6x6 Cess-pool space about 10 foot deep. This will be filled with rock or gravel and will give ample space for back-drains on your pipe in the winter time. Also provision has been made for a 6x6 building on top with siding and shingles and a galvanized water trough. In fact everything will be complete to turn on the water when we are through.\n\nUpon checking over the estimate I find that excavation is more than half the cost of the work as the ground in that vicinity seems to be very hard. I have calculated on the basis of about $2.00 per yard but it is somewhat of a gamble as to what we are likely to encounter. However we are prepared to see the job through to a final finish on that basis.\n\nTrusting you will find this satisfactory and it is further understood that we would prefer not to do this work until next year, but upon immediate acceptance, and weather being at all favorable we could have this work done immediately. Even though it would run into the month of November I think it would be possible to get men down to look after it. We are.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. W.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon School Water Supply.\n\nI beg to report that the work on improving the water supply has been finished today. This work I arranged to have done by some of the men working for A.W. Heise Co., as the Rev. Mr. Atwater had let the contract for a small church to this company on the reserve. Under these conditions the work on the water supply was not continuous, but time sheets have been carefully kept and these will be forwarded within a few days. I have asked the A.W. Heise Co. to pay these men in the usual way, and to also pay for the materials. This they were willing to do because they still had their men and equipment on the reserve.\n\nThe filter trench was dug to the bottom of the well, extending out sixteen feet to the water's edge, and eight feet wide; this was filled with stone and gravel to the normal level of the water in the well, and then boarded over and earth filled on the top. The trench was cribbed with 2\" plank. Four feet below the surface of the lake an eight inch gal. iron culvert was taken out forty feet from the end of the trench into the lake. The supply of water now seems to be quite constant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Constn.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gordon School.\n\nThe rheostat is now in place and the batteries adjusted to suit the Reverend Principal.\nHe has been having trouble with the centre bar supporting the fire grates in the boilers; the new one and also the other one have both bent so much that the grates are falling at the sides. I have taken this matter up with Messrs Smith & Wilson, and so that you may have their opinion I enclose their letter. As new bars are needed right away to keep the fires going I have today been in communication with the Guerney Co. in Regina who have also been in communication with Commissioner Graham, and they are ordering bars shipped by express immediately from either Winnipeg or Toronto; the adjustment to be made when it can be fully decided as to whether the fault is with the fireman or the castings.\nI trust that this action meets with your approval; for it would appear that to wait for an adjustment and placing of blame before rectifying the damage would leave the school without heat for some time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Gordon's School:\n\nWe very much appreciate the trouble you have gone to in getting the electrician in Punnichy to fix up the rheostat for us. We are very sorry that this rheostat was omitted, and it has put us in rather a bad position, as no doubt we should have seen that this was in place, but owing to the fact that the plant was not operated after the installation was supposed to be completed, we did not go quite sufficiently into this matter, but we do hope that this will now adjust the system satisfactorily.\n\nWith regard to the grates, it is almost impossible for us to pass an opinion without seeing the casting, because a very slight neglect by the operator would melt out any grate, irrespective of what quality of iron it was made from. However, we are taking this matter up with our sub-contractors and we may be able to find out if the Gurney people have had trouble with other bars. If they have not, we feel that it is most likely due to ashes clogging up sufficiently to burn out the castings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\nJ/B.\nDuncan G.

Your file 121-1-5c.\n\nWith reference to your recent request for a temporary certificate in the above connection, would you be good enough to furnish the Civil Service Commission with full particulars as to the size of the boarding school with details as to the heating and other plant, etc., stating as to whether or not Mr. Miller is required to supervise a staff of cleaners and firemen.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nNovember 13, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMiss O'Donahoe:\n\nRelative to the late correspondence on this file, I am convinced, from Mr. Foran's letter, that he has overlooked the temporary nature of this appointment. I think it would be sufficient to draw the Commission's attention to this fact and to explain that we had to have a fully competent man to take care of the residential school from the time of its completion until the staff and pupils were prepared to enter the building. The whole plant cost the Department in the neighborhood of $140,000 and the boilers and heating plant, the electric lighting system and the water supply all had to be carefully attended by a temporary engineman-caretaker.\nDear Mr. Foran,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, your File IA-IA8-673, and to say in reply that Mr. George Miller, for whom we have requested a temporary certificate as Public Building Engineman-Caretaker for the Gordon's Indian boarding school at Punnichy, Sask., was simply employed to take care of the residential school from the time it was completed until the staff and pupils were prepared to enter the building. We had to have a fully competent man for this position, as the whole plant cost the Department in the neighbourhood of $140,000, and the boilers and heating plant, the electric lighting system and the water supply all had to be carefully attended by a competent engineman-caretaker; this man was not required to supervise the work of others.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm.

Heise Co., which cover all costs of improving the water supply from the lake. As explained in my last report these have all been paid by the A.W. Heise Co., as they had their men on the ground anyway. Several of these men are local men and I have ascertained that payment was made as represented. I have been in telephone communication with the Richardson Road Mach., Co., from whom the 40 feet of culvert was purchased, and find this is O.K. I have checked over the lumber bill with Mr. Heise personally, and owing to the fact that he had it on hand on the site it has been put in at a price below that of our local yard. The Express Co. bill I have not checked but is was for shipping long handled telephone shovels from Saskatoon; these were used to get culvert trench four feet under water.

McKechnie's report on the Gordon Boarding School, situated on Gordon's Reserve, Touchwood Agency. The report is a good one and the reputation that this school has always had has been kept up.\n\nMr. McKechnie makes suggestions in regard to Manual Training. I have always thought that we should do a little of this work in schools of this kind. We have certain equipment in the Warehouse here that could be used if we had a proper building in which to install the benches, etc. The Department might consider the question of erecting a small frame carpentry shop, well away from the main building down by the stables, where we could carry on a certain amount of manual work. Of course, the main object of the school should be to train the boys and girls in the line of Agriculture, but it is also necessary that the boys should have a knowledge of carpentry, blacksmithing, etc. This branch of the work has almost disappeared in some of our larger schools, at Qu'Appelle for instance. At one time it was a branch of work that a great deal of attention was given to.\n\nI would strongly recommend that an item of $700.00 be placed in the Estimates, which have just gone forward, for the purpose of building a root house. I think that if we had this amount we could build a root house that would provide ample storage room for the year's supply of vegetables.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm.

The Department has noted your recommendation that an item of $700 be placed in the Estimates to build a root cellar at this school. The question of erecting a carpenter shop and equipping it for boys' manual training will have to remain over for the present. This branch of residential school work has been more or less neglected and, following your recommendation, the Department will bear in mind this need at all boarding and industrial schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nIndian Affairs,\nRegina,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have examined the center grate supports in these boilers, and find that they have sagged down and allowed the grates to fall to ash pit floor. This is invariably caused by ashes being allowed to accumulate in the ash pit, and not allowing a free circulation of air to keep the grates cool, or hot coals dropping into the ash pit and causing the same to become so hot that the center support and grates are bound to warp. Care must be taken that the pit is clear of ash at all times, and cleared of ash as often as required, and not at stated times for the reason that different coals require different attention or have more ash, and in the case of the Tofield coal being used at this school, hot coals drop through the grates when the fire is disturbed by firing or otherwise and these will remain a red hot mass for hours. I would suggest that the ash pit be lowered by cutting into the floor below the boiler pits so as to allow a larger volume of air under the grates, but this would be of no use benefit unless kept clean of ash.\n\nIn regard to the support that broke last year, I have examined same and can see no flaw in the casting. It is a clean break and I would judge was caused by throwing a shovel full of very wet coal, possibly full of ice and snow, directly on this when it was very hot. Care must be given grates as with anything else.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"R. W.

H. W. Atwater,\nPrincipal, G.I.B.S.,\nPunnichy, Sask.,\n\nDear Mr. Atwater:\n\nThank you for your letter of the 16th inst., with further information with regard to the Drumheller Coal. The coal they are using in the large hot-water furnace in the St. Cuthbert's house used as the Theological College here, is Screened Miners Run, from either the Crows Nest mine at Fernie, or some other mine in that locality. The coal used in the large steam furnaces in the St. Chad's College building, now used as the Girls school, is Miners Run unscreened, from the Crows Nest Mine. The latter costs $11.25 per ton delivered, and the former $13.50 per ton. I think it possible you may find the Miners Run unscreened steam coal, to be a more satisfactory coal for a big plant like Gordon's School, and I am satisfied that you could get better prices than we have been paying locally. On the other hand, if you are able to burn satisfactorily, a soft coal, they are very much cleaner to handle, and I think, have less waste in them.\n\nIt is unfortunate about the defective building construction, but we find the same in every contract building in the country. The only possible thing we could suggest, is to get the Government to put on \"Chamberlain\" metal stripping on windows and outside doors, or the \"Lockwood\" metal stripping on storm sashes. By the use of this metal stripping, we have in the Synod office, cut down our coal bill by one-third. In my opinion, metal stripping of some kind must be used in all public buildings. No doubt there are different kinds on the market, and you could look into the matter and take it up with the Dept.\nRev. H. W. Atwater,\n\nThe Apportionment Committee met yesterday and passed an estimate for your stipendiary grant for $900 for 1923. I am sorry to say that we were quite a bit down on our assessment this year owing to financial conditions, and that our overdraft has been increased by $600, on our workings in 1922, but this of course was to be expected. We did not pass any additional vote for Gordon's School, as we did not have any requisition from you to do that. We think it is very wonderful that you have been enabled to finance things in the new building, without indebtedness upon the Government grant, and your excellent management in home produce. But if you think it is necessary for me to apply for an allowance on the 1923 budget, I shall be glad if you will make the items known to me in time for our meeting of the Executive Committee, on January 31st.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nBelieve me,\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of Synod\n\nEHK/FWM.\nThe Assistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSIR,\n\nWill the Department permit me to suggest that, before this new school building is taken off the contractors' hands finally, which, I understand will be done after the year from the time it was finished has expired, that a competent person be sent to inspect it, one who thoroughly understands methods of construction, and installation of heating and lighting plants, and who has no connection, even remotely, with contractors or officials.\n\nI enclose a letter from the chairman of the Indian Committee, and would direct your attention to the second paragraph, in which he makes a suggestion about keeping some of the wind out. I wrote him that it was exceedingly expensive trying to heat all the air on Gordon's Reserve.\n\nYour inspector would see, if he came, that in the engine room, with the dynamo belted to a pulley on a shaft, vertically, instead of being directly belted to the engine, there is a loss of nearly 4 h.p. out of the 10 h.p. which the engine is designed to produce.\n\nHe would also see that having the water tanks one on the other instead of side by side, as specified, the air pressure is very...\nseriously interfered with.\n\nAt any rate, it would pay the Department to ring out the defects in this building, so that they might be guarded against in the erection of another.\n\nLast winter, the fireman placed here by the Department, estimated that one ton of coal a day would suffice to heat the building, but the wood had not then shrunk, as green lumber always will; now, it takes two tons, and for the reason which I gave in the foregoing, the result, when a high wind is blowing, is not all that can be desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 21, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nA letter has today been received from the Rev. Principal of the new Gordon School, complaining that the windows have all shrunk and become loose, requiring a great amount of fuel to heat the building.\n\nI would ask you to be good enough, at your earliest convenience, to make an inspection of this building and report fully on its present condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He gave only ten days' service in October as Inspector. We employed him in November in connection with a report on the water-supply, but we did not obtain a certificate as his service was in all only seven days.\n\nMr. Swan is not now in our employ.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm. Foran, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nApril 14th 1923.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon School, Punnichy.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I have made an inspection of the above school, to ascertain the reason for the Rev. Principal's complaints.\n\nDuring our most severe weather last winter there was some delay in coal delivery to the school, and the heating plant had to be kept going by using wood, most of which was green. As a result of this some of the pipes froze up; particularly the wet returns from the playrooms. You may remember that I took this matter up with Mr. Orr & Co. October 3rd, 1921.\n\nRegarding the loose windows I find that the sashes have shrunk somewhat, but not more than is usual under conditions in the West; except in one case in the South classroom, where there is a sash that can be actually pulled past the stops. This must either have been planed down since or was overlooked and left a very loose fit at completion of the job. To have perfectly tight windows it would be necessary to put on some form of weather strip.\n\nThe plaster has cracked wherever lathed work meets that put direct upon tile or brick. This of course is to be expected on account of the unequal shrinkage. Generally the plaster is in good condition.\n\nWhere wooden beams are exposed in kitchen there is quite a little shrinkage where glazed brick is built around the ends of these. A moulding could easily be mitred around these to hide the open joints.\n\nIn the Rev. Principal's suite there appears to be more than usual shrinkage between the base and floor, and in this case the shoe strip was nailed to the base instead of to the floor.\n\nSome of the doors have shrunk, but the condition can be remedied by setting the butts out slightly. Solid doors, particularly those of pine or fir, are never free from shrinkage to some extent. The only door to stand up is the veneered door.\n\n1.\nThe coal bin has pulled away from the boiler room wall much more than it should have done even though it was built during cold weather and after the main walls were up.\n\nThe man in charge of the engines states that the generator engine is overloaded due to the fact that there is not a direct drive to the generator. Owing to the lack of room in the generator room a direct drive is no practicable. The day that I made my inspection the engine was running well with generator and all laundry machinery. I was told that the engineer from Punnichy had been out and cleaned it. I afterwards saw this engineer and he explained that the engine had not been properly timed in the first place and he had changed the timer.\n\nI might repeat what I have mentioned in a previous report that the laundry is much too crowded, and with the amount of machinery installed might well have been twice the size.\n\nThere appears to have been no further trouble with the grate supports, under heating boilers, sagging.\n\nWhile in Regina I saw Mr. Smith of Smith Bros. & Wilson, and he promised to come up to Punnichy and go over the building with me and see what could be done to remedy some of the defects. He intends to do this as soon as the roads are fit for car travel.\n\nYou will of course understand that all lumber in use in the west will shrink after it is in place.\n\nDuring the winter months here the buildings are heated to a high temperature with no provisions for humidifying the air with the result that all lumber shows the effects to some extent. In many cases with the return of wet weather and open windows in the spring and summer much of it swells up again. The kiln dried lumber of the present day is not like the ten year seasoned material of some years ago.\n\nFor a large building that is practically all lumber construction I consider the amount of shrinkage not more than normal.\n\nWhen I can get Mr. Smith on the job I shall be able to have some of the items attended to.\n\nIf there is any further information that I can obtain for you I shall be pleased to send it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They informed me that this piano was not their property, but belonged to the I. O. D. E. They value it at $150 and I advised them to communicate with their Regina representative, with a view to having him ask Mr. Commissioner Graham to make out a voucher for $150 in favour of the I. O. D. E. I believe this arrangement is the best, and such voucher should be paid, when presented.\n\nIndian Affairs.

From an examination of the accounts I find that the following payments were made to Mr. Swan:\n\n- Cheque 1734 - Salary for month of August and three days in July - 19 days at $6 a day, $114.00\n- Cheque 2446 - Salary for month of September - 19 days at $7 a day, $133.00\n- Cheque 2943 - Salary for month of October - 10 days at $7 a day, $70.00\n- Cheque 3341 - Salary for month of November - 7 days at $7 a day, $49.00\n\nKindly inform me why after the first payment Mr. Swan was paid at the rate of $7 a day, notwithstanding the fact that the rate authorized by the commission was only $6 a day.\n\nI notice that the vouchers for the above payments are certified to by your architect, Mr. Orr. As Mr. Orr cannot have personal knowledge of the number of days in each month on which Mr. Swan was present on the work I think that in addition to his certificate I should have a statement from the Agent at Punnichy, showing the actual days in each month for which Mr. Swan should be paid.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAsst.

About a year after the transfer was made I learned from the Department of Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment that the piano did not belong to them but was a second hand piano purchased by money from the I.O.D.E. for the purpose of entertaining sick soldiers and after it was no longer required it should have been returned to the I.O.D.E. instead of transferred to this Department.\n\nThe piano is needed badly where it is, the school cannot afford to pay for it and I would be glad if the Department would approve of the enclosed voucher.

Atwater,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Indian Boarding School,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have arranged with a man named Rudolph, a German, living near Punnichy, to break 2 acres at Gordon's School, but the only work done by Rudolph was to take his time out of the acres.\n\nI advise Mr. Harding to overlook the tardiness for this work, as he does not work and break through, but he expects the man Rudolph, who I understand, owed him for land.\n\nBut one farmer was brought.\nI have had about 20 acres cleared of brush, at the expense of the Federal government for the past two years, and am much disappointed that the clearing has not been done.\n\nNothing, however, has been done on this Reserve for three or four years except in the line of the \"new industry,\" the manufacture of \"home brew.\"\n\nSix steers were shipped this year instead of cattle, two years ago that shows the trend of affairs.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH. W.

W. W. Atwater\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nIt appears from Rev. H.W. Atwater's letter of the 10th instant, File 121-1-1, that a voucher in favour of J. Schlosser for $90.00 and one in favour of F. Rudolph for $30.00 submitted by J.B. Hardinge, ex-agent, under cover of letters dated July 18th last on file 121-1-5, are probably false and a question has arisen as to whether an action could properly be taken against Mr. Hardinge in respect of the submission of such vouchers. If these vouchers are false it may be that it is due to gross negligence on the part of Mr. Hardinge in taking the word of the said claimants without investigating to see whether such work had been done or not, and if that is the case I do not think action could be taken against him but it would appear that action might be taken against these claimants for obtaining money on false pretense under the provisions of Section 405 of the Criminal Code.\n\nIn order to prosecute Mr. Hardinge under the provisions of said Section 405 for procuring property to be delivered to any person other than himself or under Section 415 for falsifying a paper or document, it would have to be shown that Mr. Hardinge did this with intent to defraud. I think that it would be well to have one of our Inspectors consult with Rev. Atwater and then interview Messrs. Schlosser and Rudolph to have them give the particulars of the work rendered by them and show the land they claim to have plowed, and to find out if possible whether there was any conspiracy between Mr. Hardinge and these men for securing the payment of the said sums.\n\nA.S.

Atwater, Principal, Gordon's Residential School, has requested that two frame buildings located at the site of the old school building be moved near the new school, to be used for a store house, granary and implement shed. These buildings were erected by the Department in 1914-15, respectively, at a cost of approximately $3,000, and the Principal points out that if they remain where they are, they will either be torn to pieces and stolen piecemeal, or destroyed ultimately by prairie fire. He forwards a price which he received from the McKee Cartage & Transfer Company, Saskatoon, to move the buildings for the sum of $725.00, the Principal to have a road prepared across the fields, and the moving to be done after the crop is cut.\n\nI shall be pleased, if you approve of the Principal's request, if you will make the necessary arrangements for the moving of the buildings. If you decide to have the work done, you may arrange with the above Company to do the work, or you may have it done by any other means which you consider to be the cheapest and most satisfactory. I shall be pleased to hear if you approve of the moving of the building this summer, and, if so, whether you can arrange to have the work done.\n\nWe are informing the Principal that this matter has been referred to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nS. S. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI wish to bring to your attention a matter that I think requires prompt attention. I refer to the lighting system at the Gordon School in the Touchwood Agency, which was built by Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson.\n\nThe storage battery, which cost the Department in the neighbourhood of $2600.00, was put out of commission in six months after it was installed, and since that date up to the present time, the battery has been dormant and useless. This condition was brought about through no other cause whatever than incompetent management on the part of the man who is still in charge of this plant.\n\nThe situation is that should the engine break down at any time, they would be in complete darkness, and the whole water system would be cut off.\n\nYou will remember that I took up this matter of having competent men in charge, not only at this point, but also at other places where the Department is spending thousands of dollars on these plants. We are building a school on the Blood Reserve, and you have agreed that we should have competent help here, but no doubt we will get much the same class of man as we have at Gordon's.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\n\nSept. 22nd, 1924\n\nCannot something be done to ensure these expensive plants being properly handled?\n\nI feel very keenly about the situation at Gordon's, because I took good care to point out that something would happen if the plant was not in competent hands, and this did happen in the short period of six months.\n\nIt certainly seems to me a needless waste of money, the placing of this work in the hands of amateurs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 1, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 312-11A of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the unsatisfactory services of the engineer-caretaker at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I have noted, with some uneasiness, that the electric light plant is out of order and I am corresponding with the church authorities, informing them that they will have to arrange for its replacement without expense to the Department. I am also urging the Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle to arrange for a better qualified engineer without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, October 1, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Atwater:\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham has reported that the storage battery of the lighting system at the Gordon's Indian Residential School is out of order and that this condition was brought about by the incompetent management of the engineer. I might inform you that these batteries, with proper treatment, last approximately six years. The one in your school was installed in the spring of 1922.\n\nThe school management should take steps, without delay, to have the battery replaced or put in good condition, without expense to the Department. I am corresponding with the Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle, with reference to the services of the engineer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott (Signature)\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. W. Atwater,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No.121-1-5 dated September 19th, I beg to report as follows.\n\nThe table and seating accommodation in the dining hall at the Gordon School at the present time, by crowding, is limited to 95 pupils, and the extra tables and benches asked for were for the purpose of relieving this overcrowding and also to make room for the other eighteen children, so that all might take their meals at the one sitting.\n\nYesterday I visited the school in company with a local carpenter with the view to determining the most economical way to arrange more table and seating space, and we found that by cutting the old tables in halves and inserting a three foot length in the centre of three of the old tables, it would give the desired extra space, and new tables would not be required.\n\nThe old tables are only nine feet long and the Principal thought it would be necessary to build new tables each twelve feet in length in order to avoid weakening, but the carpenter states that he can arrange braces so that the extended tables will be as strong or even stronger than they are at present.\n\nExtensions can also be made to the old benches, and the total cost of the whole work would approximate thirty-five dollars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the providing of extra table accommodation and benches in the dining room at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say your suggestion that the present tables be cut in halves and a 3' length inserted in the centre is approved. It is noted that this will increase the present length of the tables to 12', and that they will be properly braced and will be as strong as at present. It is also noted that extensions can be made to the benches. We note that you estimate the total cost of the whole work will be approximately $35. You may arrange to have the alterations in the tables and benches carried out, and you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 3)\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham must have been misinformed concerning the battery of the lighting system in this school, as there is nothing the matter with it. It gives the highest test when fully charged and carries the lights satisfactorily.\n\nI have made complaints about the belting of the engine to a shaft, and dynamo to shaft, instead of direct belting from engine to dynamo. As it is, we get 5 h.p. only, from a 10 h.p. engine, and 2 gallons of oil where 1 gal. would do if proper connections were made.\n\nI applied, on the last occasion, through Ven. Archdeacon Knowles, Chairman of the Indian Committee, to have the proper change made, and he wrote me that the Commissioner would be up, accompanied by an expert, in a week or two. This was in June last.\n\nI found when I took charge in June 1922, that the man who was placed in charge of the school as caretaker by the Department during the previous winter, had allowed the battery to remain empty for some time, until the Indian Agent brought down an engineer to charge the battery. It is surprising that all of the cells were not ruined from remaining dis-\ncharged so long in winter. There was a slight deterioration, and one of them was seriously injured, but I had it removed, and have no complaint to make about the battery.\n\nWith best respects,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have made changes of this kind at other schools, and while it is hard to arrive at what the exact cost will be for doing the work, I would say that it would be in the neighborhood of $150.00.\n\nThe henhouse asked for in my letter has not been authorized. This institution is sadly in need of a henhouse, and if you can see your way clear to make a grant of $300.00 for this purpose I will be glad. You will understand that this school has never had any small outbuildings supplied. At the Old Sun's School on the Blackfoot Reserve we have erected outbuildings, and we are putting up outbuildings at all our new schools. Gordon's School is entitled to the same consideration as other schools and in fact it will be impossible for the school to function without proper outbuildings and the grant that I am asking for is a small one.\n\nWith reference to the kalsomining of the interior; this will be done by the members of the staff and the bigger boys. The school authorities are willing to do this and I would ask for a grant of $175.00 with which to purchase material. The season is well advanced and I would be glad to get this work cleaned up before winter sets in.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[signature]\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't General,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11 A of the 11th instant, with reference to repairs at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I have examined the files and I have learned that less than $100 has been expended for grading the road to the school. This leaves some funds available for improvements and you are authorized to expend approximately $150 in overhauling the lighting plant. You may also erect a henhouse at a cost of $300. In the purchase of materials and the engagement of labour, please be guided by the regulations. I note that you recommend a grant of $175 for materials for calimining the interior of the main building. This amount appears excessive and you should arrange to have the decorating done with as little cost as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSept. 23, 1925.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle urged the establishment, next year, of a principal's residence at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. He also intimated that in the near future it may be advisable to increase the accommodation by an addition at this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Venerable Archdeacon Knowles was in my office a day or two ago pressing to have a bungalow erected for the Principal of the Gordon's School. The Archdeacon informs me that the Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle was in Ottawa recently and took this matter up with the Department, and it was suggested that an amount be placed in the Estimates for this purpose, provided I would recommend same. I am of the opinion it would be in the interest of the school to have the Principal living in a separate residence, and I believe that if we do this we could find extra accommodation for pupils. It would be on this understanding that a cottage would be built, provided that the space now used by the Principal be converted into quarters for pupils, as you are aware this school is at its limit so far as capacity is concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Kindly advise me if you received such a letter and let me have a copy of same, as we have nothing on our files here to show that such a letter was sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

BRANDON,\nTRAVELLING NURSE, DATED JUNE 4th, ON HER VISIT TO THE\nGORDON INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe recreation rooms however are still a great source of concern as the floors are not smooth on the surface and it seems impossible not to have great clouds of dust arising when the children are playing even after the floors have been washed or swept.\n\nIf it be my privilege I should like to suggest that these floors be treated in some way so that the surface would be hard and smooth as then the washing of them frequently could easily be done.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that the glass in the basement windows facing the playgrounds at the Gordon School are very often broken by the children in playing ball. It has been suggested that these windows be covered with an iron net, and I should be glad to have your authority to have this done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that I have been advised on expert authority that the batteries in connection with the lighting plant at the Gordon Boarding School are worn out and will have to be renewed. This is a 56-cell battery. I am not prepared to give you the exact figure, but the Department will know pretty well what they should cost. I would ask for authority to have new batteries installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

You are authorized to purchase to the best advantage a new battery.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date, concerning the advisability of placing an iron netting over the basement windows of this school. You may make the arrangements for this improvement, but I shall be pleased if you will keep the cost at a minimum as our funds are extremely limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

At this time you state that I may arrange for the installation of a telephone if such can be done for an inconsiderable amount. I beg to inform you that I have not gone on with this work as yet but I have received prices from several telephone contractors and the best price I have received is $200.00 per mile and $35.00 extra for the telephone. The distance from the existing phone line to the school is three miles, but on the way there is a lake which will cause a deviation from the straight line, making the total distance 3\u00bd miles, so the telephone line will cost approximately $685.00.\n\nIf funds are available I should be glad to have your authority to go on with the construction of this line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It will take 2800 ft. of metal stripping to do this and will cost approximately $150.00.\n\nHe also points out that new grates are required for the furnace and a beam in the firebox which supports the grates.\n\nI would recommend that these expenditures be allowed if at all possible and that I be advised as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It is noted that it will be necessary to put on metal stripping to insure the comfort of the building during the winter, as the windows are very loose in the frames.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $150 in the purchase of the quantity of metal stripping required. You may also arrange to supply new grates for the furnace and a beam for the firebox which supports the grate.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The cost as explained in my letter of 5th August last would be about $685.00 and authority was tentatively given in Department letter of 16th June 1926 but I was subsequently informed that funds were not available.\n\nThis telephone is needed at this Institution which is eight miles from the nearest Village and I shall be glad if funds can now be provided for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, November 30, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 512-11A C.R. of the 24th instant, with reference to a telephone line for the residence at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I regret that there are no funds available for the purpose at the present time, but a note has been made in the Estimates in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask for another advance cheque in connection with the Principal's Residence at Gordon's School. I think $400.00 will be sufficient to pay the balance of the labour, freighting etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Gordon School: Principal's Residence.\n\nWith the carpenters and the electrician away all has now been done on the above that can be done until spring; with the exception one or two things which could have been done if I had caught the carpenters before they had left the job i.e. painting the water and soil pipes in the bath room, placing nickel plated floor rings on all pipes in bath room and finishing the white painted wood-work with one coat of white enamel. These items though can be attended to when the painters are on the job in the spring doing the outside painting, as of course none of this was done owing to weather conditions.\n\nThere is still a wooden seat to come for the fixture in the bath room.\n\nI believe it would have been better if arrangements had been made to cover the furnace and pipes with asbestos, although Canon Irwin states that he will not be using the basement for vegetable storage, the loss of heat in the basement is not necessary.\n\nNo storm sash were put on the front porch, and it will not be in use quite so long as it might be if these were on. At present no screens have been provided for doors and windows, but I suppose this will be a matter for consideration when the finishing up is being done in the Spring. I am enclosing diary sheet with my account, and trust that you will find same in order.\n\nI shall be pleased to give you any further information on request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nsgd. William Swan\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Mr. William Swan, Architect at Punnichy, with reference to the progress of the work on the Principal's residence at the Gordon's School in the Touchwood Agency, and enclose a voucher in his favour for $48.00 for services in connection therewith.\n\nIn regard to certain work yet to be done, the plumbers have sent forward a wooden seat for the fixture in the bathroom and will provide the nickel plated floor rings. There is some painting to be done also, which can be attended to when the outside of the building is painted in the spring. You will note the Architect's reference to the desirability of covering the furnace and pipes with asbestos, and the lack of storm sash on the front porch and of door and window screens. It would be as well perhaps, to follow the Architect's advice and provide the asbestos and I shall be glad to know what the Department's wishes are in regard to the storm sash for the front porch and screens for the doors and windows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| ARTICLES                        | North American Lumber Co. | Security Lumber Co. |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| FOR 6-room bungalow            |                           |                     |\n| Principal's residence          |                           |                     |\n| Gordon Reserve - Touchwood     |                           |                     |\n| Agency                         |                           |                     |\n| Building material - lumber     | $1672.00                  | $1757.80            |\n| etc.                           |                           |                     |\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDate: Dec. 24/36\n\nCity or town: Regina\n\nProvince: Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Abstract of Tenders herewith.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 121-1-5 dated July 31st, 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO. 312-11\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nED\nREGINA, SASK., Dec. 27th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on\nthe Gordon School inspected December 9th, during my\ninspection of the Touchwood Agency.\n\nThis school is under the management of\nthe Church of England with Rev. Canon Irwin as Principal.\nI found the entire building clean and tidy and all the\ndepartments being carried on with splendid discipline.\nThe dormitories were clean with plenty of fresh air, and\nno offensive odors of any kind. The beds were exception-\nally clean, with a white spread on each.\n\nThe laundry is very small and cramped.\nThe stove which supplies heat for the clothes dryer\nsmokes so badly that it cannot be used. The smoke gets\ninto the dryer and makes the clothes dark and smoky.\nThis must be due to some part being burned out or faulty\ndrafts and should not be an expensive matter to have\nfixed. There is also in the laundry a small soft water\ntank; this takes up considerable room and does not begin\nto supply even the staff with sufficient soft water.\nThe children number about 100 and with a staff of 8 to\n10, one can understand a lot of washing is necessary,\nall of which must be done with hard water. If there is\nno available room in the school for a large tank, I see\nno reason why a cement under-ground tank could not be\nbuilt just outside the school, in which the water from\nthe entire roof might be collected for use in washing\nand especially for bath purposes. This would be a\nwonderful help.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nwonderful help to the laundry matron, and by removing the tank now in the laundry, considerable more floor space would be added for carrying on the work of that department.\n\nThe senior class room, of which Miss Atwater is in charge, was tidy and well ventilated. The class work was good and the children in the various grades appeared to be well up in their respective grades. I feel that Miss Atwater is doing good work here.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Mr. John Meredith. He is a young man, and, a few minutes in the room was only necessary to see that this man could not handle the situation. He is leaving at the close of this term.\n\nThe staff consists of:\n\n| Position          | Name                  |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Principal         | Rev. Canon Irwin      |\n| Matron            | Miss Atwater          |\n| Sr. Teacher       | Miss Atwater          |\n| Jr. Teacher       | Mr. J. Meredith       |\n| Sewing Teacher    | Miss Wilkins          |\n|                   | Miss Howe - just left |\n| Kitchen Matron    | Miss Wood             |\n| Laundry Matron    | Miss Cunningham       |\n| Boy's Supervisor  | Mr. Parsons           |\n| Engineer          | Mr. Sworder           |\n| Farmer            | Mr. Rogers            |\n\nMiss Howe, one of the two sewing teachers, has just left, but the Principal is endeavouring to fill the vacancy. In addition to the above mentioned, a helper, an Indian, is kept to do work around the barns. All told, there are 11 on the staff and the Indian helper. This appears like a large staff for 100 pupils. As regards the lady members of the staff, I believe they are efficient and are doing good work.\n\nMr. Meredith has not made a success and is leaving. The Farmer, Mr. Rogers, from what I could learn, is not up to the mark and is handicapped because of deafness.\nof deafness. I told Rev. Canon Irwin that I felt he needed a good young man, preferably married, who would take hold of the situation and make a success of it. This, of course, would necessitate another home. He acknowledged Mr. Rogers did not fill the bill and he intended securing another man for Spring. The other man appear to understand their work and Mr. Sworder, the Engineer, keeps everything very tidy and in good repair.\n\nRev. Canon Irwin, the Principal, is a very energetic and hard working man. He is very determined and I believe has the success of the school at heart. Should he be successful in obtaining the proper teacher and Farming Instructor for the coming year, there is no reason why splendid work should not be accomplished under his direction.\n\nThe cattle barn is too small; at present it is necessary to use part of the pig barn to accommodate the young heifers and calves. Fourteen cows are kept in the cow barn and this only supplies milk for the school. The Principal would like this number doubled so that butter could also be made. However, to do this, more barn room will be needed and unless something can be done before another winter, the Rev. Canon Irwin will have to dispose of some of his young cattle, as it is impossible to winter dairy cattle outside. This line of farming I believe to be one of the most important and I would like to see barn room provided so that the natural increase may be cared for and the school herd enlarged.\n\nA new chicken house has been built but is of no use for this climate. There is only one ply of lumber on the walls and this has dried out, so that they are full of cracks. These walls should be covered with good\nwith good paper and sided up again to make them wind-proof. The front of this building has four windows, two above two. These windows should be lower down and put all across the front of the building so as to allow the sunlight to strike on the floor. Above these windows cotton is needed to allow plenty of fresh air. A cement floor, drop boards and lumber for nests would make this an up-to-date house and of some use. At present no poultry is kept.\n\nA machine shed is badly needed here. These are the boys we expect to be our farmers in the future, consequently, we should educate them to care for machinery and not leave it out in the weather as is done here. When this shed is built, we should bear in mind to build one large enough to cover all machinery necessary to run an institution such as this.\n\nThe horse barn is about 24' x 24' and in good repair. However, this barn is small and if any barns are built, this should be kept in mind so that sufficient room, both for horses and increase in cattle be provided for.\n\nAt the rear of the school are a number of small buildings which were in use at the time of the construction of the new school. These buildings are all used for various purposes, such as granaries and garage, nevertheless, they do not add to the appearance of the school and should be removed.\n\nThe new home built for the Principal was finished except for some painting, and would be ready to occupy at any time. This is a splendid home with a lovely large living room, fireplace, two bedrooms, a bathroom and an enclosed verandah. This should make a comfortable\ncomfortable and pleasant dwelling.\n\nThe children looked exceptionally healthy. They were well clothed and clean. The dinner provided for the children on the day of inspection was well cooked and ample for all. These children appeared very happy and carefree.\n\nWhile inspecting the school the Principal pointed out the necessity for a telephone in the school. I think he is quite right in his request. This school is about 8 miles from town and many trips could be avoided and a great deal of time saved by the installation of a phone. Of course, in case of sudden or severe sickness, its value could not be estimated.\n\nThe Principal complained about the water pipes in the school freezing. He claims the cold gets in around the window frames, especially when a hard wind blows and on the side where the wind strikes the water pipes will freeze in spite of the boilers being fired heavily. One side of the building will be hot, while on the windy side, the pipes will freeze. Several pipes were frozen and broke a few days before I inspected the school, but it seems hard to understand as the temperature would not be lower at that time than 20 below with a wind and if the boilers had been properly fired this should not have happened. I believe the window frames are poorly installed as one could feel quite a draft directly under the windows, even on the day of inspection when only a slight wind was blowing.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., December 30th, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection on the various schools in the Touchwood Agency, viz: Gordon Indian Boarding School, Day Star Indian Day School, and St. Mary's Day School, all under the auspices of the Church of England, and the Muscowequan Boarding School, situated on the Muscowequan Reserve, and under the auspices of the R.C. Church.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the laundry in the Gordon School. This laundry is undoubtedly too small for an institution of this kind. I have been in it several times and I came to this conclusion, but there appears to be no remedy for this without incurring a lot of expense. Regarding the stove smoking; it seems to me that the cause of this trouble could be found out by somebody on the ground. They have a practical Engineer in Mr. Sworder who knows his business, and who was Assistant Engineer in one of the large hotels in London up to three years ago, so he should be able to locate this. However, I am writing to the Principal to ascertain if they cannot get this fixed. To send a man from here would cost a lot of money, and I doubt if it is necessary. The soft water tank is very small, and is utterly inadequate to supply the demands for soft water in an institution of this size. I doubt if it would last for a week if used for washing. I may say, however, that the drainage from the large roof on this building would be sufficient to supply the soft water requirements for the school for months, if not for the year around. As it is now, the water runs down to the ground line and is spilt onto a concrete slab which they are having difficulty with, either by it heaving up in the wintertime and getting out of shape, or in summer having a wash underneath and spilling the water up against the foundation, which, of course, is a very bad arrangement. The question of putting in a tile drain to connect with these down-pipes is one that should receive consideration, what I would like to see is\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nto have an outside reservoir built near the laundry, and these down-pipes connected with it. If this were done it would not be necessary to put in the underground tile. Something will have to be done, and for an appropriation of $500.00 I think we could make a good job here, as well as supplying the school with a good quantity of soft water. You are aware that the water for this institution is secured from a small lake, and is not the very best for washing purposes. If the Department would consider placing an item of $500.00 in the Estimates for this purpose I will see that the work is carried out in the Spring.\n\nWith regard to the Junior classroom. I know it is the intention of the Principal to replace Mr. Meredith, and I am satisfied that this room will be in charge of a new teacher at the beginning of the term.\n\nOn my visit to the School last Spring I pointed out to the school authorities that the Farming Instructor was not the right type of man to carry on the necessary work, and advised them to get a new man. The Bishop of the Diocese and the School Committee have asked me to locate a man and I am trying to do so, but as yet have not been successful. It is difficult to get the right type of man.\n\nThe cattle barn at this school is too small, and an amount has been placed in the Estimates to provide additional accommodation. An item of $4000.00 has also been inserted in the Estimates to provide a residence for the Farming Instructor at the School, who should be a married man. With regard to the Inspector's remarks regarding the chicken house. The plan used for this building was one which was received from the University of Saskatchewan, and which we have used at all our schools where chicken houses have been erected during the past two years. The trouble seems to be that they have not adhered to the specifications in erecting this little building. One thickness of lumber is absolutely inadequate. Next Spring a second ply of lumber will be put on the inside and it will then be in accordance with specifications. An item has been placed in the Estimates also for a machine shed. The necessity for this is great. I think when the cattle barn is enlarged the horse barn will be sufficient for the school without making any further additions. The matter of the small buildings at the back of the school which were in use at the time of construction has been drawn to the attention of the Principal and he promised to have them removed in the Spring. I will see that this is done, as they are an eyesore.\nYou will note that the Inspector reports he found the children looking exceptionally healthy, and that they were well clothed and clean. I may say that this is the way I have found them at all times when visiting the school.\n\nThe question of a telephone for the Gordon School has been taken up with the Department from time to time, and last year I urged very strongly to have one installed. An amount has been placed in the Estimates to cover this and I hope it will be passed.\n\nWith reference to the remarks regarding the pipes in the school freezing. This is the first time we have had complaints of this nature, although the school has been in use four or five years. We have just passed through some of the worst weather we have ever experienced in this country, and I am of the opinion that the strong winds prevailing during the severe weather accounts for the freezing of the pipes. We may never hear of this again.\nOttawa, January 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI regret that your 312-11A C.R. of the 9th ultimo has been inadvertently overlooked. You may have the furnace and pipes of the principal's residence at the Gordon's Indian Residential School covered with asbestos and you may supply storm sash for the front porch and screens for the doors and windows where they are necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, January 7, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11 of the 30th ultimo, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools of the Touchwood agency. I note, with satisfaction, that the laundry stove is being attended to; that the henhouse will be properly completed and that the temporary buildings will be removed from the school site. I also note that steps are being taken to secure suitable incumbents for the positions of junior teacher and farm instructor. I note that an addition is required to the cow barn; that there should be a residence for the farmer; that an implement shed is needed and that it is advisable to supply an outside soft water reservoir.

Manager.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that a great deal of damage is being done by the roof water at the Gordon Indian Residential School. The down-pipes empty onto slabs at the ground level, and these slabs are continually shifting and allowing the water to work its way underneath and into the basement, causing the walls to crack, and steps should be taken to carry this water away from the school.\n\nAs you are aware, this school is sadly in need of water. We now have a report from the Provincial Health Department, saying that the water which is now being used at the school is not all that it should be, and it seems to me that the best thing we can do is to construct a large outside tank, which will hold all the roof water caused by the summer rainfall, which water could be used for domestic purposes. I would even go so far as to say that, if necessary, we should neglect other work that is contemplated, in order to get this done. I think this matter was brought to your attention either by letter, or verbally by myself when I was in Ottawa. If this tank is supplied it will serve the dual purpose of taking the roof water away from the foundations of the building, and providing water for use in the school. Great damage will be done if this matter is not attended to before the summer rainfall. The Principal was in the office today to remind me of this. It was brought to my attention while I was at the school last Fall and I asked him to remind me of it this Spring, when I would take it up with the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that the question of the water supply at the Gordon Indian Residential School is one that is giving us considerable trouble. This Spring the lake from which they have been obtaining their supply of water was low and the water became unfit for drinking purposes, and for the last two months they have been using chloride of lime to kill any bacteria that may be in the water.\n\nIt has been suggested by the health authorities that we put in a mechanical filter, and the name of the Canadian International Filter Company, of Toronto, has been mentioned as being able to supply this equipment. I should be glad if the Department would take the matter up with this Company and explain to them that the water which is being used is drawn from a lake through a sand filter into a pit, and from there is piped to the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 10th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your No. 312-11A C.E. of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the advisability of supplying a soft water reservoir at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. This work may now be undertaken provided that the cost will not be in excess of $500, which was the estimate in your No. 312-11 of December 30th last. In the purchase of materials and the engagement of labour, etc., please be guided by the instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's No. 1-1-5 of the 6th instant.\n\nI am also directed to acknowledge your No. 312-11A C.E. of the 28th ultimo, and to inform you that I am today corresponding with the Canadian International Filter Company, of Toronto, with a view to securing a suitable mechanical filter for the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 10th, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe Department wishes to secure a mechanical filter for the use of the Gordon's Indian Residential School at Punnichy, Sask. Water for domestic purposes at this institution is obtained from a lake through a sand filter into a pit and from there is pumped through a pipe line to the school. The consumption is that of 125 people and 40 head of stock. Please let me have some literature, with prices to this Department, for a filter which would be suitable. Certain seasons of the year the lake is so low that the water is unfit for drinking purposes unless properly treated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nCanadian International Filter Co.,\nToronto,\nOnt.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., May 10th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools inspected by me in the Touchwood Agency.\n\nGORDON RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was inspected on April 22nd, but as the class rooms were closed on account of the Easter holiday, I again visited the school on May 6th. I found the school clean and tidy throughout. The play-rooms were, of course, tracked with mud, but the yards were very muddy and tracking in mud was practically unavoidable. The dormitories were clean and the beds in good condition. All the wash basins and toilets were in good working order and clean.\n\nIn the various departments in the school the work appeared to be progressing well, and the discipline was good.\n\nMiss Atwater is in charge of the senior class room. The children range from Grade III to Grade VIII, with over 50 on the roll. They appeared well up in their grades and responded freely to questions submitted. I feel Miss Atwater is obtaining good results in the class-room work. The children were all clean and their clothing was in good condition.\n\nA new teacher has been obtained for the junior room, Mr. Sinclair. This is a young man just out of Normal, but although he has only been in the school since the\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nGordon Residential School (Cont'd)\n\nsince the new year, considerable change is noticeable. The discipline is greatly improved and the children are much more responsive. There are at present 45 on the roll, but the attendance has been greatly interfered with of late, due to Whooping Cough. Mr. Sinclair is very interested in his work and I believe will get results. The room was clean and well ventilated.\n\nThe laundry, as stated in my last report, is very small. No soft water is available for washing as the cistern now in use has only capacity for a few barrels at the most. A large cistern is necessary for the needs of such a school.\n\nIn the boys' playroom I found several places where the plaster was knocked off the walls. This was done throughout the winter months when the boys used this room in playing various kinds of hand ball. It seems useless to patch these broken places if the same games are to be played next season. If we are to allow the children to have a playroom, it appears as though we should make the walls of some material that will withstand a certain amount of rough usage.\n\nThe outbuildings are all in good repair. The structure, in use as a repair shop and store room, needs painting outside very badly. This building stands just behind the school and if painted would improve appearances very much.\n\nThe new house built for the Rev. Principal has not yet been painted outside. He is now having the house and it is indeed very comfortable.\n\nA new Farming Instructor, Mr. Headrick, has also been employed. He is a young man about 38 yrs. of age, married, with one child. Apparently he understands farming.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 4)\nGordon Residential School (Cont'd)\n\nstands farming well and certainly is desirous of making a success. However, he has hardly been there long enough as yet for me to express an opinion either on his work or the management of the boys. At present there is no residence for the Farming Instructor, so his wife is unable to be with him. However, he is anxiously looking forward to having one, as it was with this understanding he accepted the position.\n\nAs mentioned in my last report, more barn room will be badly needed before another winter. At present the horse barn is very small. An implement shed is also needed, and should be fairly large as considerable machinery is necessary in operating such a farm.\n\nThe work on the land had just nicely started, but with a couple of weeks of good weather, no difficulty should be experienced in seeding the land under cultivation.\n\nI have no doubt, with the staff now under the direction of the Rev. Canon Irwin, that good progress will be made at this school. The children were all well clothed, clean, and appeared very happy and carefree.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., May 14th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Touchwood Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Inspector Hamilton last week.\n\nRegarding Gordon's Residential School, you will note what the Inspector says regarding the condition of the plaster on the walls of the boys' playroom. It seems to me that these walls should be wainscoted up about six feet and painted, and the same in the girls' playroom. This would not cost very much.\n\nWith regard to the paint required for the outbuildings, this work can be done at any time that we have funds available. I should like to have $250.00 to provide for the painting of the new Principal's residence which was completed late last Fall.\n\nRegarding the residence for the Farming Instructor, an amount for this purpose was placed in the estimates but I have not been advised as yet as to whether it has been allowed. It is very necessary that this be provided, and also that the amount asked for for the purpose of enlarging the barn and erecting certain other outbuildings be allowed.\n\nMuscowequan\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMuscoweguan School\n\nI understand it is not the intention of the Department to proceed with the addition to this school at the present time.\n\nI do not know that the Department should be called upon to supply new furnace grates. It seems to me that this should be a matter for the school to look after.\n\nDay Star\n\nI should like to see a new day school built on the Day Star reserve. The present building is not in fit shape to carry on the work in for another year and something should be done.\n\nSt. Mary's Day School\n\nWith regard to the eavetroughing connections which are necessary, it seems to me that this is a trifling matter and that Mr. Lawes should have attended to it. I can scarcely believe that a man would let a situation of this kind exist indefinitely without having it remedied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMay 21, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 312-11 of the 14th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools in the Touchwood agency.\n\nYou may arrange to have wainscoting provided for the walls of the playrooms at the Gordon's Indian Residential School and you may also expend the sum of $250 for painting the principal's residence. If any saving can be effected in the painting, by having the school management provide most of the labour, you should see that this is done, as this building has already cost over $5,000.\n\nI regret that there are no funds for the purpose of enlarging the barn or erecting a residence for the farm instructor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 1, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your 312-11A C.E. of April 28th, last, and your telegram of the 13th ultimo, relative to the suggestion of the health authorities that a mechanical filter be installed to filter the water supply at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. The Department communicated with the Canadian International Filter Co., of Toronto, as requested by you; but no reply has been received. We are now writing to other companies as well in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI write to advise you that this afternoon the Reverend Canon Irwin called at the office, asking whether any appropriation had been allowed for the purpose of enlarging the barn and erecting a residence for the Farming Instructor at the Gordon's School, and was disappointed to hear that the Department had advised me no funds were available. He pointed out that they are desirous of enlarging the scope of their farming operations and have eleven horses but only accommodation for eight. I may point out too, that they have to haul all the school supplies a distance of six or seven miles and several horses are thus constantly engaged. It is also the intention of the School authorities to increase their dairy herd and the present stable accommodates only ten cows. If, therefore, they raise any more animals, there would be no stabling room for them.\n\nThe Canon also pointed out that he has a good married man as a Farming Instructor and it is more desirable to employ a married man than a single. There are no married quarters, however, and the present Instructor's wife, therefore, cannot live with her husband. Quarters ought to be provided, therefore, if we are to avoid the alternative of engaging a single man. I shall be glad to know if the question of providing funds could be reconsidered as the efforts of the School authorities deserve encouragement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 22, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A C.E. of the 13th instant, with reference to the advisability of enlarging the barn and erecting a residence for the farmer at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. This matter has been given careful consideration, but I regret that it will not be possible to provide funds for the purpose at this time. A note is being made for next year's Estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIf the Department have any money to spare under the School Vote, I would once again strongly urge that a residence be built for the Farming Instruction at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. This school is in far more need of additional outbuildings than any other residential school that I know of. The stables are small and inadequate to house a sufficient number of cows and the horse stable is very small. The Farming Instructor was brought from the east on the understanding that he would be given a residence. The man has arrived and he is a good man, and now we will be called upon to tell him that he will not be able to bring his wife to live with him this winter. A married instructor is necessary at this place, and I do hope that the Department will scrape up $2500.00 to meet this request as this school is deserving of some consideration.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFiltration\n\nEarly Methods:\nHistory shows that there has always been a desire for clean clear water, at least for drinking purposes. The ancients often went to considerable lengths to obtain their water supply from unpolluted springs or water sheds, sometimes at a considerable distance from the town. Roman aqueducts carried large quantities of water, the least best for general purposes, the next best for the fountains and washing troughs and the very best exclusively for drinking purposes.\n\nWhere turbid waters were used for drinking water, there is record that porous sandstone and earthenware filters were used by the ancient Egyptians and also by the Romans. There was also a method of clarifying or turbid water by syphoning the liquid from one vessel to another by the capillary action of porous material such as a skin of wool.\n\nSlow Sand Filters:\nThe practical application of filtration techniques in public supplies probably dates from about 1800. Records show that in about 1810 slow sand filters were installed in Scotland and that in 1829 the Metropolitan Water Board companies installed the first sand filter of this type. The eventual adoption of this system for all of the London water supply, and its use in English cities, led to its being called \"The English system\" as its use spread throughout Europe.\n\nSlow sand filters are still used to a considerable extent in Europe and also in a number of localities in North America. These filters generally consist of a number of beds of sand varying in size from one-quarter to five acres, usually rectangular in shape, and the slope of the supporting structure is lower than 32 degrees. The fine filter sand is superimposed on three or more layers of graded gravel and is protected by a layer of underdrain either of brick or tile. Each bed is provided with suitable piping to control the influent, effluent, etc.\n\nSome waters may be put onto slow sand filters without any preliminary treatment in the great majority of cases; preliminary settling, sedimentation and sometimes coagulation are used to prepare the water for the filters.\n\nWith the slow sand filters an immense surface filtering area is necessary because to obtain the desired result the rate of filtration should not exceed about 50,000 gallons per acre per day\u2014although in some plants the rate is kept half that amount or even less. As the sand used is of rather small grain size and the rate of flow very slow, the filter in itself acts as a clarifier removing all settleable suspended matter. However, with the slow sand filter the surface of the sand bed provides a vast and great number of surfaces to grow and develop. These form an adherent mass that holds back and collects the bacterial and organic impurities. This layer of film (sometimes referred to as the \"schmutzdecke\") is the active part of the bed and until it has been formed the efficiency of the filter is very low. To \"ripen\" the filter bed, the slow sand filter is started at about one-tenth of its normal load and then increased gradually so that not until three or four days later is the filter operated at its normal capacity.\n\nDependent upon the character of the raw water, whether or not it has been given preliminary treatment, rate of flow, and the maximum load of head allowable, etc., the slow sand filter will deliver anywhere from 50,000,000 to 400,000,000 gallons per acre of filter area before cleaning is necessary.\n\nThe slow sand filter is cleaned by scraping off the accumulated film of one inch or two of sand from the surface of the bed, the sand being washed and either returned back on the bed immediately or stored in the storage tank and replaced after several scrapings and cleanings.\n\nSlow sand filters are limited in use to small districts with low turbidity and where sufficient ground area is available to provide for the immense filter beds and settling basins.\n\nRapid Sand Filters:\nThe first rapid sand or \"mechanical\" filters were built in the United States during the early 80's. They were installed by the paper industry to solve the problem of removing large volumes of waste and removing the coarser particles of suspended matter that were spoiling their product.\n\nThese early filters consisted of cylindrical tanks provided with a simple underdrain underdrain system, a bed of gravel and sand, both water through gravity and pumping. They were not capable of removing the finer or colloidal suspended matter and had but little effect on removing turbidity. However, they readily served their purpose and represented an immense saving therefore because of savings in first cost and space requirements.\n\nRapid sand filters differ from slow sand filters not only in the rate of flow through the sand bed but also in design, construction and operation. The smaller area of the filter bed, and consequently its much rapid drainage requirements for wash and automatic cleaning. The methods used to quickly wash the sand gave rise to the term \"quick wash\" or \"rapid wash.\" The high rate of filtration (125,000,000 gallons per acre per day\u2014even more) makes it possible to maintain and operate uniform filter sand\u2014as well as the formation of an \"artificial mat\" on top the sand bed.\n\nWhen the introduction of coagulated coagulant is added together the fine suspended matter and to form this artificial mat gave such surprising results it immediately stimulated mechanical improvements. As a result of continual research and improvement the efficiency of the rapid sand filter has steadily increased until today it is the predominating type of filter throughout the world.\n\nThese mechanical features in the modern filter might be grouped under the following classifications:\n\nProper coagulation.\nEfficient underdrain systems.\nStandardization of sizes and depth of the supporting gravel and filter sand.\nProper size water piping and troughs.\nStandardization of rates of filtration and backwash.\nSize and arrangement of control piping.\nUse of automatic rate controllers, gauges, etc.\n\nTo meet all these and other conditions, the modern rapid sand filter bears but little resemblance to its forerunner, the slow sand filter.\n\nUpon adding the coagulant to a turbid water the sludge is immediately flocculated and the finely divided suspended matter quickly settles to the graveled \"floor\" that settle rapidly\u2014leaving the water fairly clear.\n\nCoagulation:\nTo operate a rapid sand filter more than a strong coagulant is necessary to use a coagulant to provide an efficient mat on the surface of the filter bed\u2014instead of the slowly accumulated organic slime or \"schmutzdecke\" of the slow sand filter.\n\nAnd\u2014if the water is very turbid\u2014the coagulant must be added and sedimentation provided before the water goes to the filter, so as to remove the bulk of the suspended matter outside the filter, otherwise too frequent washing will be necessary.\n\nThe common coagulant is alum. Lumps of alum or potash alum in use in pressure coagulant feeders and aluminium sulphate (sometimes termed \"alum\") when the coagulant is mixed up and fed as a solution.\n\nPractically all waters are alkaline and this natural alkalinity\u2014calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonates decomposes alum with the result heavy white flocculent precipitate of aluminum hydrate. If the water is not naturally alkaline\u2014or its natural alkalinity has been exhausted\u2014by the addition of lime and/or soda ash (in swimming pool filter systems) artificial alkalinity is added in the form of soda ash or lime mixed in the form of sal-soda if a pressure coagulant feeder is used.\n\nThe action of the insoluble gelatinous sticky aluminum hydrate can be compared to that of the white of egg in clearing coffee. It entangles all the suspended matter throughout the sand and gathers the finer particles into flocs that can be readily settled, or which are caught on the filter sand, being too large to pass through the spaces between the grains. The coagulant forms a gelatinous mat on the surface of, and in the\nupper part of the filter sand, constituting the real filtering medium.\n\nDuring coagulation, the originally retent or cloudy water undergoes a complete change in appearance, for in place of the murkiness the impurities become coarse grains and flocculent. With them the surrounding water also falls clear. It is then a comparatively simple matter to filter the water.\n\nUnderdrain Systems:\n\nThe underdrain system of a rapid sand filter serves a twofold important purpose\u2014uniformly distribute the wash water during washing and to collect the filtered water without loss of sand. The underdrain actually consists of the gravel layers and the distributing manifold system.\n\nAside from supporting the sand bed\u2014the gravel layers\u2014its function is to distribute the wash water and many cases of faulty filter operation can be traced to improperly graded, poor quality gravel layers or grading systems.\n\nTo uniformly collect the filtered water\u2014but more important\u2014to uniformly supply the wash water to the undersides of the gravel layers for purpose of the distributing manifold. The systems in common use are:\n\nA pipe manifold system with bronze \"strain- ers\" or orifice nozzles screwed into the tops of the lateral pipes and laterals.\n\nA pipe manifold system with the pipes perforated on the underside in either single or double rows.\n\nThe \"Wagner Bottom\"\u2014distributing pipes with bronze plates interspaced by slotted perforated concrete blocks.\n\nConcrete \"hill and valley\" with perforated bronze plate or perforated pipe in bottom of valley.\n\nThe \"Wheelbar Bottom\" with balls geometrically placed in pyramidal hoppers.\n\n\"Strainers\" or orifice nozzles in false metal or concrete bottoms.\n\nGravel Layers:\n\nIn order to properly support the filter sand, the gravel grains must be small enough at the top layer, and to diffuse the wash water\u2014must be fairly large at the lowest layer\u2014therefore on top must be finer than below. Each grading must be of fairly uniform size and practically free from flat pieces. The gradation must be such that no small pebbles from falling through lower layers.\n\nModern practice calls for as many as five and sometimes of three gradations ranging in size from \\(2\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches at the bottom to \\(1\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch diameter at the top.\n\nFilter Sand:\n\nSilica sand, which was the first material used, is still the accepted filtering medium of today. Creede quartz, crushed granite, china clay, and screened anthracite coal have also been used\u2014but usually to take care of some special conditions. Porous filter materials are to be avoided as they cannot be washed clean and are breeding places for bacterial growth.\n\nWhereas little attention was formerly paid to the quality and uniformity of filter sand, experience has proven that for proper results definite standards must be laid down and this filtering medium must pass rigid tests and specifications.\n\nSand performs its function as a filtering medium through its ability to hold back the coagulum or floe containing the suspended and colloidal impurities in the water. Theoretically, the sand should perform this filtering duty, and it is assumed in practice that none of the coagulum penetrates beyond a depth of six inches. In practice, however, continuous tests provide a depth of sand of from 18 to 24 inches in industrial filters, to as much as 30 inches in municipal plants. The latter extreme has not been required by the dictates of some boards of health or the individual practice of some engineers.\n\nThe sand bed must be so graded as to be easily channelled or broken through during filtering and yet not so dense as to offer unnecessary resistance to the flow of water.\n\nSuitability of a sand as a filtering medium depends upon its chemical character, freedom from impurities, degree of uniformity of size, and its uniformity. Unless it is of uniform size the smaller grains will pack in the voids between the larger grains and present resistance to the flow of water. Well rounded grains are considered preferable to sharp grains because the former do not pack so readily and clean much better.\n\nTwo measures are used to draw a fairly accurate picture of the size and grading of filter sand. These two measurements are the Effective Size and Uniformity Coefficient.\n\nBy \"Effective Size\" is meant the size of the sand grains\u2014usually expressed in weight fractions\u2014of sand finer than which 10% by weight of the sand is finer and 90% coarser. Thus the \"Effective Size\" is the minimum size of the great bulk of the sand grains but it does not indicate either the limits of coarseness or the degree of variation in the size of the particles.\n\nTherefore, in order to assure that the variation is not too great a second measurement of the sand is necessary. This is the size of sand grains than which 60% by weight of the sand is finer and 40% coarser. This size is determined by the \"Uniformity Coefficient\" and is called the \"Uniformity Coefficient.\"\n\nFor example, if a screen analysis showed that 10% of a sand was finer than 0.40 millimeter, and 60% was finer than 0.64 millimeter\u2014the \"Effective Size\" would be 0.40 mm., and the Uniformity Coefficient would be 0.64 divided by 0.40 or 1.6. Obviously, the more uniform the sand, the more nearly will be the \"Effective Size\" which 10% finer and than which 60% is finer\u2014or the closer will be the \"Uniformity Coefficient\" to 1.0.\n\nThe most desirable \"Effective Size\" and \"Uniformity Coefficient\" depend upon the conditions of filter operation and the quality of filter sand desired. Modern practice calls for at least two gradings of filter sand. International filters are equipped with a sand of Effective Size of from 0.35 to 0.55 mm.\u2014as conditions warrant\u2014and a \"Uniformity Coefficient\" of from 1.0 to 1.6.\n\nWhen a filter is washed, the entire sand bed rises and grades itself\u2014the finest particles on top grading down to the coarsest at the bottom\u2014thus such sand automatically produces the several size condition that is most desired.\n\nChemical Requirements:\n\nThe filter bed must be insoluble in water and the usual specification for filter sand and gravel is that it shall not lose more than \\(1/5\\) of its weight when heated with hydrochloric acid solution for 24 hours. This is principally to insure the absence of limestone, which, on account of its relative softness and appreciable solubility, would not stand up under agitation during washing.\nRates of Filtration:\n\nThe maximum rate of filtration depends upon the required quality of filtered water, the character and quantity of the filter sand and the character of the water to be filtered. Water can be forced through a pressure filter at enormous rates if sufficient pressure is applied but the water will become extremely turbid at excessive rates the water will hardly be \"strained,\" the coagulant will be washed down into the sand and the sand bed ultimately clogged.\n\nFor efficient operation and proper quality of effluent, the rate of filtration should be carefully controlled against fluctuations in load. Standard practice has set a rate of from two to three gallons per minute per sq. ft. of filter area as a minimum. Higher rates or higher rates may be required or allowable under special conditions.\n\nThe approved specifications for pressure water filters as approved by the American Waterworks Association and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers give the following rates of filtration as standards:\n\nWhenever the water is to be used for domestic purposes or for stock, full flow rates of the capacity of the filter based on a rate of filtration not to exceed 2 gallons per minute per sq. ft. of filtering area and a coagulant must be used.\n\nRates of filtration for various uses should conform to the following schedule:\n\n- 2 gals. per sq. ft. per minute for all supplies used for drinking, or for the preparation of food products.\n- 2 to 4 gals. per sq. ft. per minute when filtering a treated municipal supply of approved bacterial purity.\n- 6 to 8 gals. per sq. ft. per minute for swimming pools and for all industrial uses.\n- 2 to 5 gals. per sq. ft. per minute as conditions require for rapid filtration using sand followed by charcoal where reduction of color, odor, taste or certain forms of iron is desired. This method of filtration is not to be applied for bacterial purification.\n\nWashing:\n\nProvision for proper washing of the sand bed is equally as important as the design of the filter. The filter retains what is removed from the water and will continue to work satisfactorily only so long as it is properly washed. A filter cannot run until the sand bed is allowed loss of head is reached\u2014or until the desired rate can no longer be maintained. Therefore, at regular intervals the filter must be shut out of service, the waste valve opened and water\u2014preferably filter wash water\u2014allowed to the unfiltered system at a rate sufficient to expose or float the sand bed, to scrub or scour the sand and wash out any accumulated impurities.\n\nFrom three to eight minutes washing are required to clean the sand bed\u2014with six minutes an average time. From one to five per cent of the total filter filtrate is the normal volume of wash water used\u2014with three per cent an average.\n\nPressure Filters:\n\nThe use of pressure filters is as old as the practice of sand filtration. The term \"pressure\" is used to designate that type of rapid sand filter wherein the filter is placed in a closed tank or vessel in which the water passes under pressure. This does not mean that high pressure is required to pass the water through the sand bed; it merely indicates that pressure consumed is not more than five pounds at its maximum, with a minimum of about one pound directly across the filter's washer.\n\nIn comparison with gravity or open rapid sand filters, the pressure type offers certain advantages. Any connection may be made in any pressure line without loss of pressure for water distribution excepting the connection to the filter tank mentioned above. Remounting of the water after being filtered is not required. They may be quickly installed in any location and easily fit into some available space. Settling basins and clear water storage can frequently be eliminated. Less precision in operation is demanded. The first cost is lower.\nINTERNATIONAL PRESSURE FILTERS\n\nTypes and Sizes:\nInternational Pressure Filters such as are shown in the accompanying illustration come in both vertical and horizontal types. The vertical type International Filters range in size from 16 inches to 96 inches diameter. These sizes are used for homes, schools, hospitals, residences, apartment buildings and general industrial purposes. They may be used singly, in groups or in series. In the case of greater capacity the International Horizontal Pressure Filters are used. The horizontal type are built in two diameters\u20143 feet and 8 feet\u2014and range in length from 8 to 25 feet.\n\nInternational Filters of Other Types:\nInternational Filters of the gravity or open type are described in another part of this book. This type has the filter bed of either wood or concrete and has many advantages for certain conditions of operation, but of course, is not constructed to operate under pressure as the type shown herein.\n\nSedimentation:\nWhile comparatively few waters require sedimentation in connection with International Pressure Filters, it can be accomplished easily with very small filters. The purposes of preliminary sedimentation are to allow suspended and coagulated matter to settle, to provide time for the floe to grow, and to relieve filters of a large amount of work (at least 80 percent), thereby reducing the washing of filters to a minimum.\n\nCoagulation:\nCoagulation and filtration are very intimately related in the art of water purification. The use of a coagulant in connection with the pressure filter is essential if it is desired to remove all suspended matter visible to the naked eye. The spaces between the sand grains of the filter bed are sufficiently large to allow the finer particles to pass through the filter. In order to retain all the suspended matter on the filter bed it is necessary that the particles be brought together into comparatively large particles. This is accomplished by introducing a coagulant, alum, by means of the coagulant feeder. The small amount of alum fed into the water is extremely important and determined by the alkalinity naturally present in the water and which may be added. The chemical reaction which takes place reduces hydrate of alumina to heavy, solid gelatinous precipitate. At the same time the electrolytic force set free induces the finer particles to gather together in floes, each of which becomes enveloped in the sticky hydrate of alumina.\n\nInternational Gravity Coagulant Feeder:\nAn automatic pressure coagulant feeder is furnished with each International Pressure Filter. The feeder is attached to the filter inlet, a special proportioner being placed in the water line. This proportioner automatically bypasses a small percentage of the incoming water through the feeder, in this way the coagulant is dissolved, automatically fed and mixed with the water entering the filter bed.\n\nThe International Pressure Coagulant Feeders are of the quick opening design for convenience in recharging. The feeder is constructed from cast iron, brass fittings and bronze shut off and needle regulating valves. The operator increases or decreases the amount of coagulant fed by adjusting the regulating valve on the feeder. Only Lump Alum (not Aluminum Sulphate) should be used.\n\nArtificial Alkalinity:\nWhen the filter is to be used in connection with circulating and chlorinated water for swimming pools, an extra feeder should be used. Redfiltration of the water finally exhausts the natural alkalinity of the water and unless artificial alkalinity in the form of soda ash is supplied, the coagulant floc is not formed and free alum will pass through the filter. For such work where there is no natural alkalinity, the use of two feeders, one for alum and one for soda ash, is to be recommended.\nInternational Filter Shell:\n\nInternational Filter Shells are substantially constructed of the best materials available. The standard design is suitable for all ordinary pressures up to 67 pounds per sq. in. Filters for higher pressures are furnished an extra charge being made for the stronger materials used. The shells are built of steel, the seams firmly hot riveted and well caulked. The heads are cast iron and of the standard maximum size. Every shell is tested under a hydrostatic internal pressure from five to ten gallons per square inch working pressure at which it is designed. Manholes and handholes for easy access to the interior are provided as needed.\n\nInternational Distributing Manifold System:\n\nThe only practical distributing manifold for use with pressure filters is the one manifold consisting of a main pipe with distributing lateral pipes. The size of the pressure filter units and the steel tank construction do not readily permit distributing systems such as the Wagner precast concrete block bottoms.\n\nFalse bottoms of steel plate unless fitted with special rubber gaskets pull up or settle, so that it is impossible to keep orifice nozzles or \"strainers\" from working loose and blowing out during washings. When properly perforated in place of using strainers, the upward jet action during washing will displace the gravel layer.\n\nTo provide perfect collection of filtered water and uniform distribution of wash water from all points directly under the surface of the filter bed the International manifold of the pipe mainfold type. The header pipe is oversized and the lateral pipes, spaced not less than 6 inches center to center, are of a size larger than the cross area of the filter. The orifice nozzles reach lateral. To meet certain conditions, the manifold system may be of the perforated lateral type, where the pipes are spaced wider center to center, are made in the underside of the lateral pipes and the jets are set flush to the concrete floor of the filter. Jet action is created by the water striking the concrete floor and diffusing between the gravel layer and passing upward through the gravel layers.\n\nThe standard manifold system on International general purpose pressure filters is of the pipe mainfold type with International Umbrella Type Tobin Bronze Distributing nozzles. Header and lateral pipes are oversized and the jets are spaced not less than 6 inches center to center. The jets are screwed into the top of the lateral. The correct sub-fill of the filter is brought up to imbed the lateral system and provide a smooth floor under the gravel.\n\nFilter Bed:\n\nThe required filter sand and gravel is furnished separately for each filter, shipped separately ready to put in place when the filter is installed. The gravel is specially selected, washed clean, and of proper size and uniformity. The sand is medium uniformly washed silica filter sand of effective size and uniformity in accordance with the standards of modern filter practice.\n\nInternational Tobin Bronze Distributing Nozzle:\n\nThe International Umbrella Distributing Nozzle was developed as a true strainer that would accomplish every required result\u2014to stand abuse and wear under all operating conditions\u2014and to eliminate the common faults of ordinary \"strainers.\"\n\nIt is made in but two pieces\u2014the body and the cap\u2014both parts of genuine Tobin bronze. The body is a drop forging of solid bronze and rivets are an integral part of the body\u2014and of real riveting metal. The cap is of one piece, scientifically shaped with a central deflecting cone and umbrella edge\u2014both perfectly formed (or efficient distribution) and rivets are spun (not hammered) to assure a perfect joint between cap and body. The throat accurately bored to exact diameter prevents the edge to insure easy influx. The shank is accurately threaded 3/8 inch pipe thread by automatic dies. The cap is a separate part and easily permits the use of a standard wrench for installation.\n\nThe term \"strainer\" to describe this part of the underdrain system is now a misnomer. Before it was learned that proper grading and correct grading of gravel was necessary to keep the sand layer in its proper place\u2014many forms of actual sand strainers were used\u2014and many are still being offered today. With correct gravel grading and the distributing manifold system of efficient design and construction, there will be no possibility of upsetting the gravel layer allowing sand and gravel bottom of the filter. The purpose of the \"strainer\" of today is not to stop the passage of sand\u2014but is that of providing distribution of wash water under the entire bottom of the gravel layer.\n\nA few of the principal advantages of the International Umbrella Type Nozzle are:\n\nIt has but one inside edge\u2014which will not clog or become incrust\u2014strainers with multiple orifices tend to invariably clog within a comparatively short time.\n\nIt provides perfect diffusion by the cone-umbrella cap, distributing the wash water in all directions with practically \"no away,\" yet extremely low friction loss and assuring complete diffusion throughout the gravel layer and the gravel layers. Multiple orifice strainers produce a jet action, either upward or partly upward into the gravel layer, and produce a limited number of jets\u2014which puts the responsibility of diffusion on a smaller part of the gravel bed and makes distribution less reliable achieved.\n\nBeing constructed entirely of Tobin bronze it is far superior in its resistance to corrosion than other strainers made of any other \"acid bronze.\"\n\nThe barrel and its rivets\u2014being a forging\u2014is more homogeneous and smoother than the variable cast base of ordinary strainers\u2014and the rivets are much more uniform and ductile. The rivets being an integral part of the forging will never work loose.\nOperation:\n\nWater enters the International Filter through the top and flows uniformly over the filter bed by a baffle, which prevents the incoming water directly striking the sand bed and disturbing the surface film. The water passes downward through the filter and upward the clean filtered water uniformly collected from beneath the gravel by the manifold system, throughout the passage of the filter outlet.\n\nTo remove the collected sediment or suspended matter, the filter is periodically cleaned by reversing the flow of water. Wash water enters at the bottom, is first distributed by the manifold system, further distributed by the umbrella distributor, and finally distributed over the gravel layers. As the water rises the filter bed expands and is loosened, the sediment lifting and passing out to waste with the wash water.\n\nInternational Filter Control:\n\nAll immediate pipes, valves and fittings necessary for operation of filters are furnished with each filter. Standard gate valves are used to assure perfect reliability and uniform efficiency\u2014as single control multi-port plug valves, although cheaper, will leak sooner or later and permit unfiltered water to bypass the filter. Valves four inches and larger in size of the screwed pattern flanged valves being used on larger sizes.\n\nInternational Filter Battery:\n\nWhere it is desirable to provide for continuous service, the advantage of having storage is obvious. But if storage to tide over the brief washing periods cannot be provided conveniently, a battery of two or more International Filters should be installed. Only one filter of a battery is washed at a time and a complete shut-off of the filtered water supply is thereby prevented.\n\nAnother advantage of having filtered water storage is that the filters may be washed with filtered water and thus be always available and continuously ready. The battery of three or more International Filters provides for washing with filtered water during normal storage. Any filter of a battery of three or more filters can be washed with filtered water from the others, by slightly increasing their normal rate of filtration during such washing period.\n\nRate of Flow Controller:\n\nAlthough not furnished as standard equipment, pressure filters of all types and makes should be provided with automatic rate of flow controllers, especially if partial bacterial purification is expected or the water is to be used for domestic supply\u2014and for the better general operation of the filter plant. It is evidently a gravity filter installation that is made without rate of flow control and underloading of a pressure filter is so much more possible that there is even greater reason for automatic control.\n\nDepending upon the piping arrangement, the rate of flow controller is placed in either the inlet or outlet line of the filter. The International Rate of Flow Controller is of the Venturi type, the differential head automatically controlling the movement of the mercury device so that the filter cannot deliver a greater amount of water than that determined by the setting on the controller. With other filter equipment, controllers are built handling its proper share of the load, whereas a clean filter of a battery of filters will always deliver twice as much or three times the pressure until the other filters have been cleaned.\n\nMany modern filter plants are providing International Type P Rate of Flow Controllers to assure the proper amount of water during backwashing.\n\nThese controllers may be provided with International Rate of Flow Gauges, either indicating or recording. Both the controllers and gauges are the subject of a separate bulletin.\nInternational Pressure Filters are providing clean clear water wherever water is being used. The best and most complete equipment is providing many municipalities with water meeting all sanitary and esthetic requirements. Industrial plants throughout the country and textile trades filter their entire supply and assure themselves of a perfect product. Public Institutions, hospitals, etc., find that filtration of the general supply results in much economy and much satisfaction. Office buildings, hotels, and apartment buildings require the best quality of filtered water to meet the high standards of their tenants. Even the better restaurants should have clear sparkling water available at all times for all purposes. Crystal clear water which will not discolor or spot the clothes is an essential to the laundries. Many large food stores and food product plants find that International Pressure Filters are not only a necessity but a profitable asset as well as a decided advertisement.\n\nInternational Pressure Filters are supplying the most inviting sparkling clear water for swimming pools of the finest type. Whether the installation is a small outdoor or an indoor installation there is an International Filter Plant of proper size to meet every requirement.\n\nThe continuous circulation and refiltration method is to be recommended. A circulating pump draws water from the deep end of the pool, passes it through the International Filter and then after cleansing and sterilizing returns it to the shallow end of the pool.\n\nAlthough dependent upon the size of the pool, the rate of flow (and size of filter) should be sufficient to refilter the full volume of the pool once in ten or twelve hours. With such continuous circulation and the natural sterilization\u2014the water in the pool can be made to comply with the most stringent sanitary requirements\u2014remaining crystal clear and clean for weeks and months\u2014adding only such fresh water needed to make up losses from splashing, cleaning, evaporation, etc., through the filter.\n\nSeveral bulletins are available covering the special application of International Pressure Filter for swimming pools, care and operation of pools, etc.\n\nFilter is designed primarily for putting the \"finishing touch\" of filtration on water that is already comparatively clean. From the esthetic standpoint it has been found advantageous to refilter even apparently clean water and remove every trace of suspended matter.\n\nWhen the water is to be used for fine manufacturing purposes\u2014such as photographic developers, boiler feed, and cosmetic laboratories, etc.\u2014even traces of foreign matter affect the finished product, lowering the quality and making the combination of International Pressure and Disk Filter an economic advantage.\n\nWhere filtration of the entire supply is not possible or not necessary, International Pressure Filters are usually installed to provide crystal clear water for drinking purposes. Restaurants, taverns, ice cream shops, hotels, and office buildings endeavor to make their drinking water most inviting and pure. The combination of International Pressure Filter and International Disk Filter has become standard practice. The latter uses as a filter medium, disks of compressed cotton fibre which are inexpensive and discarded when clogged and replaced with fresh ones. The Disk Filter is designed primarily for putting the \"finishing touch\" of filtration on water that is already comparatively clean. From the esthetic standpoint it has been found advantageous to refilter even apparently clean water and remove every trace of suspended matter.\n\nWhen the water is to be used for fine manufacturing purposes\u2014such as photographic developers, boiler feed, and cosmetic laboratories, etc.\u2014even traces of foreign matter affect the finished product, lowering the quality and making the combination of International Pressure and Disk Filter an economic advantage.\n\nStandard Specifications:\n\nFurnish complete (one, two, battery of three, etc.) International Filter Co.'s Style (D, E, R or H) Pressure Filter(s) feet in diameter by feet (high or wide), complete with inch inlet and outlet connections and inch waste connection.

A sight glass is furnished in the control panel to facilitate observation of the wash water and re-wash water so that the operator can see when the filter is clean.\n\nThe Style \"D\" International Filter is built up to the same standard as the Style \"E\" International Filter.\n\nThree or more Style \"D\" International Filters are placed in a battery where it is desired to wash the filters with wash water. The connections are arranged so that each filter may be washed with filtered water from the other two, thus requiring the opening of but one valve on each filter. To wash a filter, the inlet valve is closed, the inlet pipe is closed and the waste valve opened. The filtered water from the other two or more filters is forced through the discharge of the one that is to be washed and carries the accumulated sediment out to the waste. The wash water is used only when any one unit is to be cut out of service.\n\nWhen only one unit is to be used install a battery of three or more filters, than to install a single filter of the required capacity because the filters can be washed with filtered water and not so large a volume of wash water will be required.\n\n---\n\n**INTERNATIONAL**\n\n**Style E - International Filter**\n\nThe Style \"E\" International Filter is generally used in hospitals, dormitories, schools, residences, etc., where a large volume of water is required. It is also used in connection with swimming pools and for filtering the entire water supply of industrial plants.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\n54 Canada Life Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of file 312-11A C.W.\nof the 11th inst., I have made an analysis of the sample of water\nfrom the Indian Residential School at Punnichy, with the\nfollowing results:\n\n| Parts per million | Grains per gallon |\n|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Sulphate          | 403               |\n| Carbonate         | 191               |\n| Chloride          | 51                |\n| Calcium           | 37                |\n| Magnesium         | 147               |\n| Sodium            | 52                |\n\nMagnesium sulphate is the principal mineral\nsalt present accordingly, and therefore this water would probably\nbe somewhat of an irritant laxative. I would suggest that in\naddition to installing equipment to remove organic matter and\ncontamination, this water should be softened for drinking, as\nwell as other uses, by a zeolite softening plant. Since the\neffectiveness of different zeolite softening plants varies con-\nsiderably, I would suggest that you see that the plant installed\nis unreservedly guaranteed by the manufacturer to completely\nsoften the water, without unduly increasing the total of mineral\nsalts present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) J.
