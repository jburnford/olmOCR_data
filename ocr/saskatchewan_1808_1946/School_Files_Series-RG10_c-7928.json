It was thought in all 50 acres should be thoroughly cleared. As there is a good steady stream which for the balance of the year will not be flooded at low water and further it necessary to engage a tram line from town, so that it would be possible for us to undertake this work. To cut and lay our acreage appears that the contract price in this neighborhood is $20 per acre. It will cost additional to get it stamped and in readiness for the ploughs. It would be required to be done as early as possible before the rainfall is heavy. There are quite a number of Indians in the neighborhood whom desired for employment, as soon as the work on the road is finished it would be more profitable for the School to do the work as in this case a great deal of poison could be saved for the school's fuel supply which would otherwise be destroyed. The timing of work in the vicinity of the site when building operations are to take place ought to be preceded with almost immediately to insure the safety of material or temporary buildings that may be placed there.\n\nBelieve me\nVery faithfully Yours\nGeo.

The Department, however, prefers to do this work by day labour, under your supervision. You may, therefore, secure the necessary help to clear twenty-five (25) acres, and you should engage the school boys and teachers for such portions of the work as a team will be required for. Indian labour should be utilized as far as possible.\n\nAll portions of trees suitable for firewood should be trimmed free of brush and cut to suitable lengths for removal. These parts also should be carefully preserved for future use and fencing.\n\nThe school authorities will be required, without any cost to the Department, to remove all timber to be\n\nEllison Milne, B.A.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\n**Return of Labour on the**\n\nFor week ended\n\nAll payments to be made in presence of person signing as witness.\n\n| NAMES | Mon | Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | No days worked | Price per day | Amount of wages | RECEIVED PAYMENT |\n|-------|-----|------|-----|-------|-----|-----|----------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|\n|       |     |      |     |       |     |     |                |              |                 |                  |\n\nCheque No.: \n\nBalance:\n\nWITNESS:\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed, and that the prices are fair and just.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nChapleau, Ont., Aug 21st 1947\n\nThe Indian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIn answer to your Chapleau Boarding School.\n\nTo:\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMEMO.\n\nIndian Office\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Smith, the Superintendent of the Indian Boarding School at [location], that the school has been experiencing difficulties in obtaining sufficient supplies for the students.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the road partly constructed and leading to the clearing done on the site chosen for the erection of the proposed new Boarding School, in the summer of 1914, is several yards of corduroy necessary in crossing a piece of heavy muskeg. This part, I believe, was intended to have been covered with gravel or earth of some kind.\n\nThrough this neglect and due to exposure to the weather, a number of the cross pieces have become rotten and as a result the whole crossing has become loose and is a great menace to our stock and horses which go in this direction to find pasture during the summer months.\n\nLast summer one of our work horses, in crossing got his leg through an opening and hurt himself to such an extent that we were unable to work him for some time. It is in such a condition now that we dare not cross with a wagon. The material used was principally spruce, which does not retain its virtue for much more than three or four years when used for purposes of this kind.\n\nI would be very glad if the Department would give me permission to remove this off the road. I think there will be sufficient wood found on the whole to repay us for the work of clearing it away, so that all that is asked for is permission to clear it away. I think we can do this as soon as our planting is done and the road becomes dry enough to work on.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, believe me,\n\nVery Faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n509272\nOttawa, 5th June, 1918.\n\nRev.Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant I beg to say there appears to be no objection to your proposal to repair the road leading to the Chapleau Boarding School in the manner in which you suggest. In removing the old material off the road you should be careful not to place it outside the limit of the road allowance if by doing so the adjacent lands are at all damaged.\n\nIf the corduroy is removed as you suggest you should re-construct the road across the muskeg in order to make it passable especially during wet weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT D McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.G.Prauer,\nPrincipal, Chapleau Boarding School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, 27th June 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose for your information a copy of a letter addressed this day to the Rev.

It was constructed by the Provincial Government, and I understand that it is their intention to spend possibly $1,000.00 on the road this summer. It is over good dry ground and easily kept in repair. The distance to the school site would possibly be from 2\u00bd to 2\u00be miles.\n\nI will drop in to see you with regard to it, also with regard to some means of meeting the present financial difficulties in maintenance at the first opportunity.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGEN M.P.\nHouse of Commons\nOTTAWA March 4th, 1919.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt.-Gen., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to conversation I had with you re Indian schools, principally the Indian school at Chapleau, the situation briefly is this; that the Department must at once, or at a very early date at least, come to the relief of these schools in a greater degree than has been done in the past, or such of the schools as cannot command outside support will have to be closed. Why do I say this? For the plain reason that after careful personal investigation, I have convinced myself, and I believe that I can convince anyone else who will take the trouble to go into the matter carefully, that the schools cannot be efficiently maintained on the present scale of remuneration. It is not necessary that I should belabour this point. It is a plain fact that must be faced. What does this mean at the moment? The Indian schools have been built up. I will take the Chapleau school as a practical illustration.\n\nThe Indians have sent their children there. They have come to look upon the school as a fixture, something to which they could look forward to as a means of getting the rising generation of Indian men and women into a position that would enable them to compete, at least on a reasonably equal basis, with the white men who are gradually forcing them whether they like it or not, into the white man's environment. On top of this comes the condition arising out of the influenza epidemic, and without entering into the details I feel that your records will show that in every district of which an Indian school forms a center, it will be found that there are in some cases hundreds of\nHouse of Commons\n\nOTTAWA\n\nIndian children who are left complete orphans, and in many cases, destitute. I can give you specific instances of families of Indian children whose father went Overseas and died, and when the mother had died, the children now being cared for by other Indian families who have all their own problems to confront. It may be said that these children can be cared for by moving them out of the country altogether, but it matters not where they are, they must be cared for or abandoned to such charity as their case will command. I do not think that when once the case is properly understood, the Government will agree to either of these. In the first instance, it is not practical to move the children out. They will, in so far as they are able, refuse to go, and I do not think we can be very much surprised at that. In the second instance, we owe the Indian something better, particularly in view of the splendid record made when the manhood of Canada was called upon to do its part in the recent war. It just narrows itself down to this, that the Indian school is an absolute necessity if we are going to fulfill our common obligation to these people.\n\nThen coming again to the school at Chapleau. The present building and equipment was provided as you are aware by the Anglican Diocese of Moosonees, the department taking the school over and reimbursing the Diocese for the money spent. The building was intended to accommodate twenty to twenty-four children, but was really only taking care of about sixteen. By the erection of a kitchen and the use of an outside room for a schoolroom with a dormitory upstairs, it has been possible to increase the number to about forty-five or six. The whole plant, however, has been recognized as entirely inadequate to meet the needs of the situation, and as far back as I think 1912, your Department had plans prepared and, I believe, all\nappropriations made for the new school. The outbreak of war held this up, and in the meantime, in order that he might as far as in him lay meet the situation and relieve the Department from unnecessary expense, the man in charge of the school with his assistants literally worked like slaves. That their work has been splendidly efficient having in mind the difficulties under which they labored, no one who has any knowledge of the situation will attempt to deny.\n\nThe war now is over, pressing problems of every description are upon us and must be met, and in my judgment this is one of the most pressing, and I take the liberty of urging you as strongly as I am able to take steps at the earliest possible moment to go ahead with the erection of that building. As pointed out to you, I am satisfied that the site originally suggested for the new school is unsuitable. The two things vitally essential is a good tract of arable land and the possibility for an adequate supply of water. The next two things, possibly less essential, are convenience of access and the possibility for an efficient lighting system. In every one of these four ways the site originally selected fails to qualify. That, however, is only a minor detail and can without difficulty be easily overcome as there is an option of more than one first class site available.\n\nNow coming to the school at Spanish. As I think you know, I am not conversant with all the details in connection with this, but I know that it has to do with the question of per capita remuneration, and I again urge that this be given your full consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGBN/MP\nMarch 13, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of March 4, with reference to the situation at the Indian school at Chapleau. I was discussing this matter with the Honourable the Superintendent General the other day, and am hopeful that we may be able to do something. In this connection I had asked you to locate the site you considered most suitable, and the one we decided on some years ago.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nG.

Scott,\nCharge Indian Affairs.\nThere is, however, a lot contiguous to the 25 acres which might be available, having (so I am informed) been squatted on by an Austrian who is now in the penitentiary under a sentence of six years, and for which the Crown might on application be disposed to allot this land for a school site on payment for the improvements, totaling probably $1000.00 to $1500.00. This site is also on the main road to Chapleau, power line, and adjoins the site procured in 1914 and Indian Reserve, but on the west side of the river Kebsquashing, as shown on the accompanying sketch.\n\nThe 25 acre site with its many advantages is preferable, providing adjoining land can be reasonably obtained, and I would recommend for your consideration that Mr. Austin be at once communicated with and this determined; also that application be made to the Provincial Crown Lands Department for Lot Number 3, Concession 5; Chapleau, (Austrian Lot) and 3 and 4 Concession 3, and 3 and 4 Concession 4, and in the event of this Plot #5 or lot 3, Concession 5 not being obtained, that the building be erected on the site procured in 1914 for that purpose.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, July 2nd, 1918.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAs instructed I proceeded on the 26th ultimo to Chapleau for the purpose of inspecting an additional site proposed for the Indian Boarding School, and on the 27th and 28th ultimo accompanied by Mr. Prewer, Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Fife, of the electric plant, made a thorough inspection of the site offered.\n\nThe Austin site has many advantages in situation over that previously chosen, there being a fairly good road leading direct from the town to the old mill site (Austin site) and electric power plant, and on which (I am informed) the corporation of Chapleau will expend $500.00, putting this road in a thorough state of repair.\n\nThe power line also passes along this roadway at a corner of the site of 25 acres which Mr. Austin proposes to sell to the Department at a nominal price of $500.00. There are adequate facilities for drainage and water supply, also an abandoned railway siding into the property which if replaced would greatly facilitate the placing of materials for the building.\n\nThe site of 25 acres possessing all of the advantages stated, would be valueless for the purposes of a school, however, unless additional arable land of sufficient area can be acquired for farming purposes. Mr. Fife, representing Mr. Austin, expressed the opinion that Plot \"B\", containing about 320 acres, could be obtained from him for a nominal sum (exclusive of the water power site) but from a communication received this morning it would appear that he does not now wish to dispose of this plot situated between the proposed 25 acre site and the adjoining Crown lands which could be obtained.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nChapleau, Ont., July 9, 1919.\n\nMr. Duncan B. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further connection with the interview I had with Mr. Ogilvie Re-Site for the new School, I have seen Mr. Austin and he has agreed to transfer to the department the part of Block A. Agreed on for the school site and also all that portion of Block B, lying East of a line drawn straight South from a point 100' from the River. This will give you a fine block of land facing the railroad track on the East Side of Block B, which also connects you up with the government land lying South which is the most desirable area in the neighborhood. Mr. Austin has suggested a nominal price of $500.00 for Block and $500.00 for the part of Block B. I think this is a very generous offer and I feel you cannot do better than to go ahead and arrange for the site.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\n[AC 10, Volume 6193, File 4629, part 1]\nJuly 16, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th of July, with reference to the site for the Chapleau school.

George Prewer of Chapleau asking that an amount of $800.00 be granted by this Department to assist in the building of a road on a distance of about \u00bd mile which leads to the Old Mill Site where it is proposed to build the new Indian School. Mr. Prewer states that an amount of $500.00 has already been appropriated by the Ontario Provincial Government and other interested parties such as the settlers, etc., to carry out this improvement.\n\nThis road is reported, by Mr. Ogilvie who has lately visited this reserve, to be in a fairly good condition and I do not see any reasons for the Department to provide half of the expenditure it being not on Indian Reserve. But in view of the fact that it would benefit the school to a certain extent I would recommend that an amount of $200.00 be granted as the department share if funds are available in similar cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, September 3, 1919\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRecommend $400.00 to build roadway across portion acquired for school site to the railway and to school in the event of the building being erected.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\nWhen Mr. Ogilvie, of the Department was here going over the New School Site he also inspected the road going to the site, and considered the road in very bad condition and told me if I could get some money from the Province that the Department would also spend some money on it to put it in good shape.\n\nI have secured $600. from the Ontario Government, and this money has already been spent on this road but it is far from being a road and I beg leave to ask the Department for a grant of $500. to complete this work and $500. to complete a new road from the new school site across the 25 acres connecting up the property across Lot B. to the place where Mr. Ogilvie, selected as the place where all the material would be unloaded from the cars for the new school and which would save a two mile haul by teams making the haul about a third of a mile instead.\n\nMr. Ogilvie, will be able to explain the situation and will know best what is wanted and if I were given the authority to go ahead with the work I could secure the men, teams, and outfit who have just finished up their allowance on this portion and have them complete the work and the road would be in readiness when the work is started on the new school.\n\nI might mention that the men and teams who are employed on the road work now will soon be leaving for the lumber woods and if the work is to be done, it should be started as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

Mr. Meighen.\n\nPlans and specifications were prepared, and tenders requested by advertisement in the newspapers circulating in that district for an Indian boarding school at Chapleau, Ont. Four tenders have been received, viz., :\n\nRigby & Colson, Ltd., St. Catharines, Ont., $144,813.00,\nWallace & Angus, North Bay, Ont., .......... 94,156.00,\nJ. A. Barnie, Chapleau, Ont., ............... 98,000.00,\nGustiana & Zettler, Copper Cliff, Ont., .. 89,000.00.\n\nThe tender of Gustiana & Zettler and Wallace & Angus were accompanied by the necessary deposit security.\n\nRigby & Colson wired the Department on September 20, asking to have their tender withdrawn, but were willing to undertake the work on a percentage basis, and stated that a marked cheque would be forwarded under the above conditions.\n\nThe plans and specifications on which these tenders were based are the same as those used for the Alberni building. The lowest tender received for the Alberni building was from Messrs. Parfitt Brothers, Limited, Victoria, for $66,848.00, and this has been accepted.\n\nI cannot recommend the acceptance of any of the above tenders, as I think the prices are prohibitive. We called for tenders for practically the same building in August, 1914, and the lowest received was from Messrs. Woolbrick & Thornton, Sault Ste. Marie, for $45,050.00, but, as they failed to send their deposit security, and were thus disqualified, the next, from Messrs. Sherwood & Sherwood, Toronto, for $45,225.00, would have been the lowest.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF THE\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nOTTAWA\n\nOctober 1, 1919.\n\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen,\n\nRe Chapleau School:-\n\nMr. G. B. Nicholson, M.P., is very greatly interested in this building, and it will be a disappointment to him if we do not proceed with its erection.\n\nI thought I would mention this to you, in case you would think it advisable to discuss the matter with him.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOctober 8th, 1919.\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen -\n\nRe Chapleau School.\n\nI had an interview with Mr. G. B. Nicholson, M.P., during which we discussed very fully the tenders received for the Chapleau school. Mr. Nicholson is of the opinion that we will not gain anything by refusing to accept the lowest tender and asking for new tenders in the spring. It is his opinion that the price of building supplies will not have decreased, and that it is not at all likely that we will get a lower tender for this work.\n\nThere is no doubt that the building is absolutely necessary and I am anxious to arrange for its erection. We have provided $60,000.00 for this purpose in the current year's estimates. A small portion of that might be used before the close of the fiscal year, but it will probably be necessary to provide in next year's estimates for the whole amount of the contract, namely $89,000.00. If it is at all possible to obtain this money I would recommend that the lowest tender be accepted.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada www.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOctober 23, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson,\n\nIn the erection of the new boarding school at Chapleau, Ont., we will require the services of an inspector of works to oversee the erection of the building and to issue certificates of payment to the contractors as the work progresses.

I understand that both parcels \"A\" and \"B\" referred to are now the property of Mr. James McNiece Austin of Chapleau, who has offered to sell them to the Department. It is necessary that the title should pass to the Crown at as early a date as possible, in order that the contractor for the new Indian boarding school which is to be erected on this site should proceed with his work.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that you will at once communicate with Mr. Austin and make further enquiry into the matter.\n\nI will be prepared to send a cheque drawn jointly in your favour and Mr. Austin's for the purchase price as soon as you advise me that the title has been cleared up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nMessrs.

As this reduction comprises not less than one-fifth of the original area, it is a question as to whether the amount of $1,000.00 to be paid for this land should not be correspondingly reduced to $800.00.\n\nI am anxious that the question of title to this property be cleared up with as little delay as possible.\n\nI have today written to Messrs.

This was done on the suggestion of Mr. Nicholson, who is apparently looking after the matter for Mr. Austin and it was intended that Mr. Austin would execute the transfer and hold it until a patent could be obtained to block B, which Mr. Nicholson was having passed through the Department of Lands, Surveys & Mines of Toronto. We do not know on which portion of the property you desire to purchase that you intend to erect the school but if it is on block A, we would suggest that Mr. Austin execute and register to you a deed of block A for which you would pay him the sum of $500.00 and enter into an agreement with him to purchase block B as soon as he could obtain a title to the same and pay him the balance of $500.00 and in the meantime take from him a Crown Land assignment of the said portion of the land.\nMcKersock & Miller\n\nSudbury, Ont.\n\nDuncan Scott,\n\norder that you would be secured in case something should happen to Mr. Austin before the title to the land should be made.

I had just got the thing arranged so that Mr. Austin would make immediate transfer to the Department of the portion of block A required and have the arrangement carried out with regard to block B as discussed with you, namely: to have the Ontario Department of Crown Lands transfer to you Block B., and you then transfer to Austin, the portion of that block not required for the school site when a hitch occurred by the Department of Lands Forest and Mines asking Mr. Henderson of Sudbury why Mr. Austin's Claim to block B should not be entirely cancelled.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nTo give the percentage of the area required by the Indian Department. There are just two ways to get this whole thing straightened out namely: To have the Department of Lands Forest and Mines does suggested above transfer to you the whole of Block B, make the arrangement that I have suggested with Austin, or to have the Department issue the patent to Austin when he will transfer the portion of each block required for school purposes to you. The quickest course perhaps will be to have the department of Lands Forests and Mines transfer block B to you providing of course that you are agreeable to the arrangement suggested.\n\nKindly let me know as quickly as you can when I will arrange with Austin.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M./J.\nOttawa, 14th November 1919.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nIn connection with the completion of the purchase of the site for the school at Chapleau, the present position appears to be that in the case of Block \"A\", transfer can be made at once of that part required by this Department. Title to Block \"B\" however has not yet been granted by the Province to Mr. Austin.\n\nThe Department of Lands, Forests and Mines states that Mr. Austin is not a bonafide settler and that application can be made by this Department for Block \"B\" and grant obtained direct.\n\nMr. Nicholson suggests two courses,-either that this Department obtain Title to Block \"B\" from the Province and arrange with Mr. Austin to convey to him that part not required and presumably pay to him the price agreed upon for that part retained; or to have the Province issue patent to Mr. Austin and obtain transfer from him in the usual way. Mr. Nicholson appears to consider the first method to be the most expeditious and it would apparently be the one in which this Department is more fully protected. This would not however interfere with the immediate transfer of that part situated in Block \"A\".\n\nCorrespondence indicates that the actual site of the school is on Block \"A\" and this procedure would be the quickest method of acquiring a grant on which to commence building; the transaction involving Block \"B\" can then be completed in the manner most suitable to the Province. There does not appear to be any objection to the Title to the property required being covered by two separate patents.\n\nThe file does not show that a reduction in price on account of a smaller area being obtained, has as yet been agreed upon. The amount of reduction in area is from one-fifth to one-third of the total which it was expected to acquire and the reduction in price, therefore, should be at least $200.00.\n\n[Signature]\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nGeo.

I have therefore to make application that Block B be granted to the Crown as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs on payment of the usual fee.\n\nIt is hoped that inasmuch as the Department will at once be erecting an Indian boarding school and cultivating lands in connection with this school, that the conditions requiring agricultural improvements before the issue of patent may be waived in this case and patent be issued at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nTo Mr. Fassack, Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Lands, Forests & Mines,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, 17th November 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant relating to the transfer of land in Block A at Chapleau and Crown Land Assignment of Block B, it is requested that you take the necessary steps to obtain from the Province patent to Block B for the Crown as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt should be advanced that as this Department intends to erect an Indian Boarding School and to cultivate lands in connection therewith, it is hoped, in view of this being a public institution, that the conditions requiring agricultural improvements before issue of patent may be waived in this case and patent be issued at once.

If, however, Austin can file evidence that he is living and performing actual settlement duties on adjacent land of which he is the owner, he might be allowed to hold Block B upon the strength of these improvements, but evidence to that effect must be filed in the department.\n\nIt has not been stated what consideration Austin is attempting to procure from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nMr. Austin will be allowed ten days from the date of this letter in which to file any evidence he may have on behalf of his claim and at the expiration of that time the question of cancelling his claim to Block B will have consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Albert Grigg\"\n\nMessrs.

I am sure, however, that you will choose the best available site on the ground, and Mr. Ogilvie gives me to understand that he had defined the position of the building to both the agent and the principal. If the work is to go ahead it is essential that we should have our inspector appointed without delay. While both Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Brewer are capable men, I think we should have someone supervising with the building too. It is such a great deal of delay if there is nothing on the ground in whom all concerned have confidence who can direct the many matters that are sure to arise during the course of the construction of a building of this size.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nG.

It is hardly possible to consider the Agent as an inspector, because he would not be allowed extra remuneration. I would, however, be disposed to appoint Mr. Brewer as inspector at a small salary, and have periodical visits of inspection made by one of our own architects or engineers. From experience we know that many important questions arise during the construction of a building of this size, when expert technical advice is absolutely necessary if delay is to be avoided. I would, therefore, propose to appoint Mr. Brewer, and pay him a salary of $60.00 a month for daily oversight of the work, and send one of our officers as frequently as considered necessary, all payments to contractors to be made only on the certificate of our Architect.\n\nIf you will agree to this, and wire me, the necessary instructions will be at once sent to Mr. Brewer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.

Kindly advise me what you wish me to do.\n\nYours very truly\n\nG.W./CN\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nChapleau, Dec.2,1919\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt. Gen.

Can you advise the remuneration either would receive. This necessary to decide.\"\n\nI now beg to confirm this and in further connection would say that in my judgment either Mr. Prewer or Mr. Godfrey could do this work, providing always that it was the intention of the Department to have some one from Mr. Ogilvie's office visit Chapleau accordingly during the course of the actual erection of the building. If this cannot be done, it is going to be difficult to get anyone in Chapleau, who has the knowledge and at the same time can spare the time to see that the plans and specifications are properly carried out. Mr. Prewer or Mr. Godfrey could check the work and see that the\nSir,\n\nYour letter respecting Block \"B\", Township of Chapleau, has been received.\n\nThis block was disposed of in July, 1910, to James McNiece Austin of Chapleau. A free grant location was made of 160 acres of this parcel and the remaining area, 189 acres, was sold at 50 cents an acre.\n\nMr. Austin is the owner of Block \"A\", and a few days ago Mr. Geo. B. Nicholson, M. P., called at the Department and stated that Austin had sufficient improvements and clearing on Block \"A\", to warrant the issue of patent for the land in question.

On November 25th., I personally arranged with Mr. Joseph Fowler of Sudbury to send to your Department of Lands Forests & Mines, Toronto, certificate of search of titles to Block A., South of Chapleau, on C. P. R., and on December 3rd., I received from the Department an acknowledgement of the receipt of such certificate setting forth that the title was properly registered to Mr. James McNiece Austin.

They have not in the office the original patent to this land and the Registrar is sending for the same, and as soon as it is received, we will then be able to make a correct search to the title, but we believe the title is regular and in the name of Mr. Austin, and acting on this assumption, we have prepared and forwarded to Mr. Austin for signature, transfers from him to your Department, and as soon as they are received from Mr. Austin and we are satisfied that the title is clear, we will get in touch with your Department for the purpose of obtaining a voucher for payment of the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMcKESBOK & MILLER\n\n[Signature]\nMarch 6th, 1920.\n\nDuncan O.

If your Department thinks best, there would be no harm in securing the two part Lots adjoining on Block \"B\" and the whole of the two adjoining lots. This would secure to the School a larger range from which to cut wood, and enable us to select the more suitable portions for clearing purposes.\n\nI am enclosing a map of the Township of Chapleau. I find that the Lots do not scale with the Blue Print forwarded by you. The Lots named are indicated with a double \"X\".\n\nOn account of the room it takes up, I am not returning the Blue Print, as you doubtless have other copies on hand.

Lots 3 and 4, Concession 3, Township of Chapleau and to your letter of the 22nd March in which you say these lands are unsold Crown Lands, I would state that it is very important for the successful operation of the Indian Boarding School, now in course of construction, that these lands be acquired.\n\nThe site of this new school is on a part of Block \"A\", Concession V and application has been made to your Department for a portion of Block \"B\". These parcels however do not provide a sufficient area of tillable soil, either to operate the school economically or to sufficiently educate the Indian children in agricultural duties. Owing to the nature of the country in this vicinity and in order to have enough tillable soil to support such an institution, it is necessary to obtain a considerably greater acreage than it is actually intended to cultivate and it is estimated the area applied for is essential only to provide sufficient area to be placed under crop but also to ensure a suitable amount of pasturage and wood, these latter two features being important in operating a school of this nature.\n\nI would therefore request your favourable consideration of the application for purchase and hope than an early decision can be made in order that operations may be proceeded with.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School File 61979, Part 1\nOttawa, 1st April 1920.\n\nRev.

M. Austin for the purposes of the Indian School site. Mr. Austin's executors have advised me that these lands have not been paid for. I am taking it for granted that this must have been an oversight and would be glad to have you advise me how soon the executors might figure on receiving a cheque to cover. The executors are, Mrs. J. M. Austin, Widow of the late Mr. Austin, and Messrs. Allen McN. Austin and J. W. Austin. A letter addressed to Mr. A. McN. Austin at Chapleau or Dalton Mills Post Office, Ont. will reach the executors. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.B.N./JVN\n\nMr. Nicholson absent since dictation.\n23rd August 1922\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson,\n\nI note in your letter of the 16th instant that the executors of the estate of the late J.M.N. Austin have advised you that payment has not been received for the lands at Chapleau purchased by the Department from Mr. Austin. I have to inform you that payment for that portion of Block A, acquired from Mr. Austin, was made by Departmental cheque for $500.00, issued in March 1920 and forwarded to Messrs. McKeeock and Miller, Barristers, Sudbury.\n\nYou will remember at the time this purchase was first considered it was proposed that Mr. Austin would transfer to the Department an area of approximately 150 acres in Block A and Block B and that when the survey was made, it was found that the area amounted to less than 100 acres. When this matter was brought to your attention in my letter of the 22nd October 1920, in which I suggested a reduction in the original price on this account, you replied that the question of a reduction of values would be taken up with Mr. Austin at once. Before anything was agreed upon, however, it was found that the Department of Lands, Toronto, did not regard Mr. Austin as the owner of Block B and later, the parcel required by the Department in Block B was acquired direct from the Province by the payment of $1.00 per acre for the area taken.\n\nIn view of the above, it would not appear that the Department could be expected to pay for the portion required in Block B in accordance with the original understanding, but if in your opinion there still remains a payment which should be made by the Department, I would be pleased to have your views in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.B. Nicholson Esq.,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIndian Lands Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nAt the time of his death, on the 30th June, 1922, Mr. J.McN. Austin of this place was the owner of location \"A\" situate West of the Canadian Pacific Railway South of Chapleau in the District of Sudbury. Among his papers there is a letter dated November 24th, 1919, in which he states \"the arrangement now effected is that if I can produce a duplicate certificate of title for Block \"A\" that they (Indian Land Department) will grant me the patent of Block \"B\" on account of the clearance I have made on Block \"A\". Block \"B\" adjoins Block \"A\". The executors of Mr. Austin's estate are anxious to secure the patent of that part of Block \"B\" which has not heretofore been patented or sold. They are the owners of the Hydro-Electric plant on Block \"A\". Could you let me know by early mail if Mr. Austin's statement, given above, was correct and on what terms the executors could obtain the patent of the unpatented part of Block \"B\"?\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. F. C. Brown\n\nSTC/MD.\nOttawa, September 23, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nDealing with your inquiry of the 16th instant, with reference to Block B, township of Chapleau, I have to advise that this Department communicated with the Department of Lands & Forests, Toronto, regarding this land, and was advised that they did not consider Mr. Austin as the owner of Block B. Later, the parcel required for Industrial School purposes in this block was purchased from the Province by payment of $1.00 per acre for the area taken. The portion of Block B to which you refer as not having been sold or patented is under the control of the Crown Lands Department, Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. T. Chown, Esq.,\nBarrister, etc.,\nRenfrew, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI write you regarding the buildings over at the old school site here.\n\nSince they have fallen into disuse, for teaching purposes they have more or less deteriorated through decay and the destruction wrought upon them by wanton hands.\n\nAfter our removal to the new site, and during my Principalship, I aimed at keeping a close watch upon these buildings and upon one occasion had some young lads brought before the Police Magistrate for destroying the property and taking away articles left in the cottage. There were, however, several instances where we could not discover who was responsible for the destruction committed.\n\nOn one or two occasions Mr Indian Agent Geoffrey and myself attempted to ascertain the cost of removing the cottage to the new site, but we found that it would cost more to do this than to erect an entirely new building. To tear these buildings down, at the present cost of labour would mean that one would scarcely realize the amount in the material saved.\n\nIt has occurred to me that there is a possible use that I could put these buildings to; if the Department is willing to sell them and give title to about one acre of land upon and near which these buildings are situated.\n\nI have purchased a dwelling in Sudbury, where I am intending to have my headquarters and expect to move my family there as soon as we are given possession of the property which will be about the beginning of October, and we might use the cottage as a summer residence, provided it can be purchased at a reasonable figure, and that we can get someone to reside in the old school building and take care of the same. Furthermore, I might find someone interested enough to purchase.\n\nAs an investment, I am prepared to offer the Department $1,500.00 for the two main buildings, the woodshed and smaller buildings immediately surrounding them; the conditions to include one full acre of land upon which the buildings are situated and immediately surrounding them.\n\nThe conditions will have to include the right to use the present road across the property leading directly to the town of Chapleau.\n\nIf your Department is interested in this offer I should be glad to have word from you immediately.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeo Prenter.\nOttawa, July 8, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the buildings on the old site of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School. I have noted your offer of $1500 for the buildings in question and for one acre of land upon which the buildings are situated and immediately surrounding them.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, before property can be sold by the Department, offers must be publicly invited. We are communicating with Mr. Agent Godfrey, with a view to having the property you desire advertised for sale, if it is considered to be of no further use to the Indian boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Geo. Brewer,\nDrawer No. 57,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, 6th July 1923\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Foster,\n\nI cannot find from the records in the Surveys or Lands Branch that the purchase of the old school site at Chapleau for the church was ever completed.\n\nCorrespondence on the subject on file 65-1-9 herewith appears to have terminated on the forwarding by the Agent of the Bishop of Moosonee's certificate of ownership and a statement showing that he had paid the Ontario Government $77.50 for the land involved. I have no doubt, therefore, that this land still stands registered in the registry office of the District of Sudbury as being the property of the Bishop of Moosonee. It would, therefore, be necessary to complete this transaction before any re-sale could be made, as suggested by the Rev. Mr. Prever.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobertson\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, 11th July 1923\n\nSir,\n\nWould you be good enough to inform this Department of the name recorded in your books as being the owner of Lot No. 2, Concession 6, Township of Chapleau?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

This Department is acquiring the property, and I should be pleased if you would instruct your agent to carry to search the title, and if clear, prepare a conveyance from His Lordship the Bishop of Moncton to His Majesty, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. The consideration is $77.50 - the sum paid by His Lordship, I believe, when he acquired the property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 31, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the old property of the Chapleau Indian Boarding School - some 156 acres more or less - known as Lot No. E, Con. 6, Township of Chapleau in the District of Sudbury West, was offered by Your Lordship to the Department, in 1911. The understanding was that the consideration would be $77.60, which was paid to the Provincial Government by Your Lordship in 1910, when you acquired the property.\n\nIt was brought to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General that this transfer was never completed, due apparently to an oversight, and before he left for British Columbia on Monday last, he directed that the Department make arrangements to acquire the property in question. I have today directed a communication to the Department of Justice, enclosing a Certificate of Title, which you gave to Mr. H. A. Neat, once time Indian Agent. I have requested that the agent, at Sudbury, of the Department of Justice search the title and prepare a conveyance from Your Lordship to His Majesty, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs - the consideration to be $77.60.\n\nThis action is being taken because of the advisability of having all the land held by the Chapleau Indian Boarding School under the control of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. G.

In reply I beg to state that the Department is not prepared to rent the buildings and land in question.\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. Mr. Frewer has made an offer of $1600 for the old buildings referred to and for one acre of land upon which the buildings are situated. The Department is favorably disposed to consider this offer, and you will be kindly advised after we secure a proper description of the acre desired by the Rev. Mr. Frewer, I shall communicate with you with a view to having the property publicly offered for sale.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 21st instant {65-1-9}, with regard to the acquisition of Lot No. 2, Con. 6, Township of Chapleau, in the District of Sudbury, Ontario, before instructing an agent in the matter, I should like to know if the Patent (S.1480 of 25th July 1910) referred to in the Certificate of Ownership was issued by the Dominion or Provincial Crown. It is important to know this, as I observe that the Lot was conveyed to the Bishop of Moosonee \"for the purposes of an Indian School and farm\". If His Lordship obtained his title from the Dominion Crown the said restriction is not important, but, on the other hand, if it was obtained from the Provincial Crown he could only convey subject to the said restriction.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Aest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of 27th instant (65-1-9), and to say that I am sending instructions today to Mr. T.

We have been given to understand through Mr. Godfrey, Indian Agent at Chapleau, that this building is likely to be put up for sale.\n\nIf such be the case, I beg to inquire the price and also the price for the approximate three acres of land surrounding it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nProvincial Forester.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\nOttawa, August 1, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 69-B of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the building formerly used by the Chapleau Indian Boarding School.\n\nI have to inform you, in reply, that this building may be put up for sale, or rental, as it is no longer used for school purposes. We wish to retain the farm, however, for the Chapleau Institution. Certain enquiries are being made, and when a decision has been reached, relative to the disposition of the old building, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In order to prepare transfer it will be necessary for you to give us the full name and address of His Lordship the Bishop in order that we may prepare the necessary affidavits.\n\nThe land is subject to payment of assurance fees of $10 on value of land and $1/10 on buildings which must be paid before any dealing therewith. In order to prepare the affidavit for the assurance fees we will therefore require to know the value of the land and buildings.\n\nYours truly\n\n[SGD.] LULLIGAN & LULLIGAN\nper I. H.

I have noted that it is advisable to have them occupied.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department has hesitated to make arrangements in connection with this property, because of lack of title. This difficulty is being removed satisfactorily and I am pleased to inform you that you may arrange to have someone live in the old buildings. The Provincial Forester of the Department of Lands and Forests, Parliament Buildings, Toronto, Ont., corresponded with the Department in July, last. You may write to our correspondent, on behalf of the Principal of the school, and inform him that the building will not be put up for sale, but they may rent it as a storehouse for equipment, if you consider such action advisable. Any rental may be considered as school earnings and should be paid to the New Principal. If this arrangement does not provide satisfactory protection for the buildings, you should inform the provincial forester to this effect and make arrangements, if possible, to have someone live in the buildings for the purposes of protection. You will, of course, incur no expense in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Mulligan & Mulligan,\nBarristers, Etc.,\nSudbury, Ont\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe lot 2, con. 6 Chapleau,\n\nI have seen the Bishop regarding execution by him of conveyance to the Department of the above lands.\n\nYou will notice that the consideration mentioned in the transfer is $77.50, and that the value of the land according to the assurance fund affidavit is about $300.00.\n\nThe facts seem to be that some years ago the Diocese paid $250.00 purchase price for this land. Subsequently it developed that their vendor, an Indian, was a squatter and the Department took the stand that he had no title to convey convey but that the Diocese would have to purchase the land from the Government, which they did, paying an additional $77.50. The land has therefore cost the Diocese $322.50 and the Diocese is now asked to convey the land back to the Department at a cost of $77.50, notwithstanding the fact that the land seems worth at least $300.00 and cost the Diocese $322.50.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the Church is not a profit-making organization, and has a good deal of difficulty in raising the necessary funds to carry on, particularly in this missionary Diocese. It would seem most unfortunate if the Diocese should lose this $250.00, particularly in view of the fact that the land is worth more than the price at which the Diocese is asked to reconvey.\n\nI am sure that the Department is not aware of the circumstances and I am taking this opportunity of drawing same to your attention, trusting you will take the matter up with the Department with a view to having the Diocese paid an additional $250.00 purchase price, which amount will reimburse them for what money they have actually laid out on the property in the manner above mentioned.\nOTTAWA, 9th November, 1923.\n\nLot 2, Con. 6, Chapleau.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your number 65-1-9,\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter addressed on 5th instant to our agent's firm by Mr. John Greer, and shall be obliged to know what reply you desire that our agent should make.\n\nI am also enclosing a certificate of search as to the title, showing that the above lot is vested in fee in The Bishop of Mooseonee with an absolute title. With regard to the assurance fees mentioned therein, and the execution of the transfer, our agent wrote us on 22nd ultimo as follows:\n\n\"The assurance fees will be paid when the transfer from His Lordship to the Crown is registered. As advised in a former letter we sent the transfer to Cochrane for execution but it has not been returned to us.

Enclosed you will find blue prints showing all the school property in green and the Indian Museum. Please give one blue print to the principal of the school for use in his office.\n\nThe old school site comprises 165 acres, more or less, and is known as Lot No. E, Con. 6, Township of Chapleau, in the District of Sudbury West. In 1911, His Lordship the Bishop of Moosonee offered the property to the Department for a consideration of $77.50 which amount was paid by the diocesan authorities and the Provincial Government in 1910 when they acquired the property. Due to an oversight, this transfer was not completed until March, 1914. At that time the Department made a further payment of $650 to the diocesan authorities, which amount the Bishop of Moosonee paid, in 1906, to a Mrs. Wacowatch who was a squatter on the property.\n\nYou may inform any interested that title to the site has been in His Majesty as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs since March,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Chief, General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReferring to your letter of July 21st, 1923, I wish to say that it has been brought to my attention that there is a movement in progress to purchase the site of the old Indian School at Chapleau for the purpose of purchasing it for the Roman Catholic Church, with the purpose of using it as a school and hospital for Indian children. You can at once see what this would mean. The fact of two schools practically side by side at Chapleau would tend to create confusion and possibly friction between the Indians and those concerned with Indian education.\n\nWhen the Diocese raised the site in question in October 1923, the Department stated by your Acting Deputy that \"this action was taken because of the advisability of having all land held by the Chapleau Indian Boarding School under the control of the Department.\"\n\nI trust therefore that the misunderstanding above indicated will be adjusted so that no such sale to the Roman Catholic Church will be allowed to go forward without your knowledge. Moosonee.\n\n(Signed) John G. Anderson\n\n(Poor Copy)\nJanuary 11, 1937.\n\nDear Bishop Anderson,\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 10th instant with reference to the site of the old Indian School at Chapleau.\n\nThe Indian Agent recently made enquiry regarding the title to this property, but beyond that there has been no communication or correspondence regarding any disposition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nRev.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe question of the relationship of the land comprising the site of the old Chapleau Indian School to the school now administered by our Society is one on which our Commission have directed me to secure a definite ruling from your Department. Their understanding of the situation is that it comprises part of the existing Chapleau Indian Residential School property, and cannot be disposed of by sale or used for any other purpose than in connection with this School. If their understanding is correct, I shall be obliged if you will confirm the same in writing.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.B.C.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTHN/JF\nJanuary 28, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to Lot No. 2, Con. 6, Township of Chapleau, which was the site of the old Chapleau Indian residential School.

He has a boy who has been attending the Chapleau School since he was seven years of age. Moses Mimeable is a Protestant and the School at Lower French is Catholic. He is very desirous that his little girl should be under the care of the St. John's Indian Residential School at Chapleau, because his wife is dead. I would recommend that this child be admitted to the School.\n\nI have also had a request from Mrs. David Suhunation of the Gibson band, who is working in Toronto, and separated from her husband, that her boy who is living with his father on the Reserve be admitted to the Chapleau School. She states that her son is not being properly cared for, and she would like him to be sent to the School along with his brother and sister, who are at present in the school. The possibilities are that this boy will grow up wild as he has no proper place to live and his father is quite often away from the Reserve, and leaves him to roam around. He generally goes to stay with his aunt, Mrs. White, who gets nothing for his keep and is not desirous of keeping him.\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a request from the Indian Agent at Parry Sound for the admission of Grace Miscable, age seven, and David Sahamaten, to the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease advise me, as soon as possible, if you can provide accommodation for these two children and, if so, instructions will be given to Mr. Agent Daly to have them sent to your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr Indian Agent Winger informs me the father is ready and willing to have his son return to him if the Department will pay his fare. This boy with others was sent here by the Department. In the case of the others sent in the same way the Department has in each case guaranteed the return fare I hope you will give permission for this boy. He is marked on our list as being 15 years of age and should this Summer be advanced to the age of 16 but in reality his father says he will be 18 years of age next February. This boy does not show any aptitude for learning in the class room and I think would do better under the guiding hand of his father.\n\nWill you therefore please authorize me to send him home to his father. He has gone over the same work in the class room two or three years and does not apply himself and is keeping some other worthy child from the chance.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nTrinipal.\nOttawa, August 4th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that the discharge of Norman Spencer - No. 107 - from the Chapleau Indian Residential School is approved.\n\nPayment of his transportation to his home will be made upon receipt from you of a properly certified voucher, in triplicate.

MacKenzie\nSecretary-Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have had an application from the wife of Phillip Shashawahbic of the Brunswick House Band, for her little girl to be admitted to the Chapleau Residential School.\n\nThe little girl is somewhere about seven years of age. She is illegitimate, but there are evidences to show that her father is Indian. I have discussed the matter with the Principal, the Rev. A.J. Vale, and he is willing to adopt her into the Boarding School.\n\nThis looks like the best solution for the child's best interests as the mother is not too good a character morally, and the child is just at the formative period of life, and ought to be restored into better surroundings. I know of no other institution, because of her parentage, which would be willing to look after her.\n\nI expect to be at Elaan on the 2nd Prox., and could arrange matters then, as the mother, I believe is residing there at the present time.\n\nI would be glad of a reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n65-1-16\nOttawa, September 25, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, I beg to say that the Department is not certain from the information contained in your letter that this girl is eligible for admission as a grant-earning pupil to an Indian residential school.

I have found Joshua Thompson to be a real decent hard working man, and when he had work he always supported his family, and if there is anyone to blame in this separation it is his wife, not Joshua Thompson.\n\nThese two little boys are just like crickets, they are as smart as they make them, and Joshua Thompson would like them to be brought up correctly. If he had work to go to at the present time he could not leave the children, and as there is an expectation that he might get work in the near future, he has made the request that the boys be accepted into the St. John's Indian Residential School, Chapleau.\n\nI had the pleasure of having a visit at my home, from the Rev. A.J.Vale and I told him about this proposition of the Thompson children. He said he would let me know if he had room for them. I have received a letter from Rev. Vale this morning stating that there is room for the children. I have also received a letter from the Gibson Band asking me if I would make arrangements for the children of Joshua Thompson to go to the Chapleau School.\nOttawa, November 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your T-5317 of the 11th ultimo, with reference to the Thompson children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, provided they are medically fit, the Department will approve of their admission to the Chapleau Residential School, on the understanding that they are not in excess of the number for which grant is provided at this school. You may arrange to send these boys at an early date. It should not be necessary, however, to supply an escort, as they can be placed in charge of the train officials.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health should be forward for the Department's file.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A. J. Vale\u2014Principal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen sending in the quarterly report I neglected to state the reason for the non appearance of the two names.\n\nNo. 0123 Emily Blacksmith aged 18 years\n0140 Mary Miller aged 17 years.\n\nI secured work for them as domestics in the town and tried them out before reporting to you. They are giving good satisfaction and have permanent employment so I now request their discharge be granted them they are as you see of good age and I think it best to let them go when they can be comfortably employed.\n\nNo. 0111 Betty Claus aged 19 years has been for a long time at school here not strong enough to go on with her High school work and I have recently secured good easy employment for her at the Town Hospital where she gets medical attention she needs and a small wage and so is able to care for herself. I would request her discharge be allowed her to date from April first.\n\nI know this is irregular, I should ask for the discharge first but I feel sure you will agree it is good to take advantage when I get the chance to place these girls and I cannot wait until I can get permission or miss the opportunity.\n\nI therefore hope you will assent and approve of my action taken in these cases.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say you may inform the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\nNo. 0123 - Emily Blacksmith\nNo. 0140 - Mary Miller\nNo. 0111 - Betty Claus.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that Rev. Mr. Vale has been successful in securing employment for the above mentioned girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Dept. of Indian Education.\n\nT. J. Godfrey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nI do not think the other boys would pay for sending to the High School but Charlie Moore No.160 and Leslie Williams No.188 have no homes to go to and would be the better for being allowed to remain here longer. They will never make a mark in education but will do well in the outdoor work of the school on the farm and their characters would be the better able to withstand the temptations of surroundings on the Reserve if permitted to remain and be built up.\n\nGIRLS.\n\nNo.0103. Eileen Rathburn This girl has attended High School now for two terms. She did well at the Examination last Spring. I regret to say she has not done so well this year and I would recommend she be given her discharge and allowed to return to her married Sister's home in Burlington Ontario, who has offered her a home. As she was sent here by the Department, I presume they will pay her fare home.\n\nNo.0120. Ruby Laforce. This girl is a big strong girl physically but has little ability as a student. She has asked me to try to get her a position as Domestic this summer if I can. She is not a member of the Band though she came from Baie. I would like permission to keep her on until I can, within a reasonable time get her placed. Her home surroundings would be very unhelpful if sent back to the reserve this summer.\n\nNo.0122. Jane Blacksmith. This girl has the makings of a fine type of woman. I think she ought to be given a chance to remain here longer and see what she can do in the classroom until she can be placed as a Domestic rather than be sent back to her father who has married again and the home is not fit for her to return to, with any chance to make use of her training here.\n\nYou ask my opinion of the other pupils who were sent to the High School. I would say with a few exceptions they did not warrant the extra cost to send them. Some had ability but would not apply themselves. Others did not have the ability to meet the standard and became discouraged. One, Darcey Black, a late boy, made very good use of his chance. He got his Junior Matriculation and took a course at Business College with Shaw of Toronto in Book Keeping and Accounting and passed with Honours. He is I believe now a Time Keeper at one of the Fire Ranger Districts.\n\nMiss Emily Donald passed and took up Normal Training as a Teacher. She taught three years in a day school and is this Fall trying to return to Normal to make her Teacher Certificate permanent. She is applying to Normal School at North Bay this Fall.\n\nMiss Ella Crean went to High School and then on to Train as a Nurse in Toronto. She has graduated and taken her R.N., and is employed at her Training home Hospital for as long as she desires to remain there.\n\nLorne Rathburn had ability but proved too lazy to carry on. He is now I believe an Orderly in a Hospital in Ottawa.\n\nI do not think it pays to send pupils to High School unless they show special aptitude for it and I will be honest in not recommending any others if you allow me that privilege.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to the circular No. I-1410, Under date of June 15, 1934, I beg to send the following information.\n\nList of Pupils over 16 Years of age,\n\n| BOYS | GIRLS |\n|------|-------|\n| No.  | Name  | No.  | Age   | Name            |\n| 95   | Alec Bain | 17   | 0103  | Eileen Rathborn |\n| 110  | Walter Hall | 16   | 0120  | Ruby Laforce    |\n| 115  | Walter Hall | 19   | 0122  | Jane Blacksmith |\n| 132  | Calvin Hogan |      |       |                 |\n| 142  | Redfern Louttit |      |       |                 |\n| 143  | Charles Hall | 16   |       |                 |\n| 155  | David Tuckerman | 16  |       |                 |\n| 160  | Charlie Moore | 16   |       |                 |\n| 167  | Oswald King | 17   |       |                 |\n| 171  | Daniel Candass | 16  |       |                 |\n| 188  | Leslie Williams | 16  |       |                 |\n\nNo. 115 Walter Hall. This boy is attending High School and making good progress. In early life he had one leg amputated to save his life. It seems to have eradicated all traces of the Tubercular trouble. He is ambitious to make use of his education and I think it would be a kindness to let him go on so he can be fitted to take a situation whereby he could earn a living for himself. If he were sent home now he would not have enough to fortify him against hardwork for which he is not physically fit. His home surroundings would be such that he would lose all good of his education.\n\nNo. 132, Calvin Hogan. This boy is ambitious and will try his High School Entrance examination. If he secures the 70 per cent required to allow him to go on I think he would be well worth sending. If he fails he could be discharged.\n\nNo. 142, Redfern Louttit. This is a fine boy he is doing well at High School and I would very much like to see him go on. He is writing on his second form examination this spring. He will make good use of his education if allowed to go on. He wants to prepare for a University Education and I think has ability.\nOttawa, June 28, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the children 16 years of age and over, in the Chapleau Indian Residential School. In view of your recommendation, the Department approves retaining the following pupils in the Chapleau School:\n\nNo. 115 - Walter Heil, No. 142 - Redfern Louttit,\n160 - Charlie Moore, 188 - Leslie Williams,\nNo. 0122 - Jane Blanksmith.\n\nIt is noted that you will write, later, regarding Calvin Woganesh, No. 138. It is noted, also, that you are endeavouring to obtain employment for Ruby Laforce, No. 0120.\n\nThe following pupils may be discharged:\n\nNo. 95 - Alec Bain, No. 143 - Charles Hall,\n110 - Almyr Hill, 155 - David Quackageesick,\n167 - Oswald King, 171 - Daniel Candassi,\nNo. 0103 - Eileen Rathburn.\n\nPayment of the transportation of Eileen Rathburn, No. 0103, to her sister's home in Burlington, will be made upon receipt, from you, of a properly certified account, in triplicate.\n\nCircular letter of the 15th instant outlined part of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act. In future, the Department desires that, when children reach the age of 16 years and you consider they should be retained in the school for a further period, you should write the Department, through the office of your local Indian Agent, giving your reasons for keeping them and asking the Department's permission.\n\nGreat care should be exercised in choosing those who are given the advantages of high school education. The qualification of obtaining 70% on the Entrance examination is reasonably high. But, at the same time, I feel you will agree there is a better chance of obtaining children who will take advantage of the opportunity offered to them when we insist upon this standard. If children going to high school are not successful at the end of the year's examinations and are not promoted to a higher form, the Department is not prepared to consider granting them further assistance. You should, of course, write the Department before August 15th, giving the names and full particulars regarding any pupils of the Chapleau Residential School, who, you consider, should attend high school during the academic year 1934-35.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

June 27-1934\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby make application for the discharge of the following pupils:\n\nNo.103 Eileen Rathburn. This girl is of the age of 18 now. She has attended High School for two years. She has not made good use of her last year and has failed in several subjects so she is not eligible for further chance.\n\nI have got in touch with her sister, Mrs. O. Claus in Burlington Ontario, who would like to have her sent to her to help in the house. If you will approve and meet her railroad fare she will assume all care of the girl from that time.\n\nNo.110 Almyr Hill. This boy is over 16 years of age. He is a good steady lad but will not pay for further schooling as he is not clever in the classroom work. He has been doing special manual work and is ready for discharge. He does not need a pence money as I have a place for him on the road Camp work here. He will assume all expense for any travelling he may do later.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 9th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to reopen the St. Frances Anglican Indian Day School on the Pierreville Indian Reserve and I have, therefore, to request that you arrange to send home, as soon as possible, Irene Hoff - No. 0264; Frances Hoff - No. 0179; Douglas Hoff - No. 186; and Chester Hoff - No. 197. It is considered that these children are old enough to travel without escort. They should be placed in charge of the train officials. You should arrange for the purchase of the necessary transportation for them from Chapleau to Pierreville, Que. Payment of this expenditure will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate.\n\nYou should notify their mother, Mrs. Carrie Hoff, Pierreville, Que., regarding the date and time of their arrival in Pierreville in order that she may meet them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Sept.\n\nMr. A. J. Vale Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing the applications duly filled out for two children for this school. You will see they have been made out at Iosse Factory. The reason for their coming here was the desire of the parents for the children to go to school and the school at Iosse Factory was full so they were sent here at request of the Bishop after he learned we had room for them.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nReferring to yours of August 24th, 65-1-10, re the admission of William Jack Stevens to the Chapleau Indian Residential School, I have to state that this boy, a few days before he had to go to school, blew part of his fingers off. He is at present in the St. Joseph's Hospital here.\n\nAs soon as he recovers, I will send him on to Chapleau in care of the conductor. Trusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPerry Sound, Ont.,\nSept. 4, 1934,\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir:\n\nI have to report that Mrs. Olive King, mother of Olive King, refuses to send Olive back to school. When I was taking the little Commandant girl to Chapleau, she was supposed to meet me at the station, but did not.\n\nI have been endeavoring to see her since, and only today I saw her to get an explanation of her conduct. She seemed all worked up about this matter and explained that she had two other children at the New School and both took sick and ultimately died, one at Chapleau, and one at home, and she wants to keep this little girl with her and has promised to send her to the Parry Island School.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department could see their way to grant permission for me to keep this child with her. She has two boys at home that may be able to help her by getting work.\n\nThe consideration of the Department will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 6, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that the admission of James and Phillip Davey to the Chapleau Residential School is approved. The Department is not prepared, however, to pay for the transportation of these children to the Chapleau School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Yale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, September 6, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, I beg to say that the discharge of Olive King from the Chapleau Residential school is approved.

Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChapleau, Ont. Sept. 6, 1934\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor the first time in my six years here I have had to call upon the police to act as Truant officer and bring back here children who have overstayed their Summer Vacation and the parents refused to send them back.\n\nI have taken up the matter with the Chief of Police in the town of Chapleau and he has acted within his jurisdiction. The question arises as to what should be done in the case of children who are now in the jurisdictionality area to be safe he has asked me to write to you and see if you will in accordance with the Indian Act appoint him as Truant Officer so as to enable him to go to the homes of the said children and compel them to return to school.\n\nAll the children who have not returned are under the school age of 16 years and therefore ought to be returned. The parents refuse in the case of two children at Lissanable Ontario about 50 miles west of this town on the Railway.\n\nI would take this matter up through the Indian Agent but he is away on leave of absence at the present. He told me he would write for authority to have them brought back. I have waited two weeks and no word has come yet, as I expect to be away from the school for a month on vacation. I thought it best to write you direct and ask you, if it meets with your approval, to appoint the Chief of Police here as Truant Officer to enable him to do what he is quite ready to do if granted such authority.\n\nWill you be good enough to write him direct to the following address: Mr. Dery Chief of Police Chapleau Ontario.\n\nI am yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 15, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School, with reference to the return of certain children on the expiry of their holiday leave. It is understood that he refers in this regard to two children of James Gideon of Missinabie, Ontario.\n\nIf you cannot persuade Gideon to return his children to the Chapleau School, you should arrange with the officer in charge of the R.C.M.P. Detachment at Sudbury to bring these children to Chapleau. It is not necessary for the R.C.M.P. to make a special trip to Missinabie for this purpose but, the next time an officer visits that point, he could bring the children back with him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sept. 8-1934\n\nREV. A. J. W. Principal\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby gratefully acknowledge receipt of your permission to pay the railway fare of Charlie Neil to Bala and will send the duly signed receipt for same.\n\nIn the same letter No. 65-1-10 Dated September 7th you ask after quoting a telegram from James Gideon of Timiskaming, if there is any reason the children should not be returned to the school; in reply would say there is absolutely no reason for not doing so. They are now at these I wrote to you in a previous letter in which I made request that you would appoint the Chief of Police Truant Officer so he could compel these children to be sent back to school. They have never asked for leave for holidays and the parents, as shown in the telegram have refused to have them back. The Chief of Police of Chatham made a trip up there for children. All of those whom he went to get came back quietly except this man's two children a boy and a girl. He defied the Chief and said he was out of his territory and that he would not send them but would get in touch with you.\n\nHe makes the ridiculous statement that the children were inflicted with \"bad\" like when they went here. Everyone here knows the reverse is the truth, they went here clean and each time they came back after holidays they had to be cleaned up. He says in a letter to me they went here dirty and for that reason he would not let them come back. You can appoint any person you wish to investigate. I suggest you write the Indian Agent for a character sketch of this man who has given a lot of trouble in the past to the Agent.\n\nIt is my opinion an example should be made of this case and compel the return of these children and avoid more trouble of this sort in the future.\n\nWill you be good enough to give the necessary authority to the Chief and so convince these people they must obey the law.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nSeptember 10th, 1934.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of September 7th,\n65-1-10, re Virginia Pawis, it is the grandparents\nof this child who are applying for her admission\nto Residential School. The mother of the child was\nan Eagle, as far as I can make out, and the Grandparents\non the father's side took the child to keep, but they\nare finding it very hard these days to keep the child\nbecause there is so little work to do.\n\nThis child, Virginia Pawis is a half sister\nof William Jack Stevens. It would be a good thing for\nboth these children if they could be accepted into a\nschool. The Stevens boy has been accepted but is in\nthe hospital at the present time. As soon as he is\nable to go I will send him to the Chapleau School.\nI think it is really advisable to have this girl\nsent to the school, and I would recommend that she be\naccepted.\n\nTrusting this will meet with the approval\nof the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D./X.\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\n[Signature]\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the [Name of Residential School] to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: [Name]\nEnglish name: [Name]\nAge: [Age]\nName of Band: [Name]\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: [Number]\nFather's full name and No.: [Name]\nMother's full name and No.: [Name]\nParents living or dead: [Living/Dead]\nState of child's health: [Good/Bad]\nReligion: [Religion]\nDoes applicant speak English?: [Yes/No]\nPreviously attended: [School Name] for [Number] years\n\n[Signature of Father]\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been overheard interpreted to the parents in question and that their contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n[Signature of Witness]\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

D. Sutherland\nActing Supt of Indian Education\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. A. Allan\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 4, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 10th ultimo, enclosing an application form and certificate of health for the admission of Bernice Kate King to the Chapleau Indian Residential School. I have to say that the Indian Agent at Christian Island reports that the mother is not able to properly care for this girl and he recommends that she be admitted to the Chapleau School. The Department will, therefore, approve of her admission, provided the school authorities can accommodate her.\n\nIt may be that you could arrange to have this girl sent to Chapleau along with Virginia Pawis, whose admission was approved by official letter of the 18th ultimo. It might be advisable to communicate with the Principal and ascertain if he can accept these girls. Accounts covering the cost of their transportation should be forwarded in the usual manner. All expenditures in this connection should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nI will keep myself posted as to the condition of the Stevens boy and as soon as he is clear of the doctor's care I will send him along with Bernice King to the school.\n\nRev. Canan Vale assures me that they have room for Bernice King and will be glad to have her.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/BK.\nAgent.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nOctober 6, 1934,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir;\n\nReplying to yours of October 4th, 55-1-10 re the admission of Bernice Kate Ains, to the Chapleau Indian Residential School, I have to state that Rev. Canon Vale has been a guest at my home for the last two or three days, and I was patiently waiting to receive this letter so that I would be able to send Bernice King to the Chapleau Indian Residential School along with Virginia Pawis.\n\nRev. Canon Vale left here on the Thursday morning train for Chapleau, with Virginia Pawis. Jack Stevens who met with an accident and has his hand practically blown away, and who has been in hospital up until a few days ago was also supposed to go to the school. I endeavoured to have him released from the Doctor's care in order to go to Chapleau with Virginia Pawis. I explained to Dr. Mason that they had a good hospital up there and had a trained nurse resident at the school, but he refused to allow the boy to go and said he would not be able to go for about a month. He is at present at home at Shawanaga Reserve, but has to attend the doctor for dressings. I presume that by the end of this month, he will be clear of the care of Dr. Mason and I will send him to Chapleau Residential School as arranged, and at that time will send Bernice King along with him, as he seems to be a bright little lad and would be able to look after her.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nOct. 10, 1934\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nREV. A. J. VALE (Principal)\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI found awaiting me here a letter from you under date of September 8th saying you approved of the admission of the two boys James and Phillip Davey, but would not pay their transportation to our school.\n\nMay I ask what proportion, or what is the limit you would be willing to consider a fair amount to pay for children coming to this school. It is difficult to get the children from close in as they have access to day schools.\n\nThe children at Moose Factory and vicinity are anxious to get education but the school there is filled to capacity. Hence they were sent on to us.\n\nI shall be very glad if you can see your way clear to giving me a part of the costs at least.\n\nMay I also ask if you have taken any steps towards helping me to get back to school the two Gideon Children from Mississinewa.\n\nWill you be good enough to send me two REGISTERS for marking the daily attendance of the pupils at school.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. A. J. Vale\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 15, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, I beg to say that you may submit to the Department your account for the transportation expenses of James and Phillip Davey to the Chapleau Indian Residential School. On receipt of this, the Department will consider what amount can be allowed.\n\nBringing children from Moose Factory to Chapleau is apt to be rather costly, and, while I recognize that the school at Moose Factory is filled to capacity, at the same time our Appropriation will not permit us to provide travelling expenses for taking children to a residential school situated at a long distance from their homes.\n\nRegarding the Gideon children, Mr. Agent Godfrey was instructed in official letter of the 15th ultimo to arrange with the officer in charge of the R.O.M.P. Detachment at Sudbury to return these children to your school. You might make enquiries from Mr. Agent Godfrey with a view to ascertaining what action he is taking in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

I wired Rev. Canon Vale when he would arrive.\n\nI had arranged for Bertha King, daughter of Bertha King, to be sent to the Chapleau School along with the Stevens boy, but Bertha King did not turn up at the station this morning at 3:06. Elijah Taboingdong, Bertha King's brother-in-law has been to this office this morning explaining why the child was not sent. It appears they have been looking after the child and have objections to Bertha King making arrangements for the child to go to Chapleau. They state they want her to go to the Shingwauk Home. As the child is a minor and not of the age to go to school, and the Department has been very good in arranging for this child to go to the Chapleau school so that Bertha King can go out to work, I stated to Elijah Taboingdong that the possibilities were that the Department would not allow her to go to the Shingwauk Home.\n\nThe reason for Elijah Taboingdong wishing the child to go to the Shingwauk Home is because his sister Mrs. Galna King had two children at the Chapleau School, and one died at the school, and the other died shortly after coming home from the school. They are prejudiced against the Chapleau School.\nOttawa, November 15, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your T-5677 of the 9th instant, with reference to Bernice Kate King. It is noted that this child's guardians do not wish to send her to the Chapleau School.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to approve her admission to Shingweauk Home at the present time. In any case, she is only four years of age and if Elijah Tabobingdong is so interested in her as to prevent her going to Chapleau, the Department considers that he can look after her for a time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dec. 12-1934\n\nREV. A.J. VALL\u2014Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA letter has come through from the Mrs. Charles Gideon of Frank Ontario, parent of Robert Gideon, a pupil in our school No.153. In this letter she claims her son is 16 years of age and wants him to come here. According to our records he is not that full age. She claims his birthday is December of this year and it will be his 16th. That does not correspond with our record. These people have a way of trying to place the age to suit their own purpose. In this letter she says the Indian Agent promised her the boy would be allowed to go home. I spoke to him about it and he emphatically said he had done nothing of the sort.\n\nI told the woman I would try to secure the discharge for this boy next summer but I felt sure you would not let him go at Christmas time as she had not sent him back to school at the right time this fall and the Department had to send for him. I shall be very grateful if you will uphold my stand in this case.\n\nIn her letter to her son she spoke of trying to get Mr. Selkirk of Frank to write to you and say the boy was needed at home to help the father. That is not true to the facts. It is merely an effort on her part to get her own way and have the boy here. The boy is quite happy here and needs the extra schooling.\n\nI am yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 14th, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department approves of Robert Gideon - No. 153 - remaining at the Chapleau Indian Residential School until June 30th, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Vail, Principal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 65-1-IO Dated January 15th inquiring as to why the name of Calvin Fogahosh No. 132 did not appear on the report for the last quarter, I beg to state he was one of the boys who tried his entrance and obtained over 70 per cent but your department suggested he was too old to go on. He was 17 years of age now and it was thought he would be too old. I therefore acquiesced in your wish and arranged for him to remain at his home whither he had gone for his summer vacation at his own expense.\n\nI am of the opinion I made reference to this in some of my correspondence on the matter and considered that would be all that you required.\n\nI trust my action will meet with your approval. I did it to save expense to the Department rather than have the boy done back without going to school.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 22, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, I beg to say that the discharge of Calvin Hoganash, No. 132, from the Chapleau Indian Residential School is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nChristian Island, Ontario\nJanuary 7th, 1935\n\nI have been asked by Wilson Assance Band to ask the Department of Indian Affairs if they could consider sending his three boys to a Residential School. The following are names and ages of boys, Solomon Assance age 13 years, Samuel Assance 11 years, Lazarus Assance 9 years of age.\n\nI have had occasion to visit this man's home on different occasions and found it to be in a very filthy condition and certainly no place for children of this age. Assance apparently is not a very good manager and we have helped him out with clothes and so that they could attend school.\n\nHis Mother Mrs. Lazarus Assance who lives with them is very old and totally incapable of looking after the children consequently they go to school more often than not without anything to eat.\n\nI have had this man get his house cleaned up several times but it soon is as filthy as ever so I think the Department would be doing a very great favor to these children if they were able to send them to a Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Assance, apparently, is not a very good manager and we have had to help him out with clothes and shoes so that they could attend school.\n\n\"His mother, Mrs. Laurier Assance, who lives with them, is very old and totally incapable of looking after the children; consequently, they go to school more often than not without anything to eat.\n\n\"I have had this man get his house cleaned up several times but it soon is as filthy as ever, so I think the Department would be doing a very great favour to these children if they were to grant the request of the father to send them to a residential school.\"\n\nIn view of the above report, the Department considered that it was in the best interests of these boys to have them placed in a residential school and, as the Chapleau School was the only one at which there were vacancies, they were sent there. This school is well managed and the boys will receive every possible care and a good education. Owing to lack of accommodation at other schools, it will not be possible to arrange for their transfer. As for allowing them home on holidays, the Department considers that, in view of the report regarding home conditions, you will agree that such action would not be in the boys' best interests.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Parents who did not send their children back on time last year and made it necessary for us to get the Police to bring them have been refused permission to have them home this summer on that account.\n\nNaturally they are not happy over it. They say they will write you and ask for their children and if not allowed to go home they want them discharged. None of the children are yet of the age of 16 years and the parents are on relief in the different places.\n\nThe names of the two families are:\n1) Mr James Gideon Missanabie Ontario.\n2) Mr Thomas Saunders Bicholson Ontario.\n\nThe Indian Agent and I hope you will not accede to any request made by the above parties in the matter of the release of the children. They defied us last year when we wrote them to bring the children in the Fall and now are trying to get you to consent to let them have the children.\n\nThe Indian Agent and I have repeatedly told them and others children will not be allowed home on holidays if not returned on time.

In this connection, I have to say that, when your children were allowed home for holidays last year, it was necessary to obtain the services of the Police to have them brought back to school. They are receiving every care and attention at the Chapleau School, and the Department is not prepared to authorize the Principal to allow them home for holidays in order to grant them their discharge.

Sept. 25-1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing for your consideration the following applications for admission into our school. You will see they have all been examined and passed by the doctor at Moose Factory except the one girl Ethel Mark by Doctor Bell of Chapleau. The reason for this was that there was a good chance to send her by an escort at the time and the Doctor of Moose Factory was absent so advantage was taken to send her along at less expense. I trust this will meet with your approval. The girl is a very healthy and promising student.\n\nEthel Mark Age 15 years.

A. J. Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nAKB/O'M.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find the Report for our school for the quarter ending September 30th 1935.\n\nI was away for a vacation so am a little late in getting this report in this time. I beg to draw your attention to a few things in connection with it.\n\nFirst I wish to acknowledge your letter in which you gave reasons why it was difficult to grant the extra for High School in the case of Walter Heil No.65-I-22 Died Oct. 2-1935. I beg to say I am taking up the matter with the Authorities here and trust you will allow him to remain in our school until I can give fuller report on his case. His No. is II6 and is listed on this report.\n\nI have inserted two names, George Iserhoff No. 221 and Grace Minnie Iserhoff No.079. These have not yet been approved by you.\n\nIn explanation I beg to state Bishop Anderson was in touch with the father quite before they were sent to us. They had no means of having them examined by a Doctor and sent them to us at the father's expense entirely. I have had them examined by the Doctors here and they are found suitable candidates for our school. The application forms are filled out and are now in transit back to the father to be properly attested and returned to me. I will forward same as soon as I get them. I know this is irregular. I could not well avoid it and I hope you will accept them under these circumstances. The father has for a long time tried to get these children into this school. The mother is dead.\n\nNo.142 Redfern Louttit is over the age limit of 18 years. I am asking for his discharge. I have arranged for him to go to Wycliffe College Toronto to train for the Ministry of the Church.\n\nRightly or otherwise I was under the impression the Department would carry pupils on after 18 years of age if they were attending High School hence my action in these two cases. I beg pardon for apparent error.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT\n\n| No. | NAME | BAND | STATE OF EDUCATION | TRADE OR INDUSTRY | PLACE OF RESIDENCE | AGE | SEX | DEPT |\n|-----|------|------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----|-----|------|\n|     |      |      |                   |                  |                    |     |     |      |\n\n### SCHOOL DURING\n\n| No. | NAME | BAND | STATE OF EDUCATION | TRADE OR INDUSTRY | PLACE OF RESIDENCE | AGE | SEX | DEPT |\n|-----|------|------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----|-----|------|\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME | BAND | STATE OF EDUCATION | TRADE OR INDUSTRY | PLACE OF RESIDENCE | AGE | SEX | DEPT |\n|-----|------|------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----|-----|------|\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 1935\n\n| No. | Name | Band | Date of Admission | Remarks |\n|-----|------|------|-------------------|---------|\n|     |      |      |                   |         |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name | Band | Date of Discharge | Remarks |\n|-----|------|------|-------------------|---------|\n|     |      |      |                   |         |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChapleau, Ont. Oct. 15-1935\n\nREV. A. J. VALE Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn checking over the Report of this school for the quarter ending September 30th which went forward a few days ago, I found the name of Francis McLeod No. 0132 went through without an explanatory note to show why her name is still on the list although granted a discharge. The reason is this. Her father wanted her home in the Summer then wrote and asked for her to be kept here a little longer until he had things comfortable for her. This she did. He found it necessary to be away from home and will not return until Christmas time so I acceded to his wish on condition he should pay her fare home at that time. He has agreed to this. I have therefore kept her here and am giving her special instruction in the Domestic work preparatory to her going home. I trust this may meet with your approval.\n\nI would like to ask permission to keep Charlie Moore No. 160 who is over 16 years of age so that he may fit himself for Farm work as he wishes to carry on when he leaves us.\n\nNo. 187, Stanley White Age 15 passed the High School Entrance this spring but did not get the $70 per cent to entitle him to the grant so he has asked to be allowed to stay and learn farm work so he can take a position as a farmer when he gets old enough to do that.\n\nI shall be very grateful if you can give favourable consideration to the above requests. I may add neither of these boys have a home to go to and it does not seem wise to turn them off so young. I will do my best to locate them as soon as I can.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nNau, Ont., Oct. 15-1935\n\nRev. A.J. Vale Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn going over my accounts I find the following are outstanding for travelling expenses of children coming to this school. I shall be very grateful if you can let me have refund for same in due time. They are as follows:\n\nCochrane August 7th 1935 for Eight Children from Cochrane to North Bay 30.40\nNorth Bay to Charlevoix August 8th 31.20\nOne Child from Moosonee to Cochrane refunded by Bishop to Missionary sending the child (Rev. G. Thompson) 2.05\nOther fare was paid by relatives of children\nBy Rev. Canon Vale Chaplain to North Bay & return as escort 8.65\nTotal 37.25\n\nI have made myself responsible to the Bishop for the whole amount so if you will be good enough to send it to me I can inform his Lordship and forward his part to him or if you prefer you can send direct to him the two accounts taken from above.\n\nCochrane to North Bay for eight children 30.40\nRefund to Rev. G. Thompson 2.05\n32.45\n\nand the balance to me personally.\n\nI regret these are overdue. I was away on vacation and things got a little behind especially as we had an epidemic of measles and mumps among the children here. No serious complications have so far arisen.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. Vouchers are enclosed.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Rev. Canon A. J.

Iserhoff, No. 0199, will be forwarded as soon as they have been signed by their father.\n\nIn view of the manner in which the receipts have been prepared, it will be necessary to issue two cheques in payment of the travelling expenses. One cheque for $32.45 is being forwarded to His Lordship Bishop Anderson and the other cheque for $39.85 to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, October 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nOn February 26, 1925, you signed an application form for the admission of Walter Hall to the Chapleau Indian Residential School. The application form states that he is a son of Mr. 67, Gilbert Road. On looking up the pay list from this date it is shown that only one worker is entered. Has Walter Hall a separate number or is there some reason why he has not been paid?\n\nThe question of whether or not he is a recognized member of the Band has arisen due to the fact that application has been made for an artificial limb for him. As you are aware, the boy is now twenty years of age and is still at the Chapleau School, but the Department is endeavouring to make arrangements to have him discharged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJohn M.

Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nPP/O&M.\nFlorence Evelyn Snache - B\n\nSuggested Plan:\n\nIf Muriel could be admitted to the school at Chapleau Mrs. Snache would pay what she could for her expenses and will continue to maintain and be responsible for Myra in Toronto. John is able to provide for himself and Mr. Snache is living with his father and appears to be irresponsible and incapable of giving Muriel the advantages that her intelligence requires. It is felt that if she could complete her matriculation and receive training that she would be a considerable asset to her own people as a school teacher, a profession she is very anxious to enter.\n\n(Miss) P.M. Leino\n\nFML/BR\nWeight at birth 6 lbs., term normal, no complications. Talking, sitting and walking early. Lived on Georgina Island, then came to Sutton when about six years old; did not know English then but passed her Entrance Examinations at 11 yrs. Was in Second Form at High School in May last but had to leave as her mother was working in Toronto and her father was sick. Principal of Sutton Continuation School gives following report: October 22, 1935. Muriel has been credited for the following Departmental subjects: Geography, Art, Botany, British History.\n\nHer term reports are:\n\nForm I, 1933 - 34 - English Composition 68, 58, 71, (67) average\nEnglish Literature 63, 68, 64, (66)\nAlgebra 75, 90, 100, (91)\nGeography 64, 64, 69, (68)\nBritish History 67, 70, 81, (75)\nArt 55, 70, 53, (59)\nLatin 60, 60, 76, (77)\nFrench 94, 78, 68, (86)\nBotany 55, 82, 75, (70)\n\nForm II, 1934 - 35 - Arithmetic 50\nPhy. Geography 78\nZoology 55\nLatin 75\n(Report incomplete due to lack of attendance).\n\nPsychological Report:\nChronological Age - 13 - 0 mos\nMental Age - 13 - 3 mos\nIntelligence Quotient - 118\n\nTest results show special ability in mathematics. She is an unusually attractive Indian girl of superior intelligence who has evidently had excellent training. She should be encouraged in her ambition to be a teacher.\n\nFinancial Situation:\nMother has been supporting the children for about four years as father does not take responsibility and is not working. She placed both girls in Earlscourt Home when they came to Toronto in July 1936. She then obtained position as nursemaid for Muriel. The Board of Education refused a permit for work for her and her mother could not pay more than $18. a month, which she was paying for Myra, as she is only earning $50. a month and has to buy her own clothes and help the boy John. When at Sutton Muriel received $7.50 a month from the Indian Agent to enable her to attend High School. This was later discontinued when she left school to look after her father. Mrs. Smache thinks she could give about $8.50 a month towards Muriel's board. The relatives are unable to help and if she were sent back to them she could not attend High School.\n\nReligion:\nParents are United Church but Muriel has been confirmed in the Anglican Church.\nSUMMARY FOR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION TO INDIAN SCHOOL AT CHARLEBOIS\n\nPREPARED BY\n\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY OF TORONTO\n\nNovember 6, 1935.\n\nName:\nFlorence Evelyn Snache (known as Mariel), an Ojibway Indian,\nBorn - February 8, 1928, in Orillia. (Birth verified.)\n\nReason for Application:\nMr. and Mrs. Snache are separated. Mrs. Snache has obtained a position as domestic with Mrs. Chapman, 295 Harbourfront St. East, Toronto. She is unable to support Mariel and is anxious that she shall continue her High School work. Children's Aid Society admitted her to shelter temporarily as she could not stay with her mother and was too young and talented to be granted working permit.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n\nMother:\nMartha Charles, born 1898 in Canada, married Mr. Snache in 1919, has supported the two girls for about four years working as domestic. A year ago she had a position in Toronto and sent money home but became ill and had to have an operation. She returned to Sutton for the summer then obtained position with Mrs. Chapman who has a summer home there. Mrs. Chapman has known the family for many years. She says mother's people are very reliable and economically fine and capable and that mother is an excellent servant. She pays her $30.00 a month. Mother did not go through Public School but can read and write.\n\nFather:\nEdward John Snache, born in Rama, 1898. Went to Public School. Went to the war with the United States Army and had a pension which is discontinued now. He is not working and lives with his father at Rama doing odd jobs. Has never had steady work.\n\nSiblings:\nJohn Edward, born January 15, 1930, has been keeping himself for summer, caddying at Jackson's Point, but mother has to help with clothing.\n\nMariel, born February 8, 1928.\n\nMyra, born November 16, 1924, on Georgina Island, Lake Simcoe. Is in Earlscourt Home, Toronto, where mother has placed her. She wants this child to remain in Toronto.\n\nRelatives:\nMaternal grandfather, Jacob Charles (dead) was born on Snake Island.\n- grandmother, Mary Fort, was born on Georgina Island.\n\nPaternal grandfather, Edward Snache, born at Rama, and lives there.\n- Address: R.R. #1, Atherley.\n- grandmother, Flora L. Sandy (dead).\n\nPERSONAL HISTORY:\nFlorence Evelyn Snache (Mariel) was born in Orillia, February 8, 1928.\nNovember 9, 1935.\n\nReverend Canon Gould,\nc/o Church House,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nEnclosed please find summary for application for Muriel's admission to the Indian School at Chapleau. If you require further information Mrs. Snache would be glad to give it to you.\n\nMuriel is only in our care temporarily. We feel she should continue High School and hope your Board will be able to consider this application favourably.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY OF TORONTO\n\n(Miss) Nora Lee, Supervisor,\nProtection Department.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nTORONTO 5, ONT., November 13th, 1935.\n\nMr. A.F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe case of the Indian girl, Muriel Snache, described in the enclosed papers, was brought to my attention by the Children's Aid Society of Toronto. The papers were prepared in response to my request.\n\nI now beg to submit the case to the sympathetic attention of the Deputy Superintendent General in the hope that the desire of the mother may be granted and the girl admitted to the Indian Residential School at Chapleau. I shall appreciate being informed what is done in this case.\n\nI am forwarding copies of the enclosed papers, together with copy of this letter, to the Rev. Dr. Westgate, Secretary of our Indian Residential School Commission.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nSG-G\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, November 16, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to Muriel Snache. Provided there is accommodation for her in the Chapleau School within the number for which grant is provided, the Department has no objection to her being placed there.\n\nDuring the academic year 1934-35, the Department allowed a grant for this girl to assist her in attending the Sutton High School. However, a report received from the Indian Agent on June 24th, last, stated that she had not attended regularly for the months of May and June and that she did not intend to write any examinations at the end of the year. As I presume she has not attended school since the first of September, I doubt the advisability of her attending high school in Chapleau this year.\n\nThe Department's position in this matter is that we have no objection to caring for the girl in the Chapleau School, but, at the present time, we are not satisfied that her past actions justify us in deciding now whether or not we will be responsible for her maintenance and tuition until such time as she completes a high school course. If you decide to send her to Chapleau, the Department's position as outlined in the preceding paragraph should be kept in mind.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nTHE CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY OF TORONTO\n\n32 Isabella St., Toronto 5,\nNovember 26, 1935.\n\nReverend Dr. Westgate,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate,-\n\nCanon Gould has forwarded to us a copy of a letter received by him from Lr. Sutherland. We understand you also have a copy of this letter and as there are some details in it which are not actually correct, we are writing to explain.\n\nMuriel has been attending Jarvis Collegiate Institute here since coming to our Shelter. She has picked up this term's work and feels rather confident that she can do the first term exams in December with the exception of perhaps Geometry and Physiography, which she says are taught differently here. She, herself, is ambitious and wants to get on, and although it would appear she has not taken advantage of what the Department provided in Sutton, nevertheless we believe there are extenuating circumstances as Lr. Snache tells us that she had been working in Toronto, sending money to keep up the house. She became ill, went to the hospital here for an operation and when discharged was with a friend here for a few weeks until she was able to go home. Before her return Mr. Snache was ill and not working. They could not get relief and she, herself, was just recovering from her operation and unable to work. She lived in such poverty it was out of the question for Muriel to continue at school. She had no clothes and they had barely enough to eat. They could not pay the rent and could not keep the home. Eventually Lr. Snache obtained work with a family who have brought her to Toronto with them. She brought both of the girls with her and Lr. Snache went to live with relatives.\n\nMuriel was particularly anxious to go to Chapleau as some friends of hers had gone there and this school has also been most highly spoken of by others. We are hoping that you can arrange to admit her after the Christmas holidays so that she can begin the new term in the High School there.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY OF TORONTO\n\n(Sgd) Nora Lea\n\n(Miss) Nora Lea, Supervisor,\nProtection Department\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nWinnipeg, Man., November 30, 1926.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 18th inst., No. 65-1-10 re the above, and addressed to Canon Gould, General Secretary of our Society, I am taking the liberty of sending you herewith a copy of a letter from Miss Nora Lea, Supervisor of the Protection Department of the Children's Aid Society of Toronto, which furnishes some important information about the applicant in question which appears to have been omitted from earlier communications submitted to you.\n\nWhen our General Secretary forwarded to me all the correspondence relating to this case, and asked me to deal further with the same, I was inclined to recommend to your Department that this Indian girl be admitted to our new Shingwauk School, but in view (1) of the large number of Indian girls recently sent to this school by your Department and (2) in view of the fact, set forth in the closing paragraph of the enclosed letter, that the girl herself was anxious to go to Chapleau as she had friends there, I changed my opinion.\n\nSome time ago I notified the Principal of our Chapleau School of the possibility of this girl being admitted to that institution, and in the light of the information set forth in the enclosed letter, it appears to me that the case is one deserving of your help, and I sincerely trust you may be able to provide it, by authorizing her admission to our Chapleau School from the 1st of January next so that she may be able to attend High School in Chapleau along with the other two girls for whom I understand you have authorized the usual High School grant.\n\nI commend the application to your sympathetic consideration and have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, December 3, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with further reference to Muriel Smothe.\n\nThe admission of this girl to the Chapleau Indian Residential School is approved from January 1st, next, provided she is not in excess of the number for which grant is allowed.\n\nIn view of the information contained in the letter which you have received from the Children's Aid Society, the Department approves of her attending high school at Chapleau and the usual advanced educational grant will be allowed for her from January 1st to June 30th. At that time a report should be obtained from the Principal of the Chapleau High School giving detailed information regarding the work that this girl has done during the six months' period mentioned above. Further assistance to permit her continuing in high school will depend on the success that she attains during the six months' period she attends the school during the present academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I am considering if it is kinder to ask you to find some way to have him sent back to his home than for me to go on and prosecute him and have him sent to a Reform School. He is getting to be a regular nuisance around here and is leading other boys into bad habits of petty stealing and trying to break open locked doors.\n\nI shall be very glad if you can arrange to have him removed. It seems to me better to send him home than to let him go or and then convict him and send him down. What do you think?\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrindly Val.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nJan. 16, 1936,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find communication received this morning from Rev.

I would respectfully request that the Department advise what should be done with this boy. So far as I can see the best thing to do is to send him back home. If the Department think it advisable for him to be sent home will they please let me know what their wishes are.\n\nI have replied to Canon Vale's letter, stating that I am taking the matter up with the Department, and advised him to do nothing until I receive word from the Department.\n\nThe consideration of the Department at their earliest will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M./E.K.\n\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, January 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the case of Harrison Deaire, of the Gibson Band, who is at present a pupil of the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

This girl came to us March 27-1928. She was\nborn on February 10-1922 so is now in her fifteenth year. She is\nin the seventh grade.\n\nWe have had considerable trouble with her due to her\nstubbornness. I have tried severe whipping and various methods of\npunishments such as extra work instead of play, being sent to bed\nearly and loss of extra privileges but all seem to have failed\nto cure her of exhibitions of temper and passive resistance to\nthe rules of the classroom and school in general. She has now\nopenly defied my orders to go to school even in the face of the\nknowledge that this would mean her having to leave the school\nentirely with a possible going to a reform school. This has had\nover her no effect.\n\nI am of the opinion it would be better to arrange for her\nto be sent back to her own people at Rupert's House where she belong.\nWith your permission I will arrange for that to be done as soon as\nI can do so.\n\nI am now writing to request Reverend Bishop Anderson at\nCochrane to see when she could be sent back with some hope of getting\nher back. Have I your permission to send her before the end of\nthe term? I think something must be done as it is practically a\nquestion into question before the other pupils our power to demand\nand obtain obedience to proper discipline.\n\nI have not submitted this to Indian Agent Godfrey as she\nis not one of his Indians and in previous instances of a similar\nnature he has said it did not come under him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Principal)\nOttawa, April 28th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th instant, the Department approves the discharge of Nancy Weskechan - No. 0144, from the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you will arrange with Rt. Rev. Bishop Anderson to return her to her own people. The Department is not prepared to pay her transportation except by railroad to Moosonee. In view of her age, it should not be necessary to have anyone accompany her, but it would be advisable for you to communicate with Dr. W. L. Tyer two or three weeks before she leaves the school, advising him of the probable time of her arrival at Moosonee.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

So I told her plainly I had your permission to send her away from the school but also had a letter from the Bishop asking me to give her another chance. I put it up to her to take her choice. She had cooled down in the meantime and was quite ready to do as she is told if allowed to remain here instead of being sent away.\n\nI still think it will be wise to send her at the end of June. I note you are not prepared to pay her transportation beyond Moosonee, and I think that is fair and will not ask for more.\n\nYour letter was dated April 28th, 1936 and is No. 65-1-10\n\nI thank you for your cooperation in this matter and am persuaded it has had a good effect on all the pupils for they know this girl has made the choice to remain and submit to the proper discipline of the school and class room.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Residential School Commission\nMissionary Society of The Church of England in Canada\nChristian Island\nJune 1936\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWilson Assance #111 has three boys at St John Indian School Chapleau Ont and he wants to know if he can have those boys home for their holidays and then have them transferred to Muncey School as their Grand Mother a very old lady cannot go to Chapleau to see them but could go to Muncey.\n\nYours obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 30th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your recent letter, the Department is not prepared to consider transferring the three children of Wilson Assance from the Chapleau Indian Residential School to the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Principal Cole is now away in Dawson on a holiday and will not be back until August 1st, in time for the opening of the school, so I cannot write a letter without loss of much time.\n\nI secured a girl, Madeline Kekapow, 12 years of age, at Kitasiniwi; and a boy, Edward North, 15 years, and his sister, Annie, 9 years, at Chibosoman; and an orphan girl, both father and mother dead, Frances Miller, 4 years, at Wawamagisi, who has two brothers at Chaplain now. These are willing to come to the school at Chaplain. They all seem to be healthy. The father with two children at Chibosoman can pay their transportation, if he can hold his job at one of the little mines in that district; but no others are without funds. You can all travel by plane, Canadian Airways, Wawamagisi to Bennettite and Kitasiniwi or Chibosoman to Athabasca, and then by train via Cochrane and Portage Chapel.\n\nCan you accept these children and need lost of transportation?\n\nWith best wishes,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDiocese of Maconnee\n\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nJuly 3rd, 1936\nCOPY SENT TO MR.

Please let me know, also, the approximate cost of sending each of the children to Chapleau. Our Appropriation for transportation expenses is quite limited, and we require this information before being in a position to decide.

At the time the boys were placed in the school at Chapleau, the Agent reported that their home conditions were most unsatisfactory and it was at his urgent desire that the boys be placed in the school. It was not possible, at that time, to have them admitted to the Pointe-Plaine Residential School, as that school was filled to its full capacity.\n\nThe boys are receiving every care and attention and a good education at the Chapleau Residential School. The Department can see no necessity for making the transfer at the present time, as requested by Wilson Assance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo. A. McLean, Esq., M.P.O.,\n14 B Peter St., South,\nOrillia, Ont.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nChapleau... to which the three boys were sent, in January, 1936. They are receiving every care and attention and as good a training at Chapleau as they would at Mount Elgin. It is only a whim of the father to have them transferred to the latter. The Mount Elgin School is for the benefit of the Indian children of the Caribou, Saulteau and Selkirk Island Agencies, and there are more than sufficient children among the orphaned and neglected or those who are at too great a distance to attend day schools, to fill the Mount Elgin school. The Department can see no great need for the transfer of the children from the school in which they are at present to the Mount Elgin School.\n\nI attach hereto a draft reply for Mr. Pratt's signature to Mr. Kelton, J. F., also the correspondence in connection with the above matter.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 9, 1906.\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General:\n\nI have R.F. Pratt's memorandum of the 6th instant, with attached communication from Mr. George A. Leaman, R.F., and copy of letter he received from Nelson Assamoe, an Indian of the Christian Island Band - requesting that his three boys, who were placed in the Indian residential school at Chapleau, Ont., be transferred to the Mount Algic Indian Residential School, Huron, Ont., because of the fact that the latter school is closer to Christian Island and not so expensive when the father visits the children or when the children return to their home during the holidays.\n\nI may say that in January, 1905, three boys of Nelson Assamoe - not Nelson - were placed in the Indian residential school at Chapleau, Ont. The local Indian Agent reported on the home conditions of the boys and stated that he visited the man's house on different occasions and found it to be in a very filthy condition and certainly no place for the children; that their mother was dead and the grandmother, who lived with them, was very old and totally incapable of looking after them. The Agent stated that it would be doing a very great favour if the children were placed in a residential school. The Mount Algic School was filled to capacity and the only institution at which there was accommodation was the residential school at\n\n- Chapleau\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge receipt of official letter No.65-1-10 of July 7th, and in reply I regret to say that I find it hard to persuade the Indians of this Agency that they should take advantage of the opportunity of having their children educated in the Chapleau Industrial school, and while there are many children of school age most of them attend the public schools in the locality where they live.\n\nThere are exceptions of course where there are quite a number of children of school age which are not attending school. I have reference to the children of the Metagami Band and the Kapuskasing Indians, and these Indians do not wish to send their children out to the Chapleau school, but are awaiting the consideration of the Department in building a school at each of these points.\n\nAt all other points in the Agency except the above there are public schools where the Indians reside which makes it difficult to recruit sufficient children from the Agency to keep up the full number at the school.\n\nPossibly if the Principal were to go out among the different bands and talk to the parents personally better results would be accomplished, but I find it very hard to impress upon the parents that they should take advantage of the opportunity to have their children well educated and well cared for, but I do believe better results would be accomplished were the Principal to make personal visits to the families with eligible children.\n\nThe Secretary, Your obedient servant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nDiocese of Moose Cree\n\nJOHN Q. ANDERSON\nBishop\nWaskesiu\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nJuly 10th, 1936\n\nTo Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th inst., I have to say that\nEdward Chabot, Montagnais, Quebec, and Annie Monk, Chipewyan, Quebec, are more Indian than\nwhite and their parents live in Indian style of dressing and\nhunting. The father, at present, is caretaking at a small mine\nat Banff Lake, which has been closed down, and he got\nthe job because it happened to be in his trafficking grounds\nand he can speak a little English. These children are\njust as much wards of the Government as those in the\nChaplain school from the Poveshull district.\n\nRegarding the distance, the question is, are these children\nwhose parents desire an education for them, to be denied for that\nreason. There is no school at present at Montagnais, which these\nchildren could attend. The father of the Monk children could perhaps\npay a contribution or send to Edmonton, which his pay is very small,\nI understand. The father of Chabot has no money. The Canadian Airways\ncalls passengers in their flight planes to Edmonton for $5.00. The rail fare from\nEdmonton to Chaplin will be about $25.00.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Q. Anderson\nOttawa, July 24, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves the admission of Evadne Shekapow, of Mistassini, to the Chapleau Indian Residential School, provided she is in good health. If at all possible, she should be medically examined before she leaves for the school, to make certain regarding her physical condition.\n\nAfter carefully considering the information contained in Your Lordship's letter, the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of the two Mark children to an Indian residential school.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of sending Evadne Shekapow to Chapleau will be approximately $35.00, which amount will be paid upon receipt, from you, of an account, in triplicate, giving full details.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Principal, and under the circumstances I agree with him that it would not be good policy to discharge these children as the oldest boy is only 14 years of age and the other two younger, and they would receive no further education were they discharged in addition to this the father is not in a position to properly take care of them and keep them as this family are on regular monthly receipt of relief.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the request of Henry Saylors for the discharge of his three children from the Chapleau Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, in view of the circumstances as mentioned by you, the Department is not prepared to comply with Saylors' request for the discharge of his three children and they are to remain for the coming school year, at least, in the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

Vale Principal\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to report, one of our pupils Joseph Kegeshyoongza No. 145 (who is just under 14 years of age) has given us considerable trouble by watching his chance to sneak away from the school and try to get back to his home. He was sent away in 1925 from the Shequindah Reserve through Indian Agent John M. Daly, Perry Sound.\n\nHe has now made three attempts to get away. The last was on Sunday afternoon November 29th. He succeeded in getting as far as Nemoos on the railway 16 miles from here. He was caught there and the Police brought him back to us the same evening. This was most fortunate as the night turned out a very cold one. Temperature went down to 43\u00b0 below zero. You will see what the result would have been if exposed to that all night.\n\nThe consensus of opinion of the Indian Agent, T.J. Godfrey, the Police and myself is that he ought to be removed to safer quarters. They advised me to write you and send a copy of this letter to Indian Agent John M. Daly, asking for his early removal to prevent serious consequences. Once in the summer he eluded us overnight, that would be very dangerous in this weather.\n\nThis boy, in my opinion, is not criminally minded but mentally deficient and desperately homesick. We cannot safeguard him and will welcome your speedy action to place him somewhere under proper surveillance. In the meantime we shall do our best to keep a close watch on him by keeping him indoors as much as we can and well guarded.\n\nLooking for an early reply I am yours very sincerely,\n\nA.J. Vale\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 4, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant regarding Joseph Legesh-younga, the Department is writing Mr. Agent Daly, and on receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa, December 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School with reference to Joseph Kegeshyounga. At the time he was placed in the Chapleau School his family was residing on the Renvey Inlet Reserve, and, in this connection, I would refer you to your letter of November 18, 1925, and official reply of December 11, 1925.\n\nI understand from Mr. Vail that you have received a copy of his letter to the Department, and I would appreciate if you would have the boy placed with his father, as it is considered advisable to discharge him from the Chapleau School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nOttawa, November 25, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department is now in receipt of a report from Agent Poste with reference to the illegitimate son of Mrs. Austin Boyle (nee Blanch Solomon) of the Cape Croker Band.\n\nI enclose an application form and certificate of health. You should have the application form completed and signed by the mother and you should, also, arrange to have the boy medically examined at the mother's expense, and the certificate of health form completed. This should then be returned for our consideration. If the boy is pronounced physically fit, you will be informed regarding the Indian school in which he can be placed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

No. 5, Wiarton, Ont.\nNovember 18th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of Departmental letter no. 13-0-10, dated Nov. 5th, inst., with the enclosure of a letter received from Mr. John W. McPherson of Leaford, Ont., regarding the illegitimate child of Mrs. Austin Boyle, (nee Blanch Solomon), of the Cape Croker Band, no. 300, who now lives in Leaford.\n\nThis boy of Mrs. Boyle's, is known by the name of Eric Waukey, and until his death, he lived with the late Mr. Waukey of the Cape Croker Band who died on October 18th, ult. Following the death of Mr. Waukey, I presume Eric was sent to his mother at Leaford, who was married some time ago to a white man, Austin Boyle, who I have been given to understand is in fairly comfortable circumstances. The boy is around ten years of age and was born some years previous to his mother's marriage to Mr. Boyle, and the family are adherents of the English Church. Eric has attended the Sidney Bay Day School on Cape Croker Reserve since he started to school, and I have been given to understand that the father was a Cape Croker Indian.\n\nThe Secretary,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nJOHN M. McPHERSON, B.A.\nBARRISTER, SOLICITOR, NOTARY\nMEAFORD, CANADA\n\nNovember 10th, 1936.\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reply to my enquiry and note that you are taking this matter up with Mr. A. G. Poste, Indian Agent, Cape Croker, Ont.\n\nI understand that it was Mr. Poste who directed the child in question to my client, Mr. Austin Boyle, of Meaford. I have written to Mr. Poste today with the information you requested and shall be glad to hear from you further after consideration of this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.McP/33\nJOHN M. McPHERSON, B.A.\nBARRISTER, SOLICITOR, NOTARY\nMEAFORD, CANADA\n\nOctober 30th, 1936.\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Canada,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI should appreciate your advice on the following facts: About ten years ago an illegitimate Indian child was born of Indian parents at the reserve at Cape Croker. It seems that the parents might have married had not the father been unfortunately drowned before the birth of the child in question. The child has lived continuously with a relative of the father on the reserve until recently when this party died. The child's mother married a man not an Indian about five years ago and these people now have two children of their own. The Indian child has been sent from the reserve to the home of the mother and her husband. The husband finds it difficult enough to provide for his wife and two children of his own and does not see his way clear to provide a home for the Indian child.\n\nUnder these circumstances would it be possible to have this child placed in an Indian school under proper supervision. It does not seem to me that the husband of the child's mother should be asked to contribute to this child's support but if the child has been properly returned to its mother and the mother is obliged to support it, the result would be the same and the hardship would have to be borne by the husband. Will you please give this matter your consideration and advise me if in your opinion another home can be provided for the Indian child.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMcH/HS\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNovember 8, 1936.\n\nI am sending you herewith, for departmental attention, the attached letter to the Minister (October 30/36) from Mr. John M.

A.J. Vale, of the Chapleau School, stating that Joseph had run away but was back again and that he is homesick. This is just too bad, because he has no home to go to. His father died some three or four years ago, and his sister has been living with her uncle, Thomas Galkezheyongai since she left the school.\n\nI am going to Pickeral this week and will endeavour to see Thomas Galkezheyongai and make enquiries if he will take this boy. In the meantime there is no place where the boy can go unless his uncle Thomas Galkezheyongai takes charge of him, and I think, under the circumstances that Thomas Galkezheyongai would want something for his keep until he becomes sixteen years of age.\n\nWill the Department please say if they would be prepared to grant something for the keep of this boy until he becomes sixteen years of age.

They were returned on March 7th on train No. 1 from Sudbury where two had been apprehended by the police and the other two were apprehended at Temagami and brought home on same train and by the same officer.\n\nNo. 200 Norman Ishanatien Gibson Reserve AGED 13 years\nNo. 214 Samuel Assance Christian Island \" 14 \"\n\nRan away during the night of March 6th.

They were away all the day but found by our older boys the same night and brought home safely. The window has since been made impossible to open but the door only given. These are all first offenders and I will carry out the suggestion made at a conference held in your office this morning, a sound whirring shall be given to each boy to prevent further trouble along this line.

I am pleased to say however there is only one that has TB. The confusion has probably come about through the fact that one other child sent to us from that area, No. 0198 Ethel Mark, is in hospital with TB.\n\nI am of the opinion it would be in the best interest of these children that they should be returned to their homes as suggested in your letter. I would further advise that arrangements be made for the girl mentioned above No. 0198 Ethel Mark to have the hospital accommodation at Moose Factory and the child's people could see her occasionally there.\n\nNo. 0198 Ethel Mark is now 16 years of age in fact is in her 17th year and so is eligible to go home. I hope she may pass the Entrance examination this Spring. I would not recommend her for High School in any case.\n\nI shall be glad to receive word of your decision in this matter so I can arrange for other pupils to take their place in the event of your permitting them to return to their home.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

GODFREY M.S.,\nINDIAN AGENT,\nCHARLEAU ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing up our conversation over the telephone this morning I now write to inform you concerning the pupil, 182 Angus Gideon by name.\n\nThis boy has taken a nightmare several times lately. It seems to become more frequent of late. He had one March 24th and again April 10th and two spells of it last night. One shortly before 10 P.M. and another about 10:30. Mr. Smith spoke to Doctor Sheahan about his case. He said he would give some sedative to see if that would help. We talked over giving a change to the boy by letting him go home as an experiment to see if that would cure him. Doctor Sheahan thinks that would be a good thing and advised me to see you about it and report what he had said.\n\nI have written a letter to the parents of the boy and enclose a copy for you.\n\nWill you be good enough to write and inform the Department of the action we are taking in our efforts to help the boy. He is a very tall young fellow and is perhaps not growing his strength. He is about 14 years of age, in his 15th. In his nightmares, according to the boys in the same dormitories, he tries to get out of the windows. We place him on the second floor, but if he accidently did get out it would be dangerous. Therefore, it was thought to let him try the experiment of being at home and on the ground floor. He is quite a strong boy and might easily do harm to some of the others here. He pulls their beds to pieces and takes hold of some of the boys. They are getting nervous of him.\n\nI trust you will approve of the action being taken even before we have time to get your consent. It may prevent a tragedy.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nChapleau April 20th, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith enclose letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential school in connection with one of the pupils Angus Gideon. Ref. No. 162.\n\nThis boy has been acting very strange and the staff at the school were very frightened about him, being afraid that he might do bodily harm to one of the other pupils while under the influence of one of these spells, and after going into the matter with the Doctor, and the Rev. Principal we came to the conclusion that it was advisable to let the boy go to his home for a time and watch what results it would have on him.\n\nThe parents were willing to have him come home, and the boy was sent home last week, and if he improves he can be returned to the school, the matter should have been reported to the Department earlier but owing to my being confined to my home with illness I was unable to report the matter earlier.\n\nI hope our action in the matter will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChapleau, Ont.

This is an excellent school and I note the willingness to train still longer. I would point out that the girl is 17 years of age and I am very glad to give her further instruction and training in your Department until then. There is no reason why she should be sent back home at this time.\n\nThis girl hopes to pass her entrance and would like to go on. I would reserve opinion on this matter until I see the result she obtains at the examination forthcoming in June.\n\nI will have the other two girls ready to go home this summer when the time comes.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

When we wrote you previously, it was overlooked that this girl is over sixteen years of age. She may remain in the Chapleau Indian Residential School until the results of the Entrance Examinations are received. At that time, you should write the Department again but I doubt if it would be advisable to consider higher education for her in view of her age.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Will the grant be allowed for him or must this period be deducted from the Grant earning period.\n\nThis boy had obtained such a good standing in his High School work that they are giving him his full standing at the Spring Examination. If you so rule he can be with us from July 1st instead of being at his home for the summer vacation period.\n\nAn early reply will enable me to proceed at end of the month to make out my regular report for the quarter ending at that time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 4th, 1937.\n\nRev.

Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound,\nOntario.\nIn the case of Angelina Sands, daughter of Mr. Mrs. Jobe Sands, probably the parents or at least the mother and the girl are at fault. Angelina is 12 years old. Two weeks ago I summoned the parents, the parents and girl to the office under Section 10 subsection 3. The father apparently wants the girl to go to school. In fact, ask that we place her in a reformatory. Jobe leaves for work quite early in the morning and through neglect of the mother or girl she does not get up in time to go to school. Mrs. Sands said that she would work her up and then the girl would fight her. Mrs. Sands is pretty good on the fight herself. She lost her temper while in the office here and struck her husband [illegible] in the face. This girl is home most of the time but she stays with others fairly some. I have notified this family to appear at the office Friday, when up before I gave them a chance, as the father agreed to send the girl to school and the girl agreed to go to school. She went 4 days. My patience are about wore out with these last two cases. I am think unless there is a better effort to get these children to school I will have to fine or sentence to jail one of the parents in each case or other children or parents will soon try the same.\n\nThese girls are not a desirable lot to have at school, as some of them smoke cigarettes, it possible some of them have had contact with men, and general undesirable as pupils, but there is also the other side to consider. Others are watching the results in these cases, and if these children and their parents get away with it other will try the same thing.\n\nIf the Department has any reform school for girls where three of these can be sent, I think it would be the proper place for Harriett Gilbert, the Johnson girl and Angelina Sands. Jobe Sands has asked that his girl be placed in a reform school. I am quite sure Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Johnson would agree. If I believe the moral effect it would have on other children on the reserve would be good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWalpole Island Ont. Oct. 27th 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nRe-truants.\n\nAs well as the usual cases of children playing truant of there parents neglecting to send their children to school regular, we have four chronic cases of truancy or neglect, in two Cases Ed. Gilbert and Sam. Johnson I believe the parents are quite willing to send their children to school, a 12 or 13 year old girl in each case. They send the girls to school but the girls run away, neither the parent or officer have been able to find the girls for some time. These girls were placed to a white family on the mainland where an Indian from another reserve was working. The Indians are still working for this white man but the girls are not there now. These girls have been picked up by the truant officer and taken to school on several occasions last week while the truant officer and R.C.M.P. were looking for these other girls, they saw these girls playing on the road some distance ahead of them. The girls ran into the bush and they have not since been seen. A few weeks ago the Gilbert girl was found staying with an old blind bachelor Joshua White, and it was also learned that she was staying with Moses White another old bachelor at time. Ed. Gilbert is doing all he can to cooperate with the officers.\n\nThe other two cases the children are staying at home. These are Joe Sands and Jobe Sands, girls 12 and 13 years old. Sarah Sands daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Joe Sands age 13 has not been to school since school opened Sept. 17th. In this case the mother is running around all the time, and leave the girl home to keep house. This family have been served three day notice to have Sarah in school, and have been summoned to appear in this office Friday A.M. They have informed the police that no one can take these girl out of the house or make her go to school, this is simply a case of parents neglect, the girl would go to school if she had a chance.\nOttawa, October 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of October 27 with reference to certain children on the Walpole Island Reserve whom you consider should be placed in one of the residential schools.\n\nThere are some vacancies at the Chapleau Indian Residential School and I am writing to the Principal to ascertain if he is willing to accept the children mentioned in your letter. As soon as he replies, you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA.

I beg to say I shall be very glad to accept these children and have room for them at once.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 8, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 27th ultimo,\nand to my reply of the 30th ultimo, the Principal of the\nChapleau Indian Residential School advises me that he is\nprepared to accept:\n\nHarrah Sands,\nAngeline Sands,\nHarriet Gilbert,\na daughter of Sam Johnson.\n\nYou should have these children examined by the\nmedical Officer and if they are pronounced physically fit,\nyou may make the necessary arrangements to send them to the\nChapleau School.\n\nChapleau is on the main line of the Canadian\nPacific Railway, and a through train from Toronto to Chapleau\nleaves the former place every night. It is considered that\nif the children were accompanied to Toronto, they could be\nplaced on the train there in charge of the railway officials.\nAt the same time, the Principal of the Chapleau School could\nbe notified regarding the date and time of their arrival at\nChapleau.\n\nPlease make inquiries regarding the expenses that\nwould be incurred sending these children to Chapleau, and\nalso for the expenses of the escort to Toronto and advise me,\nand an accountable cheque will be forwarded to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. Highfield, M.S.,\nIndian Agent,\nWolpole Island, Ont.\nWe have three other children here, that I wish the Department could place in some Residential school if at all possible, not that they are truants, but they have no home and are very badly neglected. They are the three children of Admiral Williams, the mother is dead, while the father is living he does not in any way look after his children; he drinks a lot and when he works he works on the M.S.A. side of the border, there is one girl about 10 and two boys about 8 and 6. The girl is a bright girl and make her home wherever she can find anyone to take her in, she likes to go to school but often has to stay away to look after some one children or do other work, she is anxious to go to a residential school having asked me on several occasions if I have found a place for her. The boys stay with their father or in his house, he is away almost every day and is sometime not home at night; these boys are alone and have to get their own wood and their own meals and carry their own water from the river or the neighbors in both cases it is too far for boy of their age to carry water, they come to school some, but under the circumstances they do not come regularly. They live on Squirrel Island and only one neighbor close by. With the cold weather coming on I am afraid the boys may perish with the cold or possibly have a fire and they are becoming under nourished. Even the Indians are complaining that these children are being neglected. Unless the father improves condition for the boys very soon something will have to be done for them. If we can not get them into a Indian Residential school we will have to place them somewhere and no doubt pay for the care of the two boys and quite likely the girl.\n\nOur obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian affairs branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Ont.\nWalpole Island Ont. Nov. 19th 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 8th instant file 65-1-10 in reference to Sarah Sands, Angelina Sands, Harriet Gilbert and Abel Johnson, I would beg to say that the full one way fare to Chapleau is $20.95, half fare $10.50, and the return fare to Toronto is $11.15. The above children are all over 12.\n\nI have saw Sarah Sands, Harriet Gilberts and Abel Johnson parents, Jam. Johnson thinks it better that his girl be sent away to school as she runs away from home and school. Mr. Gilbert would prefer his daughter to be sent away but the other insist on keeping her home. Sarah Lother and Father object to Sarah being taken away. Sarah has not missed a day since she started back to school until today and the mother asks to keep her out for a funeral. Angelina parents Mr. Mrs. Jobe Sands went to Windsor or Detroit for a week end about 2 weeks ago and have not returned. Angelina went with them but returned Monday following and went to school for a few days but has not been to school for several days and do not know where she is.\n\nSarah Sands is not a bad girl, and will go to school if the parents will let her; they have promised to keep her in school if allowed to have her at home so far they are doing real well. I would recommend that Sarah be allowed to remain at home as long as she attends school regularly, but the other three are much better to be away from home and local surroundings as their parents have no control over them and they are out nights with very questionable company, and are a very bad example for other children at school.\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nBRANCH INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE November 25, 1937.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|---------------|--------|\n|            | WALPOLE ISLAND INDIAN AGENCY TRAVEL ACCOUNT | $115.00 |\n\nSend to: A.

I have been in touch with the Indian Agent concerning these boys and the circumstances are such that he advises me they will not be returning to the school. I am therefore making him to endorse this request for their discharge. The names are as follows:\n\nEdward Hannibush, Faril No. 196 Aged 16 years.\nWellington Hannibush, No. 197 Aged 14 years.\nLloyd Desire, No. 220 Aged 14 years.\n\nAll of these boys come from the Terry Sound Indian Superintendent.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nNov. 26, 1937\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

On questioning the father as to why he did not send his son back, he said that the boy had been sick and had a cold, and one hundred and one various diseases. He promised to send him to school at Wilson, to fill in the remainder of his term at school.\n\nI explained to these parents, the harm they were doing the children of other parents by wanting a break in the regulations and that they could not get consideration in the event of them wishing to send any other child to the school, without the permission of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/EK.\nEnclosure.\nOttawa, November 30, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nYour letter of November 24th has been forwarded to the Department by Indian Agent Daly.\n\nIn view of the information given by Mr. Daly, the Department approves the discharge of the following pupils:\n\nEdward Hannibush, No. 196\nWellington Hannibush, No. 197\nLloyd Desire, No. 220.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

This child has not been used very kindly by these people, in fact they have passed her on to other residents of the reserve, there seems to be no one to care for the child. I made application last fall for her admittance to an Indian Residential School, of which we not approved due to her age.\n\nIs there not some institution in which this child could be placed, she is past five years of age, is intelligent and of clean habits, and a non-treaty Indian. I wrote the Kent Children Aid Society on November 4th regarding this child but received no reply.\n\nAn early reply as to the Department's ruling in the care of this child would be appreciated.\nOttawa, December 3, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Indian Agent at Moravian Town has brought to our attention the case of a five year old girl, whose guardian has recently died. The girl is stated to be healthy and I would appreciate your advising if you would be prepared to accept her as a pupil at the Chapleau School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

They arrived safely and well this morning.\n\nI sent you a hurried note in regard to the request you made in your letter of Dec.3rd about our willingness to accept a little girl from Moravian town.\n\nI am now in a position to inform you we shall have a new member coming to join our Staff in the person of Miss Anne Crookes of Chatham. It occurred to me you might like to get in touch with her and perhaps that would be the solution to your need for an escort for this child if you decide to send her to us.\n\nMiss Crookes is due to arrive here Dec.14th. If you care to get in touch with her or have your agent at Moravian Town do so. I am sure she would be quite ready to take care of the child enroute to this school. The address is as follows.\n\nMiss Anne Crookes\nC/O Rev Canon Perkins\nChatham Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\nRev. J. Valk\n(Principal)\nPlease give this matter your immediate attention, as it would appear that the arrangements suggested above to have the girl go with Miss Crookes is a very good one. In the event of your not being able to make this arrangement, the only other plan that the Department could suggest would be for you to take the girl to Toronto and place her on the train to Chapleau. She could be placed in charge of the train officials from Toronto to Chapleau, as in this event, it would not be necessary to have anyone accompany her between these two points.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phalan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nStuart Spence, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHighgate, Ont.\nOttawa, December 9, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of November 25th and my reply of December 3rd with reference to the orphan daughter of the late Mrs. Sophia Snake, the Principal of the Chapleau Residential School is willing to accept this girl, provided she is in good health. You should have her examined immediately and, if the doctor pronounces her physically fit, she may be sent to the Chapleau School.\n\nMiss Anne Crookes, c/o Reverend Canon Perkins, Chatham, Ontario, is going to Chapleau to join the staff of the Chapleau Indian Residential School. Miss Crookes is due to arrive in Chapleau on December 14th. Quite likely she will be leaving Chatham on Monday, December 13th.\n\nI would suggest that, immediately on receipt of this letter, you telephone Miss Crookes and arrange with her to escort the Snake girl to the Chapleau school. This suggestion is made at the request of Reverend A.J. Vela, Principal of the Chapleau School, and you may so inform Miss Crookes.\n\nYou should, of course, secure a ticket for the girl to Chapleau and also supply her with any clothing that may be necessary for the trip. Payment will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate. It is not intended that you should purchase any large amount of clothing for the girl, as she will be outfitted when she reaches the Chapleau school.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nRev.

VALR\u2014Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nWELFARE AND TRAINING DIVISION,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is my painful duty to report two boys ran away from our school on Saturday evening last. They slipped out of the door unobserved just before time for a freight train to pass the school.\n\nJust as soon as they were missed about 15 minutes later we sent out searches but were too late to ever take them as the train had passed. We notified the Police and they wired instructions ahead and the boys were arrested at Cartier and returned to us by the regular train in charge of the Conductor so as to keep down expenses.\n\nI regret to say, one of the boys came recently from the Munsey school. He had only been in school here since noon of December 2nd. He went off with another boy recently sent here Jr. Indian Agent JOHN P. Had sent him to us November 17th. We were not at all suspicious of his tendency to run away. We are keeping close watch now on both these boys and will do our best to hold them.\n\nTheir names are Frank Jones from Shawanaga Ontario. Age 14\nEddie Noah from Munsey School. Age 10 yr\n\nI shall be glad to have refund of same cost at your early convenience as I have to close my books for the year on December 15th.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nLetter No. O.G.C.\n\nOffice of the Indian Agency,\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos.

This little girl really should be sent away as her Mother is dead and her Dad can't very well take care of her himself. The Principal has written several times to see when she is coming but as we have no permission to send her she is still here. I wish, if you could, you would kind of hurry them up. I can't sign official letters to ask why so I thought it best to write you.\n\n(Sgd.) Isabel Lumsden.\nOttawa,\nMarch 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince writing to you yesterday we have received your daughter's letter of the 15th instant regarding Louise Bonague. The only method of sending her to Chapleau is to place her on the Canadian Pacific train which leaves Toronto every night about 10 p.m. The next time someone is going to Toronto the girl could be taken to that point and placed on the through train to Chapleau. The train officials will look after her. I enclose transport requisition for ticket for the girl from Penetanguishene to Toronto via the Canadian National, also requisition for ticket from Toronto to Chapleau via Canadian Pacific. If there are any other expenses either for the girl or the escort in taking her from the reserve to Toronto payment will be made on receipt of a voucher from you in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

He grew impatient and left our school.\n\nThis boy, while at our school, made good progress in his class work. He was not popular with the other boys because of the superior attitude he took. He was very lazy about his work outside the classroom. He was not at all dependable in character. He seemed to be always scheming something to take advantage of other boys. They did not like him and would not associate with him. He has a good appearance and good manners when he cares to use them. He obtained his Entrance Standing last Fall.\n\nI would not advise further expense on his account.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMARCH 22 1938\n\nREV A J VALE\nPRINCIPAL\nST JOHN'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nGUAPLEAU ONT\n\nAUTHORIZE POLICE TO SEND DOUGLAS HOFF TO ODANAK QUEBEC STOP DEPARTMENT WILL PAY TRANSPORTATION ON RECEIPT OF ACCOUNT FROM YOU\n\nR A HOEY\nSUPT OF WELFARE & TRAINING\n\nCharge Indian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIn reply to your 65-1-10 of the 17th instant I beg to advise you there appears little likelihood of Hella Hess being sent to Chapleau residential School, as it seems impossible to locate her.\n\nThis girl apparently found out she was to be sent away to school so is remaining under cover with friends somewhere.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nG.

Vale, Principal\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wrote you yesterday in reply to your letter of enquiry re: Douglas Hoff No. 165. I reported he had run away from the school March 19th. He was located and arrested in Toronto March 21st.\n\nI wired you this morning for instructions in regard to him, so we could have your advice before incurring expense of sending Police Escort for him and bringing him back here. I am of the opinion he would turn out a source of trouble to us if sent back here. I fear he might in his revenge perhaps attempt to set fire to some of the buildings or cause damage another ways to obtain his early release.\n\nI wondered if it might be wise to send him off from Toronto direct to the care of the Indian Agent of his home district and let him try out the boy and see what he can make of him. I had told the boy we were trying to find work for him. Apparently he did not believe this and decided to take things into his own hands. I feel sure if sent back here he will run again at the first chance or give us trouble in other ways.\n\nIf he is sent, as suggested under commitment to the Indian Agent I think it will have good effect on the other boys here at school. I have informed them of our efforts to find work for him and of your letter in this connection. They realize what a mistake he made in running away.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

He gave me the names of these boys and said the father, \"ILON ASSHOR,\" would send the tickets for them. This the father did later by wire from his home; therefore allowed the boys to go as advised earlier, as stated above, by letter from the Agent looking to him to make the plans at his end of the line.\n\nShortly before school opening time I wrote him, asking him to round up the children in time to return for a prompt beginning of the new term.\n\nInstead of the boys going, I received a letter from their father saying he was not sending the boys back. I then wrote at once to the Agent telling him the father had no authority for such action without permission from you.\n\nYour letter is the only reply I have had to date.\n\nVol. II\n\n[Signature]\n\nThese boys or others to take their place as to only be in school.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to Samuel Assence, No. 214, and Lazarus Assence, No. 215. It is regretted that in making arrangements with the father to allow these boys home on holidays you did not stipulate that he had to provide the return fare before the boys were allowed home.\n\nThe report from the Agent indicates that the father is well able to support the boys and, in view of the expense involved in returning them to the Chapleau School, and as there is a good Day School on the Reserve, the Department considers that it would be advisable to grant their discharge. We are so informing the Indian Agent.\n\nI note that you require more pupils and I hope that within the next month or six weeks we will be able to send you several children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

They can go by Toronto from which point a train leaves every night via Canadian Pacific Railway for Chapleau. It should not be necessary to accompany them as they can be placed in charge of the train officials and at Toronto the Traveller's Aid Society will no doubt arrange for their transfer to the proper train.\n\nPayment of their transportation will be made upon receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate or, if you so desire, let me know and I will forward you a transport requisition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nH.

And your approval for arrangements to be made for transportation of these two Indian children.\n\nI think it would be better if you sent me a transport requisition, I find upon enquiry that a C.N.R Train leaves Belleville at 7.24 A.M., arriving in Toronto at 9.30 P.M. From this point there is a C.P.R. train leaving Toronto for Cheappleau at 10.50 P.M. This appears to be the most suitable connection, an earlier C.N.R train could be taken from Napanee but there would be a longer wait at Toronto, and I think it would be better to avoid a long wait at Toronto if possible seeing that the children will be unaccompanied.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

Vale, Principal of the Chapleau Indian residential school, advising him of the exact date of the arrival of these children at Chapleau in order that he may meet them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nH. J. Eade, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 29, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIndian Agent Rade, Deseronto, Ont., is being authorized to send to Chapleau school the following pupils:\n\nPhilip Robert John Barnhardt, 10 years of age; father Douglass Powless, No. 241 Tyendinaga Band. His mother, Effie Maracle, is dead.\n\nGladys Brant, 10 years of age; daughter of Colborne Brant, No. 480 Tyendinaga Band. Her mother is dead.\n\nMr. Rade will likely advise you by telegram regarding the date of these children's arrival in Chapleau in order that you may meet them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Thelen,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to reply to the departmental letter of December 29th in regards to Mrs. Ada Ashkewe, and I beg to say that there are three school age children, of protestant religion, who have not been attending school regularly.\n\nI have been trying ever since school opened in the Fall to have these children attend school regularly but it has not proved very successful. I have also sent the R.C.M.P., Mr. Langley, on two different occasions to try and scare Mrs. Ashkewe into sending her children to school but it has not proved satisfactory. Her husband has not lived with her for some years and she is a very capable mother and is willing to look after the children properly. I would recommend that the children be sent to a residential school as soon as there is an opening, if the Department approves of it.\n\nI have no letter on file regarding prosecuting this woman but when Inspector McGookin was here on his last visit he advised me to have the R.C.M.P. interview Mrs. Ashkewe and try and make her send the children to school or the Department would take some measure in regards to the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nInd Affs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nActing Indian Agent\nOttawa,\nJanuary 11, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the 3 children of Mrs. Ida Ashkenas. It is noted that these children do not attend school regularly and that you recommend that they be placed in a residential school.\n\nThe only Protestant school where there is any accommodation at the present time is the Indian residential school at Chapleau, Ont. I enclose the necessary forms and you should have these completed, also have the 3 children examined by a Doctor and the certificate of health form filled in. You should then return these for our consideration and if the children are found to be physically fit instructions will then be issued to you with reference to sending them to Chapleau.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP.

Tuffnell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nR.R. #5,\nUxerton, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 30, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose letter addressed to the Honourable the Minister by Mrs. Andrew Jonathan.\n\nI should appreciate having a report on this letter which should be returned for our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor E.

We shall be very pleased to see you there.\n\nAt the Indian Office,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI have heard that Mr. [Name] has applied for the smaller children to go along with them, and feel that Major Randle is excellent.\nup our home by taking our children there that way. There are a lot of things they want to do, but he does not seem too concerned about them, why he bothered about us, besides they are attending school in the Reserve.\n\nWhen they were at Mohawk we couldn't see them, and last June Major Tramblie was in favor with Mr. Smith the Principal that we couldn't bring them home for their summer holidays. We had quite a time to get them back, and now it has come up that we have the first new boy.\nChildren, they are\nand we are too\nwould be d...\nThat you\nConsideration\n\nAndrewson.\nSo at the same time I arranged the spending of the interest money, I pointed out to the parents that their home life was hardly the right atmosphere in which children should be brought up and it would be much better or the older children if they, the parents, would consent to them being admitted once again to one of the residential schools.\n\nAfter some discussion and without any undue pressure on my part, they consented and I had them both sign the application forms.\n\nAs it would be no good sending them back to the Mohawk Institute, as their mother would be constantly appearing there and unsettling the children, I informed the parents it was my intention to recommend to the Department the children's admittance to one of the Northern Ontario Schools, as Mr. Strupp has already informed me he had no vacancies.\n\nThe Department will appreciate that with seven children and only temporary employment for the father at certain seasons of the year, that this family's position is not a happy one, apart from the quarrelling and that the arrangements I suggested to the parents were in the best interests of all concerned and I hope will be endorsed fully.\n\nI am now returning with Mrs. Jonathan's letter, the application forms for the four children duly completed with a strong recommendation they be admitted to whichever residential school the Department consider best and where there are vacancies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nEPA/CB.\n\nIndian Superintendent\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your 32-0-10 of the 30th December, enclosing a letter addressed to the Honourable Minister, by Mrs. Andrew Jonathan.\n\nIn reply would advise you that both Mrs. Jonathan and her husband are a constant trouble to this office, as they frequently quarrel, then seek the help and advice of this office, but fail to follow it out.\n\nSome time in December Mrs. Jonathan had her husband up in the Brantford Police Court for assault. On the day the case was before the Court she came into this office and said that if the cheque for children's arrear of interest came not to permit her husband to have it as the children would derive no benefit from it as her husband would only \"booze it away\".\n\nOn the other hand the husband had previously told Mr. Hilton Hill, the Chief Clerk, if Mrs. Jonathan received it she would only waste it running around.\n\nSo I instructed the M.C.P. Police to bring both parents to this office after the case was over, obtained Jonathan's endorsement to the interest arrear cheque and then sent the parents and the children out with Mr. Hill in order he might supervise the spending of the money wisely to purchase some much needed footwear and clothes for the children.\n\nAs I have already explained the parents are continually quarrelling, the wife complaining the husband does not support the family properly, while the husband claims his wife runs around with other men. Mrs. Jonathan also had expressed concern about the behaviour of the 14 year old daughter, Jessie.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the children of Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Jonathan.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter the Department approves the admission of Edna, Alvin, Percy and Jessie Jonathan to the Chapleau Indian residential school. This is the only Indian residential school under Protestant auspices that can provide accommodation for pupils at the present time.\n\nI enclose a transport requisition which will enable you to purchase the four tickets from Brantford to Chapleau. It should not be necessary to accompany these children as they can be placed in charge of the train officials and a C.P.R. train for Chapleau leaves Toronto every night. You can no doubt send the children from Brantford on a late afternoon train and this will mean that they will only be in Toronto for a short time during which period the Traveller's Aid official will look after the children.\n\nIf you find it necessary to incur any other expense in connection with sending them to Chapleau you may submit the usual voucher.\n\nIt would be advisable for you to wire Rev. A.J. Vale, Principal, Indian Residential School, Chapleau, regarding the exact date and time of their arrival in Chapleau in order that he may meet them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nSupt.

We have so far been able to restrain them from running away from school. But their behavior is such at school that they are spoiling the other girls. They are very rude and obstreperous to the ladies of the staff and very hard to control. Can you remove them to some other place and relieve us of the difficult task of handling them. They have been severely punished but that does not last long.\n\nThe girls I refer to are Harriet Gilbert Age 14, Elsie Martin Age 14, Josephine Whyte Age 14, Angeline Sands Age 14.\n\nThey are very anxious to go home for holidays but I do not want them back if they are permitted to go.

Her mother was an Antone of the Oneida Band, who died previous to Elsie being placed in the school.\n\nElsie has a grand-mother who lives on the Oneida Reserve on occasions, one Mrs Ethel Antone, but this girl would not be entitled to reside at this Agency and it is my suggestion that her father be consulted as to her leaving school and having a proper home to keep her and failing to find a proper home at Cape Croker I would then suggest that this girl be retained in the residential school until she is of an age that she can care for herself or employment is found for her upon discharge from the school.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Their parents had very little control over them before they left here, and I expect that it would be a big mistake to send them home into such home conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 2, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of the 10th ultimo, in which you submitted for departmental consideration, the case of four girls pupils at your institution - all of whom have reached the age of 14. You express the view in your communication that these girls are exceedingly difficult to discipline and should be discharged.\n\nI may state that immediately following receipt of your letter we communicated with the Indian agents concerned, with respect to the matter. I am enclosing herewith, for your information, copies of the replies received by this Branch. These letters, you will note, are self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the information received from the agents, it would be in my judgment very inadvisable indeed to discharge these girls from your school at this time. I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to organize these girls into a vocational group and have them undertake crochet work, hand loom weaving, etc. These projects might be undertaken on the understanding that, when the goods are sold or disposed of, the girls would receive a certain amount of the sale price. In this way the girls might be encouraged to become less of a problem in the school and encouraged also to save a little money toward their maintenance when they are discharged a year or so from now. You might at your convenience let me know what you think of this suggestion.\n\nWe have learned from experience that it is not possible to commit these girls to a correction home. In other words, they have not at this date been guilty of an offence that would justify such action. It is altogether likely, however, if they were permitted to return to the reserves, all of them would become problem cases in a comparatively brief period of time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

If conditions there are favourable, I would like her to be allowed to return. She has proved herself a good girl and worked hard. She is not brilliant and will never make a scholar but she has been faithful in class room and practical work of the house department.\n\nI told her in common with the others if they behaved well I would try to secure their discharge as soon as I could after they were 16 years old. This girl is over that age.\n\nI shall appreciate your favourable consideration in this case.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 5, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Chapleau, Ont., in which the suggestion is made that Julia Sickles, pupil No. 2812, who has reached the age of 16 years, be discharged from the institution.\n\nThe Principal states that this pupil has proved herself a good girl and has worked very hard at the school.\n\nYou might let me know if, in your judgment, it would be advisable to have this girl discharged from the Chapleau School this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

They are Elsie Martin and Angelina Sands.\n\nIn my former letter I stated Elsie was 14 years old. She is now eleven older. I wrote to the Indian Agent for particulars and received his reply showing the girl was correct in stating her age as 16 years, as he found by looking up the records of the Munsey School.\n\nThis girl was sent to us under Police escort. She has given us a very great deal of trouble, by stubborn refusal to do what she is told. When punished severely, she grudgingly complies for the time, but soon gives trouble again.\n\nI am persuaded she was the leader of the six girls who ran away on June 19th, as reported by removing a screen from a second story dormitory window and knotting some bad clothing to form a rope.\n\nThese girls were caught by the Police about 25 miles west on the railway. They were punished by having their hair clipped short.\n\nElsie is of the agitator type causing the other girls to gang up and rebel against orders. On July 22nd the recreation door was locked to keep her and other girls from interfering while some girls were being punished. She with others attacked the door with sticks and stones, demanding it be opened; they broke one panel of glass, tore a screen and removed another wire screen from the Bakery window and took two loaves of bread before they were controlled.\n\nI think you will see from the above she must be removed from this school.\n\nAngelina Sands is of a very violent temperament.\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of May 11 and your reply of May 16 with reference to Elsie Martin, a pupil of the Chapleau Indian residential school.

If this is correct the Department is not prepared to consider placing her in any other institution.\n\nPlease let me know at once if the grandmother to whom you refer in the last paragraph of your letter of May 16 could provide a home for this girl.

This makes it impossible to transfer her to any other institution. I am, therefore, writing to the Indian Agent at Caradoc with a view to ascertaining if we can have her placed with her grandmother who still resides on the Caradoc Reserve.

Smoke, since the death of his wife on October 9th last, has practically allowed his children to look after themselves and they are now showing the result of this neglect in their condition by improper nourishment, untidy and dirty clothing and indifferent attendance at school. Smoke does not appear to provide the necessities and although I believe there is work to be had, if a person would look for it, he prefers to loaf around the Reserve. I understand he had fair success in hunting this fall but the children did not appear to benefit by his good fortune.\n\nThese children are:\n\nBeatrice, aged 13,\nBernard, 11,\nLloyd, 9,\nViolet, 6,\n\nYour letter 7-0-10 of April 25th, 1935, made a proposal that the children be placed in residential school in the fall of that year, which apparently was not carried through.

These children are showing the results of neglect. They are under nourished and although last winter relief grants were given them from time to time I do not think the food could have been properly prepared for them. Although Stephen Smoke has a wood lot and plenty of time he did not get out a supply of winter wood last year and was unable to move this year to obtain it and as a result last winter the children burned for fire wood and nineteen panels of rail fence from band property in the neighborhood of their home as well as using board stripped off a barn belonging to the band in the amount of about $250.00. I have incidentally had Smoke replace these rails and instructed him to replace the boards removed.\n\nThere are five children in the family, Leonard 17, Beatrice 15, Bernard 12, Lloyd 10 and Violet 7.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 11, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in connection with the truancy of certain girls from the Chapleau Indian residential school. The Department has very carefully considered the reports that have been received regarding the action of these girls at Chapleau and an endeavour has been made to place them in other institutions but without success. It has, therefore, been decided that Elsie Martin and Jessie Jonathan should be returned to their homes.\n\nElsie Martin comes from the Cape Croker Reserve and the nearest railway point is Marton, Ont., to which point she should be sent. Jessie Jonathan is from the Six Nations Agency.\n\nWe want to make certain that these girls reach their home Reserves and consequently either yourself or some reliable person should accompany them. I would suggest that you leave Chapleau on Thursday afternoon, reaching Toronto Friday morning. I am writing to the Indian Superintendent, Major L.F. Randle, at Brantford to have some person meet the C.P.R. train arriving in Toronto from Chapleau on Friday morning and take Jessie Jonathan to the Reserve. The party who has brought the two girls from Chapleau can then proceed to Marton with Elsie Martin. The Indian Agent at Cape Croker is being instructed to be in Marton on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe transportation expenses of the girls, also the expenses for the escort, will be paid on receipt from\n\nT.J.

The cost of their transportation was $10.00. They would have had to wait in Toronto for some hours in order to make connections if sent from Cobourg, the nearest point on the railway. I would then have had the costs of transportation from Roseneath to Cobourg plus Railway fare.\n\nI called at the Smoke home yesterday afternoon and found the children practically destitute of clothes and with practically no food in the house. Therefore, asked an Indian woman to come in and cook them up a good meal and proper food for them to have their breakfast as they would be on the train from 10.45 last night until 11 o'clock today.\n\nI had to completely clothe the four children as the two boys only had overalls as their wearing apparel and the girls had only one item of clothing which was their outer dress.

This child has no mother and is you might say kicked from pillar to post so not properly looked after. \"onague wrote Mr. Vale explaining the child's condition getting a reply to the effect he was quite willing to take him in any time the Department would consent to let him go. I would advise having this child placed in a school and if at Chapleau he and his sister will be raised together. At present time Monague could not afford the transportation.\n\nI might add there are three other children here at Island who should be sent to some school as they are not getting care or properly clothed or fed. Matthew Ying son of Howard Ying, he has no mother, and two little girls illegitimate children of Elijah \"onague,\" I have had to send these little girls home several times from school to have both their bodies and heads cleaned.\n\nTrusting the Department will see their way clear to place these children all at Chapleau School where I understand there is an opening for several.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th ultimo with reference to certain children on the Christian Island Reserve who, you consider, should receive institutional care.\n\nPlease let me have applications and certificates of health for Matthew King and the two children of Alkiah Monaghan. Provided the medical officer pronounces them physically fit the Department is prepared to approve their admission to the Chapleau Indian residential school.\n\nIn the event of sending these children to Chapleau will it be possible for the parents to take them to Coldwater Junction without cost to the Department? At that point they can be placed on the C.P.R. train for Chapleau.

The weather has been such that it would have been almost impossible to get the child to the station, roads being not passable for cars.\n\nNeither Bert Monague or Howard King are in a position to pay the children's fare to Chapleau. But I would appreciate both the Monague and King children being sent just as soon as the roads are opened up.\n\nIn regards to children of Elijah Monague would say the doctor has been on the island three times lately, and he manages to keep them out of the way but these little girls should be getting better care. He has no money with which to pay their fare.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nApril 11, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing the medical report regarding Matthew King.

Godfrey Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou asked me to write you in connection with Frances Hoff, a pupil No. OI79 of this school.\n\nI beg to report this girl came to us in the Fall of 1932. She is about 14 years old. She has given us a lot of trouble at different times. Frances has a very violent temper and capable of doing anything at such times. She did once threaten to use a knife and pointed it at one of the ladies of the Staff. She was severely whipped for this offence.\n\nFrances has often been implicated in various runaway groups. She, with five other girls, once got as far as Nicholson on the railway and had to be brought back by the police. She was again severely whipped for this. Whipping does not seem to effectual in stopping her.\n\nRecently she has organized a group of girls to abuse a small girl of six years to such an extent that marks were left on her from striking her with a stick. The little child was so intimidated by Frances that she stubbornly refused to tell the truth. I got it from some of the other girls. I was also told Frances and one other girl suspended the little girl by a rope, they had surreptitiously secured, until the child was almost unconscious. This took place in a secluded part of the lavatory.\n\nLast week Frances tried to effect a runaway of eleven girls. This was found out in time and prevented. She tried to get the girls to agree to fight if they were to be punished.\n\nI think if you could arrange for this girl to be sent to her home, Oshawa Quebec, it would be a good solution to the problem and help us control the girls and prevent serious trouble.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nChapleau November 14th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg leave to enclose letter received from the Rev. Principal, and which is in reply to a request from me to give me particulars of this young pupil.\n\nMy reason for asking the Rev. Principal to give me this report was because of several reasons first apparently the school staff appear unable to do anything in the way of controlling this Pupil No. 179 Francis Hoff, and constant trouble is experienced as the girl is a real menace to the school discipline, and in addition to her encouraging the other girls to run away she is constantly causing trouble, sometimes doing things that are serious such as climbing out the dormitory windows and meeting young boys from the town and near vicinity causing a lot of expense in locating these girls and bringing them back to the school, and as the school staff apparently can not control the situation without constant night control by guards the entire night I would recommend that this girl be discharged and sent back to her home.\n\nWe expected that when the other two girls were sent away and that having no chums to go with her that she would settle down, but such is not the case she has conducted herself very badly ever since and constantly causing serious trouble, this girl is 14 yrs. of age and very bad tempered and aborn agitator and bad example to be left among so many young girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 16, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to Francis Hoff, No. 0179, Chapleau residential school. I understand that her home conditions are extremely unsuitable and for this reason the Department hesitates to discharge her. From the information given by the Principal it appears that this girl is only 14 years of age and as she has been in the school since 1932 it is felt that the school management should, for that length of time, be able to handle her. I should appreciate your talking over this matter with the Reverend Principal with a view to having him make another effort to control this girl. If he is unsuccessful in this regard you might write to me again in about a month's time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. T. J.

Arrangements were made at the Department to have them sent to Shaganappi School as of Department letter 65-1-10 of October 14th 1939.\n\nThey were admitted on the 23rd day of November 1939.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPost Secretary & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nAlberta\n\nFebruary 1940\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupils mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA review of the December quarter return of the Chapleau Indian Residential School shows the following pupils over the age of 16:\n\nNo. 193 John Jeffries\nNo. 0212 Julia Sickles\n\nPermission for the retention of Julia Sickles, No. 0212, for the current academic year was approved by official letter of June 19, 1939, but no approval appears to have been given for the retention of John Jeffries, No. 193. In this connection I wish to direct your attention to circular letter of July 21, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nAs pointed out in the circular letter the Department realizes that frequently there are reasons for keeping certain children after they reach the age of 16 but at the same time the consent of the Superintendent General (Minister) must be obtained.\n\nI may add that in the past the Department has been favourably disposed to allowing certain pupils, especially girls, to remain in residential schools after they reach the age of 16 if good reasons for such action are given by the Principal and approved by the Indian Agent. However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. A.J. Vale,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby acknowledge receipt of the letter of Philip Phelan Dated Ottawa February 26-1940 No. 65-1-10 with reference to pupils over age of 16 years, now in this school. I note you have record of Julia Stickles No. 0812 having been given permission to continue here for this year.\n\nYou ask when she can be discharged, in reply I would say at any date it may suit your convenience.\n\nRegarding John Jeffries No. 193 I note you ask for a reason I did not seek permission last year in his case. I hope to say I had formerly asked permission for this boy to be allowed to go on to fit himself for University. This permission was given over the signature of Mr Hoey, who agreed to extend his approval for two years. This term does not expire until this summer.\n\nI would respectfully report this boy has done well at the High School, and from the Staff there I learn he is sure of getting his Junior Matriculation this summer. Examinations are not being held for this Term but standing given on the term record so the Staff were able to tell me his standing warrants their saying he will make it.\n\nI would now make request for one more year to be allowed him so he may enter University with Senior Matriculation Standing in 1941. I have plans whereby he can go on in Toronto after that date, if you will extend permission for him to remain here one year more. He is a worthwhile young man and will repay any expense on his behalf. I trust this permission may be given.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving made reply to the specific pupils referred to in Mr. Thelan's letter of Feb. 26\u2014No. 65\u20141-10, I beg to add, I am quite in accord with the remarks regarding giving others a chance to get some education and discharge of those who reach the age of 16 years. In this connection I beg to report the following pupils will reach that age by end of this term.\n\n**GIRLS:**\n- Sarah Chassawahninni No. 0152\n- Margaret Jeffries No. 0174\n- Daisy Smith No. 0196\n- Evadne Shokapaw No. 0207\n- Josephine Whyte No. 0210\n- Angelina Sands No. 0216\n- Mabel Johnson No. 0214\n\nI shall be very happy to consider your action to provide for the discharge of the above at your convenience.

In addition to these I had word from the parents of about three other children, now with us, that will be asked for in the summer to be allowed to return to their homes.\n\nIn view of this large number to leave I shall appreciate your cooperation in securing others to fill their places and thus be doing my part to help you meet the need mentioned in your former letter of several wanting to get into schools.\n\nI wish to thank you most sincerely for your kind offer to allow John Jeffries No. 193 to continue another year here.

Vale,\nPrincipal,\nSt. John's Ind.-Res. School,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nDear Principal Vale:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th inst., and relative to Dorothy Saylors, I have certain proposals to make.\n\nI can quite appreciate your difficulty, and the concern of the girl's father, and would like to help out in the matter if at all possible. Of course, what I propose to you would be entirely subject to the wishes of the Department. We have a full school, and many young ones waiting to be admitted so that if this girl came to us, she would be keeping away younger child who, perhaps has even a better right for admission than she has.\n\nIf the Department sanction the transfer of Dorothy Saylors from your school to ours, I shall be glad to have her, and will do all in our power to help her make good, but with the distinct understanding that if she does not do her part, or if her progress in school, or in controlling herself is not satisfactory, after she has been here one year, then she shall not remain with us.\n\nThis may sound a little strange from the usual way we have taken, but I really think we have not laid enough emphasis on the privilege of having the chance of an education, and for that reason a great percentage of our pupils have not valued it until the privilege has passed beyond their reach. We have fifteen attending Tech. and High school this year, and if, at any time I find any of them abusing the privilege given to them, I shall immediately recommend their discharge. I find this method raises the standard in the eyes of these pupils.\nSt. John's Ind Res. School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nApril 12, 1940\n\nPrincipal Myles,\nShingwauk School,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Principal:\n\nMr. Amon Saylors of Chapleau, who says he was an old pupil of Shingwauk School is anxious for me to see if you would accept his daughter Dorothy as a pupil in your school. Dorothy is 13 yrs. old and is being confirmed in May next.\n\nThis is the position: Mr. Saylors has had four of his children at this school, three girls and one boy. Two of the girls and the boy have done well, and graduated to High School, and Dorothy is now with us, and we expect her to pass her Entrance this Spring.\n\nThe other three children all did well and gave no serious trouble to us, or to their fathers, until they got free to go to High School. Then in each case they got out of hand, due to their being in touch with their relations living town in the free time from High School at noon etc. He fears the same fate may overtake Dorothy, and thinks if she were removed from this influence in town she might be kept from falling into the evil ways of the others.\n\nHe made a direct application to the Department last Fall, but they paid no heed to him. He asked me to see if you would be willing to accept her for the full term whether she passes or not into High School. I am quite agreed to let her go to you if you wish to try and see what can be done in this case. Will you write and let me know what you think. I will be frank with you. The girl is not a bad child in many ways, but occasionally has a fit of temper and needs to be helped over that time. We can control her here so long as she does not go to High School, we do not think she would be easily managed here if she goes to High School and only returns here at night.\n\nWrite and let me know what you think about it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned, (A.J.Vale, Princ.)\nSNIAGWAUK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSAULT STE.

Saylors from the Chapleau Indian Residential School to the Shingwauk Home.\n\nThe conditions on which you are willing to accept her at Shingwauk Home appear reasonable and you may so inform the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau School.\n\nYou should advise me later if it is finally decided to transfer this girl from Chapleau to Shingwauk Home.

I should appreciate your writing to me to that effect as due to present conditions the Department requires very definite assurance that institutional care cannot be avoided before we can consider admitting children to residential schools.\n\nYou should forward the usual application forms and certificates of health for our consideration. It should be understood, however, that in the event of our approving the admission of these two children they will not be sent to Chapleau until the end of August as this school will be closed for summer holidays during the months of July and August.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

He has done well and now has his Junior Matriculation. In asking for his discharge, I was under the impression it would be possible to get him into the Training school at Galt for the Air Force as a mechanic, for which he has a very good talent.\n\nI have their application forms and find he must be at least 16 years old. This boy will reach his 16 birthday in December and so is not eligible for this Fall as planned. Would it be possible to carry him on until end of this current year and so enable him to comply with the conditions and enter the March Class?\n\nIf you cannot arrange for him to get the extra grant for high school, would you permit me to carry him on as a regular pupil, if I can make local arrangements with the High School to accept him without the extra Grant?

So, in the best interests of the boys, I recommend their placing into a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nTraining Division, Ottawa.\n\n[Stamp]\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDivision File No. 40 T 1074-4/16\n\nDivision \"O\"\nProvince Ontario\n\nSub-Division Detachment\nMUNCEY\n\nDate July 29th, 1940.\n\nRe: Kenneth ALBERT (Indian) Chippewa Reserve, Ont.\nTruant - Mt Elgin Indian Residential School.\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\n29-7-40\n\n1.

Matters\nIndian Agent.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am advised that George Henry Saunders, a pupil of the St. John's Indian Residential School was born Oct. 10th, 1923, and is now almost 17 years of age, this is from the Parish records at White River, Ont., although on the school records, given when he entered the school he is only 15.\n\nIn view of this I would recommend that he be discharged from the school, he had a job on the Section gang during the summer, and I allowed him to stay on the job until the matter of his age was cleared up.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent.\nChapleau, Ont., Oct. 3rd, 1940.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF SEPTEMBER.\n\nDuring the month we had some trouble with children running away from the Indian Residential School here. It started with one boy, sent here from the London Juvenile Court, who escaped and has not been caught to date. A few days after two girls tried, but we kept such a close watch on the freight trains that they could not get out of town, and they returned to the school. Then about a week ago three boys tried it; they got as far east as Cartier, but could not get through the police check, and they also returned to the school. After their privations in the bush, and punishment on their return, they will be a deterrent to any others who may take a notion that they would like to travel.\n\nF. Matters,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant you may advise the Principal of the Chapleau Residential School that the discharge of George Henry Saunders is approved.\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 14 you may inform the Principal of the Chapleau School that the admission of Louise Minnie Davies, Louise Samakeesee, Clara Saylors and Emily Paul is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo and previous correspondence regarding the admission of Allan and Norman Teweshaw to the Chapleau Indian Residential School arrangements have been made to admit these boys to the school mentioned.\n\nThey should be placed on the Canadian Pacific train leaving Montreal at 8:15 p.m. standard time on Friday, October 18. When they reach Ottawa an officer of the Department will board the train and accompany them to their destination.\n\nPlease acknowledge this letter immediately in order that the Department may be assured that the boys will be on the train mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. Harbour,\nIndian Agent,\nOka, Que.\nOttawa,\nOctober 11, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nArrangements are being made to send Allan and Norman Taweshaw to the Chapleau School. They will leave here on the night of Friday, October 18, and will reach Chapleau on the morning of the 19th. You should have someone at the station to meet them.\n\nNorman is 6 years of age and Allan is 7 years of age. Their father's name is Norman Taweshaw and both boys are from the Oka Indian Agency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. A. J. Yale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 11th instant regarding the admission of Allan and Norman Teweshaw to the Chapleau Indian Residential School I enclose tickets for their transportation from Montreal to Chapleau. The older boy should be given the tickets on leaving Montreal and he should hand them to the official of the Department who will accompany them from Ottawa to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

In the case of fillings, amalgam or other cheap material is to be used. In the case of first teeth no dental attention with the exception of extractions can be allowed. The fees usually allowed are $1.00 per amalgam filling and 25 cents each for ordinary extractions, or 50 cents each when a local anesthetic is used. Please advise the Principal and Dr. Gawley accordingly. The Principal should see that those pupils absolutely requiring same receive dental attention, as it is not intended that any large accounts for dental services at this school be rendered. It is presumed that the dental work could be carried out in the dentist's office, the pupils being sent there for that purpose when necessary.\n\nThe Dentist should prepare his accounts, in duplicate, stating therein the name of each pupil given attention and the nature of the services performed. These accounts he should hand to you, to be attached to proper voucher forms, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

I invited the dentist of Chapleau Dr. Gavley, to come out and make an examination of all our pupils, this he did. I now enclose his copy for your consideration.\n\nIn talking over this matter with Dr. Gavley, he suggested the best plan would be to have a regular time, say one half day a week, from 9 A.M. till 12 noon, when he would come down with all his equipment and devote his time to root work or extraction, and in addition would at his office attend to any emergency work that might arise at any time.\n\nHe further suggested his willingness to enter into an arrangement with your Department to accept a stated remuneration per week.\n\nI have consulted Mr Indian Agent Godfrey of Chapleau and he advised me to write you a letter and place the case before you.\n\nI am of the opinion the health of the pupils is impaired by the present condition of their teeth as indicated by the report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 11, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School regarding the arrangements for dental services required by the pupils. In this connection I have to refer you to official letter dated September 26th, last, in which you were informed that Dr. Gawley, of Chapleau, might be employed, and the fees that would be allowed, and you were instructed to advise the Principal and Dr. Gawley accordingly.\n\nIt is noted that Dr. Gawley made an examination of the pupils, and the report prepared by him as to the dental work required to be carried out, which was forwarded with the above mentioned letter from the Principal, has also been received. If Dr. Gawley will undertake the extractions and fillings, the Department will allow him payment at the rates mentioned in our letter above referred to. I may say that we do not allow fillings in temporary teeth. You should see Dr. Gawley, and ascertain from him whether he will carry out the work at the rates mentioned. If so, he can arrange to do the work at any time convenient to himself and the Principal. The requirements regarding the rendering of accounts for dental services should be carried out as requested in letter to you of September 26th, last. You should advise the Department whether Dr. Gawley will undertake the dental work, and, if so, the date on which he will begin same.\n\nPlease inform the Reverend Principal that this matter has been referred to you to make arrangements with Dr. Gawley to perform the extractions and fillings required by the pupils at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I carried this out and found the general health of the children very good, but not a single child had any defects in their vision. I would suggest that we should have a specialist examine their eyes for glaucoma. There is no eye specialist in Chatham, but Dr. Murray has a very good one.\n\nThere were thirteen with diseased strabismus; three of these were extremely bad. This is a percentage much lower than what we find in our city schools.\nDecember 30th, 1930.\n\nDear Dr. Smith,\n\nI have to convey to you the thanks of the Department of Indian Affairs for your interest in making an inspection of the pupils of the Residential School at Chapleau.

Dr. Smith states this examination was carried out at the request of Dr. Sheehan. Her report shows that while the pupils are, on the whole, in good physical condition, there are 12 with defective vision and 13 with diseased tonsils, three of which are extremely bad.\n\nThe Department is called upon to provide very large sums of money annually for medical services to Indians at Chapleau. This School is under the medical charge of a Doctor who earns the greater part of the expenditure and, I may be permitted to express some surprise that the condition referred to, particularly the diseased tonsils, should have escaped his notice. Please request Dr. Sheehan to report to the Department how many pupils he considers should have immediate attention to their throats.\n\nWith regard to those with defective vision, the Department wishes, if possible, to avoid bringing a specialist to Chapleau for this special purpose.

Sheahan, M.D.\nCharlevoix\n\nJan 13th, 1921\n\nTo Mr. H.G. Godfrey,\nIndian Agent,\nCharlevoix.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe examination of pupils at Charlevoix Residential School by Dr. Mary McKenzie Smith\n\nDr. Smith reported 13 cases with elevated tonsils, and that these required removal at once. I know that Dr. Smith has wide experience as regards throat conditions among school children, but in the case of Indian children my experience is that the fever elevations they have are the better. These cases have not reached any notice. My opinion is that from these cases would be benefited by removal of the tonsils when warmer weather comes, but should not be done during the winter. I find that if there is bad tendency in the case of these children as regards tuberculosis or any form of tuberculosis in the way of tubercular involvement, removal of the tonsils is often a questionable procedure.\n\nWith regard to the children who defective vision we are at a disadvantage in that no physician makes visits here. We have a local physician who can help some of them by fitting them with glasses. Some have had more or less serious conjunctivitis which after healing leave the eyes different in the appearance to fit with proper glasses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.J. Sheahan\nChapleau January 14th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg leave to enclose Mr. Sheahan's report in connection with Official letter No. 45-1-13 of January 2nd, and have gone into the whole matter with him and while he says that if the Department approves of his operating on these children who have rejected tonsils he finds from past experience that it is not always the best thing to do so much with these children in this particular district who are all more or less affected with traces of T.B. and therefore healing after the operation is not always possible and the patient is in a worse condition than before operated upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDpt. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 29th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of January 16th enclosing Dr. Sheahan's report on the pupils of the Chapleau Residential School. The Department desires to disclaim any intention of criticising Dr. Sheahan's professional opinion, but I think it permissible to observe that Dr. Sheahan has not furnished the Department with any reports on the health of the pupils and that the report of Dr. Smith, who was called in by Dr. Sheahan, suggested that some corrective work was immediately required.\n\nFacilities for medical attention for the pupils of the Chapleau School are very convenient and good, and the Department is quite prepared to leave the treatment of individual cases to Dr. Sheahan's judgment if assured that adequate attention is being paid to the pupils' health by means of regular examinations and a study of individual cases.\n\nThe Director of Medical Services wishes me to observe that while he cannot presume to instruct Dr. Sheahan in treating any pupils under his charge he has had reports from many parts of the country to the effect that the removal of tonsils was one of the most efficient ways of dealing with tubercular glands of the neck.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.J.

Godfrey Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChapleau Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOne of our pupils Charles Wesley, No. 56 attending High School complained of pain in his teeth. I sent him to Dr. Sheahan. The Dr. found no need of extraction. I then sent the boy to the Dentist. He reported three teeth needed filling and the total cost would be Four Dollars and Fifty cents (4.50). I write to see if you will ask the Department to allow me to have this work done.\n\nI would to ask permission to have all the teeth of the School Children examined by the Dentist and report the condition to you. Last year you gave permission to have this done and the result was most gratifying to us and saved a lot of trouble to the children. May I ask the Dentist to examine and report the condition this year. I am led to ask this as several of the other children are complaining of trouble with their teeth and we have some new children this year who were not examined as to the condition of their teeth. If you can permit this I am persuaded it will be a great boon to the children and relief to the Staff from night calls in cases of tooth ache by the children.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nChapleau February 25th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg leave to enclose letter from the Rev. Principal of the Chapleau Indian School relative to the condition of the children's teeth for your instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 3, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Chapleau Indian Residential School requesting to have dental attention provided for Charles Wesley, who is attending high school; also requesting permission to have the teeth of all the pupils examined by a dentist and furnish his report as to the dental work required.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Dr. R. J. Gawley, Chapleau, may examine the teeth of all the pupils and carry out the work only that is absolutely urgent at the present time. This includes the fillings required by Charles Wesley. Dr. Gawley will be allowed remuneration at the same rates as previously paid him, as mentioned in official letter dated September 26, 1930 viz., $1 per amalgam filling; $1.50 for compound cavities, 25 cents each for ordinary extractions and 50 cents each when a local anaesthetic is used. In view of the recent orders for strict economy, it is to be distinctly understood by the Dentist and the Principal that only the most urgent dental work is to be carried out, and it is not intended that any large account be rendered at this time.\n\nDr. Gawley should prepare his account, in duplicate, together with a list giving the name of each pupil receiving attention and the work performed in each case. This account is to be handed to you to be attached to a proper voucher form, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nPlease ascertain from Dr. Gawley if he will undertake the work, and, if so, arrange with him to carry out same at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

J. Gawley stating the number of extractions and fillings required at the present time. He states that he forwarded a copy of his letter to you.\n\nThe Department will approve of Dr. Gawley undertaking the work, and he will be allowed payment at the rates mentioned in letter above referred to. The total cost of the work should be kept within the sum of $150, as this is the full amount we can allow for this service at the present time. You may, therefore, arrange with Dr. Gawley to undertake the work at a time convenient to the Principal and himself. Dr. Gawley's recommendation regarding the extraction of deciduous teeth, when abscessed or interfering with the permanent teeth, and the extraction of permanent teeth when beyond repair, is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

VALE\u2014Principal\n\nDr. E. L. Stone,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Stone:\n\nI received a letter from R.M. Grant, 776 Bronson Ave., Ottawa in connection with the supplying of an insect Exterminator.\n\nI write to see if that is a bonafide letter and offer, and if you really are convinced it will do the work of getting rid of BED BUGS will you be good enough to order for us TWO gallons. It is understood we shall have to pay for this at the rate of $2.50 per gal.\n\nI regret to say somehow or other we were invaded by the above pests last year. I have tried to get rid of them and kept them pretty well under control during the Winter. The warmer days has brought out a few again and I am anxious to get completely rid of them. Can you give me any help along this line.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nApril 6th, 1938.\n\nDear Canon Velo,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 3rd, I may say that Mr. Grant brought me a sample of his insect exterminator. I should think it is a good product, but, naturally, I am not in a position to give a recommendation for the product of any particular commercial firm. It is my opinion that it will kill bed bugs and will not spoil textiles.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L. Stone, M.D.\nDirector of Medical Services.\n\nReverend Canon A. J.

This other person for whom it is suitable should also have what is required. The great increase in the consumption of Cod Liver Oil shows that there is a demand for it among Indians. It is desirable that you will answer the following questions and return this questionnaire to the Director of Indian Affairs, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nThe answers to these questions will necessarily be approximate; but it is hoped to gain some fairly reliable information.\n\nJuly 10th, 1933.\n\nReserve or School (state which) ____________________________\nName of Principal or Dispenser ____________________________\n\n1.

I thought this would be much less expensive than leaving the girl at the Hospital to draw the regulation daily charge.\n\nI am at this time also sending in the regular requisition so that one order will cover all.

If you can make the necessary arrangements with them and if it is the opinion that the work should be taken in hand now, you need make no further report if the work is not expected to exceed three days. It is understood under this arrangement that the dentist will be called upon to spend the whole of three full long days, but it is not necessary that he should do it on three consecutive days.\n\nIn making up his accounts the dentist is only required to specify the number of days' work he does and add on the face of the account form a list of the fillings, extractions, etc., which he has done. There is no object in making a long list of the pupils' names, though the principal will, undoubtedly, wish to preserve such a record.\n\nTo make this plan a success the principal must see that the pupils are organized into proper groups so that the dentist's time will not be wasted. In most schools the medical officer carries out the preliminary inspection and the dentist is only required to do the actual work. There is room in these proposals for any minor variation of the plan proposed which will meet the local situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\nJuly 17th, 1934\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 9th enclosing Dr. Gamley's estimate of dental work at the Chapleau Residential School, I wish to inform you of a new arrangement that the Department is bringing in for work of this kind. It has been found more satisfactory for all concerned to employ a dentist on a daily basis and the fee offered by the Department and accepted everywhere by dentists, is $30 per day which covers professional attendance and supply of ordinary materials. The class of work required is extractions and repair of cavities with a cheap type of filling. The amount of work estimated by Doctor Gamley, who has experience in other places, would seem to require about three days.\n\nWhether it should be done now or after the beginning of the new school year is not apparent to the Department, but might be decided between yourself and the principal of the school.\n\nBy this method in the course of a year or two the dentist finds himself able to get the children's teeth in a fairly good state of repair, after which only one or two days' work per annum is required. Many dentists have been somewhat reluctant to accept the fee offered in the beginning but after a year's trial have expressed themselves as not only satisfied but interested and anxious to co-operate in keeping up the dental condition of the pupils. Where the dentist lives a long way from the school it is the custom to pay his travelling expenses, but this would not be the case at Chapleau.\n\nT. J.

Vale Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby make application for FIVE pounds of Pyrethrum Insect Powder to combat the pest of Cockroaches that have invaded our school. I have tried several other remedies but have not overcome them. I consulted the Doctor and he advised using the Featings Powder. They tried this in my absence and found it better than other things.\n\nIt is difficult to get completely rid of them. I am told by a persistent use of this powder for a few days they can be eradicated.\n\nWill you be good enough to send along with this some small puffing cans so we can get the powder well into the cracks and get completely rid of the pest.\n\nI shall be very grateful if you will let me have this at your very earliest convenience.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 28, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant regarding the trouble you are having with cockroaches, I beg to say that Bulletin No. 112 of the Department of Agriculture suggests the following:\n\n\"Cockroaches may be readily controlled by means of sodium fluoride. This material should be lightly dusted in places frequented by the roaches such as about sinks, baseboards, cupboards, hot water pipes, etc. The sodium fluoride adheres to the legs and antennae of the roaches, and in cleansing themselves the insects are poisoned by it. Sodium fluoride retains its effectiveness and may be left undisturbed as long as convenient or until the cockroaches have completely disappeared. As this chemical is somewhat poisonous reasonable precautions should be taken to prevent children or domestic pets from gaining access to it.\n\nTwo other materials which form the basis of many proprietary roach powders and which often are recommended, are pyrethrum and borax. Pyrethrum insect powder is less effective than sodium fluoride; it loses its effectiveness quickly on exposure to air, and has to be used in larger quantity. Borax, also, is less satisfactory than sodium fluoride. It is easily obtainable, however, and mixed with equal parts of powdered sweet chocolate, is a fairly effective remedy. Superheating and fumigation with hydrocyanic acid gas are also effective in destroying cockroaches. In the case of hydrocyanic acid gas fumigation, however, our experiments indicate that a concentration of 1 per cent, or burning 2 lbs. of calcium cyanide per 1,000 cubic feet, although effective against nymphs and adults, does not destroy the eggs.\"\n\nThe cost of the ingredients required will be quite small, and it is considered that you should purchase same locally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Godfrey of Chapleau and John M. Daly of Parry Sound, as he came from that District.\n\nWe are of the opinion, the boy would have a much better start in life if he could be given an artificial leg. This matter was spoken of by Inspector McGookin on his last visit to our school.\n\nIf this could be done for him it might then be possible for us to get him a position as Time Keeper at one of the Road camps and so give him a start in the way of caring for himself. He has no home to return to.\n\nI shall be very glad to learn what you think of this idea. Perhaps you will be too urgent to take the matter up with Inspector McGookin. He can give you first hand information as he has seen the boy and talked with him. The boy is making good progress in his studies and is well spoken of by all at the High School.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n#115 Walter Heil - 20 years old\nInjil No. 678 Silver Band - Parry Sound Agency\nAdmitted Chapleau Mar. 10/35\nOctober 30th, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 22nd, your best course is to have Walter Heil examined by the Doctor, who must give his opinion as to whether his stump is ready for an artificial leg. To get such an appliance the boy would have to go to Toronto, where he would be kept in the Christie Street Hospital of the Department of Pensions and National Health. It might shorten his stay in Toronto if the stump were shrunk before he went there, by the application of elastic bandages. Perhaps the Doctor is familiar with this matter and could advise on it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nReverend A.J.

This boy is a cripple, having lost one of his legs some time ago. He is about to be discharged from the school, and my information is that the Department has refused to supply him with an artificial leg. It is stated that he is a very promising student and has his junior matriculation, and if he is discharged now without some further education he will be a burden on the community.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would look into this matter and see if something can be done to assist this boy in completing his education, and if possible to assist him in securing an artificial limb. Anything you can do to help this boy will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this matter, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Thos. Farquhar\nThos. Farquhar, M.

Farquhar, M.P., will you please furnish draft reply.\n\nA.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\nMay 20th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen you last applied for an artificial leg for Walter Heil, the Department's funds were so low that it did not think it could grant your request at that time. A friend has now interceded for him, and the Department's funds being in somewhat better condition it is prepared to discuss the matter again. A great deal of money has been expended for the education of this young man who is not actually a ward of the Government. He must face the prospect of earning a living for himself, and, if an artificial leg would make it possible for him to do so, the Department is willing to consider providing it.\n\nFirst, however, I should like to inquire what plans he may have in mind for his own future.\n\nAt the least calculation, his appliance will cost about $150. This sum of money can be put to very good advantage otherwise, as, for example, in providing the services of a dentist for about five days at your school. In short, the Department is willing to help the young man in this respect, if he has any definite plan for his own future self support.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nRev. A. J. Vale\nPrincipal Indian Residential School\nChapleau, Ont.\nMay 19th, 1936\n\nDear Mr. Farquhar:\n\nI have secured some information on the case of Walter Hall on whose behalf you wrote on May 15th. This boy is not a legal ward of the Dominion Government but as a matter of compassion the Department has provided twelve years schooling for him, including a course in the Collegiate Institute. He is now 21 years old and the Department holds, with, I should think some reason, that it has fairly done its duty toward him.\n\nIt will cost about $150.00 to provide this young man with an artificial leg. The request came in during the winter at a time when the Department feared that the appropriation for such purposes would be over-extended. It is so difficult to make the appropriation for medical services cover the requirements of the service that it was thought at that time that money could not be spared for this purpose. I will ask the officers of the Department to look into the matter now and I think their attitude may depend somewhat on what plans the young man may have for his own self-support.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThos. S. MacKee, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa\n\nW. J. F. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChapleau, Ont. May 28, 1934\n\nRev. A. J. Vale Principal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 24th No. 65-1-13 with reference to an artificial leg for Walter Heil. I beg to say I have gone carefully into the matter with him as to what he would like to do when he leaves the school as he must before very long.\n\nI pointed out it would be a long time before he could get through for a Teacher and he sees the truth of that. He says he would like to take up a regular bookkeeping course at a good school, like the Shaw Schools in Toronto or similar Training place so he could be fitted for office work.\n\nI think with his education here he could get through in one year if the Department could help him to that extent and he would then be able to earn his living. It is true the Department have spent a lot of money on him. It would seem poor policy to drop him now and lose all the good done, when a little more would bring credit to the Department, to our school, and to himself.\n\nI am delighted to learn this is a chance for him to get this artificial leg and so fit him for his future career as outlined above.\n\nI shall be very glad to operate in any way I can to help you in this undertaking for which I thank you most sincerely.\n\nHis High School examinations will close in June and he could then be fitted to go to the hospital at your bidding.\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nA.J. Vale Principal.\nMay 28th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 23rd, the combined opinion of the Educational and Medical Services of the Department is that the standing Walter Neil may make in his forthcoming examinations should be considered before any further plans are made for him. If he does well, the Department is prepared to provide him with an artificial leg and possibly to give him some further assistance in establishing himself.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

This will ensure the charges being made against that Agency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nT. J.

Sir:\n\nIn your letter dated May 23rd, last, regarding the supplying of an artificial leg for Walter Heil, a pupil of the Chapleau Indian Residential School, you recommended that he be given an opportunity to take a bookkeeping course in a school similar to the Shaw Schools in Toronto.\n\nIt is intended to provide this boy with an artificial leg, and it is considered that, during the time he is receiving treatment and fittings of the leg, he could take up the business course.\n\nPlease state the exact course he wishes to take. Is it the bookkeeping course only, or does he wish to also take shorthand and typewriting? I should be pleased if you would state the approximate length of time it would take him to complete the course and the fees that would be charged by the business college which he would attend. Besides his college course, there would also be board and books. As full information as you can give regarding the course he wishes to take and the cost involved will be appreciated. You might also state when he would be prepared to go to Toronto, when arrangements will be completed for him to obtain an artificial leg and enter the business college.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. J. Vale,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChapleau, Ont., Oct. 5, 1936\n\nMr. W. J.

I beg to reply as follows:\n\nCost of Books at beginning of course: $15.00\nExamination in each subject: $.50 each\nCost of Board per month: $25.00\nEstimated time to complete course six or eight months.\nA little extra money will be required for other books say $2.00\nA little money ought to be allowed for incidentals street car fare etc.\n\nTime Walter Hall will be ready to go to Toronto is at your call he can go at any time you are ready for him. May I ask if the authorities at the Christie Street Hospital would be able to help him to get board and also locate a suitable College to attend so as to be near for the treatments he will require. They would be in a better position to do this than I can at this distance. I suppose the Chaplain for instance if asked would be able to do this.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nhe is having the leg fitted.\n\nI would request that you correspond with the business college you recommend, obtain their rates, etc., for the course the boy wishes to take, and advise the Department, giving full information.\n\nYou will be advised, in a separate communication, regarding sending this boy to Toronto, to the Christie Street Hospital.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

You have not stated the exact course he wishes to take, the name of the business college he will attend or the fees charged by the college.\n\nWhat do you consider would be the future of this boy, after he completes the proposed course? Will there be any likelihood of his obtaining employment and taking advantage of the course? As a considerable sum of money would be required in putting him through a business college, the Department would like to be assured that the money will not be wasted. I would request that you state the name of the business college in Toronto which you recommend this boy attend, the fees charged by the college for tuition and, also, what arrangements have been made for suitable living accommodation and for his oversight while he is taking the course. As it will be some time before this boy obtains an artificial leg, would he be able to attend business college while\n\nRev. A. J.

Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn carefully reading over my copy of the letter sent you today in connection with Walter Heil, in reply to yours of Oct. 7,\n\nI consider a definite reply was not given to your query regarding the probability of this boy making use of the instruction now proposed for him. In this connection I would say I have good reason to believe he will make use of it. I am taking steps now to get in touch with men who can, and I hope will, employ him when he is ready to take up work after he has filled the course and has his artificial leg.\n\nI think the boy has enough character to make his way and hold a position if given a chance.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChateauguay, Ont. Oct. 16-1936\n\nREV. A. J. VALE Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 7th, I beg to say I have got in touch with the School in Toronto and have their reply showing by their syllabus the Course for a Complete Business or Office training will cost \u00a318.00 per month Books for same will cost \u00a317.00 at beginning with a possible supplementary cost of \u00a35.00 for supplies and \u00a34.50 for examinations.\n\nThe course will take about 10-12 months.\n\nI have made arrangements whereby Walter Heil can get Board at Wycliffe College for eight dollars per week. This will provide good supervision and care for him as we have two other boys there who can help him while in the city.\n\nThe Shaw Business School is located on St Charles Street within close walking distance so that he can easily get back and forth for lessons.\n\nI trust this may furnish you the full information and enable you to proceed as soon as an opening affords at the Hospital or even before so that he can get started.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn 1925, Walter Heil was placed in the Chapleau Indian Residential School. The application form for his admission was signed by Phillip Laforce and approved by you. This form stated that the boy was a son of No. 67 of the Gibson Band. On reviewing the pay list, it is found that No. 67 was Mrs. Eunice Hill, but the Department understands that she was married last year to John Nolan of Caughnawaga and, consequently, her name has been dropped from the pay list. The boy is between twenty and twenty-one years of age at the present time and has only one leg.\n\nThe Principal of the Chapleau Residential School has requested that this boy be supplied with an artificial leg and, also, that he be given a course at business college. The cost of the latter would be, approximately, $500.00, and the Department is doubtful if he would make any real use of a business education.\n\nIs there any provision that can be made for him on the reserve or would his mother, who, I presume, is now living at Caughnawaga, be willing to take him. He has reached the age where something must be done, as he should have been discharged from the Chapleau School before this time. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nOttawa, October 28, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with further reference to Walter Heil.\n\nThe business college course which you suggest would cost, approximately, $500.00. Owing to the many demands on our appropriation, the Department can hardly see its way clear to allow such a large amount for this boy. Please let me know why you consider it should take him between ten and twelve months for a business college course. As a rule, such courses can be obtained in about half that time.\n\nIn your letter, you mentioned that you are making inquiries with a view to ascertaining if employment could be secured for this boy in the event of his securing some further training. Please let me know if you have any definite information in this regard.\n\nIn the meantime, the Department is writing Mr. Agent Daly in order that we may know whether or not the boy could be returned to his home reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. J. Valo,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nChapleau, Ont.\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nCh\u00e2teau, Ont. Oct. 30-1936\n\nRev. A. J. Vale\u2014Principal\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 65-T-13 Dated October 28th in connection with Letter Hail. I beg to state my reason for giving the time required for the Complete Business Course as ten to twelve months was based on the information given in the Prospects of the Shaw Business College Toronto. That is the time they state it takes.\n\nIn reply to your question as to the success of my effort to secure work for this boy on completing his training, I have to say I have seen one of the employers of labor with a view to work for the boy next summer. All he could promise me was he would do his best by placing his name before the Company for consideration.\n\nI note you have written to Mr. Indian Agent Day of Parry Sound regarding the possibility of the boy being returned to his home. I trust this does not mean a refusal to grant the boy the Artificial limb. I do hope this will be given him even though the way to send him for further training is out of your reach.\n\nI am yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nI have taken up the matter with his uncle Philip Laforce in Gibson Reserve and he does not seem anxious to have the boy.\n\nTrusting this is the information required by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\n\nJMD/BK.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nOct. 30, 1936\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of Oct. 28th, 65-1-13 re Walter Hell, I have been in communication with Rev. Mr. J. Vale, principal of the Chapleau School re this matter at various times. I look upon this as a problem case and I recommended to the Department that he get an artificial leg when he would be full grown.\n\nIn pondering over the business course for Neil, my mind goes back to Alexander Decaire who was a member of the Wilson Band, and who has been enfranchised. This lad took a business course at McGill University and it appears to me that there was a lot of money spent on him for the benefit he has got out of it. He does a little bookkeeping at Baie where he is living now and I honestly do not look upon him as a bright and shining light in his community.\n\nMy idea is, that if Hell is inclined in that way, for his step-father and mother to make some provisions for him to stay with them at Laughnawaga and if he feels inclined to take a business course, he would be nearer a centre where he could make use of it. Canan Vale and his wife tell me that this boy is quite smart. Mr. Rankin Nesbitt and his wife tell me that the Williams boy at Moose Point is also smart. I cannot see it.\n\nMy recommendation is that Neil's step-father and mother be asked to look after the boy and encourage him in his desire for a business education. In this way if he has the ambition he will get there.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 12th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department understands that Mrs. Bunice Hill of the Gibson Reserve was married last year to John Nolan of Caughnawaga and that they are residing on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nFor some years past, a son of Mrs. Hill, named Walter Reil, has been a pupil of the Chapleau Indian Residential School. He is now about twenty-one years of age and the Department wishes to discharge him from the school mentioned.\n\nThe boy has only one leg and we are favourably disposed to make the necessary arrangements to provide him with an artificial leg. This could be done at the branch of the Department of Pensions & National Health in Montreal.\n\nPlease see Mrs. Nolan at once and advise her that the Department expects her to provide a home for her son and you should then write the Department in order that we may arrange to have him sent to Caughnawaga and, also, complete the necessary formalities for his securing an artificial leg in Montreal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

This girl is a diabetic child of a very active temperament requiring almost constant personal attention to attend her needs as she frequently falls down in convulsions during the day and at night cries out for a long period and then goes off in a convulsion. This disturbs the whole dormitory.\n\nWe have had to send her, at different times, to the hospital for the doctors to observe and prescribe treatment. We fear some calamity may overtake her without constant care. We are not equipped for this sort of case.\n\nWould it be possible for you to arrange for her to be sent to some institution that could provide the care she needs. She is too young for the classroom and our supervisor cannot give the personal supervision needed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Residential School Commission\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nSt. John's Indian Residential School\n\nChaplain\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (RG 10, Volume 6193, File A2-13, part 1)\nFebruary 24, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Sheahan:\n\nWe have a letter from Canon Vale about Mary Marsden.\n\nWe knew this child had diabetes, but no one told us she had convulsions. She was sent to school as the only apparent means of clearing up a most deplorable situation from where she came. Her mother has husband and three children, and also an unofficial husband and five children of whom this is the second youngest.\n\nApparently, she will have to be taken off Canon Vale's hands. What I wish you would tell me is whether she has any good prospect of living long, and if so, whether she is a candidate for entrance to an institution for mental defectives or epileptics, or whether she could be placed under the auspices of a Children's Aid Society somewhere.\n\nI do not think there is any hope of returning her to her mother who has gone back to her original family and husband. If she is not likely to live long, it might be as well to keep her in the hospital at Champlain if they can manage her there.\n\nCanon Vale will receive a copy of this letter and I am sure you will wish to consult further with him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. L. Stone, M.B.,\nSuperintendent of Medical Services.\n\nJ. J.

Sheahan. No doubt the latter will consult you regarding the girl.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A. J.

Sheahan, M.D.\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nDr. B. L. Stone,\nSupt. of Medical Services,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Stone:\n\nRe. Mary Marsden, about whom Canon Vale wrote you last month,\n\nAs this child apparently still continues subject to these attacks of convulsions, I believe it would be best to have her transferred to the hospital here for further observation.\n\nShe is now taking fifteen units daily of insulin and evidently requires that much, even on a strict diabetic diet. A child of four requiring that amount indicates a bad prognosis.\n\nIt is doubtful if these convulsions are really epileptic and we should be able to decide in two or three weeks what kind of institution would be best for her. She could, of course, be admitted to the hospital as soon as you give permission for her admission.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n65-1-13\nMarch 15, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nIn reply to your letter to Doctor Stone of March 9, it would appear to be advisable to have the child, Mary Marsden, admitted to hospital for further observation.\n\nPlease arrange to do this and when you have made a decision in her case, particularly along the lines as suggested to you in Doctor Stone's letter of February 24, advise the Department accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.

He said some of them have decayed teeth that ought to be taken out, and other work done as well.\n\nI write to see if you will ask the Department to give me permission to have the Dentist Dr. W.

Stone of the Department of Indian Affairs regarding the expenses in connection with the sending of the two girls to the Sanitarium.\n\nI beg to state I have now secured from Mrs. Vale, who escorted the two girls, a statement showing she received the money for same from me.\n\nThe expense was for Mrs. Vale herself staying in Toronto overnight in each case. Dr. E.L. Stone's letter might mean he thought it was for the girls. There was no cost for the girls in that way as they went direct to the Sanitarium in each case, but Mrs. Vale stayed overnight and has charged only for one meal in each case.\n\nI trust this may make it all clear and prove to be the information that is being asked for.\n\nI enclose a Statement from Mrs. Vale.\n\nDelay in my reply was caused by my being absent in Toronto.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nTo [Name],\n\nAccount from [Date] at [Location]\ndated [Date] Your voucher [Number]\namounting to $63.0\n\nJune 27th - Margaret Hutchequis:\nExpenses enroute Board and Lodging - \u00a31.80\n\nJuly 4th - Minnie Trapper:\nBoard and Lodging - \u00a31.60\n\nReceipts are required.\n\nI anticipate a reply to these observations.\nPayment of the account is being withheld.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

None has come to hand.\n\nI take this means of thank you for your prompt and kind help in this way. They have proved very helpful to us.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\nA. J. Vale\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a month ago, at your request, I agreed to try to see if we could take care of Mary Larsen, a former pupil of this school, who was at the time an inmate of the Hospital, with Diabetes.\n\nI tried her out for a month. We found she was causing too much disturbance by her outcries at night she would keep awake everyone in the school.\n\nI consulted Dr. Sheahan and Indian Agent Matters of Chapleau and they agreed the only thing for us to do was to return her to the Hospital until such time as you can make other arrangements for this child.\n\nI regret our inability to keep her, we gave it a fair trial and failed to be able to take care of her. Even though we had her isolated in a small room with her sister, she disturbed the whole school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSept. 17, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Mary Margdon.\n\nPlease attempt to make some arrangements for the care of this girl.\n\nThe Department does not feel justified in keeping her in hospital indefinitely at $2.50 a day. Surely there is some Indian family who could be trained to give her her insulin and attempt to keep her on her proper diet if it were supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

He is the boy you sent us from the Juvenile court recently held in London.\n\nI hope you may be able to supply the necessary glasses as their eye sight is very poor indeed but can be helped by the proper glasses.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.J.

Canon Vale, principle of the Chapleau Indian Residential school, also a report from the optician regarding the need of six of the pupils for glasses.\n\nNone of these children are able to pay anything toward the cost of glasses, being all from destitute families.\n\nI have approached the optician with a view to getting a better price on the six pairs but was unable to get any reduction, he contending that the price quoted was away below the usual price for such lenses as are required.\n\nThe children's eyesight must be protected, so I would recommend that they be procured, awaiting your instructions, I remain.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nF. Matters\nIndian Agent\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department approves the expenditure necessary to supply six pairs of glasses needed by pupils of the Chapleau Indian Residential School.

Canon Vale, principle of the St. John's Indian Residential School and with the co-operation of Dr. Sheahan, a survey of the teeth of the children attending the school was made by the local dentist, Dr. W. C. Young a few days ago, and he reports that out of 25 children with bad teeth about 50 extractions and the same number of fillings are necessary.\n\nBefore proceeding with any of this work, I advised him to wait until I had your ruling as to whether or not it should be done, or on what conditions with regard to the cost that you may determine, should apply, please advise me what you desire done in this case.\n\nUnder the same heading of medical attention, another girl Grace Missable should have glasses, she has a pair which she has left worn, she should have been included in those supplied about a month ago, but at that time was home to see her father who was seriously ill, and who has since died, a pair of glasses to fit her and aid her vision would cost $8.50, and I would request your authority to have these supplied at the cost of the department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nP.

Correspondence to this effect can be found at the Head Office in Winnipeg.\n\nThirdly, That education is becoming urgent in that district as the mining industry has taken hold there and the country is overrun by prospectors. Living conditions have materially changed of late.\n\nFourthly, That an educational establishment at or near Fort Frances will be under the public eye, nearly as much as Rat Portage, especially as it will be on the international boundary, hence the necessity for making provision for an institution that will be creditable to our country. Moreover, as it is destined to take the place of several day Schools, excepting the day school of Couchiching Reserve, would it not be advisable to provide accommodation for at least 40 children, even if the number to be admitted were limited to twenty for the first year.\n\nFifthly, That should the plea of undue favoritism arise, it might be remarked that Anishnaws have been provided with day schools, wherever their jurisdiction extended, and with some costly ones, notably on Rainy River. In the present instance, it is a question supplying the place of day schools with a Boarding School.\n\nIn consequence of all these motives, we earnestly ask the Government to kindly grant a Boarding School of Indians at Fort Frances, at Father's Point, if possible, to provide accommodation for, at least, 40 children.\n\nHoping that this Request will meet your approval and will receive your kind support, I have the honour to be\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\n(662-19, Volume 619), File 4653-1, part 1\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward an application from his Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface for the establishment of a Boarding School at Fort Frances for the children of the Couteheeshing Agency Indians.

A new building has been purchased to\nreplace the old one at Manito, so that the three\nbuildings are in every way satisfactory. Water\nclosets have also been built at each. The teach-\ners have no certificates. Also a day school at\nCouchiching Reserve. The standard course of\nstudies are followed as nearly as possible. The\nattendance is neither regular or large, conse-\nquently the progress of the pupils is not good\non that account.\n\n\"The parents do not appear to take much in-\nterest in the education of their children. I\ncontinue to impress on them the importance of\neducation, and have frequently pointed out to\nthe teachers the necessity of continuing their\nefforts in getting a larger and more regular atten-\ndance.\"\n\nInspector Leveque, whose inspectorate embraces\nthe Couchiching Agency, in his report to the 30th\nJune last makes the following remarks in respect to\nthe education of the Indian children in that Agency:\n\nHungry\nOttawa, 20th October, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nWith reference to the application of the Arch-\nbishop of St. Boniface for the establishment of a\nboarding school in the neighbourhood of Fort Frances\nnear Rainy Lake, I have to make the following re-\nmarks.\n\nIn reply to the statement that the reason that\nday schools were not erected on the reserves in\nthe district in question was the prospect of a\nboarding school at Fort Frances, Coote's remarking\nthat it may be remarked that this very same\nreason was advanced for the establishment of a\nboarding school at Rat Portage in the same district,\nand now that a school at the latter place has been\nin existence for about a year and a half, a new ap-\nplication is made of the old argument. Moreover,\nbefore it was decided to open a boarding school at\nRat Portage, Fort Frances was considered as a pos-\nsible site instead, but the former was selected\nas the better site, and for very good reasons\u2014\namong others no doubt being the fact that it is\non the line of the C.P.R., and therefore easily reached,\nwhile the international boundary, being so close to\nthe latter site, is quite an objection.\n\nIn his annual report of the 30th June last Mr.\nMacdonald, Indian Agent at Fort Frances, makes the\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, 24th October, 1899.\n\nYour Grace:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt, through the Indian Commissioner, of Your Grace's letter of the 9th ultimo, addressed to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, asking the Government to establish an Indian boarding school, with accommodation for at least forty children, near Fort Frances, Ontario.\n\nIn reply I am directed to say that as there are no funds at the disposal of the Department for the present fiscal year out of which the cost of a new boarding school could be paid. The matter will, however, be given due consideration; although in view of the increased expenditure for Indian education it is a question whether the Government will feel disposed to create any new boarding schools for some time, at least until the subject of the day schools has been fully gone into and a decision arrived at as to the future policy regarding them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.M.

This meeting took place at\nStandikaming Reserve on the 20th inst.\nFive Reserves were represented by their chiefs\n& councillors, viz:\nCouchiching, Standikaming, West Bay,\nKickaboomkaming (not attended), and Little\nForks Reserve on Rainy River.\n\nI attended the meeting by invitation of the\nIndians in order to note down their deliberations\nand transmit the same to your grace.\n\nThe object of the meeting was to discuss\nthe question of an Industrial or Boarding\nSchool for Rainy Lake.\n\nThe deliberations and resolutions were\nsubstantially as follows:\n\nConsidering:\nThat hunting & fishing are hardly sufficient\nat present to obtain a living, and that it\nbecomes necessary for our children to master\nthe English Language in order to cope with\nthe new condition of things prevailing since\nthe arrival of the white man in our\nneighbourhood.\nThat the so-called Day Schools on the Reserve have failed to attain that end viz:\nTeach the English Language.\n\nThat most of our Indians never had even the small benefit of a day-school.\n\nThat the rapid development of this section of the country calls for a proportionate rapid improvement in the education of our children.\n\nBe it Resolved:\n\n1. That an urgent request be made to the Government for the establishment of an Industrial School for the benefit of the Rainy Lake Indians.\n\n2. That said school be situated on the point of land commonly known as Father's Point.\n\n3. That these resolutions be placed in the hands of His Grace the Archbishop of St. Boniface with request that he use all his best efforts with the Government to obtain for us the object which these resolutions set forth.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYour Grace's most humble servant,\n\nC.

On the stair platforms, at each end of main corridor, on two floors, exits to outside of building have been put in, with good platforms and stairs down from same, to serve as safe fire-escapes in case of emergency. The attic dormitories are isolated from the corridors below, by a closed in stair and doors to same below the landings. On each landing is placed the outside doors to the fire-escape. The work mentioned in this clause is called for in the plans or specifications, but is a wise and necessary addition.\n\n5th. All the painting is completed in a good manner as called for in the specifications.\n\n6th. The plastering has all been done in a good manner, much better than could have been required, owing to the obscurity of the specifications.\n\n7th. The heating plant is not specified in the specifications, but they have installed a good low-pressure steam plant, with ornamental cast iron radiators in all rooms, halls etc., and also steam coil for attic tanks. The plant is all in good order and the resident Priest informs us that it works very satisfactorily.\n\n8th. The lighting apparatus is all fitted up complete. The gas generator, pump, and gasoline meter are of same design as the ones installed at Fort Alexander and Sandy Bay, and are all fitted up complete in good working order, having shafting, pulleys and wood-saving apparatus outside of building.\n\nA separate building, 20'x10' x 30', on a good stone foundation has been erected, located about 20' from the main building, in which the said generator, pump and meter are placed. Although not shown or called for by the specifications, this is to be commended and is much preferable to the arrangements for these plants which were installed in the other schools. This building is heated with steam from the boiler in the main building, having protected steam pipe connection.\n\n9th. Water, etc. The water supply is pumped from the Rainy River, or rather from a bay at this point which is an over-spreading of the rain river current. The water supply pipe, at present, is laid out into the bay about 200 feet from the shore, and it is proposed when the ice is thickly formed, to put on an additional 800 feet, or more if necessary, to extend out to the current of the river, so that the intake will be in the deep running water, and also so that the mouth of the intake will be as far as possible up stream. The drainage from the building empties into the bay, downstream from the water pipe. On account however, of the water being partially stagnant in the bay, especially near the bank, it is of vital importance that the water taken from the river for domestic purposes, should be from the running current.\n\nThe water supply for the building is pumped into three galv. iron tanks, 4'x6'x7' each, placed above the attic ceiling, from which all the fixtures...\nWINNIPEG, MAN., Dec. 26th, 1905.\n\nD. Laird Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner, Winnipeg,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to your request of Dec. 15th., I have made a personal inspection of the School building which has just been erected on or near the Indian Reserve at Fort Frances, Ont., by the Oblate Fathers of the Roman Catholic Church and beg to report as follows:\n\n1st. I found that the building is completed with the exception of the setting up of 4 or 5 water-closets. The Plumber was at that time working on them, (Dec. 20th.) and expected to finish in 3 or 4 days. In connection with the closets for the school, I may say that the Fathers made a change from the specifications, and instead of using range closets as called for, substituted single and separate ones with seat operating flush, instead of automatic tank flush. These are put in throughout the building. This change increased the expense and I think that it should be commended as in my opinion, these fixtures are better adapted for schools of this grade and character than the trough or chain pull closets.\n\n2nd. I may say that in May, last, I was taken to Fort Frances, by Father Poitras, to make an inspection of the foundations and stone basement which had been built in the fall of 1904, as they had received conflicting reports as to the quality of the work. Acting on my advice they took all the work down and rebuilt the basement in a first class manner.\n\n3rd. The building above the basement which is of frame construction, has been well built and all the carpenter and joinery work has been done in a good and workmanlike manner. All the material for the outside and inside finish is of good quality, with the exception of the flooring which is rather knotty. The exterior work has been carried out as called for by the plans, the attic being made 6\" higher than shown on plans. The tower has been omitted. The platform at the main entrance has been made larger than called for and a neat entrance vestibule has been built on the same. The entrance doors are of oak instead of pine as called for. Inside of building, a few changes have been made in the location of doors and partitions which are an improvement on the plans. The inside doors and frames throughout are per specifications, and the doors have all been hung in conformity with the Statute requirements, and no door\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in reference to the transfer of the St. Boniface Industrial School building and in regard to that portion of same asking that conveyance be made from \"Les Reverends Peres Oblats\" of the new boarding schools at Sandy Bay, Fort Alexander and Fort Frances including the land occupied by and appurtenant to the said three boarding schools. I beg to say that each of these schools is erected on Indian Reserve land, therefore the Oblates have no title to the lands in question and cannot therefore convey same to the Crown. The Department, I understand, always held that school buildings on Indian Reserves were safely under its control.\n\nAs to the buildings, so situated, I am not sure that it is necessary to have them conveyed. But if the Department thinks otherwise I would like to have a form of conveyance made out by the Department such as it requires.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Chisholm's inspection of the Fort Frances building, I am enclosing his report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Pedley Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nThere is installed in the school a low pressure steam plant with cast iron radiators. The report states the piping has been installed in a good manner and the plant is all in good order. It is noted however that Architect Chisholm has neither given the capacity of the boiler, the amount of radiation or his opinion as to its sufficiency for this building.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMemo.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 12th January, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,-\n\nI have examined the report of James Chisholm, architect of Winnipeg, on the Fort Frances Indian school. He reports that the building is now complete with the exception of some of the plumbing fittings which would be installed within a few days after his inspection (13th December, 1905), and that the work is done in a perfectly satisfactory manner.\n\nHe states that considerable work has been done which is not called for in the specifications. The items mentioned are however covered by a letter supplementing the specifications.\n\nIt is noted that the changes required by the Department have been made, and that all exterior doors now open outward, as also dormitory and class rooms. Fire escapes have been provided for two upper floors, and doors provided at each end of corridor on ground floor (shown as windows on the plan) giving additional means of escape in case of fire.\n\nMinor changes have been made in the interior of the building which Architect Chisholm considers advantageous, and it is noted that a defective foundation was taken down and entirely rebuilt.\n\nIt is stated in the report that water is pumped into three tanks above attic. The capacity of the tanks however are not given. The specification calls for 600 gal. tank, this amount would be of little service for stand pipe unless other means of storing water and providing pressure are available. Nothing is stated in this report as to fixtures and furnishings for the school.\nOttawa, 19th January, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your report of the 28th ultimo on the construction of the Fort Frances Indian school, I have to request you to be good enough to state what is the capacity of the boiler and the amount of radiation, and your opinion as to its sufficiency for the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\ncipally by hunting Indians it occurs to me to ask you whether you have under consideration any special system of instruction for children whose parents are hunters and who must in their turn become hunters. It would seem to be advisable to have well conducted day schools and allow the Indian children to early learn the habits of the chase; and to give advanced education only to those who are specially promising and who have sufficient stamina to withstand the confinement of Boarding School life.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. Father Poitras,\nThe Juniorate,\nCumberland St.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 20th., 1908.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of 24th January with reference to the requirements of the Fort Frances School. In reply to your first requisition I beg to say that the Department does not see its way clear to increase the number of children in residence at the Fort Frances School.\n\n(1) The whole question of the increase in the per capita grant paid is receiving consideration, and the claims of the Fort Frances School will not be lost sight of.\n\n(2) As this School is one which was taken over in lieu of the St. Boniface School it does not seem possible to pay a deficit which was incurred for clearing land, and the general principle has been laid down that the Department would not be responsible for deficits at Boarding Schools.\n\nAlthough it was supposed that the schools taken over were furnished with an adequate system of drainage, if it was found that new work was necessary to perfect that system and by so doing to contribute to the health of the pupils, the Department would not be averse to giving some assistance toward the work, if proper accounts are presented for the outlay.\n\nAs this School draws its pupils from reserves occupied prin-\nthe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, you are the foster father of the poor Indians, and it is to you that they look for help to improve their conditions.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nthis school than any other school in the West where they cannot raise their own meat, milk and butter. Hay has cost from $20 to $24 a ton and everything else in proportion. Being closer to civilisation the children have to be kept better and tidier than if they were living on the prairie or in the woods.\n\nIn your letter of the 28th of February you express the opinion that these Indians are in a peculiar condition, being hunting Indians, and that they need a special system of instruction. Allow me to say that hunting is a thing of the past, for all the Bands in Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods Districts. It is a fact of experience that wherever the white people have penetrated, the fur bearing animals are destroyed and soon disappear, which is the case here. The whole country has been overrun by lumbermen, prospectors, miners, settlers, etc., who have destroyed the hunting grounds of the Indians. I refer you to the reports of the Agents and Inspectors. Read the Item \"Occupation,\" and you will find out that, as a rule, the Indians have to have recourse to other means besides hunting to support their families. It will become more especially for the growing generation. They will have to earn their living, as the white people, and they must be prepared for it and trained from youth. That training they get in our Industrial and Boarding Schools\u2014nowhere else. The girls are initiated into all the details of housekeeping, and contract habits of cleanliness, order and economy; and the boys learn all kinds of work which they will have to do later on as a means of sustenance. That could not be accomplished in the day schools. It has been tried in many places in the past and had to be abolished as a failure. On account of the roaming habits of the Indians, it is impossible to get a large and regular attendance; besides, to civilise the Indian children you have to take them away from their surroundings.\n\nPardon me for taking so much of your valuable time, but I have this great work at heart, and it should be so with you, as\nMarch 20, 1908.\n\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, P. Q.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nRe Indian Boarding School, Fort Frances, Ont.\n\nActing on your recommendation contained in your favor of the 20th of February, I have procured vouchers covering the cost of the extension of the Water Works, which I herein enclose. On account of extreme low water, as I expressed in my request of the 24th of February, a drain 1500 feet long by 4 feet deep had to be dug, and over 500 feet of 2 1/2 inch galvanized pipe added, which was very hard work to do and required a very skillful man. To dig under water a special scraper had to be made, and dynamite had to be used to blast the frozen ground. You will be convinced of the necessity of the work when I tell you that during the whole winter water had to be drawn with horses and carried up stairs in pails to flush the closets. I need not insist on the inconveniences of such a system. I therefore ask of you to pay the full cost of that very necessary work which had to be done without delay. The material has been bought at wholesale price, and wages fair and just, considering the hard work done, have been paid.\n\nI take this opportunity to ask of you to reconsider our decision about the increase of 20 children for this school as has been done for the Fort Alexander Indian Boarding School, which is now in almost the same condition.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, September 22, 1909.\n\nMemo. for Fort Frances Boarding School File, No. 5.\n\nTwenty-four Diamond Dry Dust Fire Extinguishers are being sent to this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nIn fact for the past two years the school has been keeping from four to seven children for whom they have not been paid.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nThe Indian Office,\nFort Frances, Ont.,\n23rd September, 1909\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the number of pupils allowed at the Fort Frances Boarding School, I would respectfully recommend that the grant be increased to provide for fifty pupils.\n\nMy reasons are that an aggregate allowance for forty pupils would not cover the necessary expenditure, and therefore the school has a deficit each year, but an allowance for fifty pupils would, it is thought, cover all expenditure.\n\nThe building can accommodate fifty pupils as easily as forty and they have sufficient furniture on hand for the larger number. Again if this number is granted they could afford to have two teachers, whereas they only have one now, which in my opinion is not sufficient.\n\nThis is the only school we have for the Couchiching, Stangecoming, Biacatobewenin, Biickickanescanecaning and Lac la Ctoix Bands, when there are over one hundred children of school age and there are children applying for admission to the school all through the year.\n\nIn\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\n\nOttawa,\n\nOnt.\nContract for Fort Harvey Bldg School forwarded to Most Rev.

The father and mother were legally married, but the father, a white man, deserted the family and went to the States. The mother then placed the children with Father Vales upon the understanding that she was to pay so much per month for the maintenance.

John Seaman,\nInspector of Indian Agencies and Schools,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nHon. Sir,\n\nIn our present position I am obliged to refuse the admission to the school of children belonging to the tribe and after having an interview with our agent Mr. J. P. Wright about it, thought it would be advisable to put up the number of children in seventy (70) I have already admitted sixty-nine (69) and the time has not been long enough for seventy. But for the welfare of the children and the tribe in general, I must take into consideration the welfare of the tribe. Therefore, I have determined to keep the school closed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files\n(65104 Volume 619a File 403-1, part 1)\nI also enclose a letter from the principal of the school, asking to have the number of pupils increased to 70.

Wright,\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, November 16, 1920.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nA request has been received from the Principal of the Fort Frances Boarding School that the number of pupils for which a grant is allowed be increased by 10. The school at present receives a grant for 60 pupils at $120.00 per capita and the Principal states that he has already 69 on the roll and considers there is no trouble to recruit to the numbers for which he wishes to receive the grant. I may say that there is accommodation in the building for 54 girls and 39 boys, a total of 73 pupils.\n\nThere is no provision in the current year's estimates for an increase in the pupilage, but I would recommend that an increase of ten pupils be provided in the estimates for the next fiscal year, as the school has the accommodation and there are sufficient children. I think it would be in the interests of the Indians, as well as the Department, to provide educational facilities up to the number for which the school can provide accommodation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

This increase is, however, being provided for in the estimates which are being submitted to parliament at the next session and, if allowed, will provide for 70 pupils from the first of April next.\n\nIn the meantime I regret that it will not be possible to allow the grant for more than 60 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.F.

While I have my own auto, and would try to keep down cost, this could entail extra expense in time and a reasonable amount for use of auto., besides the work would probably extend into the winter months when an auto could not be used.\n\n(2) In winter, the days become shorter and darker. My office is equipped with proper electric lighting equipment for dental work. On many fall and winter days up here, it is impossible to do proper work without proper dental lighting equipment, and during these seasons the light in the mornings and evenings is nearly always poor, unless augmented by electric light.\n\n(3) I have in my office here-up-to-date electric and also chemical Dental Sterilization equipment. The sterilization of instruments used in this work must be carefully done and can be done more effectively in my office and by my nurse than can be at the school.\n\n(4) There is no proper dental chair at the school. I would be obliged to put one of my chairs up there to work efficiently. This would also entail extra expense.\n\n(5) I have a very fine, to me, of the best electric and water meters at my office in town, electric lights and various other things which it would be almost impossible to move back and forth. I have lost money I could use but not as satisfactorily.\n\n(6) While I make every effort to avoid causing children pain, sometimes we cannot avoid causing some pain. When we do, it is just as well that the other children who are to be operated on later, should not be in the immediate vicinity as the psychological effect is bad.\n\n(7) Summing it all up, I would say that this work can be done better and at less cost than at my office in town than at the school.\n\nFather Brassard and his sisters are unable to run their office and in town on other business, there is telephone connection to the school and appointments can easily be made and the children brought down two or three at a time as has been done in the past. The work will probably extend over several months but I am sure the children will be given more satisfactory service if handled in that way, and at less cost to the department.\n\nIt is impossible for me to give a bulk estimate of the cost but I would charge the same as I do for public school children, which is as follows:\n\nAmalgam fillings (without treatment) 75\u00a2, 1.00 and 1.25\nAmalgam fillings (with devitalisation or treatment) anteriors or bicuspids $2.50, molars $3.00\n\nNotes:- In the majority of cases, in children's teeth, where a tooth must be devitalized or treated, I believe it is better to remove the tooth, as the dead tooth will always be a weak one and \"thrust\"\nDr. H. A. Reeves  \nDENTIST AND  \nOPTOMETRIST  \n\nFORT FRANCES Sept. 29th, 1922  \n\nJ.F. Wright Esq.  \nIndian Agent  \nFort Frances  \n\nDear Sir:  \n\nIn reference to the matter of Dental attention for the children of the Industrial school here, about which you requested information as to cost etc., I beg to say\u2014  \n\nRecently there has been a more active movement among the Dentists of Ontario towards saving the children's teeth and to that end, many Dentists have volunteered to examine the teeth of the school children of their locality. I was appointed by the Public School Board here to examine the teeth of the children of the Public Schools. I did this without cost to the school board and when the examination was completed, and as a further extension of the work, I decided that it was only fair to the children of the Industrial school to give them an equal chance with the white children.  \n\nAfter being given permission by Father Brassard and Dr. Moore, my nurse and myself went over to examine at the school.  \n\nIn order to leave the whole matter in the hands of your department to take such action in regard to the matter as they might see fit, we handed over all records (both originals and carbon copies) to Father Brassard. If your Department decides to have the work done, I would suggest having one set of records handed over to the Dentist appointed to do the work. No charge will be made by me for this examination.  \n\nI also extracted quite a number of temporary teeth whose extraction was urgently required and for this have charged $3.00 each.  \n\nFor the children of the Public Schools, who are having their teeth attended to, I am making a decided reduction in fees and will gladly do the same for the children of the Industrial School.  \n\nIn the letter from the Department, it is stated that the work should be done at the school. I believe this would be a mistake for several reasons:\u2014  \n\n(1) In my office in town, I have my nurse who has been trained to assist me in the work and is of special value in working on the teeth of children. I presume I could take her with me on my trips to the school but that would at present mean the closing of my office each time, leaving no one to answer telephonic calls and make appointments.  \n\nAt a later date, I expect to have a graduate assistant again, and if the Department decides that the proposed experiment justified setting up a chair and equipment at the school, I would then be in a position to handle future work for the children at the school, but at present I do not think expense would be necessary or justified.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the dental defects of the pupils of the Fort Frances Boarding School, I have the honor to enclose a letter from Dr. Reeves, who made the examination of these children and I think he has covered the ground very fully. It would be absurd for me who knows nothing about such matters and not having the Doctor's report, to try and make an estimate of the cost this work would entail, if the Doctor who made the examination considers it impossible to do so.\n\nI quite agree with the Doctor regarding the work being done at his Office and not at the School.\n\nI also enclose a letter from Dr. Bell of this town, who is the only Dentist besides Dr. Reeves here, and in my conversation with him, he informed me that the work could be better done in his office than at the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 3, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing communications from Drs. Reeves and Bell, relative to the dental defects of the pupils of the Fort Frances Boarding School, and stating the prices charged for having the necessary treatment administered in the cases of the pupils requiring same.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange with Dr. Reeves to have the extractions and fillings made, where required. Only the cheaper grade of material should be used for filling. It is noted that the fees charged by Dr. Reeves are considerably reduced below his regular charges. The dental work may be performed by him in his office, and the principal should arrange to send the children as required by him, without any charge to this Department for their transportation.\n\nNo undue expenditure should be incurred and only the most urgent cases among the children should receive attention. In most of the cases it is considered that it would be better to remove the teeth rather than go to any unnecessary expense in having fillings made. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to see that the work is carried out at as low a cost as possible.\n\nCertified accounts in duplicate, showing the work performed for each child, should be furnished by the dentist. You will kindly certify these accounts, attach proper voucher forms and forward them to the Department for payment.\n\nYou may arrange with Dr. Reeves to undertake this work as soon as possible. The reports made by him regarding the dental defects of each of the children are returned herewith, and you will be good enough to hand these to him for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It appears that there are very many more Indian children who could be accommodated in school if provision could be made. There being no day school in this vicinity the only facilities for Indian education is at this boarding school. He feels that 100 could easily be found for regular attendance. To do this would mean that the school would have to be enlarged. It is a question just what the cost might be. Considering that this boarding school is the only one between the Manitoba boundary and Fort William, I have no hesitation in recommending that this school be enlarged to accommodate 100 children.\n\nJ.

I believe that arrangements can be made to repair the cow stable and to prepare an approach to it, early next year.

In my opinion the school could accommodate that number principally in the class-room and dormitories, as you may see by the following additions:\n\nBoys Dormitory, Height 28 ft., width 67 ft., length 47 ft.\nGirls Dormitory, Height 30 ft., width 57 ft., length 47 ft.\nBoys Dormitory, Height 34 ft., width 50 ft., length 34 ft.\nGirls Dormitory, Height 36 ft., width 50 ft., length 34 ft.\n\nHoping to hear favourably,\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.

Principal.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter I received from The Principal of the Fort Frances Residential School, in which he asks that the quota of pupils be raised from 80 at present, to 85.\n\nI would suggest that the matter of raising the quota be put before Mr. R.T. Ferrier, who has visited the School and knows if the School will accommodate any more or not.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 14, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 8110 of the 2nd instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Fort Frances Indian Residential School, in which he requests that the pupilage be raised from 80 to 85. The dimensions of the dormitories which he gives are not the same as those given in former Indian Agent Wright's 7623 of November 21, 1923. Before intelligent consideration can be given to the Rev. Principal's request, it will be necessary to know the exact size (three dimensions) of the two dormitories. Upon the occasion of your next visit to the school, I should be grateful if you would arrange for accurate measurements and submit them to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Spencer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Frances, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo; in regard to the dimensions of the Class rooms and dormitories of the Fort Frances Residential School, so I have visited the school and measured the rooms and find them as follows viz:\u2014\n\n| Girls Dormitory | 52 ft 2 in by 39 ft 7 in |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Boys Room       | 28 ft 2 in by 30 ft 10 in |\n| Other Room      | 38 ft 7 in by 30 ft 8 in |\n\nThese are the exact dimensions of the rooms asked for. I find that Father Perrault had sent you the measurements in links instead of feet, as he looked at the wrong side of the tape when measuring; therefore the big listake.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAccommodation 95' [signature]\n\nOctober 18th, 1925\nOttawa, September 30, 1925.\n\n8129\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, furnishing the dimensions of the classrooms and dormitories of the Fort Frances Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it has been decided to give favourable consideration to the request to increase the pupilage at this school from 75 to 85, as it is noted that there is accommodation for the latter number. This increase in pupilage will date from October 1, 1925. Please inform the principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nAct. Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.

The Department considers it important that there should be a qualified teacher in charge of this room, and I would therefore request you to make immediate arrangements to secure such teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

School, is very tired, and I feel it is my duty to give him a complete rest.\n\nI propose to the Department for approval the choice of Reverend Father H.M.

Father Brassard has a long experience in the management of Indian Schools, and no doubt it will be beneficial to Fort Frances School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr Russell T.

I.,\n340 Provancher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface,\nMan.\nSir:\n\nIn regard to this Account, I have to report that the pipes at the Indian Residential School, froze up, so that I had to send a plumber up and repair the damage, no doubt but it was caused by not keeping the fires up, so that it was a careless thing of the Principal, so much so that I took it up with the Church Officials at St Boniface, and they sent their Inspector down, with the result that the present Principal Father Perrault, is being removed from here, and a new Principal is being sent in his place, the School has under his care been going to pieces, and need to do something to stop the careless way. I might say also that the Father has been too careless in lots of other things, that should not be around the school, such as letting the children run all over and not regulate a school. The Indians has put in several claims that the children were not being properly fed and clothed and were also freezing in the school.\n\nAnd I only hope that the new Principal will put things in shape, and carry on to the benefit of both the church and the Indian Department more successfully.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Minister:\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nAfter four years of absence my superior called me back to take charge of Fort Frances School. During that lapse of time, it seems to me that some changes have taken place for the time of the assistance of the pupils or the number of their years at the school. In the past the Dept. had ruled that pupils should not be discharged before the age of sixteen if they had reason, and for the others if they had no reason, before eighteen years old. Now I see that children of fourteen and fifteen years of age have been discharged from the school with and without reason, principally for the girls who are exposed to a great danger of immorality. I would be very glad to know from the Department what they think about it, and what they want me to do.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 26th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th instant, in connection with the discharge of pupils from the Fort Frances Residential School, I beg to say that the Department desires you to follow the same procedure as you did when formerly in charge of this school. It is felt that, in the majority of cases, it is beneficial to the pupils to have them remain at the school until they have fully completed their education. While the compulsory clause of the Indian Act does not give authority to enforce attendance until eighteen years of age, Indian Agent and principals and others interested in Indian education are urged to make every possible endeavour to have children remain in the school until they reach the age mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Agent, seem determined to do the\nsame for our School.\n\nRelying to the fact that, by the Indian Act, (Part\nlst. no. 9.) they have a right to inspect the school, they want\nto make a thorough inspection of it. They go so far that they want\nsee our books. They asked for them, but they were refused.\n\nA first visit was already made, and they intend\ncoming back soon. In this first inspection, they took the liberty\nof making unjust remarks in the presence of the pupils.--If there\nare remarks to be made these should not be mentioned in the\npresence of the children as this hinders discipline and authority,\nbut to the Principal of the School, who can see if there are no\ncauses to account for these remarks.\n\nBy these inspections, the children become\nexcited and unruly, so that the task is an arduous one to all those\nin charge of the School.--In the dining room, the children pretend\nOttawa, January 31, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, regarding the trouble which is being occasioned at the Fort Frances Indian Residential School by the action of the Chief and Councillors of the Band, who claim the right to visit and inspect the school whenever they desire to do so.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, under Section 9 (6) of the Indian Act, the Chief and Council of a band have the right to inspect a school at which children of the band attend, at such reasonable times only as may be agreed upon by the Indian Agent and the Principal of the School. It is considered that not more than two visits each year by the Chief and Councillors should be sufficient and these visits should be made only at times convenient to the Agent and yourself. The Chief and Council have no right to visit the school indiscriminately and interfere with the regular routine of the classroom. During their visit, they have no right to inspect the books or accounts.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. Agent Spencer and requesting him to give definite instructions to the Chief and Councillors that before they make any visit, they are to arrange with the Agent and yourself, and they should be accompanied each time by the Indian Agent.
