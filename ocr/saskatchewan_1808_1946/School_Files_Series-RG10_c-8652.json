Henri Poissin, for freight of materials supplied for the addition to St. Joseph's Indian Boarding School, Cross Lake. This Voucher is supported by the Copies of Bills of Lading, Statements and receipts of The Northern Fish Co., Selkirk, for the freight from Selkirk to Whiskey Jack. The item for boxes was to protect the lime where the bag were broken on receipt at Selkirk. I also enclose the Statements of Rev. Poissin of the freight from Whiskey Jack to Cross Lake. The weights are the same as the Fish Co's, and the charge of 50\u00a2 is fair.\n\nI may say that The Fish Co. claim an additional $74.50 on the freight for the boiler, as they state their charge for this was $250. for the trip, while it was figured and paid for by the Principal as 27,000 lbs. @ 65\u00a2. I will be in Cross Lake shortly, and will take this matter up, and if correct, will later issue a further voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Aast.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 4)\nNovember 1924\n\nMr John R Bunn Esq Inspector of Indian Agencies\nWinnipeg\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA few months have passed away already, since the last report concerning the works on the new Addition.\n\nAs we were delayed by the roofing papers, the mason work finished much later than we all expected; but nevertheless, favoured by a nice weather; all the outside of the whole addition was finished; the cornices all around the roof were painted; and the eaves pipes, all connected to the main sewer. About the Boiler, we want to tell you that we have had very hard time. We took six days to cross the five miles portage, and one day to load on our barge. Everythings were all set to leave on the next morning; but during the night, a big storm with snow came; and the waves pushed by a strong south wind, filled our barge up to the top. A good chance, we had her in a shallow place; there we took a day and half before we could have our barge to float, and the big boiler well balanced inside, because the least difference was enough to upset our barge, as she was not much bigger than the boiler itself. You can imagine the hard time we have had there.\n\nIn the last twelve miles in the lake, it went good; but we took 8 hours. The expenses amount to $220.00 and the North Fish Co bill is $250.; or $472.00 for the freight, from Selkirk to Cross Lake.\n\nAt the present time, it is set up to its place, and operates since three weeks. She will heat very well; but a big trouble arose about the chimney, which is too small. According to the size of the boiler the chimney should be about 432 square inches of surface, and ours has only 144 square inches. There is no draft, and to prevent it from smoking, we have to keep the draft doors closed. To remedy to that,\nI was thinking to keep the present chimney for ventilation, and to build another one of the right size, near the other one, but inside; because it must disfigure the outside wall, and we will be able to build it in winter. We have already put in the basement, the heating plant electric fittings, cold and warm water, and sewer pipes.\n\nWe were thinking to have a plumber and a steamfitter, but as the expenses amount to a great deal already, we will do the work, and we are only glad because you have been so good to me. At the present time, we are making the concrete and cement flooring in the basement, and we expect to start plastering in a couple of weeks.\n\nAbout our Storage batteries, to keep it in a good condition, we would need to clean it, but before touching it, we would need repairs. Just now it is working not too bad. To clean it good, we have to charge all the wood insulators, and even a few plates which are worn out.\n\nWe will be very thankful if you will be good enough to send us the following order:\n\n1. No. 2 -- 17 Thyrax Exide Cells\n2. 3 doz bolts and nuts\n3. 1/2 doz Positive connecting Plates\n4. 1/2 \" Negative \"\n5. 9 \" Positive Plates\n6. 12 \" Negative \"\n7. 4 Jars No 13 for same\n8. 12 gallons of Electrolite\n\nN.B. -- We never heard about the Big Wheel of our New H.P. Engine that we asked you to send us; perhaps she was sent to Selkirk; but we would be very glad to have it by the Railway, at Mile 137, Setting Lake Man.\n\nYour very sincerely,\n\nAssistant Principal.\nOttawa, May 12, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that some materials are necessary in order to make replacements to the electric lighting plant at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 4)\nSir;\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith Voucher No. 594 in favor of the Principal, Cross Lake Boarding School for the lumber supplied to the new addition to the building.\n\nThis lumber was used for the last story, second floor, and double floor for garret, the roof, the joists, beams, rafters, posts, studding, window frames, all for this top story.\n\nThe prices on this material are much lower than the prices in Winnipeg, and there is no freight.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMemorandum:\n\nWhen the addition to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School was commenced, in 1923-24, $10,000 was available. During the year there was expended for materials and freight $1,821.64 and for labour $6,240.20 - a total of $8,061.84.\n\nIn 1924-25, $20,000 was voted to complete the addition. There was expended during the year for materials and freight $23,529.84 and for labour $8,116.40 - a total of $31,646.24.\n\nNothing has been voted for this addition this year, with the exception of the furnishings, which are not yet ordered. During the past two years, $30,000.00 has been voted and $29,708.08 expended. Hereunder are time sheets for labour, amounting to $2,666.00, and later, I understand, there will be an account for lumber amounting to over $900.\n\nThe expenditure has exceeded the amount provided and there was no provision this year for the last few accounts, as I understood that the building would be completed. However, the addition will have to be finished and furnished and I wish to recommend that the account for labour now on file and the one for lumber that will be presented in due course be paid.\n\nRussell J. Turner\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir;\u2014\n\nI have to report that I inspected Cross Lake Boarding School on the 26th and 27th of May.\n\nThe general health of the pupils appears to be good.\n\nIn the class rooms the work was excellent, as usual, and good progress is being made.\n\nThe grounds are kept tidy and in good condition. There are quite a number of trees on these grounds which were not cut out, and these make the surroundings much more pleasant than the bare open space often found. The outbuildings are also in good condition. There is an excellent garden here which provides sufficient potatoes and vegetables for the school. The unusually severe winter caused a loss by frost of some of the potatoes in the winter storage root house, so that while the school had enough for themselves, they had no surplus as expected. Hens and cows are doing well, and furnish their quota for table use.\n\nThe school building is in excellent condition and well kept. It is a good example of the permanency of the stone building, especially when placed on a solid rock foundation. Some of the rooms were not so spotless as usual, as openings have been made into the addition, where work is going on, and dust is continually passing in.\n\nWork on the new addition is making good progress, and the building should be ready for occupation in the fall.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst.

Whitla Co for prices, but they did not give quotations, they took exception to the fact that the descriptive or reference numbers were taken from an Eaton catalogue. I endeavored to explain this fact by saying that the preparation of the list was most likely by the Mother Superior who did not have any other means of giving an intelligent descriptive idea of the different articles that were treated in this manner.\n\nThe Ives Bedding Co are sending a list direct from the factory.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nNote. These goods should be away by the 15th to the 20th August at the latest.\nOttawa, August 7, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to furnishings for the Cross Lake Indian Residential School addition, enclosing competitive prices. The Department received direct from the Ives Bedding Co. their quotation on beds. As this firm did not quote on mattresses, springs and pillows, consideration is not being given.\n\nPlease place with the T. Eaton Co. the order for beds, mattresses, springs and pillows. Their price of $560.90 F.O.B. Selkirk is accepted. You may place with this same firm the order for window shades, curtains, etc. Their price of $132.60 is the lowest of those firms quoting on all the articles of this nature required. They should also be given the order for the 5 toilet sets, amounting to $21.20. Please also place with the T. Eaton Co. an order for 200 only rubber stair treads, 7\u00bd\" x 21\". You will note that they quote $50 in this connection.\n\nRobinson & Co.'s quotation of $314.40 for furniture is lowest, and you may place the order with them. Gault's Ltd., quotation of $427.75 for rugs, linoleum, etc., is considered the most satisfactory, and the lowest of those quoting on the articles required. This firm could not supply the 200 stair pads which is included in this list, and you will note that this item was added to the T. Eaton Co.'s order.\n\nIt is understood that all prices are F.O.B Selkirk, and I should be pleased if you would arrange for early shipment, so that they will be placed on a suitable boat for Cross Lake. You should see that all articles are securely packed. The quotations of the successful tenderers are returned herewith, and, when you are submitting accounts, in duplicate, in favour of the firms given the business, please return them to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

It states \"descriptive or reference numbers given are taken from T. Eaton Co.'s Catalogue, Fall 1924 & Winter 1925.\" I have a copy in my office for reference. Perusal of such Catalogue, of course, gives no idea of the quality or design of the goods called for. We certainly would not buy from the T. Eaton Co., one of each of the articles in order to submit quotations. We doubt whether the Eaton Co., could furnish us with all the articles, for the Catalogue is now a year old. We issue a catalogue ourselves and supply more goods to Western Trade than any two Wholesale Houses in Canada put together. Why not quote our Catalogue?\n\nWe think you will agree that no Catalogue should be quoted and that if you buy by sample these should be in your hands for inspection by prospective tenderers. That is the only way in which fair competition can be had. And an expert is necessary to see that the article supplied is up to the quality specified.\n\nYou will understand that we feel most strongly upon the impropriety of the course followed in the above instance.\n\nCheap tapestry rugs were called for. These we do not carry. They are not worth the price. Axminster rugs last little more and wear four times as long.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. J.

It states \"descriptive or reference numbers given are taken from T. Eaton Co's Catalogue, Fall 1924 and Winter 1925. I have a copy in my office for reference.\" Perusal of such Catalogue, of course, gives no idea of the quality or design of the goods called for. We certainly would not buy from the T. Eaton Company one of each of the articles on order to submit quotations. We doubt whether the Eaton Company could furnish us with all the articles, for the Catalogue is now a year old. We issue a Catalogue ourselves and supply more goods to Western Trade than any two Wholesale Houses in Canada put together. Why not quote our Catalogue?\n\nWe think you will agree that no Catalogue should be quoted and that if you buy by sample these should be in your hands for inspection by prospective tenderers. That is the only way in which fair competition can be had. And an expert is necessary to see that the article supplied is up to the quality specified.\n\nYou will understand that we feel most strongly upon the impropriety of the course followed in the above instance.\n\nCheap tapestry rugs were called for. These we do not carry. They are not worth the price. Axminster rugs cost little more and wear four times as long.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJBC/B.\nR. J. Whittle & Co. Limited\nWholesale Dry Goods\nWinnipeg, Canada\n\nSeptember 8th, 1925.\n\nHon. Chas. Stewart,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn the 10th of August I wrote a letter to the Department of Indian Affairs, a copy of which I enclose. The letter speaks for itself. I endeavored to see you in connection with this when you were in Winnipeg but your time was so fully occupied with the Pulp proposition that I did not care to force this on your attention and later wrote to the department instead. However, as we have had no reply from the Indian Department I would be glad if you would give it your consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJBC-B.\nEnc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 4)\nOttawa, Sept. 14, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAttention J. B. Coyne, Esq., K.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th ultimo and have been directed to reply also to yours of the 8th instant to the Honourable the Superintendent General. I regret that you did not quote on equipment required for the Cross Lake Indian Residential School because of the nature of the specifications that were offered to you by our Winnipeg office.\n\nYou will understand that some guide must be given to those who are quoting, and, in this particular instance, it is entirely probable that the school authorities had no reference other than the catalogue they used. References are used solely because of the necessity to guide those quoting and the goods supplied were to be similar or equal.\n\nThe Department, of course, is not interested in any company, and, if you will let me have your latest catalogue, which I know is well known in the West, I shall be glad to see that it is used as a reference from time to time as required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Following instructions to get fuller details by correspondence with the Principal, this had to be done and cause delay further delay arose through some changes in the management of the Exide Batteries in the local Winnipeg Office and it was not till the 13th August that I could get the order.

D. McLean,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere has been difficulties regarding the payment of a freight bill to the Northern Fish Company of Selkirk, Man., account of Cross Lake School. There has been noticed by the Department a difference between the accounts of the Northern Fish Company and that of the Principal of the School for the transportation of a boiler. This boiler weighed 27500 pounds, which, at the ordinary rate of freight, viz: 65\u00a2 per hundred would have amounted to $177.45 as the Principal had mentioned in this account, but the Northern Fish charged a special price of $250.00, making a difference of $72.55 which has been paid by the Principal, though only $177.45 have been reimbursed to him.\n\nWould you kindly loop up this matter and advise me in order that I may communicate with the Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 4)\nOttawa, Nov. 8, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the freight charges on boiler shipped to the Cross Lake School, I beg to say that on looking through the file, I find that on March 16th of this year there is a voucher for $72.55 in favour of the Reverend Principal, which covers the amount mentioned in your letter.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing herewith a copy of this voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

FERRIER\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Father H. Boissin O.M.I., Principal of Grass Lake Indian Residential School has referred to me a copy of your letter dated February 4th, re the refusal of a water tank for his institution.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has requested me to reopen that question on account of its importance and urgency of action and I take the liberty of submitting the following considerations to your judgment. On account of the enlargement of the school the water supply is altogether insufficient with the two water tanks already used. In spite of pumping 3 or 4 times each day the upper stories are deprived of water during the night. You readily perceive the inconvenience and danger resulting from such a situation. In view of those facts and other reasons set forth in Rev. Fr Boissin's previous correspondence I would ask you to reconsider the negative decision above referred to.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 4)\nMarch 25, 1926.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nA few weeks ago, the Rev. Principal of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School urged that an additional water storage tank be installed. The present tanks are inadequate, now that the building is enlarged, and there is insufficient water, particularly at night, for plumbing fixtures. The situation would be serious, of course, in the event of fire.\n\nMr. Orr estimates the cost at $700, and, as no funds are specifically provided, the request was refused. His Lordship Bishop Charlebois and Father Guy have left the letter hereunder and His Lordship informs me that there is really an urgent need and asked to have the matter re-opened.\n\nI wish to recommend that a pressure tank be supplied, as I am hopeful that funds can be found from the coming year's appropriation.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 25, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, urging the Department to re-open the question of supplying the Cross Lake Indian Residential School with an additional pressure tank. I am pleased to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has authorized this improvement and the Department is today writing Mr. Inspector Bunn, of Winnipeg, asking him to ascertain from the School Principal just what is required and to make purchase. Please inform the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has decided to supply an additional pressure tank for the water supply system at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. Please communicate with the Rev. Principal, with a view to determining what size tank and what fittings are required. When you have all the information necessary, make purchase, after securing competitive prices, and arrange for early shipment to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D.

Gasoline Engine, see voucher 2937 of Lake Winnipeg Inspectorate.\n\nThe following in explanation re this item. This fly-wheel was broken in transit across the Whiskey Jack Portage, in the latter part of the season of 1924, too late to replace same. The broken fly-wheel was patched up and the engine ran in a way, but not to capacity, and there was a great element of danger if the damaged wheel burst.\n\nIn the month of October, the Rev'd Brother Cordeau was in Winnipeg, there was only one more steamer going, and he asked me if the broken fly-wheel could be replaced, he intimated that the engine would be useless practically if this was not done, under the circumstances I complied with his request. I beg now to submit my action for approval. The time was so limited that I had catch the steamer which went out on the 13th Oct., 1925.\n\nI have been away so much in December, 1925 and January 1926, from my office attending to official duties at Fort Alexander, that this and other matters have been held up.\n\nThe New fly-wheel made the engine a complete new engine almost, and possible to run with safety.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nCross Lake July 31st\n\nIndian Dept Norway House\nNo. 20\n\nA.

The school handled the material here with its own outfit.\n\nIt will be noted that on page 1 of the Voucher there are two errors, amounting to $1.90. These are undercharges and underpayments.

I have a reply from the Rev'd Principal, and in addition I have been able to have a personal interview with Brother Cordeau, this is the man who actively supervised the work connected with the new additions and other activities incident to these operations.\n\nI am informed by Brother Cordeau that it would be best to get two tanks of the following dimensions:\n2 Pressure tanks 4' x 8', the capacity of these two tanks together would equal the capacity of a large one of 6' x 13', the two smaller tanks would not cost any more, would handle better in transport, and can be admitted to the building through the opening as it now is; if larger a special entrance would be required. Brother Cordeau says that two such tanks as indicated could placed upright.\n\nBrother Cordeau's judgement in this matter, in my opinion, should be accepted, he is familiar with the whole lay-out.

Mr. Inspector Bunn has received authority to make purchase and shipment of the desks required.\n\nI have also your 432-5A of the 6th instant, concerning flooring and hose connections. Mr. Inspector Bunn is purchasing the hose connections, which were omitted when the hose was supplied. I regret that there are no funds for the purpose of making replacements to the flooring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nWinnipeg, 14th April, 1926.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nWhen I was speaking to Brother Cordeau about the pressure tanks for Cross Lake Indian Residential School, he opened up the matter of replacing the pipe of the main sewer of this institution with a larger pipe, 8\" at least.\n\nThe old sewer pipe was 6\", this appears to be too small to properly carry away all the material for discharge through this source from the school building with the increased accommodation since the new addition was completed. This was the cause of overflow or backing up in the basement.\n\nThe Reverend Principal makes mention of this, in his letter of the 6th instant, and asks for attention.\n\nThe length of this main sewer is about 500 feet.\n\nBrother Cordeau is in the east at present, and he may be calling at the Department in Ottawa.\n\nThis is an important matter in providing for the disposal of the sewerage in a proper manner.\n\nI beg to submit this matter for consideration, which is what I told the Rev. Principal and Brother Cordeau I would do.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nBrother Cordeau who is in charge of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School recently visited this office and gave me a detailed description of the damaged condition of the concrete septic tank. After making an approximate estimate of the work required to put this tank in working condition, I would recommend that a new tank be built, similar to that provided for the new Guy Indian Residential School, with a few alterations to the drainage system. The cost will probably amount to $2,500.00 in this locality.\n\nIt was suggested by Brother Cordeau that the sewage could discharge direct into the lake without endangering in any way the water supply intake, which is about a mile above the proposed sewage outlet. I cannot recommend this change unless a very accurate inspection of the local conditions is made. As I understand Inspector Bunn is familiar with this Institution, I beg to request that he be asked to submit a report as to which arrangement should be decided upon.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOttawa, April 23, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, concerning the sewage disposal system at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would correspond with Mr. Indian Agent Gordon and make a joint recommendation concerning the necessity for a septic tank at all. It has been suggested that it might be possible to empty the raw sewage direct into the water, without danger to any inhabitants. Please let me have the findings of Mr. Gordon and yourself as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

Comme la navigation sera bient\u00f4t ferm\u00e9e, le Principal n'aimerait pas \u00e0 passer un autre hiver dans les conditions actuelles, alors il me prie de vous demander de faire envoyer au plus t\u00f4t possible, 225 pieds de tuyau de 8 pouces, en fonte, avec deux coudes.\n\nJe voulais discuter cette question avec vous, il y a quelque temps, mais vous \u00e9tiez absent du bureau par maladie et je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de me rendre au D\u00e9partement depuis.

Lindsay, O.M.I., Principal of the Cross Lake School, has written me about the sewer, stating that his predecessor wrote two years ago to have some pipe but nothing has been received yet.\n\nThe Agent said that it was ordered on the 25th August nothing had yet reached the school. As navigation is to close soon, the Principal would not like to spend another winter in the present condition, so he has requested me to ask that 225 ft. of 8 in cast iron pipe be sent with two elbows.\n\nI wanted to discuss this matter with you some time ago but you were sick at home and I had no chance to go to the Depot since.\n\nRev. Father Lindsay also mentions the water pump for which a new handle with accessories is needed, such as washer etc.\n\nYours etc,\n\n(Sgd) Joseph Grey, O.M.I.\nSept. 29, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am advised that 225 feet of 6\" (eight inch) cast iron pipe with two elbows is urgently required for the completion of the new sewage system lately installed at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School, Man. Although I understand that this material was ordered by you last August no delivery of it has yet been made, I would ask you, therefore, to attend to this matter with the least possible delay, in order that it may reach its destination before the closing of navigation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 4)\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 3772, amounting to $130.00 in favour of Crane Limited, for repairs to the Water Supply pump at Cross Lake Indian Residential School. These repairs were for a special make of pump supplied by Crane Co.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 550-5A dated July 12th, 1926, from Mr Agent Gordon of Norway House Agency. It was very difficult to locate where these repair parts could be obtained and after many inquiries I found out the contractor who put Your obedient servant, in the pump and in that way was able to secure them. I placed the order as it was doubtful if we could get the parts; delay was likely to prevent delivery at the school on account of the short shipping season. I offer this explanation for immediate action.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.123-1-5, dated Sept. 29th and just received, with reference to the purchase of some 225 ft. of 8\" cast iron pipe, and two elbows for the Cross Lake Indian School, for the sewer discharge line, I beg to say that there must be some misunderstanding in this matter. I have not received any authority from the Department re this pipe, nor have I ordered it.\n\nJune 8th last I wrote Mr. Inspector Bunn, of Winnipeg, recommending the purchase of 8\" glazed tile for this line. Mr. Bunn had already been in communication with the Department re the matter. Since that date I have had no information except that I found, on my visit to the said school July 28th last, that the material had not yet been delivered.\n\nIt may be that the letter has been wrongly addressed, since Inspector Bunn does practically all of the buying for this Agency, being in closer touch than I with the dealers. It may also well be that the goods are now at Whiskey Jack. If they are not, the last opportunity of forwarding the pipe by boat is past for this season.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 11, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of the 23rd of April, relating to the installation of a new sewage disposal system for the Gross Lake Indian Residential School, and to request whether the report asked for, on the advisability of proceeding with this work, can be expected at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. Nelson,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn-St. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with my recent inspection of the St. Joseph's Indian Residential school at Cross Lake I find the following require attention at as early a date as possible;\u2014\n\nReferences, J.H., are to J.H. Ashdown's Hardware catalogue for 1925.\n\nA new magneto is required for 6 H.P. International gasoline engine. Magneto type R.No.1566T.\n\nA new \"Swift Sight Feed\" 1 pint capacity, J.H.241.\n\nRound water gauges for pressure tanks supplied last summer, with complete fittings. Shank require, \u00bd inch. J.H.214.\n\nBath faucets, J.H.918A, half dozen.\n\nFor Gurney sectional furnace, centre bar to support grates. Furnace is 9 sections, outside measurement 81\" X 52\u00bd\", No.949.\n\nThe pipe for the sewer, which was asked for, and I understand some arrangements made for, last summer, should be forwarded at the first opportunity, on as early a boat as possible.\n\nI found also, that the steam boiler, which has been used for some years for compression for the small steam engine which has done much of the work, and which will now be used for running the laundry machinery, as well as furnishing steam for thawing pipes, providing hot water for laundry, or heat to make water hot, and used on some occasions as an auxiliary to the heating plant, especially so in mild weather, is getting badly rusted, and is likely to be condemned at any time, in fact, should not be used much longer, as it will not be safe. I would ask that this be replaced, as it is a very necessary part of the plant.\n\nThe type of boiler required is 15 H.P. Nagle, of the type \"Bug\", diameter, 36\", height, 7 ft. Upright submerged tubes. The minimum weight should be 15 H.P. and the maximum height, 7 ft., as this will leave only sufficient head space in the basement. Engine should be complete with injector and other necessary fittings.\n\nI would especially ask that the engine and sewer pipe receive early and favorable consideration, as both are very much needed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

In this connection I have to inform you that we are authorizing Mr. Inspector Bunn, of Winnipeg, to arrange for the purchase and forwarding to the school of the following:\n\n1 Magneto for 6 H. P. Gas Engine.\n1 Swift Sight Feed.\n6 Bath Faucets.\n1 Centre Bar for Gurney Sectional Furnace.\n2 Round Water Gauges for Pressure Tanks.\n\nRelative to the iron pipe for the sewer, I beg to refer to your letter of October 15th, last, in which you stated you had received the Department's letter of September 29th authorizing you to purchase some 225 ft. of 8\" cast iron pipe and two elbows. If you have not yet made the purchase of this pipe, you should arrange to do so and have it forwarded to the school at the first opportunity, or you may communicate with Mr. Inspector Bunn, who could, no doubt, procure it advantageously in Winnipeg. Please give him full particulars as to the quantity and size of the cast iron pipe required, also of the two elbows.\n\nWe would have requested Mr. Bunn to make the purchase direct; but, in view of the instructions which were given you in the letter above referred to, it may be that you are arranging for the purchase.\n\nYou will be communicated with further regarding the request for a new high pressure steam boiler for running the laundry machinery, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa, March 11, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Agent Gordon, of Norway House, in which he states that, upon a recent inspection of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School, he found that the following repairs were required:\n\n(References \"J.

Furnace is 9 sections - outside measurement 61\" x 52\u00bd\", No. 949.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange for the purchase and forwarding of these supplies. You should obtain them at the lowest possible cost and have them shipped to the school at the first opportunity. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIn September, last, Mr. Gordon was authorized to purchase a quantity of cast iron pipe for the completion of the new sewage system. We have again requested him to arrange for the purchase and instructed him, if he is unable to obtain this material, to communicate with you, giving full particulars, when I shall be pleased if you will arrange, after obtaining competitive prices if possible, for the purchase and delivery of the quantity required. Mr. Gordon will, no doubt, correspond with you regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R.

last especially to my recommendation that a new high pressure steam boiler be supplied for St. Joseph's Indian School, Croas Lake, I enclose herewith the circular and letter forwarded to me by the Principal, in which the kind of boiler is particularly specified as their choice.\n\nThe type, Geneva, has the advantage of being only 6 ft. in height which will leave more headroom.\n\nTen feet of smoke stack will be required. As the pipe must run horizontally, an elbow is required, as short an elbow as possible. It may be that a collar could be made that would fit on the hood of the boiler.\n\nI trust the Department will furnish this boiler, as it is urgently needed, the old one being unsafe, or will be unsafe very soon. It is being carefully watched, and not too much pressure being allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nYour letter number and date as marginally noted above, is hereby acknowledged. This reply is belated, but the letter came between seasons and I expected to have an interview with someone from the Cross Lake School, so that I could get at the facts and write intelligently. I am now pleased to say that I had a visit from the Rev'd Brother Menard who is the man who looks after this side of the work for the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. He called on me on the 4th instant and we had a long talk that day and continued this on the 7th and 8th, these adjournments were necessary as he had to bring in certain information that became necessary as our talk progressed.\n\nThis was the first matter that we talked over. I find that the system is practically out of business. The Septic Tank will have to be rebuilt, the old construction was too light. Brother Menard will send correct dimensions so that the quantity of Cement required can be worked out.\n\nThe piping, cast iron, should be 8\", and the quantity named by Brother Menard is 235 lineal feet, from building to mouth of discharge in running water. The old pipe was 6\" and was too small.\n\nA \"Y\" reducer is required, cast iron, the branches to 4\" each and the stem of the \"Y\" 8\" this connects the two feeders from various parts of the building with main sewer pipe, the 2 feeders are sewage conveyors, the main goes to the Septic Tank after receiving the discharges from the conveyors, the junction is in the building I understand. The enlargement of the main pipe is necessary to take proper care of the sewage, there are about 110 people, pupils and staff, all told. The new Laundry also adds to the quantity of discharge.\n\nSummary:\nA- Cement for new Septic Tank,\nB- 225 ft. Sewer pipe, Cast iron, 8\"\nC- 1 only Reducer, \"Y\" arms 4\", Stem 8\",\nD- Lead &c for making Joints.\nSummary continued.\n\nBrother Menard is to send correct dimensions of the new Septic Tank, see item \"A\".\n\nI might now add that the purchase of the sewer pipe last fall would not have expedited matters as it would have remained at Warren's Landing for the winter I fear, so that the purchase now will be at Warren's Landing for the first boat of 1927.\n\nAll the piping handling sewage inside the building is in good condition, it is the main that wants attention.\n\nThese remarks cover the result of our long talk over the whole sewage system.\n\nRev'd Brother Menard, me the enclosed cut marked \"A\", on which I have circled \"15\", this is the boiler that he mentions as being required in the Laundry, the description is given on the folder. Brother Menard says that the condition of the boiler that is now being used is not in good condition. I told him that I would submit his statement for consideration.\n\nThe Rev'd Brother also asked for \"steam Rubber Hose\" 5 ply, 14\" or 12\" inside diameter. This is required in case that the water main intake freezes. He says that this has happened on account of low water. He would want 200 feet.\n\nThe following Implements were listed as required:\n\n- 1 Plow, Breaker with Gouler, 14'\n- 1 Stump Puller, and a wire cable for same.\n\nI am enclosing a list of sundry school requirements, this is the original, I have made a copy of same, the list also mentions Bed Carriers, Clocks for Class rooms. A copy of the Blue Book the last issued is also asked for by the Rev'd Principal.\n\nThe Rev'd Brother mentioned a new stable with a good Hay loft, dimension 34' x 50', to accommodate 5 horses and 12 head cattle. He says that they can furnish certain lumber and that he will send in a list of the materials he would want furnished. I told him that I would submit this item for consideration.\n\nHe stated that he wanted a Magneto for a 6 h.p. International Gas Engine, furnished the School in May 1924. I went with these people and secured this Magneto for him, he took it back with him. Later I received your letter authorising me to procure this, by a personal selection as explained, this want has been well attended to. He also wanted a switch for his panel of the lighting plant, I found out that this was important, after a long search I located what was wanted with the R.A. Lister Co. I secured same for him and he took it back with him, this switch protected his battery. I will submit vouchers for these items.\nand I will attach explanations thereto.\n\nI asked the Reverend Brother about the possibility of discharging the raw sewage direct into the water but he says that this is not a workable plan and that it entails a lot of labor, and he also suggested that there might be some complaint about doing this. It is my opinion that Provincial regulations would soon step in, and that some severe criticism might be the outcome. I was getting a line on this matter as it was intimated in your letter 285-1-5 dated the 23rd April, 1926. I wrote about this but did not get satisfaction and a definite conclusion, so I preferred to hold it over and during the past season of 1926 I did not meet any one from Cross Lake, so that I was not clear about the details as I have able to place them with you now, after a talk with Brother Monard.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may also supply a \"Y\" reducer of the dimensions mentioned in your letter, and a sufficient quantity of lead, etc., for making joints. As soon as you have received the correct dimensions of the new septic tank, you should forward same for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRelative to the new steam boiler required, we would refer you to official letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you were requested to arrange for the purchase of same.\n\nYou may purchase and have forwarded 200' steam rubber hose, 5 ply, of the dimensions required.\n\nWe have no funds available at the present time to supply the plow, breaker with coulter and stump puller and wire cable.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of castors for 100 beds. I may say that the beds supplied this school were purchased from the T. Eaton Co., Winnipeg, and you may obtain the castors from this firm at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYou may also purchase and forward 3 inexpensive wall clocks.\n\nRelative to the building of a new stable to accommodate the\n\nJ.

We have no funds available in our appropriation for the present fiscal year for this purpose. In the meantime, however, full particulars should be forwarded as to the lumber and materials that would be required, the approximate cost of same and for any labour required.\n\nRelative to the extra desks required, I would refer you to official letter of April 21st, 1926. It is presumed that you have arranged for the purchase of the number of extra desks mentioned in said letter. If not, you should make the purchase after obtaining competitive prices from the firms mentioned, and have these desks forwarded. You should also purchase 2 teachers' desks of the type described as No. 25 in the catalogue of the Christie School Supply Co., Brandon, also 2 teachers' chairs, No. 10, and 4 visitors' chairs, No. 14, in said catalogue.\n\nCompetitive prices should, as far as possible, be obtained in all the above authorized purchases, and certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.

In providing Cement for the construction of this tank, the Reverend Brother asks that a few extra sacks be sent, as in transit there is some Cement spoiled, even with the greatest care in handling. The end and side walls will be 8\" thick and the bottom and top 6\". These figures are exactly as given by Brother Menard.\n\nThis information is submitted in response to Departmental Letter #123-1-5 of the 6th April, 1927.\n\nI have the hope to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 18th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th instant regarding the quantity of cement required for the building of a septic tank of the dimensions as mentioned in your letter, I beg to inform you that it will take approximately 200 bags of cement, and, as there will be some cement spoiled in transit, it is thought that 225 bags would be ample. I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase, after obtaining competitive prices, of 225 bags of cement, and have same forwarded to the school at as early a date as possible.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the cement, together with a memo, attached showing the names of the firms asked by you to quote and the prices quoted, also accounts, properly certified, covering the cost of the freight charges on the cement to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ltd.,\nBlackwood Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe have your favor of the 10th in reply to which would say that our quotation covers exactly what is specified in your Order #399 were it not for the fact that the boiler is to be installed in the Province of Manitoba, and presumably comes under the Manitoba Boiler Inspection Law.\n\nIt is not a question of safety; the boiler we have quoted is a good boiler and perfectly safe if properly operated; but as we understand it the Province of Manitoba requires that all boilers except those used on railway locomotives and in steamship service, or boilers used in private residences smaller than 30 square feet of heating surface, must be built in accordance with the Canadian Interprovincial Regulations, and the boiler we have offered you would not comply with those regulations; but is our regular catalog construction boiler. It may be possible that boilers used in an Indian school are not subject to this inspection, but that is a point on which we have no information, and we would not ship this boiler for installation in Manitoba unless you relieve us of all responsibility of its passing inspection, and agree to pay for it whether or no.\n\nWe would like very much to sell you the boiler, but we cannot take any chances of shipping the boiler to this distant point and then have it rejected, as we believe the inspector would have a perfect right to do if it is subject to the regular inspection; nor would we care to furnish a boiler built to comply with the Canadian Interprovincial Regulations. Our reason for this is that the Canadian Provinces have adopted a special boiler inspection law which is different from anything else in existence and which operates very much to the disfavor of manufacturers outside of Canada. It entails a large amount of expense to get the specifications approved, and on account of not having a Canadian inspector in the shop there is a severe penalty in the shape of a higher factor of safety; and when the Canadian inspectors do come here to inspect throughout construction they make it just as hard as possible for the American manufacturers. We know of a case where an inspector was brought here to inspect boilers being built throughout construction, and in explanation of the amount of unnecessary work and changes that he insisted on he told the manufacturer outright that the Canadian...\nGurney North West Foundry Co., Ltd., June 14, 1927.\n\nManufacturers of boilers wanted to furnish as many of the boilers used in Canada as possible, and for that reason have made it hard for outsiders to compete. We are only giving you this information to show you how the matter stands.\n\nIf the boiler you have ordered is acceptable we will be very glad indeed to fill your order; but it must be with the understanding that we take absolutely no responsibility in regard to it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nNAGLE ENGINE & BOILER WORKS,\nE. C. Robinson\nTreasurer.\n\nP.S. Mr. R. A. Stewart is Chief Inspector of Steam Boilers for the Province of Manitoba, and as we understand it is located at Winnipeg.\nORDER\n\nWinnipeg, 1st June, 1926.\n\nThe Gurney North-west Foundry Co., Ltd.,\nHeating & Cooking Appliances Co.,\nWinnipeg, Man.-\n\nGentlemen:-\nPlease supply and ship the following goods for and on account of\n\"The Dept. of Indian Affairs for Canada, Ottawa, Ont.\"\n\nAddress.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 4)\nMr. Geo. R. Bunn,\nInspector,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nCommercial Bldg.,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have very much pleasure in quoting you on one 15 Horse Power Eagle Steam Boiler, f.o.b. Selkirk, care of the Northern Fish Company, at $485.00.\n\nWe are advised that the makers of this Boiler can make immediate shipment.\n\nTrusting to be favored with your order, which will receive our careful and prompt attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGURNEY NORTH WEST FOUNDRY CO. LTD.\n\nE. Antill\nManager.\nWith reference to this High Pressure Boiler, I received your letter, number and date as marginally noted above. On the 15th Mar. 1927, I addressed you with reference to this boiler, and I enclosed a cut showing the style of same, this I had received from the Rev.-Bro Menard of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School staff, this cut is an exact duplicate of the high pressure boiler that is in service now at this school. It has given good service and for that reason the Rev.-Bro desired to have a new one of the same design in every detail.\n\nIn your letter, number and date as marginally given, I am instructed to purchase this H.P. Boiler, and before doing so I wrote on the 6th May 1927 asking for the cut of the boiler that I had enclosed with my letter of the 15th March, 1927, I received the cut on the 14th May, and I then asked for competitive prices, on the 17th May, due at noon on the 20th, I received three tenders as listed as follows:\n\n- Vulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg, $620.00 f.o.b at Selkirk, Man.\n- Crane Limited, London, Ont., $495.00 \" \" \" Selkirk, Man.\n- Gurney Foundry Limited, $485.00 \" \" \" Selkirk, Man.\n\nThe tender of the Gurney Foundry tender was for a high pressure boiler exact in all detail as described in the cut, I received the price above listed and on the 1st June I placed an order with the Gurney Foundry Limited covering this h.p. boiler, and I telephoned them to that effect. I made a note on the order as follows: \"Ship this to above address with quick despatch.\"\n\nThere seems to be something in connection with this boiler as to official inspection and certification of this boiler, this is detailed in the enclosed letter, the letter is from the makers of boiler in question. As I have stated above the Rev.-Bro. Menard informed me that this boiler was satisfactory in every way for their service, and for that reason they wanted a new one exactly the same as the old one.\n\nI might say that I was asked at what point they desired the safety valve.\nsafety valve to be locked and I replied at 75-lb pressure, I felt this would be an absolutely safe point, in fact I know that it is sufficient for the service it is used for, that is in the laundry.\n\nThe Gurney Foundry Limited wanted me to give them a letter, accepting responsibility, but I declined to do this without submitting all these facts and this letter for consideration. I have marked a certain portion of the second paragraph of the letter in pencil.\n\nI am enclosing the copy letter of acceptance by the Gurney Foundry Limited of the order for this boiler, and this amply justifies the placing of the order in the way I have done.\n\nI have spoken with Mr. R. A. Stewart the Chief Inspector for the Province of Manitoba, and he informs me to the effect that what is required is that the Nagle Engine and Boiler Works people will have to submit blue prints and full specifications covering the boiler in question, these documents are for registration, and the working pressure would be fixed by Mr. Stewart; it is this point about registration that is the sticker as far as I can make out.\n\nPlease return the two letters enclosed.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnclosures.\nSir,\n\nIn regard to the new sewer line and septic tank at St. Joseph's Residential School for which material has been forwarded, I beg to say that there will be considerable work in connection with this installation, chiefly cleaning out and straightening the old line, laying pipe and covering same, excavating for septic tank, hauling by boat and barge of gravel and sand, building of cement tank, etc.\n\nMay I ask if the school authorities are expected to do this work gratis or is there an allowance to cover this labor. Considerable labor will have to be hired. It would cost approximately $300 and if any allowance has not already been set aside I would recommend that the above amount be allowed for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

We are enclosing herewith a circular describing this boiler, under cipher \"GENEVA\", together with blue print giving details of construction. At the same time, we quoted the Gurney North West Foundry Company on the same size of boiler, except built in accordance with the A.S.M.E.

We are therefore enclosing circular describing this boiler, under the cipher \"GENEVA ASME\", together with a blue print, giving details of construction.\n\nIf there are any slight changes which would make these boilers conform to your requirements, they could probably be made without any great expense, if we are informed what they are.\n\nWe await your further advice, and remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nNAGLE ENGINE & BOILER WORKS,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTreasurer.\n\nECR:LS.\nOttawa, 17th August 1927\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested I am sending you herewith blueprint copies of the plan and specifications of the pressure boiler manufactured by the Maple Engine and Boiler Works and supplied through the Gross Lake Residential School, together with a copy of a communication sent in by this company, all of which I would ask you to forward to the Chief Inspector of Boilers of the Province of Manitoba, in order that the question of the adjustment of the safety valve of the above mentioned boiler might be satisfactorily settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(A.

When we have this information, consideration will then be given to placing the order for the equipment mentioned.\n\nIt is noted that there are adequate fire escapes, with easy access, and that instructions have been given the children so that they would know what to do in case of fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Res. School,\nCross Lake, Via The Pas, Man.\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 123-1-5 of Dec. the 21st arrived here last week. I am pleased to let you know the supplies for fire protection could be forwarded in the winter time via H.B.R. Mile 137. However, setting lake at mile 137 H.B.R. is the nearest place from Cross Lake. From mile 137 to Cross Lake the cost of transportation is $2.50 per hundred pounds. But as there is no agent at that station there might be danger of loss some pieces as it happens sometime.\n\nMore information will be supplied to you by my representative Bro. Minard that left for Ottawa to arrange the things about the construction of our new stable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.E. Sundeen\nPrincipal\nCross Lake\nMan\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie\nActing Deputy\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nFor some time, representations have been made that a proper barn should be erected at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. The item was omitted out of the Estimates for the coming fiscal year; but, following the last interview with Father Guy, I marked the request as fairly urgent.\n\nBrother Menard, of the staff, has been sent out by the Rev. Principal and he is now in Ottawa in connection with the improvements that are necessary at the school. He proposes to get out the lumber and put up at least the frame of the barn this coming summer. The building could be finished in 1930, and, if you approve of the scheme, an item will have to be placed in our Estimates of a year from now.\n\nA plan and a bill of material have been prepared by Beatty Brothers, of Winnipeg. It has been estimated that the barn, without sill (which is unnecessary at Cross Lake) would cost approximately $7,000. Mr. Durand sees that $5,000 is all the Department should be asked to put into a barn at any northern school, and I wish to recommend that an item for this amount be placed in the 1929-30 Estimates. The school management has a small lumber mill at Cross Lake and can erect the barn at a cost of very little more than $5,000, if they provide some labour by members of the staff and the older boys.\n\nI believe the Department should let them proceed with the work and undertake to reimburse them to the extent of the Vote in 1930.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 22, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nPursuant to conversation with Rev. Brother Menard, I wish to suggest that you indicate what type of binder, farming mill and small thresher would be most suitable for the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. You should state the Winnipeg representatives of the manufacturers and let me know something of the cost, f. o. b. Winnipeg. If the Department decides to allow the expenditure, instructions could be given to Mr. Inspector Bunn to purchase and ship to Cross Lake as soon as navigation opens. You may also let me have the receipt, in duplicate if possible, which shows your expenditure for a seed drill, which, I understand, you have purchased so as to be ready for the spring sowing. Favorable consideration will be given to reimbursing you in this connection.\n\nI am today authorizing Brother Menard to purchase 300 ft. of fire hose, one-half dozen couplings, one-half dozen valves, one case of Pyrene refills and one case of Guardene refills. It is understood that the Brother will purchase these in Winnipeg, to the best advantage. After consultation with Inspector Bunn, Brother Menard should certify to the accounts, in duplicate, and present them to Mr. Bunn, who will forward them to the Department for payment. The company that supplies these goods should prepay the express to Mile 137, R. R. Railway, and should attach the express receipt to the account.\n\nI am also authorizing Brother Menard to purchase one 80 gallon jacket heater, to be attached to the kitchen range. It is understood that this will be shipped to Mile 137 by freight. The company from which he purchases this, also, should attach freight receipt and submit their account, in duplicate, to Mr. Inspector Bunn. Brother Menard should certify to this, also. He is also being authorized to select a few dollars' worth of heavy wire screen for approximately a dozen windows which are next the playgrounds. When navigation opens, the company should ship this to Cross Lake and present their account, in duplicate, to Mr. Inspector Bunn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Please see that he goes to the proper sources of supply and certify to the account, in duplicate, when forwarding to the Department for payment. These should be shipped by express, to Mile 137, H. B. Railway, and the express receipt should be attached to the account.\n\nBrother Menard is authorized to purchase, also, one 60 gallon jacket heater. This should be shipped by freight and you should certify to the account in duplicate, to which the freight receipt should be attached. The Brother has been requested to select a few dollars' worth of heavy wire screening to cover approximately a dozen windows next to the playgrounds. You may have this screening shipped to Cross Lake when navigation opens and you should forward the account to Ottawa for payment at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCommercial Building,\nSt. Boniface St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, February 22, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nRev. Brother Menard has explained that you are desirous of proceeding, this year, with the erection of the proposed new barn at the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. Funds for this purpose will not be available until 1929, but the Deputy Superintendent General has approved of certain activity this year. I have to advise you to proceed with the preparation of the lumber and with some of the building operations this year. If you erect a barn as shown on the plan which Beatty Brothers of Winnipeg have prepared and which has been approved by our Architect, the Department will allow a grant of $5,000 in 1929, if you will forward receipts in duplicate showing expenditures of at least this amount. If the cost does not come to this amount, the Department will be glad to learn that a saving has been effected. It is understood that the lumber will be supplied at cost and that the members of the staff and the older boys of the school will provide labour without special payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This informs me with reference to Brother Menard of the Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, Man., and to certain authorization given to him to make certain purchases, assisted by me, as follows: Brother Menard arrived here on the 5th March, to be shipped by Express, 300 feet fire hose plus fittings, and refills for Byrne and Garden extinguishers. I accompanied the Rev'd Brother and made the purchase of these supplies, placed orders for the immediate shipment of same and the shipment will go forward to Mile 137 Hudson's Bay Railway on Friday the 9th instant. All to the entire satisfaction of Brother Menard.\n\nTo be shipped by freight, 1-82 gallon range tank was what Brother Menard wanted. I went with him and together we secured exactly what he wanted; there were certain connections required, all these were obtained, and I placed an order for shipment, also to go forward to Mile 137 Hudson's Bay Railway on the 10th instant. I can also intimate, in this reference, that Brother Menard was well satisfied.\n\nOrders placed this morning to be shipped after opening of navigation. The window screen will be shipped according to directions. In this regard Brother has agreed to send correct measurements of the windows, so that the correct quantity of wire can be exactly calculated.\n\nInvoices in accordance with instructions will be sent to the Department later.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDominion Government,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n- Attention Mr. Bunn -\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have the honour to quote you as follows:\n\n1 - Type LB Switchboard for a four kilowatt compound wound generator suitable for storage battery charging.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Lighting Plant of Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the early part of January, 1928, I received a letter from Mr Agent Gordon of Norway House Agency, with reference to the Lighting Plant above mentioned.\n\nIn his letter Mr Agent Gordon made a recommendation that a New Switch-board should be installed, and he gave the firm name as placed on the generator of the above named plant. When I got this letter, I consulted with a form of Electricians, the Schumacher-Mackenzie-Kurmen Co., as I could not intelligently make out the facts that I got in this connection from Mr Agent Gordon's letter.\n\nThis Electrical firm asked a number of questions and these I submitted to Mr Agent Gordon for fuller detailed information, at the same time I wrote to Brother Menard who has charge of the lighting plant in question. Unfortunately Brother Menard had left Cross Lake by the time my letter reached there and it was sent to him in the east; he received it, he told me this when he called at my office on the 5th instant. I asked him if he had spoken of this matter when he was in the Department at Ottawa on or about the 22nd February, he answered in the negative, as the Brother is fully acquainted with all the facts, it was most unlucky that he omitted to speak about this important matter at the time he was there, he had my letter and knew what I required.\n\nWhen Brother Menard was here we went to the Canadian-Fairbanks Morse, and I showed them the correspondence, and this firm told us that a New Switch-board was the safest solution of this problem, as this will insure safety.\n\nBrother Menard told me that in the present condition of the Old Switch-board that there was danger of fire, and that they have been very careful about using the plant. This feature of danger of fire is a serious one and I fear that the safest and best cure is a New Switch-board that will safe-guard the situation in an absolute manner.\nI think I have taken every care to determine what is the best steps to take, and I have come to the conclusion that the Old Switch-board should be removed and replaced with a New one and this should be done without any delay.\n\nIf a New Switchboard is decided upon, then this could be shipped to Cross Lake via the C.N.R'y and H.B.R'y via The Pas to Mile 137. I told Brother Menard that I thought this was the safest and best procedure and he agreed with me. It would have simplified matters very much if he had introduced the matter to you when he was in Ottawa on the 22nd Feb'y, the whole matter would have been closed by this time.\n\nI enclose a memo of the cost of a New Switchboard which has been figured out by The Canadian Fair-banks Morse Co for your information.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJno R.

(RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 5)\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie\nActing and Deputy Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear sir,\n\nIn reply to yours (No. 123-1-5) of February the 24th let me first offer you our most sincere thanks for your kindness and for the favourable consideration you gave and that have always given to our school.\n\nRe: Binder and farming mill information will be forwarded to the department by Rev. Father Lajeunesse.\n\nAs to the fire implements which you authorized Bro. Menard to buy, this was done through Mr. Inspector Burley, and I am glad to let you know that they are all arrived already. And so for the Jacked Theater, once more we thank you heartily.\n\nWe have been asking for almost two years for a new floor in the recreation hall of the girls and there was no...\nThe floor has not been renewed since the opening of the school and is in a very bad shape. Mr. Gordon our agent said at his last visit that we should have a new one. It is very bad for the girls feet especially when they are wearing their mocassins. So I am letting you know that it urgent and will be very pleased to hear that lumber (maple) will be sent by first of next week via telegraph, so it would give us the time to have it renew during the children holidays.\n\nThe dimension of the hall including the corridor is 54 ft x 21 which makes 1,134 sq feet. At $5 for the box 206 sq ft which will make altogether 1,240 ft maple flooring.\n\nWe would also need about 10 bags of King cement for a new coating for the tables of the children refectory which are much damaged and would have needed to be repaired long ago.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nCROSS-LAKE MANITOBA\nOttawa, April 21, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to authorize you to purchase and ship as soon as navigation opens 1240 ft. of maple flooring for the use of the Gross Lake Indian Residential School. You should secure competitive prices and attach to properly certified accounts in duplicate a memo showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. You should also ascertain the number and dimensions of the dining room tables at the Gross Lake School, and when you have the necessary information, you should purchase sufficient Battleship linoleum to cover these and the required number of brass angles to bind the corners.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. Macdonald,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCommercial Bldg.,\nSt. Boniface St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, April 21, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant and am pleased to inform you that a binder and a fanning mill are being purchased from the John Deere Plow Company, of Winnipeg, for the use of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School. I am authorizing Mr. Bunn to purchase and ship as soon as navigation opens 1240 ft. of maple flooring.\n\nI regret that I cannot authorize a Keen's cement covering for the dining room tables; but I am instructing Mr. Bunn to find out the dimensions and the number of your tables and to purchase Battleship linoleum with the necessary brass angles for the corners. These will be shipped to you in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake,\nvia Norway House,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 5)\nI have to report that on March 16th last I made a formal inspection of the Cross Lake Residential school. This school is managed by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI found the whole building, dormitories, kitchen, dining room, corridors, etc., spotlessly clean and carefully kept.\n\nI visited the stables and found them very well looked after. Because of the scarcity of hay, the number of cattle was reduced last fall. About four cows are now in milk. All are in good condition.\n\nA good supply of vegetable for food for the balance of the season was on hand.\n\nAn additional area of about 15 acres, not on school or reserve property, has been cleared and broken, and is this spring ready for cropping.\n\nThe work in each of the three class rooms is good, and good progress is observable at each visit I make.\n\nThe children have an appearance which speaks of good health, good food, clean habits and clothing, and wholesome living.\n\nAn outdoor skating rink has been kept open all winter, a toboggan slide has been erected and is in use, and a hand ball court was just opening for the season at the time of my visit.\n\nThe septic tank and sewer have been completed, and this should solve the drainage question for many years.\n\nThe steam boiler and steam engine are now in the new position, and operate the laundry machinery satisfactorily.\n\nNew floors are much needed in the girls' recreation room and the corridors of the old basement. These are asked for in this year's Estimates. Also considerable painting should be done in the interior of the new wing.\n\nThere has been some trouble with the electric lighting plant. When the new switch board is installed, it will or should help materially. In listening to the operation of the plant, I am of the opinion that the 6 H.P. International gasoline engine used for this plant has not sufficient power, as it labors very hard, and cannot get up sufficient speed. I would recommend that a new engine, 8 H.P. gasoline or oil, of good rating, be supplied, to ensure proper service, and as a protection to the batteries.\n\nThis Institution is well cared for in every way.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS | LIST PRICE | GROSS EXTENDED | DISCOUNT | NET |\n|----------|----------------------|------------|----------------|----------|-----|\n| 1        | only type LS switchboard for 4 KW 60V comp.wound gen. suitable for batt. charging instruments on board 1 volt meter-1 ammeter-1DP DT Switch 2 DP DPM unfused batt.switches 1 SP circuit breaker 2 sets batt.charging resistance 1 set volt meter & ammeter switch rheostat | 60.00 C | 900 | | |\n| 10       | only 100 amp 250 volt etge.fuses | 60.00 C | 900 | | |\n\n**DS**\n\nExp.to mile 337 E.Rly.to Principal Indian Resid.School Mail to Jno.R.Burns, 4th Fl.Commercial Bldg., City.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I examined the oven, and find it beyond repair, as all partitions are gone. It has been used for some twelve or thirteen years.\n\nI would recommend that it be replaced at once. The old one is an \"Oxford Portable oven, Gurney Foundry Co., Toronto, No.1382.\" A new one should be of equal capacity to this.\n\nIf shipped direct to the school, via Hudson's Bay Railway, to Wabowden, the school could take delivery at that point.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary & Asst.

Sir:\n\nMr. Agent Gordon states that on his recent inspection of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School he found the present bake oven badly burned out and beyond repair and recommends that a new oven be supplied.\n\nThe type of oven we supply to residential schools is that manufactured by Jean J. Daoust Limited, St. Boniface, Man., and is a wood burning oven. I enclose herewith a catalogue showing the various sizes of ovens manufactured by this firm. The Department is of the opinion that the Size No. 3 would be suitable for the requirements at this school. You will note that it has a baking space of 42 square feet, is 36\" in width and 65\" in height. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as soon as possible whether this oven would be satisfactory for your school, also if you have accommodation for same and whether its size would permit it to easily pass through the door into the room where it would be installed. When we have this information, consideration will then be given to placing an order for supplying same. You might furnish full shipping directions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

Ray, and from there on account of the mining operations at Cross-Lake, we have a very good team road this winter otherwise it as to be shipped by June C/O Northen Pisk Co., Lake Winnipeg Via Selkirk.

Menard O.M.I.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department that a new engine for power for the lighting plant is required at Cross Lake Indian Residential school.\n\nIn April last I drew the attention of the Department to the fact that the engine used for this purpose was unsatisfactory, being under power. However it ran along until last fall, when the crank shaft broke, ripping the bearings out of the body, breaking out large pieces of the solid body. Fortunately, a good supply of wood had already been cut, and other outside power work done, so that it was possible to move the engine which had been used outside in for the winter. The old engine is beyond repair, and would not serve satisfactorily if it could be repaired.\n\nThe school authorities express a preference for the Fairbanks Morse gasoline engine, and state that one of this make, of eight horsepower would be satisfactory. I would recommend that a new engine of the type asked for be supplied, purchased in Winnipeg, and shipped north on the first boat to Norway House, or rather addressed to The Principal, Cross Lake Indian School, Cross Lake, where it will go direct to Whiskey Jack where it will be received by the School.\n\nThe engine now in use will be required for cutting wood and other outside work even before the new one can be received.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This adds 4 ft. to the Bill, or 8 cents.\n\nIn the case of girders, ridge ties and saffits, the first figure is? I think, used to show how these were constructed the girders being made up of 4 pcs. of 2\" X 10\", each 12 ft. long, and 44 pcs. of 2\" X 10\" were used. The same would be true of the Ridge ties and Saffits. It is impossible to get in touch with the Principal of the Cross Lake School for probably six weeks, and I would suggest that the account be paid as it stands, and I will draw his attention to these points on my first visit to Cross Lake, and if I am in error an additional voucher for the balance can be issued.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nF.G.H.

I am much pleased with this building, as it is a good plan, of good material, and well built.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nOn my recent inspection of St. Joseph's Residential School at Cross Lake I found that the water intake had been frozen and that considerable work had already been done in efforts to get water, but with only partial success. A new pipe line had been laid over the ground, but the lift was too great and the water came very slowly, and finally froze in the pipes as the weather was very cold.\n\nThe very low water caused the freeze-up. I suggested taking up the old line to the foot of the hill, from which point it should be safe from frost, thawing the pipes, and replacing them above the ice and covering them with hay and sawdust. I agreed to allow them to get a number of men for a couple of days to get this work done without delay, which they did. I feel satisfied that they will now be able to get water, but they will have to drain the pipes during cold weather, and may find it necessary to use steam to keep the pipes open.\n\nMisfortunes appeared to come together, as the water intake froze, the steam boiler developed a leaky flue, which had to be repaired, and the insulation winding came off the armature of their generator.\n\nBesides the inconvenience of being without sufficient water during the time when the pump would not work, the building was without water pressure, and this would have been disastrous had a fire occurred. The line had been protected as well as possible early in the season, but the water level had continued to fall, and the line had been frozen several times, but had always opened for steam pressure before.\n\nIn this connection the following will be required by an early boat for replacing the water line for the future:\n- 4 lengths, each 20 ft., galvanized water pipe, 3 inch.\n- 3-45 degree elbows.\n- 3-90 \" \"\n- 6 assorted nipples.\n\nI would also recommend that the floors be resurfaced and that the Department supply for this work:\n- 1 barrel boiled linseed oil,\n- 10 gallons floor varnish.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Commissioner,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 5)\nSir:-\n\nI enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. Wm. Gordon, Indian Agent at Norway House, with reference to some trouble they have had at the St. Joseph's Residential School at Cross Lake with the water intake. It will be noted that he asks that certain material for replacements be purchased and forwarded by an early boat, and I shall be glad if the Department will advise me whether they wish me to take any action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 15, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 207-11A R.C. of the 11th instant, enclosing copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Gordon, with reference to water intake difficulties at the Grass Lake Indian Residential School. You may purchase the following equipment some time in April and arrange for its shipment to the school by the first boat:\n\n4 lengths, each 20 ft., galvanized water pipe, 3 inch.\n3-45 degree elbows,\n3-90 \" \"\n6 assorted nipples,\n\nI regret that there are no funds for the purpose of supplying linseed oil and floor varnish for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nThis afternoon at about 2.45 p.m., the Rev'd Brother T. R. Menard of Cross Lake Indian Residential School called on me in my office here. He arrived in Winnipeg from Cross Lake on Saturday, the 15th, in the afternoon, coming to the H.S.R'y at Wabowden (mile 137) then via The Pas to Winnipeg.\n\nHe informed me that the School has had a lot of trouble with their water supply for the institution. Trouble started on or about the 7th December, 1929. Since the 15th January, 1930 they have not had any water from the source of supply, and they have been providing water by hauling and delivering by water pails from the barrels to the several points in the school where the water is held for the various services; he said it took about 250 pails per diem, and in the cold weather experienced since the 15th January past, this has been quite a stiff job as well as an of considerable hardship in cold weather.\n\nThis trouble arises from the unusually low water, which is so low that the pipe conveying water from the lake to the school building is so exposed that it has frozen up, they endeavored to open up the pipe by using steam but this caused a split in the pipe, and until it is possible to get at the pipe and repair or fix it, the water will not flow. They tried to put in a temporary pipe line, but owing the severe cold weather, this was a failure, and also resulted in splitting several lengths of pipe by frost.\n\nThe Reverend Brother now asks me to make the above statement of facts, and that he would like to get assistance to put in a pipe line, to do this he would require 14 lengths 2\" Iron Pipe, Galvanized. If he gets this it is his intention to put the intake of this pipe line in the current west of the School, here he says the water is deeper. If the Department decide to grant this request, please wire, and I can ship these materials to Wabowden, and from this point the Rev'd Brother can take the whole lot by team to the school and have the work done.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nInspector\n\nIndian Affairs.

French Esq.,\nPur Trade Commissioner,\nHudson's Bay Co.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMay 5, 1930.\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe were much pleased to hear, in the course of the interview which we had with you on May the 3rd, that you were in favor of raising from its ashes the Indian Residential School of Cross-Lake and of going on with the construction of the Beauval school. Your kind words have relieved us from many of the sorrows and cares which have assailed us since the sad fires which have destroyed so many lives and so much valuable property.\n\nYour decision of constructing no other but fireproof buildings for Indian Residential schools is highly commendable for its wisdom and prudence. The recurrence of such calamities as have taken place in the past is to be prevented by all means possible.\n\nWe understand that for this year, no substantial funds for building purposes can be relied upon. However, we should like to have your directions concerning the work which we might do this summer as a preparation for the building operations of next year.\n\nWe would suggest that an expert be sent to examine the walls of the burned school at Cross Lake in order to determine whether they can be used in a new building. As far as I could judge, these walls are still in a fairly good condition and as the stress in a fireproof building is not so much on the walls as on the inside pillars, I am inclined to think that they might be used to advantage. This of course would save much time and much expense.\n\nO. Charlebois, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is reported in trade papers that Indian School at Cross Lake is being rebuilt under supervision of Roman Catholic Authorities.\n\nIt will be appreciated, if you will be good enough to advise us, who we should get in communication with, regarding Heating Equipment for this building.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTRANE COMPANY OF CANADA Limited.\n\nDistrict Manager.\n\nF.S.M. - B.\nLe Pas, Man., June 17th., 1930.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAccording to a letter received from Rev. Father J.-A. Munsenese, our representative of your Department, it appears that you wish to know if we are expecting to see the Cross-Lake Residential School rebuilt next summer, that is in 1931.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that we certainly do expect to see the said School to be put up again next summer and all the Indians of Cross-Lake expect the same. We are all confident that we shall not be disappointed. Therefore we trust that the estimates providing for the necessary funds will be prepared on time and presented at the next Session of Parliament.\n\nWe dare expect the same will be done to assure funds in view of completing the construction of The Beauval Residential School. This is yet more important, because there are already on the spot four carloads of cement which will be entirely spoiled if the construction is postponed to 1932.\n\nPlease endeavor to complete both Cross-Lake and Beauval Schools next year. In so doing you will make me the happiest man. I will be satisfied for good.\n\nI will consider it a favor if you would let me know in a near future what you intend to do in connection with these Schools. We would need this information to see about getting our own work ready.\n\nTrusting that your answer will be favorable in every respect, I remain,\n\nYours truly and gratefully,\n\n+Bishop of Keewatin.\nOttawa, July 2, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the reconstruction of the Cress Lake Indian Residential School. In reply I beg to state that there has been no decision regarding this matter. There is no intention of rebuilding at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Trans Company,\n270 Fort St.,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nJuly 8, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, urging the reconstruction of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School next year.

In the latter event we would request that you give on the enclosed form an estimate of the probable earnings of men to be employed. If all or any of the work is to be done through contractors it is essential that we be notified as to the names and addresses of all contractors or sub-contractors, and it is also essential that you insist upon full compliance with the Workmen's Compensation Act before they are permitted to commence work.\n\nIt is also essential that you hold in abeyance final settlement with any contractor until you have received from this office Certificate indicating that the Act has been fully complied with.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: No. I23-I-5d Cross Lake School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPursuant to your order of June 17th., I visited the ruins of this School and beg to offer my report as follows.\n\nWalls which are built of Stone are still standing and with a few exceptions are in good shape. If a portion of the front wall, \"see photograph 1\", measuring 50 feet from the wall of the new wing was taken down to level of 1st storey window sill and first three walls between windows on ground floor to window sills. Walls of new wing adjoining, \"see 2\", also wall of new wing which faces the same direction as front, \"see 3\", were taken down to ground level. Wall on top storey facing Chapel, see 5, taken down for approximate width of 20 feet to 1st floor ceiling joice and wall on original building, see IO, taken down to top of 2nd floor joice and inside wall of top storey to 1st floor ceiling joice, which was the west wall of original building and these rebuilt with stone, all walls could then be used for new structure, including the rebuilding of all parapet walls on original building, or first three storey part of structure. A few places would have to be re-pointed.\n\nAll window and door arches and sills in original portion would require new brick arches or plastered with cement over present brick, also window sills likewise.\n\nAll openings would require new lintels on inside and portion over same rebuilt with stone or brick. Where face walls are blackened with smoke these could be re-pointed. Inside of all walls if used to be thoroughly re-pointed or plastered.\n\nAll floors in original building including basement floor were of wood. Provision could be made to insert Steel joice construction.\n\nPresent Septic Tank is in good, I might say first class condition.\nWater supply intake pipe broken, would require re-laying.\n\nAll foundation walls are in first class condition, being all laid on solid rock when constructed.\n\nAll present chimneys are as perfect as when built.\n\nIf present walls, with the above noted changes are to be used, construction should take place before winter sets in for if walls are left as at present and become wet and freeze I would not like to forecast what would happen to them, but am afraid that they would further need to be taken down and rebuilt.\n\nAll entrance porches or verandahs to be entirely rebuilt.\n\nAll fire escapes to be new.\n\nI am enclosing photos of present ruins which will give you a better idea as to the condition of the walls, numbers starting at front and travel right, around building. I failed to photograph No. 2.\n\nIf the department have the original drawings I could mark better the portions to be rebuilt; but, would recommend that re-construction be undertaken in the very near future if present wall are to be used which, in my opinion would be a considerable saving.\n\nThere is only the one interior wall, being the end wall of original three storey structure, and this with the exception of top storey which I have previously mentioned to be taken down, is in good shape with the exception of the openings, they will require jambs and lintels to be rebuilt.\n\nI trust this report and photographs will be of material assistance to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRNW/EM\n\nIndian Affairs.

A of the 17th ultimo, with reference to the rebuilding of the Grass Lake Indian Residential School. In reply I beg to state that it is not the intention of the Department to undertake any work this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nCross Lake June 30th 1931\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI believe this is the first time I am writing directly since our terrible fire. It isn't necessary to tell you how I felt at pretty bad, and I do not think I will feel really happy until I see our school rebuilt. I can't forget a day this most terrible night of my life. I would have rather die than see such a horrible accident.\n\nIt is so sad to see these walls standing there to break my heart. They do not only remember the sad accident we had but they make me also regret the nice things and the nice years I had passed in the school with our dear own little Indians, and now we don't have yet a comfortable place for the class room though we are using the church for classroom! If only we had desks for the pupils and the teacher it would not be too bad, but we have only benches and a little homemade table for the teacher. Last summer in July I had put an application to our agent Mr. Gordon for desks for the pupils and the teacher and nothing came. Last winter I asked...\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 5)\nagain for them to Mr. Gordon hoping we could get them by the first boat this summer but nothing has come yet though the boat has been to Wisky Jack twice and I had no answer about them from the agent so I thought I will ask directly to you hoping to get them before next fall. You know it's very hard for young children to write on their knees or to kneel down to write on their benches. Suppose that that you must have heard or seen by the Quarterly Return that there was no 50 children coming to class? So I also thought of asking you if the Department could not grant me at least a building like they have for day school on the reserves. It could be easy put up for next fall and this building could be use for other purpose, like provisions house, when they would rebuild the school. A building of 22 x 36 I think would be sufficient for the class room. I think it is not asked too much as we have been making great effort to keep the class going on. Most of the lumber could be got right here except the flooring windows & doors framing etc.\n\nWell Mr. Ferrier I hope that you will find the way of getting us this building put up soon as it is rather urgent for us to keep the school going on the day school program.\n\nThere is another thing I will like to find out from\nYou Mr. Ferrier. In June 1930 when Foster, supervisor from the Post, noticed me that he had received the cheque for my quarterly return ended March 31st 1930. The amount of the cheque was $2471.87. So I looked immediately at my quarterly return and found out that the amount figuring on my return was more than that as it was $2972.81 so about $500 more than the cheque received and there was no explanation given. I thought I had made a mistake but could not find it. I wrote to the agent to look over my quarterly return and to inquire from him. I waited and waited but I never had the thing settle. I asked the agent two or three times so finally I decide to ask you directly. I would like to send you the number of the cheque as we should do when referring to a cheque but I lost the slip with the number. But telling that it was the cheque for my quarterly return ended on March 31st 1930 one month after the fact. Suppose that you could try to trace it and give me the explanation about the cheque. Hoping to hear from you. Don't you like to come by Cross Lake, we would be glad to see you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ.E. Fredericton\n\nPrincipal\nSt. Joseph's Road School\nCross Lake, N.B.\nOttawa, July 16, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the situation at Gross Lake. The Appropriation for Indian Education has been so materially decreased this year, that I regret there are no funds for improvements at your school. The situation is known to the Department and your suggestions will not be overlooked for another year.\n\nWith reference to the amount of the grant for the March quarter, 1930, I find that on your return you ask grant for several days after the date of the fire. The arrangement with His Lordship Bishop Charlebois was that the regular per capita grant would be paid up to February 25th and that, from then on, special grants in lieu of per capita grant would be made from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. H. L. MacKinnon,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nGross Lake,\nvia Norway House,\nMan.\nMarch 7th, 1932.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nOn File 126-1-5, the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, writes, in a letter dated March 4th, 1932, in connection with an account for $38.00, covering the cost of paint supplied to the Cross Lake Residential School during August 1929.\n\nIt will be noted that the Principal of the Cross Lake School was written in connection with this matter in official letter of March 7th on this file. When a reply is received from Reverend Father Trudeau, the Ashdown Hardware Co. should be written.\nOttawa, March 7th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe J. H. Ashdown Hardware Co. has written requesting payment of the enclosed account. It apparently covers the cost of paint supplied during the summer of 1929 when the new barn was being erected at the Cross Lake Residential School. If the paint mentioned on this account was received by you at that time, you should certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment. If you have no record of having received it, the account should be returned here with your explanation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nRev. G. H. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nCross Lake Indian School,\nCross Lake,\nvia Norway House, Man.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose Voucher No.151, in favor of J.H.Ashdown Hardware Co. This is for paint supplied to the St.Joseph's Residential School, on the order of the Principal, in August, 1929, to be used for the completion of the stable then under construction.\n\nIn some manner, it has been overlooked by the Company until recently, when the account was handed to Mr. Inspector Bunn. As he had no knowledge of the transaction, he forwarded the account to me for information. I forwarded it to Rev. G.E.Trudeau, of St.Joseph's school, and he furnished the above information, and has certified to one copy of the Voucher.\n\nI regret that this account was overlooked, and that it was not in my hands when the Vouchers were completed for the stable. However, the red paint was used on the stable, the white having been kept over for the painting on the following summer; as the stable was late being completed, and this paint was unfortunately burned with the school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm.Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| Quantity | Description                          | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|----------|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| 5        | Galls.

It was missed at Norway House, as it often happens, and stayed there over ten days as we have mail service only twice a month. When I received your letter, the mail had left Cross Lake for the last time before break-up, so I may have an occasion to send letter and returning you the advance account for the paint which I certify and declare was bought and received by us in the fall of 1929 for the new barn we were building at the time.\n\nI have also answered Mr. W. Gordon our Indian Agent at Norway House, who was inquiring about a month ago about this paint and I gave him the explanations.\n\nYours truly,\nH.G. Fredrickson\nPrincipal\nIndian Res. School\nCross Lake\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 5)\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 18th inst. re allowances for the day pupils at Cross Lake Roman Catholic School I would suggest (as no biscuits are supplied) an allowance of $7\\frac{1}{2}$ per pupil per day, or $40.00 per month, as the average attendance will probably decrease with the reduction of food supplied.\n\nI will be glad to render what assistance I can to Father Trudeau in the preparation of his statements re expenses. I am also gratified to know that a definite arrangement for the near future has been arrived at.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 30, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 379-1A of the 31st ultimo, with reference to allowance for midday meal for the pupils attending the Cross Lake R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nAs our Appropriation this year is limited, it is found that the maximum monthly amount the Department can allow is $30.00. If at all possible, you should keep the expenditure below this amount. Payment of the grant for midday meal purposes will be made upon receipt from you of a properly certified voucher, in triplicate.\n\nThe arrangements authorized in this letter will continue from September 1st, 1932, to June 30th, 1933. About the middle of next June, you should again communicate with the Department and consideration will then be given to the amount that can be allowed for the academic year 1933-34.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to purchase new desks for this school but it has been decided to allow the sum of $75.00, for which amount, Father Trudeau stated, desks and seats could be built locally. You may, therefore, authorize Father Trudeau to incur an expenditure of this amount, and I enclose R. R. No. 952 as authority for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P.

Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nMr. Phelan  \nDept. of Education  \nBooth Building  \nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWhen I saw you at Ottawa in September you asked me to send you a bill of groceries &c. so you could reimburse us for the mid-day meal given to the children attending the R.C. Day School at Cross Lake. I am sending you one today for the year 1932-33. I am sorry I could not send it sooner as when I got back to Cross Lake Oct 19th the lakes froze two days after and it is only two weeks ago that I could reach Le Pas. There was no way of travelling or sending mail sooner, so I could not send you this invoice sooner. I hope that you will be able to refund us soon for this bill.\n\nWhen I left Cross Lake two weeks ago nothing had been sent yet for the mid-day meal for the children attending day school. I suppose that instructions have been forwarded to the Indian agent at Norway House and that it won't delay too much before they get these...\nsupplies to Cross Lake.\n\nAlso about the bill I gave you Re. expenses made by the mission after the fire. I did not hear from you. I will be very thankful to you if you could also refund us soon.\n\nI suppose you heard of the great loss we had last week by the death of our old venerable Bishop Charlebois. It was a great loss not only for us but also for the whole northern country.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon.\n\nI remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. E. Trudeau\n\nN.B. I forgot to tell you that I had been transferred to Le Pas recently.\n\nG. E. T.\nOttawa, December 5, 1933.\n\nDear Father Trudeau:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing accounts for food supplies used at the Cross Lake R. C. Day School during the period September 1, 1932, to June 30, 1933. Owing to the requirements of our Accounting Branch, I find it necessary to return these accounts to Mr. Agent Gordon in order that he can attach them to proper voucher forms and certify them. Mr. Gordon is being instructed to return the accounts to the Department for payment as soon as possible.\n\nPermit me to point out that the Department does not usually supply such a variety of food as has apparently been supplied - this opinion is founded on a review of the accounts which show purchases of such articles as pickles, canned plums, shelled nuts, icing sugar, gelatine, raisins and currants. It is considered that only staple articles should be purchased and that the midday meal served at the school, while as appetizing and nourishing as possible under the circumstances, should not include fancy groceries. I feel you will agree with me that the Department's attitude in this matter is reasonable and that the supplying of only staple articles will result in a considerable saving.\n\nI was extremely sorry to learn of the death of Bishop Charlebois. He is a great loss.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Via Norway House,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6260, file 577-5, part 5)\nOttawa, December 5, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn official letter of September 30, 1932, you were advised that the Department had decided to allow an amount of approximately $30 a month for the purchase of food for midday meals for the pupils attending the Cross Lake R. C. Indian Day School. We are now in receipt of the enclosed accounts for the school year 1932-33. These accounts amount to $283.73. I would appreciate if you would attach the accounts to proper voucher forms, certify and return them in order that payment can be made.\n\nI wish also to draw your attention to the last paragraph of official letter of September 30, 1932. You will note that the Department expected you to write last June with reference to the amount that would be allowed for the academic year 1933-34. As yet, no communication has been received from you in this regard. Please let me have a definite recommendation stating what amount you consider reasonable.\n\nYou should point out to Rev. Father Trudeau that the Department considers many of the articles listed on the enclosed accounts should not have been purchased. It is considered unnecessary to serve a variety of food, and only staple articles should be purchased. By so doing, a considerable saving would be effected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nWm.

However, I am certifying the Vouchers, as I am assured that we have received equivalent value for the amount herein stated.\n\nThere should be no further difficulty of this nature, as the arrangement for the present year is the same as for the other Day Schools. This change was made at the request of Rev. G.H. Trudeau, who was then Principal of St. Joseph's School.\n\nWith regard to this latter arrangement, may I refer to my letter of Aug. 24th, 1933, in which I stated that the Rev. Principal had requested such an arrangement, and to Department's letter 123-7-5, of Sept. 13th, 1933, in which I am instructed to arrange a supply of biscuits for this school.\n\nI have forwarded from my supply some 500 lbs. of biscuits as well as a share of the beans, rice, sugar, salt and cocoa supplied by the Department for this purpose. Owing to lateness of receipt, rush of freighting to God's Lake, early freeze up, and deep snow, making the muskegs bad for travelling, these supplies did not reach Cross Lake until the end of December. Since, however, the Indians had plenty of fish, and trapping was good, so that there should be a good supply of food, the need was not so great for a noon day meal, as it will be later. The attendance of day pupils was also small, owing to the epidemic of whooping cough.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm.

Lazenby Esq;\nIndian Agent\nNorway House\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Brother Menard and myself have been very sorry to have missed your last visit. We had to speak to you about our present day school. We will try to do that today on this letter. You have seen that day school. Although it looks not too bad we are absolutely obliged to pull down the whole building and rebuilt on a smaller scale and very simple. As it is now it is very cold; the roof leaks all over; the floor is all wavy (?). It is too big and practically impossible to repair because the walls and ceilings will fall down alone. The present building is 58 X 22 ft and we would rebuild 36' X 18' and will try to use all the good lumber out of it for first ply outside inside and flooring. For that we want the Department of Indian Affairs to give us a help by supplying the following materials herewith enclosed which materials should be sent if possible by the first boat of the Selkirk Navigation Co as we intend to do the work quick in order to have the building ready for next opening of school on September. The expenses will not amount to much more than $300.00 and it will make a good building, that could be very useful later on, even if the Department intend to build a new boarding school as we hope in the coming future.\n\nIn the confidences you will give to this matter your immediate attention and your kind approval which will be much appreciated, we are yours very sincerely\n\nSigned; Rev Henry Boissin\nO.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nN.B. a small part of the building about 8' X 10' will be used as a little interior chapel\nH.B.\nRef: 13-A\n\nNorway House, Mani\n12th April 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter I have received from Rev. Henry Boissin O.M.I., Principal of the R.C. School at the Cross Lake Reserve, accompanied by a requisition for certain building materials, for the purpose of erecting a new day school building, after razing the present building, and using what material that could be salvaged from that in addition.\n\nWhen I was at the Cross Lake Reserve last month the Principal was away to Norway House, and I did not see him. I saw all the Sisters, but the matter of a new day school was not mentioned.\n\nThe present day school building, I understand was formerly used as the R.C. Church. It is a very roomy place, with a fairly high ceiling, and is a far better building than the United Church day school on the same reserve. However, I did not examine the building closely enough to find the defects mentioned in the Reverend Principal's letter, and am therefore not in a position to verify his statements.\n\nThe school was nicely heated, and very clean. I did not notice anything wrong with the floor.\n\nHowever, if the roof leaks all over, that is a matter that should no doubt be remedied, unless the Department will accede to the Principal's request for the materials asked for, for a new building.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nOttawa, April 27, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a letter from Rev. Henry Boissin, O.M.I., with reference to the Gross Lake Day School.\n\nThe Department understands that the building mentioned is the one known as the Gross Lake Indian Day School and which is situated in the neighbourhood of the former Gross Lake Residential School. Is this building on an Indian reserve or is it on Church property?\n\nIf at all possible, you should get in touch with Rev. Henry Boissin and point out to him that funds at the Department's disposal are quite limited. While we are disposed to give him some assistance in making this school as habitable as possible, at the same time we are not able to allow the amount requested in his letter. In replying, you should state what amount you would suggest be allowed towards repairs to this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G.

Cedar Shingles\n- 3 Rolls Diamond \"A\" Impervious Sheeting, 32 inch. (Ashdown)\n- 1 Barrel of Lime\n- 1 Camp Stove. No; 38.

If these goods are purchased the shipment should be addressed as follows:\n\nRev: Henry Boissin O.M.I.\nCross Lake.

C. Indian Day School. He has recommended that the following materials be supplied, and I would request that you arrange for the purchase, from firms on the approved list, and for the forwarding of the same to the address stated hereunder:-\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ M} & = \\text{XXX B.C.

The shipment should be addressed as follows:-\n\nRev. Henry Boissin, O.M.I.,\nCross Lake, Manitoba,\nc/o Selkirk Navigation Company,\nvia Whiskeyjack Portage.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above materials. The firms from whom you make the purchase would, no doubt, arrange to prepay the transportation charges, obtaining receipts, which should be attached to their accounts. When you have these accounts, you should attach them to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

The financial status of the work is being called to the attention of Bishop Lajeunesse.\n\nDirector.\nDecember 5, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Construction of Residential School,\nCross Lake Indian Reserve, Manitoba.\n\nAs you are aware, the sum of $25,000 was made available for the above project and the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Keewatin was advised that this amount was all that would be made available by the Department for the present fiscal year.\n\nOur Chief Engineer advises me that up to November 29th the Corporation had been reimbursed, under the terms of the Agreement, for expenditures totalling $21,467.78. Additional accounts have been received totalling approximately $6,726.00 and which includes $1,500 for a Chevrolet truck and $1,000 for material obtained from the Truscon Steel Company.\n\nThe Corporation, of course, are fully aware that the $25,000 has been overdrawn but are hoping that the balance might be paid when some future appropriation is made in regard to this reconstruction work. This information was confirmed by Father Grouard in an informal discussion I had with him on November 28th. The latter had hopes that some additional funds might be made available for this project by your Branch or through Supplementary Estimates for the current fiscal year so that the Corporation would not be obliged to finance the over-expenditure themselves until next year.\nWould you kindly advise me if there is any possibility of additional funds being made available by your Branch for this project, provided of course the Minister is agreeable.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Construction of Residential School, Cross Lake, Manitoba.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of December 5 with reference to the amount already expended in the construction of the above-mentioned school.\n\nThe amount of $25,000.00 already transferred to your Branch is the total amount that can be allowed for this school from the current year's appropriation. It is expected, however, that an amount of $35,000.00 will be provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 in order to complete this building.\n\nDirector.\nBishop's House, Le Pas, Man.,\nJanuary 6, 1939.\n\nMr. T.S.

All this should not cost less than $15,000.00. You will also notice that we have no quotation on stairs and fire-escapes.\n\nAccording to the Beaver Lumber Co., as per their letter enclosed, we could realize a substantial saving by using wood laths. We leave it to the Department to approve such a suggestion.\n\nAccording to informations taken about mastic cement finish it seems that it has proved unsatisfactory everywhere it has been laid. Therefore we would prefer plain cement finish to this rather unpopular kind. Of course terrazo would give us complete satisfaction but it is rather expensive and we doubt if the Dept., will be ready to favour us with it.\n\nAlthough this estimate is far from being accurate, I hope that it shall enable you to find out the amount required to complete the enterprise.\n\nYours very devotedly,\n\n+ Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\nVisar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\n\nEnclosure: Sketch for heating system.\nBishop's House, Le Pas, Manitoba.\n\nJanuary 4th, 1939.\n\nMr. T.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-5, part 6)\nd) Electricity:\n\nThe wiring, fixtures and fittings amount to about $775.00. A Diesel engine to run a 5 kilowatt dynamo would cost about $1995.00; batteries about $525.00 for Gobelite Batteries: 110 volts, 56 cells, C.D. 13, 13 plates per cell, 168 amperes, Int. rating. D.C.\n\ne) Plastering:\n\nMetallic laths and plaster for three coats which, without including the wages of the helper, laid at .25 cents a yard, will cost altogether about $6,700.00. Transportation of this material from Winnipeg to Whisky Jack Portage will cost about $450.00. (See post scriptum, b).\n\nf) Cement, lime and bricks:\n\nTo finish the basement and the top slab of the former chapel and to repair some of the walls, window sills and chimneys, about 1300 bags of cement, 300 bags of lime and about 5000 bricks are needed. Cement for the whole at $2 a sack will cost $3000, transportation included, while the lime will amount to about $2, transportation also included.\n\ng) Partitions and stairs:\n\nWe suggest for the partitions to use home-cut two by fours (2 by 4), covered with metallic laths. As for the main staircase, only the landing place at the basement has been raised slightly, the rest of the plans that you have on hand remain unchanged.\n\nh) Water and intake:\n\nA well will be dynamited this winter. An intake pipe will be extended 325 feet out from the shore into deep water. We actually have 200 feet of 3 inch galvanized pipe on hand, but we still require 220 feet more of the same kind and size. 150 sacks of cement will be needed this winter for this work.\n\ni) Floor finish:\n\nIn previous correspondence, it was agreed upon to use plastic cement everywhere in the house, but after due consideration, we wonder whether it would not be advisable to lay\nREPORT OF THE CROSS LAKE SCHOOL:\n\n1) Floor finish: (cont'd.)\n\nThis only in the boys' and girls' playrooms, manual training room, outside students' room, basement toilets, etc., while for the corridors use battleship and in the rooms where there is less traffic some kind of linoleum.\n\n2) Fire-escape tower:\n\nFor the fire-escape enclosure, since the school is now fire-proof, we wonder whether it would not be just as wise to do without this stone tower enclosing the fire-escape. Would just a pole with steel platforms at the floors suffice?\n\n3) Gasoline-electric plant:\n\nAn engine and dynamo must be installed and since we have in mind a new European invention making gas from wood, we would suggest that a second hand electric plant be repaired and set up for a couple of years service, until this new machine, very much more economical, be adapted to our needs. There are three second hand electric plants at your Norway House Agency that could probably be utilized if the Department approves the suggestion.\n\n4) Chimney:\n\nTo cut down expenses, instead of tearing down part of a good wall to put up the chimney on the outside, it was constructed within.\n\nHoping that this report shall meet your requirements and satisfaction.

Mills,\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Reconstruction of the Cross Lake School,\nCross Lake Reserve, Manitoba.\n\nREPORT OF THE CROSS LAKE SCHOOL.\n\n1) What has been done to date since August 15th, 1938.\n\na) The saw mill:\n\nOur old saw mill was set up again after having been idle for the last four years, but several parts had to be renewed before it was in good running condition. The boiler also had to be replaced. The cutting, hauling, sawing and planing of about 64,000 ft. of lumber employed a crew of men quite regularly till the 15th of November.\n\nb) The construction:\n\nOne of the first things to do was to clean up the fire ruins. Four and five feet of debris inside had to be dug up and the top story, at places the whole wall to the basement, had to be demolished. This work kept another crew of men busy for three weeks.\n\nAccording to the preliminary plans, two stories on the wing, built in 1924, were supposed to be taken down too, but after due examination, the walls were judged by the superintendent to be in such good condition that he thought it would have been a mistake to have torn them down. The walls, therefore, were preserved and doing so by keeping the building at the same height saved the general appearance of the school and even gave it more room.\n\nThe saving of this story did not in any way affect the main skeleton of the building, but it did afford the opportunity for more spacious and better lighted manual training and sewing rooms. We are sending you the remodeled plans of the same.\ne) Transportation of material:\n\nWhile the above crews were busy, another was at work in the Whisky Jack Portage freighting the building material. As stated in my letter of October 11th last, we had to purchase a truck that was indispensable to keep the work going and to assure efficient service. This work continued till the first part of October and it was paid for by the weekly wages already included in the Return of Labour. Nearly 300 tons were trucked over a five mile portage, then unloaded and embarked for a further twelve mile water route, the whole necessitating several handlings before reaching the school grounds.\n\nd) Sand and Gravel:\n\nThrough lack of time, we were unable to organize, as we would have desired, for the transportation of sand and gravel. The Indians were employed to supply both by canoe, paddling about a yard per trip, the wages amounting to an average of $2.50 a day. Though the procedure was not very economical, the employment of these Indians who were on relief saved the Government what it would have paid out anyway to succor these people.\n\ne) Masonry and cement:\n\nFavored by the weather and by the regular supply of material, four masons were kept at work right along till November 17th. The masonry is now practically over, except for the finishing under the rafters, the joining of parts of the walls, the completion of the window sills and the building of the fire-escape enclosures.\n\nf) Concrete:\n\nThe plans for the steel work were well figured out and everything was made per requirements. This favored the advancement of our work considerably. Actually all floors are poured, except the top slab of the former chapel, (now intended for the boys' dormitory). Shortage of cement held up the completion. Nevertheless, all steel joists and other parts were finished to permit the building of the roof.\n\ng) Present state of the building:\n\nThe work was kept up till mid-December. Towards the end, all efforts were centered on the roof which was\ng) Present state of the building: (cont'd)\n\ncompletely boarded and about one-fifth shingled. Since the 15th of December the building foreman and three or four men are working at reduced wages to stud the inside walls and make the window frames and partitions. All openings have been blocked and stoves on every floor protect the building against frost.\n\nh) Expenditure:\n\nThe enclosed statement shows that the total expenditure up to this date amounts to $36,668.60 plus the expenditures expected to be incurred to March 31, 1939: $2,240.00. Grand total of expenditures: $38,908.60.\n\n2) Work to be done:\n\na) Doors and windows:\n\nAs stated before we have not bought the windows and doors. Sketches of the various sizes were roughly drawn, enabling us to ask tender prices for storm, inside and outside doors and windows, amounting to approximately $ (See post scriptum.)\n\nb) Heating system:\n\nAs for the heating plant, we are including something based on the former system which gave us satisfactory service. The old boiler was tested and if it was repaired, it still could be used. Riveted edges would have to be rolled over and tightened and a few pieces replaced. This boiler would be useful in case of emergency. However, according to your engineer, a new boiler is needed and we would suggest a \"Spencer Boiler\", Type 4S-1S. The tender price for this boiler and for the heating and plumbing accessories amount to about $. The repairs of the old boiler will cost about $200. (See post scriptum.)\n\nc) The water system:\n\nFour water cisterns, four by eight feet (4 by 8 ft.), were found to be in good condition and they were placed in the attic of the main building to give gravity pressure. The columns and beams underneath had to be reinforced accordingly.\nTotal amount required in 1939 season (1938-40 estimates) to meet 1939 expenditure and balance 1938 expenditure as estimated by Bishop Lajeunesse..............$65,000.00 to $70,000.00\n\nThis information was requested in your memorandum of December 22nd last.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDirector.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJanuary 18th, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI am forwarding you herewith copies of reports dated January 4th and January 6th, forwarded by Bishop Lajeunesse covering the reconstruction of the Cross Lake School in Manitoba. I am also enclosing a recapitulation of total expenditures made by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Kewatin, on this project up to December 31st. You will note that accounts have already been sent in covering more than the total amount of $25,000.00 provided by the Department for the present fiscal year. A summary of the financial situation in regard to this project, is as follows:\n\nExpenditure to March 31st 1939 as estimated by Bishop Lajeunesse..................... $ 38,908.60\n\nTotal expenditure estimated for next season by Bishop Lajeunesse...........$ 56,000.00\n\nReduction in latter expenditure possible through omission of laundry and baking equipment ....... $ 2560.00\n\nSaving possible if wood lath used instead of metal lath ...... $ 2600.00 5,160.00\n\nNet estimate for 1939 season construction costs.......................... $ 50,840.00\n\nExpenditure for 1938 season over amount provided by Department.......... $ 13,908.60 (Approximate)\nFebruary 7, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe - Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI have asked Mr. Mills, our Chief Engineer, to forward you immediately sketch plans which indicate construction undertaken by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Keswatin on the Cross Lake Indian Residential School during the past season. Bishop Lajeunesse was to forward us plans showing just what work had been done, as the Corporation had not followed the approved plans that were forwarded them. The plans showing the building as constructed have not yet been received from Bishop Lajeunesse. The plans that will be forwarded you from Mr. Mills' office are made up from information given in Bishop Lajeunesse's report of January 5th.\n\nDirector.\nThese Plans Amended April 153\nBishop's House, Le Pas, Manitoba.\n\nJanuary 4th, 1939.\n\nMr. T.S.

We leave it to the Department to approve such a suggestion.\n\nAccording to informations taken about mastic cement finish it seems that it has proved unsatisfactory everywhere it has been laid. Therefore we would prefer plain cement finish to this rather unpopular kind. Of course terrazo would give us complete satisfaction but it is rather expensive and we doubt if the Dept., will be ready to favour us with it.\n\nAlthough this estimate is far from being accurate, I hope that it shall enable you to find out the amount required to complete the enterprise.\n\nYours very devotedly,\n\n+ Martin LaJeunesse, O.M.I.\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\n\nEnclosure: Sketch for heating system.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These accounts, duly certified by G.E.

It would appear that similar action might be taken in this case but I should be glad to have your opinion before anything is done.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 12, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Cross Lake Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of September 2 regarding certain items in the invoices in connection with the construction of the Cross Lake school I may say it is considered that this matter should stand over until completion of the building and the return of surplus funds, if any, to this Branch. At that time purchase of the articles mentioned in your memorandum will be further considered.\n\nDirector.\n### Document 1\n\n**J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co.

Hoey,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your telegram of the 3rd instant concerning the Cross Lake School:\n\nI am somewhat surprised to read in the telegram that \"No authority has been given for purchase of equipment although accounts are being received from different firms.\" In equipment, for which accounts you may have received, I do not see anything besides desks and other school supplies that were ordered through the Indian Agent at Norway House, consequently following the ordinary procedure. By equipment, also, I hope you do not mean the electric system and lamps, or necessary supplies for the laundry and bakery. However, all these articles are listed in a report sent on request to the Department last January so as to figure up the approximate cost for the rest of the construction.\n\nSince the school will be finished at the beginning of December, I hardly think it is the intention of the Department to leave it idle till the following September in 1940. Furthermore, since navigation over Lake Winnipeg will soon come to an end with the coming freeze-up, we took the initiative to buy only what was strictly necessary in furniture, dishes, beds, blankets, clothing. We have not as yet received the invoices to enable us to say just what will be the total costs.\n\nAs in all constructions, the estimate cost will probably be exceeded, but I do not think it will be above 20% of the $90,000.00. Furniture and fixtures strictly necessary for the school cannot very easily be omitted, unless a bare school is intended.\nWe hope the Department will understand the situation and that our efforts to co-operate with It will be seconded so as to make a success of the enterprise. I will be in Ottawa next week and I will have more precise figures and information to present by then.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the present time it appears that some $34,000 may be available from the latter project and a Memorandum to Council is being drafted asking for authority to pay or refund to the Church authorities the amount of the over-expenditure as represented by accounts submitted. Some of these accounts have already been forwarded.\nto you.\n\nIf your understanding in regard to the additional payments is in accordance with that outlined above, would you kindly advise me if you would like to have all accounts submitted to you for inspection before they are paid by this Branch from the Port Alberni Vote, or if you would prefer that they be checked by our Architectural Division and paid without further reference, provided they are considered in order.\n\nDirector.\nEv\u00each\u00e9-Bishop's House,\nLa Pas, Man.

It is noted that it is your intention to use this amount in paying approximately $8,000.00 required to pay accounts incurred in connection with the erection of the Cross Lake School, also $21,000.00 in connection with the construction of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand that you have accounts on hand approximating the above amounts and I should appreciate it if you would arrange to have them checked by your Architectural Division and paid without further reference to this Branch, provided they are considered in order.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 24, 1940.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nRe: Cross Lake Indian Residential School\n\nOn the receipt of Mr. Wardle's memorandum of February 17 I visited the Surveys & Engineering Branch and checked the accounts that had been submitted in connection with the Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nIt was found that accounts amounting to approximately $9000.00 incurred in connection with the construction of this building have been received by the Surveys & Engineering Branch and, as approved by Dr. McGill's memorandum of February 22, the Surveys & Engineering Branch will arrange payment of these. As far as we are aware at the present date this will complete the amount due for the construction of the building.\n\nThe Church authorities have, however, purchased considerable equipment for this building and in this regard reference should be made to letters on this file dated January 5, 1940, from Rt. Rev. M. LaJeunesse, O.M.I., also letter of February 7, 1940, from Rev. G.E. Trudeau, O.M.I. The following is a statement of the expenditure already incurred for equipment by the Church authorities:\n\n1. List dated January 5, 1940, included with Bishop LaJeunesse's letter of the same date -- these accounts have not been paid...$ 4,324.46\n\n2. Accounts forwarded some time ago to the Surveys & Engineering Branch but returned unpaid as they covered purchase of equipment -- these are also unpaid and amount to... 975.25\n\n3. Under-mentioned accounts have been paid by the R.C. Episcopal Corporation of Keewatin and they request the Department to refund the amount due them:\n\n(a) Blankets, sheeting, pillow cases $415.76\n(b) Battleship linoleum ............. 46.56\n(c) Bedspreads ....................... 200.00 662.32\n\n$ 5,962.03\n\nOf the above total it will be noted that in the event of funds being provided the amount of $662.32 should be refunded to the R.C. Episcopal Corporation of Keewatin and the balance covers accounts due to different firms.\n\nRev. G.E. Trudeau, O.M.I., in his letter dated February 7, 1940, on this file, submits a list of equipment that he considers is still required. The total cost of these would amount to $1,783.80.\nSUMMARY\n\nCost of material already purchased and presumably in the school ......................... $5,962.03\nApproximate cost of equipment still required ........... $1,783.80\n\n$7,745.83\n\nIn addition to the above amount provision will have to be made for payment of freight on the equipment and possibly for the purchase of some other smaller items. Consequently, Rev. G.E. Trudeau, in his letter of February 7, estimates the total amount required for equipping the Cross Lake School at .....$9,000.00\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFebruary 23, 1940.\n\nThe Dominion Government,\nDept.

School,\nCross Lake, Manitoba.\n\nOn the tenth of this month I went to Cross Lake, Man., where I passed a week. I am in a position now to give you a report on the latest doings on the construction.\n\nThere are still a few carpenters at work making transoms, screens, cupboards and finishing the fire-escape staircases. Another coating of paint will also be necessary nearly everywhere. There is enough work left to keep busy the carpenters now on the job until about the 16th of March. By that date it is understood that all work will cease and by the twentieth or so I will be in a position to send you the last paylist. If in fact by that time there still remains some work left, we shall see to it ourselves.\n\nBy the end of next month I will also send you the last bills: one from Wood Vallance for glass for transoms, one for mosquito screen for windows, one from Ashdown for hardware and the Compensation Board receipts amounting to about $600.00.\n\nAs already stated last December, I am very pleased with the work done at Cross Lake. Without saying that the work is perfect all around and safe from any possible criticism, I do say, however, and sincerely ask you to send Mr. Parkinson himself to judge the amount and the quality of what has been done. He better than any one else, since he saw the ruins before the construction, can give you a fair and impartial report.\n\nIt is with pleasure that I am herewith forwarding you a few snapshots of the new school and which will help give you an idea of the new edifice. Enclosing, I again emphasize my desire to have you send a competent inspector to examine the work done at Cross Lake.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nVicar-Apostolic of Keewatin.\nOttawa,\nMarch 7, 1940.\n\nEX'D.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of the copy of your letter of the 27th ultimo addressed to Mr. T.S.

As soon as this is done we will endeavour to arrange payment of the accounts for the furnishings already purchased.\n\nI also intend to take up with the Purchasing Agent early next week the question of purchasing the additional articles which you require. In Father Trudeau's letter of February 7 he gave the prices of a number of additional articles. If you could let me know the name and address of the firm from whom these prices were secured it would assist us greatly in making the purchase.\n\nIn your letter of March 15 you enclosed an additional list of equipment required. Among other articles mentioned on this list were tables, wardrobes, benches and cupboards for various staff rooms. If you could let me have more detailed information regarding exactly what is needed it would also be of considerable assistance to our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. M.

Harrisons & Crosfield (Canada) Ltd. regarding their account for supplying laundry machinery to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation, Vote 196, an amount of $10,000.00 was included for the purchase of furnishings for the new Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware this school was built under the direction of the Church authorities and His Lordship Rt. Rev. M. Lejeunesse, O.M.I., Bishop of Keewatin, purchased a considerable quantity of furnishings in the fall of 1938 without receiving any authority to do so from this Branch.\n\nHis Lordship has submitted the attached accounts for payment:\n\n1.

Marshall Wells -- Electrical appliances ... 20.01\n4. Selkirk Navigation Co. -- Freight .......... 113.06\n5. William Roberts & Sons -- Dough mixer and bread pans ...... 401.52\n\nNone of the above accounts has yet been paid and as soon as our total appropriation is available cheques could be issued if the Minister approves.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-5, part 6)\nHis Lordship has also submitted, for reimbursement to himself, the following accounts which he has already paid:\n\n(a) Daoust & Co. -- Bake oven .................. $351.00\n(b) Les Industries Textiles Franco-Canadiennes Ltd. -- Linens .......... $268.00\n(c) Gaulds Ltd. -- Linoleum ... $46.58\nLinens ...... $158.76 $445.34\n(d) Fairbanks Morse --\nRip Saw etc. $9.95\nPump ....... $201.10 $211.05\n\nIt has been our practice in the past to fully equip all new residential schools and all the articles shown on the attached accounts appear to be necessary for the proper operation of the school. I should, therefore, appreciate it if the Minister would approve payment of these accounts and in that event they should be forwarded to the Purchasing Agent in order that the necessary purchase order may be issued.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I hope that this report will be found satisfactory.\n\nYesterday I have forwarded to Mr. Mills the last bills to be paid in connection with the reconstruction.

If the Department is not ready to grant the same, we will try to do without them, though they would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA third list refers to tools needed for the manual training room.\n\nThe fourth list with explanations deals with an extra Diesel Engine and Frigid Air Equipment.\n\nHoping not to be indiscreet in submitting all this to your kind consideration.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Vicar-Apostolic of Keewatin]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The prices quoted might change as most of these are quoted from catalogues. However, if you find that some items of lower values could be suitable, we are leaving this entirely to your discretion, as well as the buying of these furnitures. However, if we received authority to purchase these, we will do it the most economical way.\n\nIt is rather difficult to find out exactly the freight charges on these furnitures and if we consider that most likely there will still be many little things needed, in my opinion the expenses for the equipment shall amount very close to $9,000.00.\n\nHoping that you will not find this exaggerate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe R.C.

G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nBursar,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOctober 15th, 1940\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been greatly disappointed when I saw the beds bought by the Department for our school. They are too wide to be suitable for the dormitories and moreover they don't match those bought last fall from Ashdown Company. If you look down on the invoice No.65563, you will find out that there were:\n\n15 Bungalow Beds No.57 2'6\" x 6'\n35 \" \" \" 2'5\u00bd\"x 5'6\"\n\nThe beds bought from the Globe Bedding Co. on September 7th, are:\n\n29 Bungalow Beds 4' 6\" x 3'\n26 \" \" 5' X 3'\n\nI wonder what is the reason that they are so wide as it is not necessary for comfort and as they would look more proportionated if they were narrower as they are shorter. The main objection I have is, that they take too much floor space uselessly. With these it means that we lose fourteen feet of floor space in each dormitory. There is no doubt it would be too crowded. Hence, in my opinion, they have to be returned and so the mattresses, at any cost.\n\nWhat makes me more sorry about it, is that besides the additional cost for transport, I am sure there is depreciation on the beds as they are in a certain way damaged. The water is so low this fall that the barge can not come to dock at our warehouse. They have to unload out on a point. From there we haul the freight by canoe. It is where the beds were unloaded. The first day the boat arrived, we hurried up to get in the shed all perishable goods. We did not have time to put the beds in. They were left outside well covered. The next day it has rain all day. Too much dampness and possibly rain have caused the cable fabric to rust on some of them.\n\nIf I have had been there when the boat came, I would have reshipped them at once. When I was aware of the kind of beds we had received, the boat was gone.\n\nThey were left on this point for the next boat that was supposed to come only this week. Without giving us any notice, I hear they have come last week. What have they done with the beds, I can not say. More likely, they should have have taken them on the boat and reshipped them to the Globe\nI would have liked to have your advice before taking any action. I could not delay any more as, undoubtedly, it is the last boat this fall. I would not have cared to keep them over winter as very probably they would have received more damage, especially the mattresses which would have been spoiled by the mice.\n\nI had no opportunity to take information from Father Trudeau. It would have been too late to send them back.\n\nI understand plainly you will feel sorry about it, but I should think you will approve what I have done, realizing that smaller beds meet far better the needs. I had even asked Father Trudeau to try to get 24\" width for the 4' 6\" beds.\n\nI have to point out to you also that on your Purchase Order the five foot beds are quoted at $6.97. On the Manufacture invoices they are charged at $9.97.\n\nIt would not be possible and practical to buy smaller beds this fall and have them shipped out by railway. The winter roads are not good enough for that purpose and the freight would amount too much. The only thing to do is to wait until next spring to have them in. It will be awkward to do without them this winter, but I think we will have to.\n\nI would ask you to buy the mattresses now and have them shipped out by rail around November 20th. The length for the beds and mattresses is correct, but the width should not be more than 2' 5\u00bd\". Address them Via Wabowden C/O A. Pieroni.\n\nAt the exception of the sewing machines, I have not yet received anything else of what was purchased. More likely it has arrived on last week boat and as it has been outside under cover for pretty near a week I wonder how these furnitures will be.\n\nI feel really sorry to give you so much trouble and to seem to be dissatisfied, although I understand that lots has been done for us. I can not help it, it has to be done. However, I would like you to rest assure of our gratitude. If these shipments had been done earlier, lots of troubles, expenses and lost could have been avoided.\nI hope this experience will convince you of the importance to clear every matter regarding the northern districts as soon as convenient in the early summer.\n\nAs soon as the merchandises arrive, I will endeavour to send the certified invoices. They may be late as it may freeze up before I have time to send them in.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Chamberland, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Rev. Father Chamberland, Principal of the Cross Lake Residential School. This letter explains itself and I must say at the outset that it is difficult to understand why the Principal took the action outlined in the letter. At the present time, when it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain deliveries of goods, and when the Department supplied good serviceable beds of a reasonable width, it is beyond me why any Principal should return them.\n\nAfter all is said and done the Department should have some say as to the width of beds that are used in residential schools. Apparently the Principal of the Cross Lake School does not recognize this fact.\n\nIn addition you can see from his own letter that the beds were left outside for a considerable period of time and even now he does not apparently know where they are. He refers in the first paragraph of his letter to beds which he purchased himself from the Ashdown Hardware Company. This is one of the accounts which have been forwarded here for payment and it shows that the beds cost $8.50 apiece whereas we purchased them for $6.97 each.\n\nI have not yet heard from the Globe Bedding Company but I think both of us can be assured that when the beds finally are returned to them, if they ever arrive, we are going to have a very interesting time in endeavouring to straighten out the matter.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI dislike bothering you with this matter but I was afraid that if I wrote to the Principal I would say something that might be better left unsaid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSHOP AT September 18, 1940\n\nM.

I regret too that it appears from your letter that no serious endeavour was made to provide suitable storage for this furniture when it reached its destination.\n\nYou mentioned in your letter that you also intended to return the mattresses but in a communication just received from the Parkhill Bedding Company they state that the Selkirk Navigation Company has only returned to them the beds.\n\nAs the Parkhill Bedding Company supplied beds according to the specifications prepared by this Branch they are not prepared either to exchange them or to refund their cost. Under these circumstances the Department considers that they should be used in the Cross Lake School and it is our intention to instruct the Company to ship them to Wabowden.\n\nYou must be aware of the conditions existing at the present time and it is so difficult to obtain\n\nRev.

This amounted to $8.95 and presumably covered small items purchased for the Cross Lake School.\n\nI enclose a copy of the item for $251.59. It would appear that this account was sent in error as it is stated the pump was forwarded to the Ile a la Croix Hospital.\n\nIs this pump in use at Cross Lake or was there a mistake made in paying for it? It was included with other accounts forwarded from your office for the Cross Lake School and we presumed that it was used there.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

If not is there anyone on the staff capable of teaching it? In that event a loom would be purchased.

Episcopal Corporation of Keewatin at a cost of $1,540.00, and that approval of charging the purchase price of the truck against the cost of construction was subsequently given on the understanding that the truck would be the property of the Department on completion of the work.\n\nWhen our Architect inspected this project in March, 1940, it was not possible to see the truck in question since it was in winter storage at Wiskay Jack, some fifteen miles distant from the school. However, from information obtained in discussion with the Principal of the school, and with the firm who supplied the truck, it appeared that the truck had been subjected to extremely heavy use and that its market value at that time would be between $500.00 and $600.00.\n\nSince this project was completed in March, 1940, the above mentioned truck is now the property of the Department. However, as it is located at Cross Lake, and is undoubtedly being used in connection with the operation of the Residential School, it is felt that arrangements should be made to transfer full responsibility of ownership and maintenance to the Indian Affairs Branch, dating from the completion of the work in March, 1940.\n\nYour consideration of the above matter will be appreciated.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

You realize, I have no doubt, that this truck has lost more depreciation than the same vehicle would have, if it had been operating on a good road.

The cost of the truck was included in the cost of construction of the building and was paid from the amount appropriated for the latter purpose. This truck is consequently the property of the Department. I recently wrote to the Principal to ascertain the purpose for which the truck is now being used and he has replied as follows:\n\n\"This machine has been exclusively used for freighting at Whiskey Jack Portage, and is left there, twelve miles from the school.

There are still different things to be done to say it is completed and finished. I hope that by next fall it will be all done. Regarding the accommodation it will take all the winter to do it. We have a man working regularly on this job. His work can not show much on a building of this dimension.\n\nWe are very satisfied with the construction, water, electric and heating plans. They have worked perfectly and have not given any trouble yet. However, I would advise that another \"Diesel Engine\" be installed. We have only one engine to drive all our machines; water pump, generator, laundry and dough mixer. We have also an electric pump for the return of the heating plan. We would be in a very complete disorganization should it happen that this engine gets out of order yet it is but a natural thing to expect. As we are in a distant location it would take weeks before we could have the repair parts. I would strongly suggest that the Department send us another engine. I am convinced it is a very wise organization to do.\n\nSince the opening of the school, we have realized that some changes have to be made in the partitions. It would be more convenient. I am sorry we could not have foreseen it and have it done at first.\n\nThe chapel has proven too small. We have to crowd to a certain extent the children, the organ and the confessional take many feet of room. It could be easily extended if we would take down the wall between the chapel and the solarium and add this room to the chapel. On the other hand the solarium is too far away from the infirmaries and there is no accommodation for the sick people. I have taken the matter up with the Department Doctor, Dr. Cameron Corrigan, from Norway House, and he said that our infirmaries are large enough and plenty of sun shine to meet our needs. Consequently I think this wall should be taken down and use the full room as a chapel.\n\nOn the first floor, it would also be more accommodating if the wall between the Principal's Office and the class room be demolished and the full room use for the \"babies' \" class room. We had provided for four class rooms. The fourth one is too small to be practical. Besides, I think it would be always a problem to have so many teachers. A larger class room would be better and I think give good results as in pretty near all the Indian Residential Schools there are no more than three class rooms. The Principal's Office would be located in this fourth class room. This would be better arranged. The Principal's office is really too narrow and too far from the parlor. If it would be in this fourth class room a door would be opened direct on the parlor and give more accommodation for all.\nI am sending you the plans and I ask to be given authorization to have these changes done. I should say that it is my intention to have it done at our own expense and I can assure that the work will be neatly done. I would like to know at a very early date as it should be done in the first part of the holidays so we could do the painting we have to do after. I want to say again that this is practically necessary.\n\nI hope that you have been pleased with Mr. Buck's report when he visited the school. He seemed to be very satisfied. We have endeavoured to do the very best we could according to circumstances in which it had to be put up.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Albert Chamberland, O. M. I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. T. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJuly 14th, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Manitoba.\n\nI am forwarding herewith for your information, copy of a letter received by Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer, from the Rev. A. Chamberland, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, in which he requests authority to change partitions in several class rooms at the expense of the school authorities, and suggests that the Department purchase a duplicate diesel engine for the school. Sketch plans showing the proposed partition alterations are attached.\n\nOur Architectural Division have checked over these and state that the changes can be made without prejudicing in any way the upper floor, and whether or not the changes should be allowed rests in the discretion of your Branch. If they are made, the school authorities should forward an accurate plan of the changes after they have been completed.\n\nIn regard to the purchase of a duplicate diesel engine, there should be no serious breakdown of the present power plant if it is properly looked after. However, as mentioned by the Reverend Chamberland, the school is in an isolated locality and repair parts would not likely be obtained promptly. If a spare engine...\nis to be purchased, it is suggested that inquiries be made as to the possible saving in buying a smaller engine, i.e. one that would give emergency service only and be limited in capacity to supplying essential power for the water pump, heating plant and lighting.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 16, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a letter which was directed to the Surveys and Engineering Branch by the Reverend Principal of the Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nIn the first place I would point out that the Reverend Principal should have written to this Branch before communicating with the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nAs you are aware, the Cross Lake School was only erected recently, and it is rather difficult to understand why it should be necessary to move partitions in the building.\n\nNo doubt, you will have an opportunity of discussing the Rev. Principal's request with the Bishop, Right Reverend M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I., following which you should communicate with this office.\n\nIn regard to the purchase of a duplicate Diesel engine, I may say that there should be no serious breakdown of the present power plant if it is properly looked after.

Lajeunesse, O.M.I. and received an answer to my letter this morning.\n\nHis Excellency was himself very much surprised to learn that some of the changes were advisable if not quite necessary. He attributes this to the want of experience of both Rev. Father Chamberland and the Mother Superior in charge of the School.\n\nOf all the changes proposed, His Excellency advises there is one which is imperative, and that is the enlarging of the classrooms for the very small children. This is to be done at the expense of the Principal's office. As far as the chapel is concerned, His Excellency admits that it is rather small, but will not advise enlarging it by doing away with the solarium, unless the Doctor advises that this solarium is of no practical utility, and that the School can very well get along without it.\n\nThe question of the supplying of a Diesel engine is one to which the Department should give careful attention. It should be borne in mind that Cross Lake is about 400 miles from Winnipeg and there are times during the year when it would take about six weeks for repair parts to be shipped from Winnipeg. The heating plant depends for its proper functioning on an electrically-operated condensation pump. Should the Diesel engine break down in the Winter, there would be no way of operating the heating plant. Great damage might result in the freezing of the radiators and the plumbing system.\nOttawa,\nAugust 8, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo in which you state that it will be necessary to enlarge the classroom at the Cross Lake Residential School and that this work will be done at the expense of the school management. This action is approved.\n\nI am taking up with the Surveys & Engineering Branch the suggestion contained in the last two paragraphs of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

His Lordship hopes that you will pay for this pipe out of your emergency fund so that the small allowance of $425.00 which stands to the credit of the Cross Lake School may be utilized for the purchase of manual training tools and equipment.\n\nI am enclosing the list of manual training equipment which, in the opinion of Rev. Father Chamberland, the Principal, is needed. I am informed that the school has the necessary quarters for this training. If given the tools and equipment they would give this department at the opening of the school much more attention than it has received up to date.\n\nIn the course of the conversation which I had with his Lordship, he informed me that the children at Cross Lake being discharged at the age of 14, the shoe repairing cannot be done by them. They must use the services of an employee. All these repairs up to now have been done by hand and it has proved to be quite expensive. Notwithstanding the practice followed by the Department, would it not be possible to supply the Cross Lake School with a shoemaker sewing machine in order to reduce the cost of shoe repairing. If necessary his Lordship would like his request to be placed before the Minister for his personal attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are also forwarding to the Principal an outline of the program for vocational training for the current academic year. This is also the same as will be used in the Alberta schools.

It is understood that removal of the partition between the chapel and solarium, suggested by Father Chamberland at that time, was found to be unnecessary.\n\nIt is further noted that the Church authorities again refer to the purchase of a second Diesel engine to provide current for the electrical system at the school in the event of a breakdown of the engine now installed. A breakdown of the engine would of course prevent operation of the electrically operated condensation return pump on the heating system, and the school Principal has suggested the installation of a hand operated pump for use in such an emergency.\n\nAs far as we have been able to discover after investigation, no manually operated equipment for use in returning condensate to a boiler is manufactured, and in our opinion no such equipment is necessary.\n\nThere is no possibility of the heating system freezing up due to the failure of the condensation pump. Condensate in the return steam line would not be removed, and would build up in the return line to the volume usually eliminated by the electrically operated pump. When this point was reached, the vent with which the pump is equipped would allow additional condensate to spill out on the boiler room floor; but, provided the water level in the low pressure heating boiler was maintained, nothing more serious would result.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nFrom the information available, it would seem that the heating system is working satisfactorily and that the only justification for considering the installation of additional equipment would be to ensure continuous operation of the electrical system in the event of a temporary breakdown of the present installation.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S.

It is now proposed to put the sawmill in charge of one of the agency staff and to have the Indians take out lumber from their reserve to be used at the mill. It will, therefore, be able to supply all the lumber required for the erection of the insulated frame building to be used for refrigeration purposes for the school and hospital.\n\nIt is noted that the estimated cost of a suitable building erected by Indian labour, under the supervision of an engineer, is $600.00. It is possible that the building will not cost so much as estimated in view of the proposal to use the lumber at Reserve House.\n\nWill you kindly prepare a list of the lumber required to erect the building and a rough sketch? This would enable the Indians to get the lumber ready for the construction of the building in the spring or early summer. The balance of the materials required for the building could be shipped in to Reserve House by the first boat.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Trudeau drew my attention to the fact that there is no standby source of power and that if anything happened to the engine they would not be able to heat or light the building or have any water whatever. This would be a serious condition if the engine broke down in cold weather as the fire would have to be put out immediately due to the fact that there would be no water available for the boiler. The school itself is very well constructed, but very poorly designed. The building is narrow for its length and the rooms are of an awkward size. There does not seem to be sufficient class room space.\n\nP.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-5, part 7)\nDear Parents, Benefactors, Benefactresses,\n\nI was anxious to write to you. I should have waited to be in Chagona to do it but Reverend Fathers R\u00e9my and Chaput are just like you and they willing to give me a help so here I am. Yes, I am not home yet as I have still forty or fifty miles to travel, a two days trip. I thought I could have gone by trucks but I heard today that the trucks are not going in that direction on account of the snow and as they cannot buy fish there is no reason to go, so I will have to find another way of going... I will go in a canoe or the other. My Montagnais seem to be lonesome. No Father! I was reading this morning a letter from one of them and he said \"Time is long when we have no Father.\" No Father, it is true, how I will be lonesome once more in my little house, nobody to help me, no one to speak with... but I must remember that the life of a priest must be a perpetual sacrifice.\n\nNow I will tell you what I did on my way back. I met good people all over and everywhere. First I stopped at Three Rivers, after I left Quebec, then Cap-de-la-Madeleine, and Montreal. I tried to pay a visit to all those who have been so kind to me and generous to my mission. I wanted to visit too the parents of our Fathers but they were too many it was impossible. I was really sorry. It was impossible to ask me to these different places when we know that the gas is rationed on account of the war, so with the tires. At Ottawa the good brothers the \"Schlastics\" have been kind and sympathetic, they did not seem to pay attention to my language and manners which resemble (involuntarily) to the languages and manners of my people. At Toronto I met several persons who did not know what to do to help the Missions. We are all Canadians, so all brothers, of course this is what we should be. To all my most sincere thanks.\n\nFrom Winnipeg to Le Pas, as I went to see His Excellency Bishop Lajeunesse, I met several Fathers. Time flew in such company. I stopped at Saskatoon, at St. Paul's Hospital where I met the good Sister Buckley and Sister Vincent, the Superior. They have been so kind to me that I have no words to express my gratitude. I also went to the Academy of Sion. I saw the Superior and the pupils. I also met there a Canadian, a well cultivated person. At St. George-de-Beauce. From North Battleford to Meadow-Lake we took a whole day to travel one hundred miles. This remembered me my dogs sleds. As the Oblates are found everywhere I was well received by them everywhere.\n\nOn Wednesday morning I took the truck for Ile-a-la-Crosse. We had a few incidents. We had to shovel the snow once in a while to avoid trucks left along the road. I had my dinner with Brother Berne-Rolland at Green Lake. Finally I was at Ile-a-la-Crosse at two o'clock the next morning. When there is a will there is a way... we finally arrived here. I think it would be wiser to stop now even if I have some more to say because if I wait to continue at Chagona I do not know when I could finish it. I am persuaded that I will not have peace for a while there, and I wish to thank you you have been so kind to me.\n\nMy sincere thanks to all the Parish Priest and their Vicars who have been so kind to me in all ways. Thanks also to you all dear parents, benefactors, benefactresses. To you all I desire to express my most heartfelt wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. During the solemn moment of Mass, every morning I pray God to bestow on you His most Precious Blessings. May the Almighty give you strength to bear the heavy burden of sufferings of the present life.\n\nThanks to you all.\n\nYour grateful missionary in Our Lord and Mary Immaculate\n\nL. Morand omi\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nsent that freight by truck. The driver had a steam plough at the front of his truck to plough the snow. The snow was so thick that no truck could pass without ploughing the snow. There was a bad crack in the lake, on account of the thickness of the snow, it was dark too. The driver could not see if there was a crack or not. Then, when they arrived there, the truck sunk in the water. Fortunately only the back wheels and the load went down. The two front wheels and the cab stood on the ice. If it had not been that, the driver, the police and a boy, would have lost their lives. They could have been drowned.\n\nThen they walked half way; it was about eight miles from here. The day after, the driver with some Indians, went with dog team to pick the freight. All men fully recovered. Had a case of books. They all spoiled by the water and the ice. My sleeping bed, is full of water, who converted immediately into a block of ice. Bought a hundred loaves of bread. Half of them. That freight stay pretty near of a week on the lake, it is today the day before yesterday, that the freight was brought this freight with horse teams. If you had seen the mail, all the newspapers were stuck all together, frozen and frozen.\n\nAnd, now, share to go and to visit my dear. They leave sixty mile from my mission of Shagoma. Dear sir, pray you to excuse this letter. Share no body to help me, to put it in a suitable English.\n\nPray you to present my respect to dear house. I will write to him, pretty soon. I am all alone, I had let go do for the Christmas feast, this afternoon, dinner with a half beef, to look for a dish of meat, in the bush.\n\nThank you, dear sir, for your kindness toward me.\n\nS. Morrell\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-5, part 7)\nDear parents benefactors and friends,\n\nI am back again, at my mission of Chagona.\n\nIt is to relate you how I reach my mission, that I write to you this present letter.\n\nI assure you, that I started to come here, without expecting at all. I was not quite rest from the fatigues of the journey, between Fondow Lake and Islo & La Grosse.\n\nI traveled hundred and fifty miles by truck. Some places the wheels of our truck were sunk in the banks of snow. Then we took the shovels and remove the snow. Place by place we see some broken trucks a side of the road. They left one just on the middle of the road we had quite a job to pass beside. A terrible blizzard passed in the north, about the middle of the month of November. Since that storm, some trucks had past, and had crush the snow, but it was still bad when we past our selves. Finally, we arrived at Islo & La Grosse, at two o'clock in the morning. I thought at first, that I could reach my Chagona's mission by truck. The doctor was supposed to go himself, by truck. I made my plans to start with him. But at the last moment, he send me a little note, telling me, that we had to renounce to go to Chagona, by truck, because the snow was too heavy. Then, I was resigned to wait until the next Monday, and to hire a man with his sleigh and a team of horses. If we could find any, who would be willing to come. Mean while, I decided to write you a printed letter, to each one of you; with the aid of Fathers Remy and Chaput. We just began to print it. Behold, the doctor enter in the house, like a gust of wind, and yelling: Father Morand, be in a hurry, we start for Chagona, by aeroplane, on five minutes. The arms pretty near, have fallen no down, like we say in French. He took me unaware, the doctor. I all ready renounced to start. All the supplies, that I brought from Fondow Lake, I had to leave them behind me.\nI had no friend nor host at Chicoutimi; I would not be very anxious to begin to take back immediately; in arriving, But it was difficult, to let pass a so good chance, to reach my mission rapidly. To leave the letter, not even outlining, and I begin to pick my baggage... All was well, on the floor, a true bazaar. Father Remy and Chaput give me a help. I carry with me the most needful things. Father Remy assured me to send the rest by the first chance. I tell a last \"Bonjour\" to my dear Confreres, and we fly towards Chicoutimi. After half an hour of flight, I perceive from the air, the chapel, my house, the shocks of the Indians. No body was at the landing to meet me. I arrive at my house, I unbar the door, I light the fire in the stove, go to the lake, with my kettles to get water. I re-began my life of solitude, of and hermit, my life of \"Bachelor\". I tell you, I was obliged like we say in French to take my courage with my both hands. To not let me go to the discouragement. My house was not quite warm, that the Montagnais and Montagnaises, arrive to shake hands to me, and says: \"Sotrain shu horinlo\". It means to say: that they found the time long, since I left the mission.\n\nDear parents, I think to you often. I remember often what kindnesses you had for me. I visit you almost every day, with my mind and my heart. I pray for you every day, the Good God, that He spread on each one of you, His most copious blessings. I wish to you all a merry Christmas, and a Good and Happy New Year; and the Paradise at the end of your days.\n\nI am your Grateful missionary in our Lord and Mary Immaculate.\n\nLouis L\u00e9onard\n\n---\n\n26 Dec.\n\nDear Sir, I am back, when I think what I asked to you, a rug for my Church.

He requests the Department provide half of this amount, or $2500.00, which would provide the materials needed, and the Bishop himself will provide the other half, covering the cost of the labour and any material that could not be purchased from the amount allowed by the Department.\n\nI feel you will agree with me that it is most important to have proper housing accommodation for the Principal and male staff at the Cross Lake School and I feel that the Bishop's request is a very reasonable one. He is prepared to arrange purchase of the material at the lowest cost and forward to the Department receipted accounts for the amount of $2500.00. I trust that your Branch will find it possible to provide the funds immediately for the purpose mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, September 20, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL.\n\nRe: Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI am sending forward herewith a letter received from the Reverend Father J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., the subject matter of which, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nThe records indicate that the Cross Lake Residential School was totally destroyed by fire in the year 1930 and rebuilt during the fiscal year 1938-39. It would appear, however, that no provision has been made at any time for the construction of a residence suitable for the principal and the male members of the staff.\n\nThe desirability of providing additional accommodation for the principal of the school and for the pupils in attendance at Cross Lake was discussed very fully with me by Dr. Corrigan when he visited this Branch a few weeks ago. In this connection may I refer you to a letter received from Dr. A. Corrigan, dated July 6, 1943 - File 123-1-1A. The Cross Lake School had at this date an authorized enrolment of 130, for which per capita grants were paid at the rate of $175.00. Dr. Corrigan was emphatic in his belief, however, that this enrolment should be substantially reduced. In response to the representations made to us by Dr. Corrigan at that time, the enrolment at the school was reduced from 100 to 60 pupils - see letter to Bishop Lajeunesse, dated July 13, 1943. Dr. Corrigan described the residence now occupied by the principal and certain male members of the staff as a dilapidated, insanitary shack. He pointed out\nthat inasmuch as no provision could be made for the accommodation of the principal in the school building itself, a principal's residence and one sufficiently large to accommodate all male members of the staff should be built by the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nWhile no provision has been made in the estimates of this year for the construction of such a building, it is just possible that should it be deemed advisable to proceed with the establishment of a principal's residence, funds might be secured by the transfer of the amount of $500.00 from the amount voted for the construction of schools and teachers' residences at the Shubenacadie and Eskasoni reserves in Nova Scotia.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nSince writing to you on September 15th last, I received another letter from His Excellency Bishop Lajeunesse concerning the proposed residence for the Principal of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThis letter was written after receiving from Reverend Father Trudeau, the Principal of Gross Lake, further information regarding the approximate cost of this new residence. As a consequence, Bishop Lajeunesse informs me, and he wishes that the information be conveyed to the Department, that it will be impossible to erect a proper home and residence for the male staff of Cross Lake, for less than $7,000. Materials have increased so much in price, and labour, at least such as will have to be imported from Winnipeg, will cost in most cases twice what it would have before the war.\n\nWhilst it is the Bishop's desire that most of the work be done by local mechanics, the electrical installation, the heating plant, the plastering, all items which must be figured at Winnipeg City prices, plus transportation, both ways, and even the payment of wages whilst the mechanics are travelling.\n\nIn view of the above, I am advised to ask for the sum of $3,500.\n\nIf you have not as yet written your memorandum to the Minister's office, I hope that you will enclose the above amount instead of that which I mentioned in my letter of September 15th last.\n\nThanking you in advance for your sympathetic consideration of this request, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Plourde, O.M.I.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nRe: Cross Lake Residential School.\n\nMr. Hoey has submitted to me two memoranda dealing with the above noted, dated September 20 and September 24, respectively. These memoranda I am enclosing with copies of relevant correspondence from Father Plourde.\n\nIn forwarding you this information with Father Plourde's request I regret that I cannot recommend that this proposal be given favourable consideration at this time.\n\nOur past experience of undertakings under arrangements similar to those proposed in this case has taught us that such schemes rarely turn out satisfactorily. Usually the cost exceeds the original estimate. Examples may be cited in the Berens River building, the Cross Lake school itself, the Sandy Bay school and the Kenora school.\n\nEven if the methods suggested were acceptable I would still feel that a number of projects in connection with schools and other departmental buildings should receive first consideration. In the Schools Division there are a number of buildings urgently required and which should be proceeded with as soon as money, labour and material are available. Among these I shall cite only a few: day schools in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia; the replacement of the Caughnawaga senior school which was destroyed by fire nearly two years ago; the Caughnawaga teachers' residence; the replacement of the classroom building at File Hills and also at Alberni which were completely destroyed by fire.\n\nThe best example to illustrate the point under discussion is one affecting the Cross Lake Reserve itself. The day school on this reserve under the auspices of the United Church was burned a year ago and has not yet been replaced.\n\nEnclosures.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS | LIST PRICE | GROSS EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | TOTAL |\n|----------|----------------------|------------|-----------------|----------|-------|\n| 1        | only Cylinder Lining #4018 for Fairbanks-Morse Diesel Engine Model SS A 4\u00bd | 21.00 | net | 21.00 |\n|          | No. 10 R.P. serial number will be supplied by Indian Affairs Branch | 36.00 | net | 36.00 |\n|          | sets seal rings for above | 36.00 | net | 36.00 |\n|          | Transportation charges as per receipted express voucher 1.11 | 1.11 | | 1.11 |\n|          | Total | | | | 22.67 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

As I have not received any answer to my telegram I discuss the matter with Right Reverend Bishop Lajeunesse and we decided to buy them before receiving the authorization from you as it is urgent. The high pressure boiler is needed every week in the school for the washing. Also there is only one train a week to Wabowden which is the closest railway station from the school and a longer delay would put us in a critical condition at the school.\n\nWe had to order a complete set (75 tubes) as when they start to leak they have to be renewed entirely.\n\nSo I do hope that the Dept. will agree to pay this extra expense.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

However, the end of the fiscal year is approaching, and if the building has either been erected or is in course of erection, there is no doubt that you have expended a considerable amount. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would forward receipted accounts for material or receipted labour returns, accompanied by a statement, in order that payment of the amount promised by the Department can be made before March 31, 1945.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

Indian residential School, and spent a full half day in each of the three class rooms.\n\nIn the Junior class room, where the Grade 1 and 'Beginners' pupils were, there were 32 pupils present - 17-boys and 15-girls. The work of these pupils was very creditable. Their reading aloud was quite good; also simple arithmetic on the blackboard, and spelling. Their book work too was good. All these pupils were clean and well clothed, and the discipline was very good. The teacher was keenly interested in her work. All the class room furniture of every kind was in excellent condition. The register was marked up to date.\n\nIn the boys room there were four grades being taught - grades 2, 3, 4, and 5. There were 30 boys present, all clean and well clothed and tidy in every respect. The work of these boys was very good in every way; reading, spelling, book work, and blackboard work. The discipline was very good, and the teacher well qualified for her work and showing great interest in it. The class room and all its furnishings were in excellent condition. The register was marked up to date.\n\nIn the girls room, there were pupils in six grades, from grade 2 to grade 7 inclusive, there being a total of 34 girls present. All these girls were doing very good work and showing interest. Their book work was especially good being neat, clean, and accurate generally. The discipline was very good, and the teacher very interested and keen about her work. The register was marked up to date. The class room and furnishings were all in excellent condition, and all the pupils clean and well clothed.\n\nThere was a total of 96 pupils in residence in the school, and all 96 were in the class rooms, none being absent on account of sickness or any other cause.\n\nThe dormitories, dining rooms, kitchen, laundry, and all other departments of this school are kept in spotless condition. The high pressure steam boiler was not in operation as the flues had worn out, and a new set had been ordered from Winnipeg. The electric light and power plant at this school is entirely dependent upon one single 10 H.P. Diesel engine, and if for any reason this engine broke down considerable trouble would ensue. I asked to see what repair parts they had on hand for emergency, and found that there was practically nothing in this line. I therefore asked the Principal and the engineer to make up a list of repair parts immediately, which they did. This list is being forwarded to the Department in the form of a requisition, with a separate covering letter.\n\nP.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This tank is to be fitted with coils as shown at the bottom of the same catalogue page, and provided with a manhole. There should be four coil pipes, galvanized, size 1 1/4 inch.\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from letter from Mr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, 538 Dominion Public\nBuilding, Winnipeg, Man., dated August 17, 1945.\n\nOriginal on 123-7-1\n\nCross Lake Indian Boarding School:\n\nThis school is situated in an isolated area and the Rev. Father is greatly concerned, and rightly so, about his one engine and generator. If the engine should fail at any time the school would be without light or water - in fact, it could not continue to operate. I think a second unit should be installed. There is plenty of room, consequently no additional expenses will be required for building purposes. The total cost would be for the engine, generator and wages for someone to see that it is properly installed. I think the Department should give this request serious consideration. If the school were close to a railroad I would not make the recommendation; but a bad break in equipment at this isolated point would be serious and perhaps repairs could not be secured for weeks. There are often weeks when communication to the outside is impossible and this is especially bad at freeze-up and again in the spring during break-up.\n\nThe hot water tank which hangs by the furnace also must be renewed. I understand Mr. Lazenby has the particulars and is submitting the necessary requisition. This should be ordered and sent forward at once.\nOttawa, 31st August, 1945.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe desire to refer to your letter dated\n17th August with reference to the Cross Lake Indian\nResidential School.\n\nRegarding the hot water tank, an order\nwas placed with the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works on\nAugust 1st but I do not know whether it has been shipped\nas yet. You can make inquiries and ascertain this.\n\nWe have also received the attached\nrequisition for certain parts for the maintenance of the\nwater service. Please purchase these and ship them to\nthe school.\n\nI wish you would make inquiries and let\nme know regarding the type and size of engine which you\nrecommend to be supplied. A catalogue number or some\nother definite description should be given to assist our\nPurchasing Branch. If a suitable engine is available in\nWinnipeg, you should let me know stating the name of the\nfirm and price at which it could be supplied. I am\ndoubtful if we could get one to the school by this fall.\nHowever, if you are successful in locating one in Winnipeg,\nI may be able to have the purchase of it approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED\n\n576 Wall Street,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nSeptember 8th, 1945.\n\nA.G.

I am advised that more information is required. Two messages have been sent; but the Company has received no reply. They have also written but the letter probably has not reached Cross Lake. I am today sending the following message:\n\n\"What steam pressure is used in coil of required tank. Urgent.\"\n\nThe parts required have been ordered and should go forward on Monday's boat.\n\nThe engine required I understand is a 10 H.P. Single Cylinder Diesel, at least Fairbanks-Morse state this is the type they installed some six years ago. At present they have no engines and I enclose a letter from Mumford Medland stating the same. I understand a 10 H.P. engine will cost between $800.00 and $900.00 and a 14 H.P. will cost from $1000.00 to $1200.00.\n\nA new engine should be provided as soon as one is available.

Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am in receipt today, of a letter from Reverend Father G.E. Trudeau, O.M.I., Principal of the above school, regarding the necessity of the purchase of an auxiliary lighting plant.\n\nCross Lake is about 450 miles North of Winnipeg and can only be reached in the summer time when the boats are running. For at least eight months of the year, the place is inaccessible. The school being modern, the heating plant is partly operated by electricity, as there is a motor for pumping returns to the boiler and in case of a breakdown of the electrical plant, there would be no way of operating the heating plant with the consequence that everything in the school would freeze. The damage thus caused, would be so severe that everything must be done to prevent it.\n\nI am informed that all the inspectors and agents that have visited the school, have commented adversely on this situation and have, at various times, requested your Department to supply an auxiliary electrical plant. Whilst the War was on, it was possibly difficult to purchase this plant but now that we are at peace with the wide world, such a plant should be secured immediately and installed during the coming summer months.\n\nThe batteries used in connection with\n\n2.....\ntheir plant are described as follows:\n\n1 set of 56 (Volts) Batteries Type GD Capacity 200A.H.\nGlobelight Power Batteries Ser. No. 7656.\n\nWhen Mr. Morris visited this school, he recommended that the attic of the school be finished with Tentest and used for the purpose and training both the boys and girls, in the various activities of the school and he told the Principal to get a price on the cost of the material and labour. Mr. P. Desrosiers, St-Boniface contractor, has estimated the work and material to be worth $1200.00 and Father Trudeau kindly requests that this be provided for, in next year's estimates.\n\nThe following quantities of paint are also required for the coming year:\n\n- 10 gal. Red Concrete floor Paint\n- 10 gal. Tile Green Concrete floor Paint\n- 10 gal. Italian Grey Concrete floor Paint\n- 10 gal. Fenetrem (Mixoil Clear)\n- 10 gal. Clear Gloss Varnish\n- 10 gal. Boiled Linseed Oil\n- 100 lbs. Decorator White Lead.\n\nThe batteries for the present electrical plant were bought in 1938 and should be replaced during the coming summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 26th December, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the request of the Principal of the Cross Lake R.C. School for the purchase of an auxiliary lighting plant. We have already given considerable consideration to this request but we were informed by Inspector Hamilton in a letter dated 13th September that Mumford Medland had no diesel engines in stock and did not expect to receive any until the Spring of 1946.\n\nI wrote to Inspector Hamilton again on 19th instant requesting him to interview Mumford Medland a second time and ascertain if there is any probability of the diesel engines arriving in Canada earlier than next Spring. As soon as I hear from him I will let you know.\n\nI have noted the request for supplying next year a new set of batteries and 160 gallons of paint. These requests will receive consideration.\n\nI will be pleased to discuss with you at some future date the request for an expenditure of $1,200.00 to finish the attic.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J.O.

Your letter refers to a second-hand engine, which was not anticipated. However, Mr. Medland states these, too, are not available and he has no idea if or when one could be obtained.\n\nIt is my opinion that for such a remote area only a new 14 H.P. Diesel should be purchased.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nSt. Joseph's Indian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Man.\nDec. 18th 1945\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you please present and back of your authority our petition to the Department of Indian Affairs for the following items which we urgently need for the good working of our School.\n\n1. One \"Economy Oven\", Pat'd, Trade Mark Reg'd No 3 - Serial 1066' 3' X 4', of the Jean Daoust Co. of St-Boniface, Man.\n\nThis Baking Oven would be needed to add to the one similar actually in use and which is not large enough for the quantity of bread consumed daily.\n\n2. Two (2) \"Tailor's Singer Sewing Machines\"\n   No 31 K 15 - EC503742\n\nWe actually have a few ordinary Sewing Machines good for light and fancy materials, but we would badly need a couple of strong machines for sewing heavy garments, such as boys' overalls, coats, etc.\n\nYour kind and early attention to this request would be greatly appreciated.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have just returned from Cross Lake where I spent a week. I inspected the St Joseph's R.C. Residential School and was greatly impressed by the work that is being done in this institution. I inspected both the school and the building.\n\nThe oven for baking bread, which they have at present is too small and out of proportion to the capacity of the mixer. Father Trudeau requested that I try and obtain, for him another oven, i.e.; Economy Oven patented trade mark registered No 3-Serial 1066 -5' by 4' of the Jean Daoust Co of St Boniface, Man.\n\nI strongly recommend that this request be granted as I believe it would be a saving of labor and fuel and would be productive of better bread.\n\nAlso the Sister Superior told me that at one time they had been promised a Taylor Sewing Machine but owing to the war it had been un procurable. This machine is badly needed for work on heavy cloth etc.\n\nI strongly recommend that two such machines be granted if it is at all possible. The two machines requested are Taylor's Singer Sewing Machines #31 K 15 -E050742. I also enclose a request from the Reverend G.E. Trudeau, C.M.I., Principal.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Joseph's Indian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Man.\nDec. 18th 1945\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nCould you possibly obtain for our School a good piano.\n\nOf course, we understand that this is an unusual petition, but we feel that a piano is a necessary instrument in a school, not only for the recreational purpose of the pupils, but also for their educational welfare.\n\nThe kind interest and sympathy you have shown our little Indian people give us the hope that you'll take our request in consideration and oblige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept' of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI recently spent a week on the Cross Lake Reservation. I visited homes on the Reservation, gave pep talks to the President of the women's home-makers clubs and inspected both Schools, which are both doing very well.\n\nI stayed at the R.C. St Joseph's Residential School and was very impressed with the excellent work that is being done here. I attended their Christmas concert and noticed that they have considerable musical talent, both on the staff and among the pupils. The only instrument they have for teaching music is an ancient piano which is hideously out of tune. I understand from Father Trudeau that it is impossible to tune it, as the pegs which hold the wires are worn in their sockets and slip and lose tension. I strongly recommend that for the good of the work being done, that they be provided with a new instrument.\n\nThere is in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, a firm which manufactures a species of piano known as a 'Dulcitone'. It has all the attributes of a piano but instead of wires which need constant tuning, tuning forks are used. This instrument is compact, light, and easily portable and never requires tuning. It was built especially for the tropics. It seems to me that it is the ideal instrument for Northern isolated schools like Cross Lake. The cost as I remember it, was in the neighborhood of about $300.00 but I am not sure. You may be able to ascertain the name of the firm through a trade commissioner. In the meantime I have written to the London Daily Mail-England, who used to carry the advertisement for this instrument in their overseas edition and it is some years since I have seen it.\n\nE.B.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n588 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nReference: 301/1.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to our telephone conversation during\nthe Christmas Season in connection with LISTER engines and\nequipment.\n\nWe have approximately forty-eight small Vertical\n4-cycle LISTER engines on order, and we are expecting shipment\nof some of these to be made within three or four months.\nHowever, the promises that have been made us since the cessation\nof hostilities are incorrect. Shipment of the engines we have\non order was promised before the end of the year. In other words\nit is impossible for us to definitely promise shipment of British-\nmade engines at this time.\n\nIf your Department could make arrangements with the\nPriorities Division to follow an order through, we might arrange\nfor shipment in two or three months. This was done by the\nDepartment of Natural Resources, Ottawa, and we are expecting shipment\nof an engine for them next month.\n\nWe regret these conditions, but there is little\nwe can do about it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED\n\n\"C.R. Medland\"\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nA two weeks absence has prevented me to answer sooner to your letter of December the 27th.\n\nThe paint and the batteries could be sent in the winter time to our nearest C.M.R. Station, which is Nakowden, Manitoba, but the freight would be quite expensive. It would cost at least $3.00 more per hundred lbs than in the summer time. However I wish the paint could be shipped before the first of March as we would need it in the last part of May. As for the batteries as they are very heavy and also and also as our winter road between Cross Lake and Wasowden is bad there is a great possibility that they might suffer some damage before reaching Cross Lake. Considering these facts, I would suggest, if there is funds in the current year's appropriation, that they should be bought and paid and delivered only in the first week of June to the Selkirk Navigation Co. which makes our summer freight. By sending them in the summer time by waterways you would at least save $75.00 just for the freight.\n\nIf you send the Paint will you please send also:\n\n1 doz.

State whether load is continuous or intermittent.\n\nAIR CLEANERS\u2014Engines to be operated under Dusty or Gritty conditions should always be fitted with efficient Air Cleaning equipment. A Lister Air Cleaner is suitable for average dirty conditions, or an Air Cleaner of the Vortox type for more severe conditions where abrasive dust is present. Please see separate page on this subject and state requirements when ordering.\n\nGENERAL CONDITIONS\u2014The following allowances should be made when estimating nett H.P. required.\n\nALTITUDE\u2014A reduction of 4% per 1,000 ft. above 330 ft. above sea level.\n\nTEMPERATURE\u2014A reduction of 1% for every 5\u00baF over 65\u00baF.\n\nINSTALLATION\u2014Particulars of Engine mounting and type of Drive should be stated wherever possible. When a special Exhaust pipe layout is to be used please consult us and give us as much information as possible.\nDESCRIPTION OF ENGINE\n\nTHE ENGINE is provided with a specially designed Combustion Head incorporating the \"Lister Patent Combustion Chamber,\" which ensures a positive start from cold by hand without need of Cartridge, Heating Lamp or Electric ignition. A variable compression ratio initially ensures easy starting and subsequent running at low maximum pressures.\n\nTHE CYLINDER LINER is treated with the process of chrome hardening (Van der Horst Patents) which has been proved to give the greatest wear resisting surface yet known, whether the wear may be due to heat, chemical action or abrasion from the piston rings; thus giving a greatly lengthened life throughout which the engine retains its ease of starting, fuel and lubricating oil consumption, and develops rated power.\n\nTHE PISTONS AND RINGS are of high grade material, and finished to an accuracy equal to that employed in the finest motor car engines, long life and full compression are thus assured.\n\nTHE CRANKCASE is totally enclosed and dust proof, making the engine especially suitable for work in dusty and gritty surroundings.\n\nTHE CRANKSHAFT is made from high grade steel, accurately machined and finished by grinding to an accuracy of half of one thousandth of an inch.\n\nTHE CAMS, CAMSHAFT AND ROCKERS are of high grade steel, accurately machined. The working parts hardened and finished by grinding.\n\nTHE CONNECTING ROD is a Steel forging with renewable Phosphor Bronze Bush at small end, and the large end Bearing is bronze shell white metal lined.\n\nTHE BEARINGS for Crankshaft are of ample size to provide maximum durability.\n\nTHE VALVES are of the finest alloy heat resisting steel, and the valve seatings are efficiently water cooled for increased life.\n\nFUEL PUMP & FUEL INJECTOR C.A.V. Bosch Fuel Pumps and suitable Fuel Injectors are fitted.\n\nGOVERNOR is of the centrifugal type and operates on the fuel injection pump, varying the quantity of fuel injected in accordance with the load.\n\nLUBRICATION is automatic. Main Camshaft and Fuel Pump drive gear bearings are fed by pump. Splash and Oil mist from Big End lubricates all other parts.\n\nGENERAL EQUIPMENT Tank or radiator to suit requirements. Exhaust Silencer, Air Silencer, Fuel Tank and piping, Starting Handle, Set of Tools and Funnel with Strainer where necessary. Tank Cooled Engines ordered without Water Cooling Tanks are supplied with water connections unless contrary instructions are given. Where Radiator cooling is supplied an allowance of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) h.p. should be made for fan.\n\n| TYPE OF ENGINE | Nett Wgt. lbs. | Gross Wgt. kgs. | Volume cu. ft. | Code Word |\n|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|\n| 15 h.p.

Neary\n\nRe: St Joseph's Residential School-Cross Lake, Man.\n\nI was at this school last week and while there the Sister Superior asked me if anything was being done about the new oven and the TaylorSinger Sewing machines which were requested for the school by me in a letter to the Department d/22 Dec 1945 under file 1-A. I told the Sister Superior that I had never received a reply to my request but told her that I would write again. The sewing machines requested are 2 in number as follows: Taylor's Singer Sewing Machine 3LK15-EC5037h2. These machines are needed to cope with the heavy ex-service materials when it is converted to garments suitable for the children. With regard to the oven I obtained the following data:- The one requested is Economy Oven #3 Serial 1066, the manufacturer Jean J. Daoust & Co, St Boniface, Manitoba. The present oven is inadequate to the needs of the school. There are in all, 125 bodies to feed, six sacks of flour are used per week which produces 600 loaves of bread. The present oven can only bake 50 loaves at one time. At the time of writing you previously, I also enclosed a letter from the Principal the Reverend G.E. Trudeau, OMI, which was d/December 18 1945.\n\nE.B.

Phelan.\nRe: Repairs to Kitchen Sinks for the Grass Lake Guy, Beauval and Duck Lake Indian Residential Schools.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nDuring the course of my summer visits to the above schools I noticed that all kitchen sinks were in bad condition and should be repaired as soon as possible. Monel Metal or Stainless Steel are the most economical metals to use for such work.\n\nThe J.R. Douglas Company Limited, 262 Slater Street, Ottawa, have both Stainless Steel and Monel Metal sheets for sale and can supply them on request. According to gage, the price varies from one dollar and twenty-five to one seventy-five per square foot. I figure that four sheets of either metal would be sufficient for making these repairs in each of the above schools. It would therefore be very much appreciated if you would place an order for either metal immediately with the Douglas Company. I may add that I could not find Stainless Steel or Monel Metal in either Edmonton, Regina or Winnipeg; that is why I am giving you the name of the J.R. Douglas Company Limited.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

As Mr. Waite is not at Norway House and having seen him only once in August I cannot tell you if he had any quotation from Servel.\n\nWhen Mr. Waite was here for paying treaty in June I made the requisition for a Kerosene Refrigerator and I had told him that our electric plan would not be strong enough to carry extra load as we were already using more electricity than we could produce. I told Mr. Waite that we needed a big kerosene refrigerator as those they use in restaurants and I doubt that one of 7 cubic feet would meet our needs. It would take at least an 8 cubic feet one or even larger one but not an electric one.\n\nAs the navigation season will be closed in two or three weeks I am afraid that it could not be sent by boat but would have to be sent by Railrod Freight Via Wabowden, Manitoba and we could bring it to the school by tractor in December.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.E.

G. E. Trudeau, O.M.I., Principal of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School, Cross Lake, Manitoba, requesting the purchase of a 3\" roller tube expander.\n\nThis request was initiated by a Provincial Boiler Inspection on September 7, 1949, which report read as follows:\n\n\"The tubes in this boiler are leaking; it is necessary that the tubes be rolled to prevent further corrosion of this boiler. Tube size 3\".\"\n\nRegional Supervisor Davis authorized the purchase of a tube expander from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company at an approximate cost of $18.00 and trusts that his action will meet with Departmental approval.\n\nJ.S.

Davis,\nSupervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nYour file 123/6-1-577\n\nDear Mr. Davis:\n\nYour letter of October the 3rd was received only on the 23rd of October just two days before freeze up here.\n\nThe work on the leaking boiler could be done by our Engineer, Brother Menard, if we had the necessary tools to roll these 3 inch tubes. We have one roller for 2\u00bd inch tubes and the engineer has tried to roll the tubes with it but could not succeed. So if you could not send a man to fix this boiler send us one roller instrument for three inch tubes and our engineer could probably do the work at little extra cost.\n\nOur Engineer, Brother Menard, is leaving for Montreal to see his mother dangerously ill and if he has not time to call at your office on his way to Montreal, he will do it on his return and will discuss the matter fully with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Folster and from the latter to the Reverend Fathers Oblate of Mary Immaculate, I have the honour to inform you that until a survey of the lot which you apply for on behalf of the Reverend Oblate Fathers of Mary Immaculate has been made in the regular way no patent therefor can be issued, nor is the Department in a position at present to give you any assurance that the application of the Oblate Fathers will be granted, as the evidence submitted in support thereof does not appear to be sufficient to warrant such a grant being made. In any event the authority of the Governor in Council would first have to be obtained.\n\nIn order to establish the claim in question evidence should be submitted to the Department in the form of a statutory declaration made by some person cognizant of all the facts and corroborated by two or more witnesses, setting out therein that the original claimant, Charles Creight, was in actual and peaceable possession of the land in question at the time Indian Treaty No. 5 was concluded in September, 1872.\n\nHis Lordship\nBishop Charlebois,\nThe Pas, N.W.T.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is situated about \u00bc of a mile south from the Hudson's Bay Company's Post on the Nelson river, on a piece of land that was supposedly owned by a Treaty Indian of the name of Amos Colon \u00a7496 of Norway House Band.\n\nThis land of course belongs to the Crown, as Colon is a treaty man, and has no squatter's rights on land outside of the Reserve. But I will wait till Father Lecocq comes back from Winnipeg, when I can discuss with him in full the proposed site of their new boarding school, and inform him of the Government's probable decision of erecting this building themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 3, 1913.\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nOttawa, March 4, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the recent telegram sent you yesterday I beg to say that, as plans and specifications for the proposed Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House are under preparation and as it is desired to proceed with building operations, if possible, next summer, the matter of site must be decided upon without delay.\n\nIn the first place the Church was to assume the cost of building and the securing of the site, of course, rested with them. Now the Department has undertaken the obligation and before work can be commenced the question of site, title of which must rest in the Crown, arises. A site on the reserve somewhat near the present Roman Catholic property, if the band in council would give consent, would obviate all difficulties. If this is not possible other steps will have to be taken. The Roman Catholic Church some time ago applied for a patent for lot 6, not far from the Hudson Bay Co.'s post and formerly owned by Charles Creight. Copies of all correspondence in connection therewith are enclosed, as well as a blue print showing the location of the lot; also blue print of the reserve as constituted now, showing position of the Roman Catholic mission property on Fort Island. It should be possible to obtain and transmit here the information asked for by the Interior Department, as called for in letter of May 6, 1912, addressed to J. R. Bunn, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nBishop\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nBishop Charlebois; patent could then issue to the church and ownership be transferred to this Department.\n\nIf, on the other hand, this cannot be done an unclaimed site might be chosen and this Department would then ask the Interior Department to set it aside for Indian school purposes. In the event of the last mentioned suggestion being acted upon, the site should be, if possible, on the steamboat channel or otherwise readily accessible, should be high and dry and easily drained, and contain a sufficient area for the needs of the school. You should show the location on the plan herewith and indicate the frontage and area. As you will see from the correspondence the Interior Department will be making surveys in the near future and this work could be done at the same time.\n\nYou will recognize the importance of immediate action and it is for this reason that the Department is placing the matter in your hands to be dealt with while you are at Norway House. It will be necessary to consult Father Lecoq and obtain from him on behalf of the Roman Catholic church his written acquiescence in whatever action is decided upon. Kindly, therefore, consult with him before leaving Winnipeg.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nOttawa, March 11, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department contemplates the erection of two boarding school buildings at Norway House during the coming summer, one is to be situated on the Indian Reserve, but the site for the second school, which will be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic church, has not yet been definitely decided upon.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a blue print of the plan of the Norway House Indian Reserve and adjacent territory, upon which has been marked in red ink a site south of the lot on Fort Island now occupied by the Hudson Bay Company upon which the missionary at that point would like to see the new school erected. An officer of this Department is leaving in a few days for Norway House and a definite report from him will be received in the near future. Pending the receipt of this report this Department would like you to be good enough to reserve for school purposes the lot in question, which has twenty chains frontage on the river. It is thought advisable to take this action now in order that no other applications may be entertained by your Department and as soon as our Inspector's report is received we will again communicate with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge your telegram of the 3rd instant as follows.\n\n\"Roman Catholic School Norway House must be erected on land title of which is vested in the Crown, at present some difficulty regarding deed of proposed site location should be decided soon and Department wishes you to make final selection, consult Father Lecoeur St Boniface, and wait information in writing before leaving Winnipeg.\"\n\nThe above wire was received by me at 9.30 A.M. on the 4th inst.\n\nI have seen Father Lecoeur pending receipt of information we are to meet again about this matter; in the meantime I have wired as follows.\n\n\"A map showing present boundaries of Indian Reserve at Norway House is required to accompany information that is being sent as advised your wire of the third inst.\n\nI shall want this to be fully in touch with situation.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\"\nSir,\n\nAs the Revd Father Lecq will probably be away to Winnipeg for an indefinite time, I had an interview with the Revd Father Thomas, who is his assistant, in connection with the site of the new R.C. Boarding School.\n\nRevd Father Thomas and myself discussed the site of the new school fully. In his statement to me he said that the site chosen was about \u00bd of a mile south of the Hudson's Bay Trading Post on the Nelson River.\n\nAfter making careful investigations as to a site for their new Boarding school along the Jack River and the Nelson River, they finally selected this place as being a good site. The principal objection they had to Jack river was rock, and as the river is very grassy it makes it impossible to use a Tug steamer in connection with their school. This Tug steam-boat which they are about to build is to be used in the transportation of the building material for their school and also for freighting the yearly supplies afterwards.\n\nThe site chosen was selected on account of there being no rock to contend with in the making of the Basement for the school and mostly on account of the splendid sewage facilities and the laying of a pipe to the river for clean water for the use of the school. There is also a quantity of good land for a large garden which they contemplate using, so as to give the pupils instructions in gardening and the raising of all kinds of vegetables, which ought to be very useful to the pupils in future.\n\nI don't think that a better site could have been chosen, as it is in the direct way of travel from all parts of the Agency, and principally for the drainage.\ndrainage.\n\nand sewerage which is of the best, as the river has a good current, and will naturally carry off all sewerage filth from the vicinity of those living between the school and the little Play-Green Lake. I have marked the place chosen for a site on the map by a X in black ink as carefully as I could.\n\nOn the property chosen, an Indian of the name of Amos Colon was living, and the Revd Father Lecoq paid him for all rights and improvements he had. This land belongs to the Crown, and Father Thomas says that they have no wish to own the land, but would like that they be refunded the money paid to this man in order to secure this site. The amount paid was $150.00.\n\nAmos Colon is a Treaty man and had no rights to the land, as he should have been on the reserve, but I understand that this place has been in his family for a long time, and he has lived for a number of years on this place, so I think the amount paid him was a just payment as he will have to remove his house to the Reserve now.\n\nRespectfully submitting this report on the site of the new R.C.-Indian Boarding School at Norway House.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Ontario, March 17, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant reporting on the accommodations provided at the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House. This report corroborates the information given by Rev. Father Lecocq based upon which action was taken as outlined to you in the letter of the 27th ultimo. The Department is pleased to note the very satisfactory conditions existing at this school as gathered from your report which gives matters very thoroughly.

Stewart, on the 29th March 1913 several sites were visited, one was finally chosen as being the one that would most nearly meet the requirements, the location of the site selected has been carefully marked on the Blue-print Map received by me from the Department, this marked map is returned attached to this report; the site chosen and marked on the map is initialed by the Reverend Father Lecoeq; the frontage is on the Steam-boat channel, and is indicated as being approximately 25 chains wide, the area is 100 acres more or less.\nThe site chosen is an unclaimed site, so that the Department of Indian Affairs will have to ask the Department of the Interior to set this land aside for Indian school purposes.\n\nThe site chosen is on the steam-boat channel, is high and dry, there is an abundant supply of good water, is readily accessible, can be easily drained, and as far as possibilities locally permit, contains a sufficient area for the needs of the proposed school.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter in duplicate, signed by the Reverend Father Lecocq, which intimates his written acquiescence on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church, in the action taken with reference to the selection of the site for the proposed Roman Catholic Boarding School at Norway House.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, April 16th, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to an official letter of the 11th of March last in reference to a site for the proposed Roman Catholic Boarding School building at Norway House. The Department has received a report from the inspector, and it has been decided to locate the school on the lot situated south of that occupied by the Hudson Bay Co., as indicated on the sketch which accompanied the Department's letter of the above mentioned date. There is, however, a difference which you will be good enough to note. The sketch sent you called for a frontage of only 20 chains, but our inspector recommends a frontage of 25 chains, with the depth as shown on the sketch in your possession. Of this the Department approves.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to have this piece of land set apart for school purposes, and surveyed at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The proposed site is indicated by a cross at the southwest of the peninsula. It will be seen from the plan that at present this land is in part occupied by the Roman Catholic Mission and cemetery (the mission being about \u00bd of a mile from proposed site of school), Geo. McKay's (Indian) house, Mercer's house and store, George Hughes' house, Henri Wolomb's (Indian) house, and Louis McLeod's house.\n\nThe Styx Mineral Claim, staked May 20, 1913 by G.S. Macrae and recorded by him at Winnipeg June 17, 1913 would at present interfere with obtaining any considerable acreage immediately adjoining the desired site.\n\nIt would seem that 40 or 45 acres should be sufficient acreage for the purposes of the boarding school and this could be obtained to include the desired site as indicated in green; Louis McLeod owner of a house on this tract being willing.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This tract contains 200 acres (approx.).\n\nI intended to include in the Indian Reserve but surveyed and posted it in such manner that it can, if necessary, be omitted from the Reserve and used for the purposes of the school without further survey. This latter location however is not quite as desirable a site as the first mentioned.\n\nDominion Land Surveyor\nJanuary 31, 1914.\n\nMemorandum,-\n\nHon. Dr. Roche,\n\nCrosse Lake Roman Catholic Boarding School:\n\nThe contract for the school building having been awarded, it now becomes necessary to decide upon the site of the school. The Rt. Rev. Bishop Charlebois was in the city yesterday and I had the opportunity of discussing this matter with him and with Mr. Donald F. Robertson, D.L.S., who made the survey at your request in that locality last summer. I send herewith a blue print plan prepared by Mr. Robertson and find that the most desirable land for the school is situate at a point bordered by green on the plan, containing 46 acres. Rt. Rev. Bishop Charlebois would like more land than that, and I think it would be advisable for him to have about 250 or 300 acres. The location is rendered difficult by the presence of a mining claim recorded on the 17th of June, 1913; this claim may be abandoned. There are also two white traders to be considered; they are now in enjoyment of possession on the lake shore. There seems to be no doubt that the best location is this point, and I would\nrecommend that the 46 acres be granted to this Department as a site for the school and that the necessity for acquiring further land in the locality for school purposes be noted.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. D. C. Scott.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 31st ultimo, addressed to the Minister, with regard to the Grass Lake Roman Catholic Boarding School, I may say that it has been decided to make a reservation in our books of the point of land coloured \"green\" on the blue print which accompanied your memorandum as a site for the school in question. This tract contains an area of 46 acres but a note has been made in our books that the whole of the point shown on the plan, containing an area of 401 acres, is to be reserved for the present, as it is understood that the Roman Catholic Mission have occupied a considerable portion of the point for some 20 years back and they are anxious to retain control of their property in connection with the boarding school. Reverend Father Lecocq, who called on the Minister yesterday morning in this regard, would like to receive an official communication from you advising him that he may proceed with the work of construction. He was also advised by the Minister, as you are aware, that the land recorded as a site for the school would be duly reserved for that purpose by this Department.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nFebruary 5, 1914.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Cory,\n\nI have to thank you for your memorandum of the 3rd of February, regarding the land required for the proposed Cross Lake Roman Catholic boarding school. I note that your Department is making a reservation of the 401 acres shown on the plan; perhaps it is unnecessary to again draw attention to the following point which came up in our conversation with the Minister, but I would like to say that, as the school buildings are to be erected by the Government, the site should be vested in the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. D. C. Scott.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of the 5th instant, with regard to the reservation of a site for the proposed Cross Lake Roman Catholic Boarding School.

Rowatt, Controller of the Mining Lands and Yukon Branch, that the \"Styx\" mineral claim, which was staked out on Cross Lake, has lapsed and the claim has been cancelled in the records of the Department.\n\nI, therefore, request that you reserve in your books for the use of the Cross Lake Roman Catholic Boarding School, the land comprised in this claim, in addition to the land already reserved.

We could hardly proceed...\nArchiviste de Saint-Boniface\n\nSaint-Boniface,\n\nAny one from so squatting, so long as the boundaries of the property have not been shown you.\n\nI draw your attention to this matter, confident that you will place our request before the proper authority and secure immediate action in the matter.\n\nPlease accept my anticipated grateful thanks and best wishes.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nE.

The Principal of the school is very anxious that a survey should be made of this property as soon as possible, so that the boundaries of the reservation should be clearly defined, and I would ask you to be good enough to let me know if your Department will have a survey party in this neighbourhood at any time in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nAttention of Mr. R. T. Perrier\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the name of His Lordship Bishop Charlebois I take the liberty of recommending to the Department the request made in the following letter which I have recently received from Father Trudeau, Principal of the Cross Lake Indian School:\n\n\"We have been informed that the Dominion lands are soon to be transferred to the provinces and we have also been told that, if we intend to apply for lands to be used in connection with our School, we had better do so at the earliest date possible. After consultation with Mr. Waddy, His Lordship Bishop Charlebois advised me to ask you to submit our request to the Department.\n\nIn the map which is hereto attached No. 1 represents the location of the Cross Lake Indian School. No. 2 is the school land on which we have been cutting construction and cord wood for a number of years. It is now almost exhausted, and, on account of numerous marshes and patches of bare rock, cannot be used for farming purposes. No. 3 shows the place where we wish to obtain a section for cutting cord wood. This section would be adjacent to the land which we now own; it would not be far from the School and could furnish fuel wood for many years to come. At No. 4 we would like to get a section for farming. We began farming operations there last year and we have now 35 acres under cultivation.\n\nShould the Department think that we do not need all the land we are asking for, we might put forward the following considerations:\n\n1. More than one half of the land of these regions consists of marshes and bare rocks which can be of no use whatever.\n2. About 400 cords of wood are needed yearly for the School. Should we fail to obtain the section No. 3 (on map) this large quantity of wood would have to be transported at heavy cost from great distances.\n3. Mining companies intend to build a dam on the outlet of Cross Lake in order to develop electric power. This dam will raise the level of the lake and drown the natural meadows on which we have cut hay for our cattle in past years. This...\"\nThis will necessitate the clearing of land for pasture and the raising of hay.\n\nWe therefore ask the Department to obtain for the use of the Cross Lake Indian School the sections marked (3) and (4) on the accompanying map.\n\nMr. R.T. Ferrier has kindly promised that he would attend to this request and I feel confident that the matter will be brought to a successful issue.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nFebruary 18, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Department of the Interior has reserved, for the use of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School, most of the points on which the school buildings are situated. In addition, there is reserved hay meadows to the south west and south east of the school property. Fractional Section 7, T. 65, R. 2, W. P. M., which is part of the school property, is not very suitable for farming and most of the wood has been cut therefrom. The school uses approximately 400 cords of fuel per year.\n\nThe school management now requires more land for cutting wood, and they have requested that Fractional Section 18 (that part not covered by the lake or the reserve) T. 65, R. 2, W. P. M., be included in the grant that is to be made to this Department for the purposes of this school. They further request that Fractional Section 19, T. 65, R. 2, W. P. M. (that part not covered by the lake) be included in the grant as they wish to use it for farm purposes. They have already cleared 35 acres there. It is represented to the school management that the level of this lake will be raised and that their hay meadows will be flooded. They, therefore, will have to prepare pasture land and grow oats for their live stock.\n\nThe amount of land requested, which is in addition to the original site (approximately 300 acres) which is to be granted to us, appears to be large; but it should be remembered that more than half of the land is marsh and bare rock and cannot be used for fuel, farming or pasture.\n\nI have to recommend that favourable consideration be given to the request of the church authorities.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, 27th February 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of the 25th June 1917 (your file No. 5100466) regarding Indian boarding school at Cross Lake, and subsequent correspondence wherein you have been requested to reserve to this Department certain lands in Secs. 1 and 12-65-5-W.P.M., and that portion of Sec. 7-65-2-W.P.M., lying West of Cross Lake, for the use of the Indian boarding school, and also to your letter of the 15th August 1922 (your file No. 608331 T. & G) in which you reserve three hay meadows for the use of the school.\n\nApproximately 400 cords of fuel per year are required in connection with the school and it is reported that the supply on the lands already reserved is not sufficient. You are requested to reserve from sale or settlement Frac. secs. 18 and 19-65-2-W.P.M. and to have them transferred to this Department for use in connection with the Indian Industrial school at Cross Lake.\n\nIt is further reported that it is probable that power will be developed in this neighbourhood and that the raising of the waters consequent thereto is likely to flood the hay meadows now used by the school. In anticipation of this, the school authorities have commenced farming on Sec. 6 and that portion of Frac. Sec. 7 lying South of Cross Lake in Tp. 65-2-W.P.M. They now have 55 acres under cultivation. You are requested to also reserve these lands from sale or settlement and to have them transferred to this Department in connection with the Indian Industrial school.\n\nThe areas now applied for are in addition to those areas for which previous application was made and which it is hoped you can now confirm. This may seem to be a large area for the use of the school, but it should be taken into account that more than half of the land in that region consists of marsh or bare rock, which is of no use whatever and also that if wood is to be transported a long distance it will prove costly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Commissioner of Dominion Lands,\nDepartment of the Interior\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n(J.D.

In 1922 the Department of Indian Affairs requested that three additional hay meadows located in Township 64, Ranges 2 and 3 W.E., be also included in the transfer for the same purpose. This reservation was made and the Great Timber Agent at Winnipeg was so advised on the 15th August, 1922, he being furnished with a plan showing the position of the three hay meadows in question.\n\nIn view of this fact it is considered that these lands come under Clause (b) of Section 10 of the Manitoba natural resources agreement dated the 14th day of December, 1920, which reads as follows:\n\n\".....(b) any ungranted lands of the Crown upon which public money of Canada has been expended or which are, at the date upon which this agreement comes into force, in use or reserved by Canada for the purpose of the federal administration.\"\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs are again pressing for transfer of the lands in question and you will be kept informed regarding the action taken.\n\nConsiderable money has been expended by the Department of Indian Affairs erecting a school and other buildings and placing the land under cultivation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.M.

These two group lots include fractional section 1 north of lake and all of section 12, township 65-3-Pr. except fractional legal subdivision 15, comprising 3.9 acres as shown on the township plans. The balance of the lands applied for in township 65-2-Pr. are shown on the official plan of that township and the usual form of description should be used for the lands required on these two plans.\n\nThe transfer of the three hay meadows in township 64, ranges 2 and 3, west of the Principal meridian will present some difficulty. If one of them comprises the whole of island C shown on plan 37152 it would be possible to describe it as such in a transfer but if it does not comprise the whole island it would be in the same category as the meadows on islands A and B where the meadows appear to be vested in the Dominion while the balance of the islands have transferred to the province.\n\nIt would seem necessary for the Dominion to define by survey the boundaries of the lands reserved for hay before the transfer is made.\n\nF.

From these it would appear to be in order for the Department to obtain title to the hay meadows on A and B, and that a survey will be necessary. Needless to say, the expenditure for such survey would be out of all proportion and I would suggest that it would be advisable for us to go ahead and obtain transfer of the lands required in Tp.65, Ranges 2 and 3, rather than leave them in their present condition on account of the hay meadows. If we could state definitely that the whole of Island C was a hay meadow, the Interior would be in a position to transfer it also.\n\nChief Surveyor\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is unable to arrange for a survey of the hay meadows at the present time and it is considered undesirable to delay transfer of such of the lands as are required for the Industrial School at Cross Lake as could now be transferred until the survey of these hay meadows is undertaken. I shall be pleased, therefore, if you will take the necessary steps to complete the transfer of the lands required in Tp.65, R.23 W.P.M., and I should also like to be advised if there is any arrangement whereby the Department could ensure the use of the hay meadows on Islands A.B. and C until such time as the survey of the boundaries can be accomplished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(T.R.L.

Section 6; fr. Section 7 west and south of lake; fr. Section 18 and fr. Section 19 in Township 65, Range 2, West of the Principal Meridian, and fr. Section 1 north of lake and fr. Section 12 east of lake, less Lot 1, Group 423, claim of A.E.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nSt. Joseph School,\nCross Lake, Dec. 21, 1938.\n\nRe: Cross Lake-Wabowden Road.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nThe work proposed for this year on our Residential School is practically completed. The walls have been built up and the building closed. Though the expenses exceed considerably the grant allowed for, I feel confident you will not be deceived, as you have seen the conditions of the building and the size of it. If we keep in mind the distances and difficulties for transport, the late season in which the work had to be carried on, I think we should feel satisfied at the amount of work done.\n\nWe have appreciated your kind cooperation and feel much obliged to you.\n\nI have to state it has not only been preparation for the future welfare of the Indians, but also a very important and very needed help for the Indians of this reserve. Their condition would have been at worst had not this construction started on. It has meant for them a decent living last fall and for the first part of the winter. In as much as we could, we have endeavoured to give a chance of earning to everyone of this settlement. I should say it has been their salvation. The prospects for fur were so poor that the traders did not care to give out a nickel in debt.\n\nNow the trapping season is opened and the forecasts have come to reality: fur is very scarce and prices for most of the furs are low. It is easy to foresee poverty for the severe part of the winter: January and February, which is always a very poor trapping time.\n\nHaving this in mind and considering the real need we have of a suitable road to the railway station, Wabowden on H.B. Ry., I wish to recommend this work to your attention and ask for a grant of about two thousand ($2,000.) dollars to have this road cut and improved.\n\nThe necessity of this road is undoubted. During the winter months, it is the only way of communication with outside. Although the important amount of freight comes by boat, every winter there is always a fair quantity coming over this road. This winter especially on account of the construction, over sixty tone will have to be taken in this way. Furthermore, many of the trappers take their fur up to Wabowden where they get far better prices for them and pay less for the goods they buy. There is lots of traffic on this road. One point that needs consideration is the mail service we are requesting to be done by horses or dogs. It was giving better\naccommodation than the air mail service and was costing less. We ask to come back to the old way, which was the best for this settlement.\n\nThe actual road is but a trapper's path which leads through muskegs, creeks, hills and is in no way proper for freighting and travelling with horses. The proposed road would be more level, more sheltered and shorter by at least eight to ten miles.\n\nThe road we are asking for has been cut for about half way. With the grant we request, the cutting could be completed and the road improved and opened for transport.\n\nThe Provincial Government has already been asked for a grant. I am sure they will agree to cooperate.\n\nMr. P. Sutherland is well aware about this road and could give you other particulars if necessary.\n\nI take the opportunity to recommend for the success of the Day School the corduroying of a swamp between the school and the reserve. When children can not come by canoe, they are prevented to come to school on account of this swamp and two creeks at each side of it. Two bridges would have to be erected and the swamp corduroied.\n\nI suggest you these works as I sincerely think that help will have to be given to the Indians this winter. I trust this will meet your approval and be granted if any money is available at the present.\n\nRe: Muskrat Farms.\n\nLast summer in the short talk we had during your very pleasant visit, I had told you about the necessity of muskrats farms. I heartily believe that it is time to make steps forward in this direction. Undoubtedly there will be difficulties to establish them, but at any rate they should be undertaken if we want to assure to our Indians a living.\n\nOn the land owned by the Res. School, there are some creeks. I will try to convince the Indians not to trap the muskrats there. This experiment will give us an idea of how much they can increase when they are left alone.\n\nWith my sincere thanks for your devotedness to the Indians Affairs, receive my heartfelt wishes for a very Merry Christmas and joy, prosperity and success in your important and difficult office. May the Almighty bestow upon you and upon all those you care for His most precious blessings.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) Albert Chamberland, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nHonourable T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDecember 29, 1938.\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nre $2,000 grant for road Cross Lake-Wabowden; corduroying swamp from reserve to school; and re muskrat farms\n\nWith the return of the attached (Dec 21) from the Reverend Albert Chamberland, O.M.I., Principal, St. Joseph School, Cross Lake, will you be good enough to furnish a report.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nOttawa, January 4, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: $2,000 grant for road, Cross Lake - Wabowden; corduroying swamp from reserve to school; and re muskrat farms.\n\nReverend Albert Chamberland, O.M.I., Principal of the Indian Residential School at Cross Lake, Manitoba, in a letter to the Minister dated December 29, 1938, asks among other things for a grant of approximately $2,000.00 for the construction of a winter road between the school at Cross Lake and Wabowden, a station on the Hudson Bay Railway, a distance of approximately 45 miles.\n\nFather Chamberland intimates in his communication that the major portion of his freight and the supplies necessary for the operation of the residential school have been reaching the institution by boat. The officials of this Branch are of the opinion that this is the most inexpensive and satisfactory method of transporting freight to the Cross Lake School. The Principal is of the opinion however that the road should be constructed as a mail route and as a transportation route that would enable the trappers of the district to secure a better price for their furs when delivered at Wabowden. The Principal estimates that at least 60 tons of supplies necessary for the rebuilding of the Cross Lake School will pass over the route this winter. It is not at all likely however that a grant, if made now, could be utilized in time to reconstruct the road for transportation of the goods necessary for the building of the school.\n\nIn view of these facts, it is difficult to see how the -\nhow the suggested grant of $2,000 could be legitimately charged to any of the appropriations of this Branch. It has not been at any time the policy of the Department to pay for the construction of roads on lands other than those within actual boundaries of Indian reserves.\n\nFather Chamberland suggests the corduroying of the swamp between the school and the Indian reserve. This is a project that might be undertaken by the Indians now in receipt of relief at Cross Lake. If you so desire, I shall be glad to communicate with the Indian Agent with the object of having this work undertaken by the Indians, on the understanding that the project is to be completed in return for rations supplied by the Department.\n\nFather Chamberland refers to a conversation he had with the Minister last summer, relating to the development of muskrat areas in the district. You are probably aware that we are at present negotiating with the Provincial Government in an attempt to secure an area of approximately 10,000 acres in the Cross Lake district for the use of Indians. It is in my judgment useless to talk of the development of muskrat areas at Cross Lake or the conservation of fur life in the district until an understanding has been reached with the Provincial Government in respect to the lands now under consideration. It is our intention, however, to continue these negotiations until a settlement measurably satisfactory to all parties is reached.\n\nMr. Halcrow made a survey of the Cross Lake district about a year ago with the object of determining the possibilities of the area for muskrat development. His report containing certain specific recommendations is now in possession of this Branch.\n\nI am returning herewith Father Chamberland's letter.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\n\nIndian Affairs.

He agrees that it would not be possible out of any vote in your Branch to make expenditures on the road from Wabowden to the School. It might be that some work could be done on this road if we should have a Mining Roads Vote next year. The Minister approves of you communicating with the Indian Agent for the purpose of seeing if an arrangement could not be worked out with the Indians to construct the road from the School to the Reserve referred to by Father Chamberland in his letter. He hopes it will be possible to have the work done this winter.\n\nC.W.

He stated that he would like to look into the matter further before making any comments or recommendation.\n\nMr. Lazenby stated further that he had had an interview with Father Chamberland prior to leaving Norway House, and the Reverend Father did not discuss with him the question of constructing such a road.\n\nOffice of the General Superintendent of Agencies.\n\nM.W.\nFebruary 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI quote hereunder, for your information, from a letter addressed by Rev.

Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Mr M. Christianson's letter No; 123-1-9 of the 8th February 1939, and in reply, to say that I visited the Cross Lake Reserve last week, and discussed the matter of the corduroying of the road mentioned by the Rev: Father Chamberland in his letter, with Father Chamberland himself.\n\nThis road would not be on the Cross Lake Indian Reserve, but would run from the R.C.Mission, on the east side of the lake, northwards round the lake shore to the Hudson's Bay Company store. The road would run through certain lands belonging to the Department and allotted to the R.C.Residential School for their use, through a short stretch of unoccupied Provincial land, and through some private property on the north end of the lake, belonging to a man named McLeod, through the U.C.Church property and the Hudson's Bay Co's property.\n\nThere is, of course, already a sort of foot path here now, that has been in use for many years, and I would think that the private property owners, through whose land this path runs, could not close it, though whether or not they would consent to having the path widened to make a roadway would be something to consider. Father Chamberland's idea, is to make the road wide enough for teams of horses to travel on, as well as to accommodate the day school pupils, as this would facilitate their going to the school's hay lands with teams to haul hay, and other work, in the summer months.\n\nThe making of this road would certainly be of benefit -\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-9, part 1)\nbenefit to the R.C.Day School, as well as accommodating most of the pupils attending it.\n\nThe work proposed, would cost, it is estimated, somewhere in the neighbourhood of $1,200.00 to $1,500.00 including the erection of two bridges across two small creeks, and could be done as a Relief Project by the Indians of Cross Lake Band, provided they worked under some responsible foreman. Probably Brother Menard of the R.C.Mission might undertake to look after this.\n\nFather Chamberland advised me that he had some documents at the mission setting out in detail what lands were owned by the Department. These he would look up and forward copies of to this office, with a map showing the location of the proposed road, and when I receive these I will communicate further with you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.Lazenby.\nIndian Agent.\nNorway House, Man:\n25th March 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nFurther to my letter of the 14th March, in reply to Mr M. Christianson's letter 123-1-9 of the 8th February, regarding a proposed corduroy road at the R.C.Mission at Cross Lake, I beg to forward herewith a plan showing the route of this road, which I have received from Rev: Father Chamberland.\n\nIn his covering letter, a copy of which I enclose herewith, Father Chamberland estimates the cost of the road, with two bridges, at approximately $1,300.00, or $1,350.00.\n\nWith reference to Father Chamberland's P.S. to his letter, I beg to say that Mr P.W.Durant, the Provincial Forest Ranger, is away from Norway House at present, and will not return for probably two weeks.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nCross Lake, March 15th 1939.\n\nMr P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request, I am pleased to forward with a sketch of the proposed road we were talking about on your last visit, and also I give you an approximate value of what it would cost. This I hope, will make all the explanations easier to understand.\n\n1. The two creeks will require each a bridge; one of 175 ft., and the other 125 ft. Material: Poles of 4\" or at least 3\u00bd\" at the small end, 12' long, in order to facilitate the travel with horses when necessary. This material is to be taken close to site on Government lands.\n\nIf a post driver could be available, and should we use posts instead of cribs, it would save both time and money.\n\n2. The adjoining ground to mainland would need to be raised to a level of about 18\". Corduroy and soil would be the right thing for this part of the road, 1500'.\n\nApproximate cost of bridges: $350.00\n\n\" \" Corduroy 1000.00\n\n$ 1350.00\n\nRe Mrs McLeod's property we have to cross to join the road allowance, Mr P. Durant should be able to give you full informations. If necessary the part wanted could be changed with Louis McLeod, who is built on Government land.\n\nSigned: Albert Chamberland O.M.I.\nApril 4, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th of March enclosing copy of a letter from Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nSir:\n\nIt will be remembered that, after the burning of St. Joseph's residential school at Cross Lake, some eleven boys were transferred temporarily to the R.C. Mission at Norway House. These boys have now gone home to Island Lake and God's Lake for the vacation. There is no doubt that at Treaty time some of the parents will declare that they sent their children to Cross Lake, and as that school is not now carrying on as a residential school, their arrangement is cancelled, since the school at Norway House is not a Residential school. Shall I insist positively that the children must be returned to school at the end of the vacation? I would recommend that this be done, with the exception of those whose discharge I have already recommended.\n\nI may say that the representative of the Provincial Board of Health stated to me that the R.C. Mission at Norway House had accommodation for sixteen boarders only, should not exceed that number. Of course the putting of these children at that Institution was an emergency measure. During the past quarter there have been in excess of twenty in residence, there being, besides the eleven from St. Joseph's school, a number of half-breeds, and some Indian children of Norway House Band as well. In view of these facts, I would suggest that no more children be taken in under Government grant than those already there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 24, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to returning certain former pupils of the Cross Lake Residential School to the R. C. Mission at Norway House. The Department considers that it would be in the best interests of these boys to return to the Mission, and you should make every possible endeavour to have them do so. However, we are not prepared, at the present time, to authorize using the services of the R. C. M. P.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, the Department trusts you will see that only those pupils are placed in the Mission for whom accommodation can be adequately provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing an Application for Admission to Cross Lake, (St. Joseph's) Residential School from Edward Mason of Island Lake, for his son James Mason, aged ten years.\n\nIt is a little difficult to know just what to do with such an application. The school is, of course, unable to accept residence pupils. There are several boys, former pupils of this school, who are in attendance at the Day School at the R.C. Mission on Jack River, at Norway House, and some arrangement I presume, has been arrived at as to payment for these pupils through the St. Joseph's School. It may be that this boy could be accepted as a pupil of St. Joseph's school, and temporarily lodged and taught at Norway House R.C. Mission.\n\nThe mother of the boy is an invalid. The family are in poor circumstances, as the father is unable to go away from home to trap during the winter. The boy would be better where he would receive regular food, and should be in school of course. On the other hand, I am quite sure that the number of children lodged at the R.C. Mission exceeds the number which the Provincial Health Officer stated should be accommodated in the building, limiting the number to sixteen lodgers, outside of the staff. As a matter of fact, the boy is already being lodged at the said Mission.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm Gordon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 1st, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge your 4A of October 18th, submitting an application with reference to James Mason.\n\nIt is noted that you consider that, in view of the accommodation, there are sufficient children already lodged in the Norway House R. C. Mission. Under these circumstances, the Department is unable to approve the placing of James Mason there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

After having carefully looked over the copy of my last report, I noticed that among the twenty-four children boarding at school, that is Norway House or Cross Lake, none had reached the age of 16 years.\n\nThe oldest among them are as follows:\n\n# 098 Flora McKay .... 15 years\n# 010 Charlotte North .... 15 years\n# 075 Veronique Cook .... 14 years\n\nAll the others are under 14 years.\n\nI take advantage of this occasion to ask you also to please discharge No. 010 Rena Frogg. She was taken home by her mother a few months ago, during my absence, for unfounded, light reasons in regards to menstruation. It has been impossible for me to make her return. Our reason for desiring her discharge is because she was a continual cause of trouble and her conduct gave bad example to the others. She is 15 years old and is in the 11th Grade. Since, you see, her term at school is nearly finished, we do not see any great inconvenience in discharging her.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The circular letter pointed out that, when pupils reach this age and you wish to keep them for a further period, permission should be secured. Consequently, at the end of each academic year in future, you should forward to the Department, through the office of your local Indian Agent, a list giving the names and register numbers of all pupils sixteen years of age and over. In the case of those whom you desire to keep for a further period, you should request permission to do so, giving your reasons for this request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

The mother of these children has been very ill with T.B. for some time, and is not likely now, to improve. It is on this account that the admission of these children to the school has been applied for, as the children are more or less neglected.\n\nMarie Bernadette Scatch is six years of age, and I have recommended her for admission, but Marie Clara Jane is only just past three years of age, and I have not signed her application as I am of the opinion that she is too young to be admitted as a grant earning pupil of the school. It would be better, I think, if some other arrangement were made for the care of the child for another two or three years at least, with some relatives, or some other Indian family. However, I will leave the decision in the matter to the Department. The father of these two children is living, and is apparently in good health himself.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\n\nIndian Affairs.

Solomon Farmer was discharged on the doctor's advice, owing to his poor physical condition. Boniface Okimow has never returned to the school since the summer vacation, the reason given being illness at the time when he should have returned.\n\nI may say that the quarterly return for the Cross Lake R.C.Residential School, is always made out by Rev: Henry Boissin of Cross Lake, the return including the children at Jack River as well as those at Cross Lake, and Father Chamberland states that he did not give notice to Father Boissin, in time for the September Return, regarding the above pupils.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Legenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nOttawa, April 14, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nReferring to conversation with Your Lordship during your recent visit to the Department, regarding the age limit for the discharge of the boys who are 14 years of age from the residential schools conducted under your auspices, in order that they can be returned to their parents, to acquire a knowledge of hunting, trapping etc., I have to say that this meets with the approval of the Department. The Indian Agents at The Pas, Norway House, and Battleford are being informed and requested to advise the Principals of the Guy, Cross Lake and Beauval Indian Residential Schools accordingly.\n\nIt is not intended that all the boys, upon attaining 14 years of age, shall be granted discharge, but only those cases which the Principals consider to be in sufficiently good health to accompany their parents on their hunting and trapping trips. It is thought that Indian boys should have acquired sufficient education for their future needs by the time they reach 14 years of age and that it would be to their future advantage to acquire a knowledge of hunting and trapping, on which their future livelihood will, to a great extent, depend.\n\nI would suggest that Your Lordship discuss the matter with the Principals of the above named schools and advise them that careful selection should be made by them of the boys whose discharge they would recommend at 14 years of age.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, April 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Lajeunesse, during a recent visit to the Department, discussed the matter of the age limit for the discharge of the boys from the Indian Residential Schools conducted under his auspices. He recommended that those boys who are in good health should be given their discharge when they reach 14 years of age, in order that they can be returned to their parents or guardians, with a view to acquiring a knowledge of hunting and trapping, which will be the main source of their future livelihood.\n\nThe Department considers that it would be in the interests of the boys to be granted their discharge at 14 years of age, as they should by that time have acquired an education sufficient to meet their future needs. You may, therefore, inform the Principal of the Cross Lake Indian Residential School that, when he considers that a boy, upon attaining his fourteenth birthday, should receive his discharge, he should make application to the Department, through your office, in the usual manner.\n\nIt is not intended that all boys, upon reaching 14 years of age, are to be discharged, but, as stated, only those who are in sufficiently healthy condition to accompany their parents or guardians in order to acquire a knowledge of hunting, trapping, etc.\n\nI would request that you advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\n597 McDermot Ave.\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nMon cher P\u00e8re,\n\nCi-inclus copie d'une lettre du R. P. Boissin ainsi que d'autres documents ayant trait au refus du D\u00e9partement Indien d'admettre Henrietta et Nancy Dixon \u00e0 l'Ecole Catholique R\u00e9sidentielle de Cross Lake, sous pr\u00e9texte que ces deux enfants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9es et \u00e9lev\u00e9es dans la religion protestante. (Lettre agent, 27 d\u00e9c.)\n\nSi vous vous rappelez bien, \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re r\u00e9union du comit\u00e9 des missions, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de cas semblables, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'on s'en tiendrait aux d\u00e9cisions l\u00e9gales donn\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement et qui veulent que la volont\u00e9 des parents soit souveraine quand il s'agit de l'\u00e9ducation religieuse de leurs enfants. Qu'un enfant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9 et \u00e9lev\u00e9 catholique ou protestant cela n'y fait rien si les parents d\u00e9cident de la placer dans une \u00e9cole de leur choix.\n\nC'est d'ailleurs la ligne de conduite suivie par le D\u00e9partement, et de cela nous avons des preuves multiples. Je m'en citerai que quatre.\n\n1) Catherine Sinclair fille d'Albert Sinclair de Cross Lake, baptis\u00e9e catholique d\u00e8s l'enfance et ayant fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l'\u00e9cole pensionnat de Cross Lake durant deux ans avant le feu, et l'\u00e9cole du jour catholique au moins une ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le feu, a bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 admise \u00e0 l'Ecole protestante de Norway House. Elle doit \u00eatre maintenant d\u00e9charg\u00e9e.\n\n2) La fille de William Thomas, autrefois de Cross Lake et maintenant de Nelson House a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise l'an dernier \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole protestante de Brandon. Elle y est encore probablement. Or \u00e9tant n\u00e9be elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9e catholique et est suppos\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9e catholique.\n3 et 4) Qu'on consulte encore les registres de l'Ecole Protestante de Norway-House et on y verra les noms d'Oliver Sinclair fils de Charlie Sinclair de Cross Lake, et Marguerite MacKay fille d'Edouard MacKay, deux enfants qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9s et \u00e9lev\u00e9s catholiques.\n\nJe suppose qu'il n'y a pas deux poids et deux mesures au D\u00e9partement. Si la volont\u00e9 des parents vaut dans un cas elle doit aussi valoir dans l'autre. Or ici la volont\u00e9 du P\u00e8re des enfants Henrietta et Nancy est bien expresse comme on peut le voir par l'affidavit ci-inclus. Vous pouvez dire au D\u00e9partement que dans les circonstances pr\u00e9sentes, le renvoi des enfants Henrietta et Nancy Dixon constituerait \u00e0 notre endroit un deni de justice.\n\nJe vous pris d'agir le plus t\u00f4t possible et de ne rien n\u00e9gliger pour assurer le r\u00e8glement favorable de cette question.\n\nVeuillez croire, mon R\u00e9v\u00e9rend et cher P\u00e8re, \u00e0 mes sentiments respectueux et d\u00e9vou\u00e9s en N.-S. et M. I.\n\n\"Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\"\nVicaire Apostolique du Keewatin\nMr. Philip Phelan  \n161 Homewood Avenue  \nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn a letter dated December 12, 1938, your Indian Agent at Norway House, Mr. P. G. Lezenby, approved the admission of Nancy and Henrietta Dixon to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School but, in a communication dated December 27, 1938, he informed the Principal that he had received instructions from Ottawa to the effect that Nancy and Henrietta Dixon having been baptized and brought up as protestants were not eligible for admission to the Cross Lake Indian Residential School and were to be returned to their father at the earliest possible date.\n\nOn receipt of this letter from Mr. Lezenby, Father Boissin interviewed the father of the Dixon children and asked him if it was his desire that his children be dismissed from the Cross Lake Residential School and returned to him. Adam Dixon then stated that it was his express wish that his children be kept in the Cross Lake School. He then made the enclosed declaration before Mr. Jack Wright, the Police Magistrate for the District of Norway House.\n\nIt being the will of Adam Dixon that his children be educated in a Catholic School, Bishop Lajeunesse informs me that he cannot accept the decision of the Department, his claim being that the will of the parents in matters of education is supreme and recognized as such in an opinion given by the Department of Justice on January 5, 1922. You are no doubt acquainted with this opinion and I need not quote it here; it will be found in a letter written by Mr. D. C. Scott to Mr. Bunn on October 16, 1922. I am enclosing a copy of Bishop Lajeunesse's letter to me bearing on this case and dated the 13th instant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOP/TR\n\nEnclosures 3.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the meantime you may advise the Principal of the Cross Lake school that the children may remain there until he receives further communication.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The Principal hopes that the Department will allow the latter at least two years in the school. Re Lawrence Castel; the same might also be said regarding this boy, aged 14. The Principal states that this boy is easy to discipline and will do well in school, and as he had no chance to go to school, it is requested that he be given at least two years education.\n\nKindly advise me of the Department's decision regarding the foregoing applications.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.G.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nNorway House, Man:\n11th April 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith for the Department's information, a copy of a letter I have received from Rev: H. Boissin O.M.I., the Principal of the Jack River section of the Cross Lake R.C. Residential School, regarding one of the pupils named George Menow, who was admitted to the school last December. This pupil's number is 137, and he is 10 years of age.\n\nA few days prior to receiving Father Boissin's letter, this boy's mother came to see me, and told me that the boy would not stay at the school, but was continually running home. I have also had a talk with the boy's father Johnnie Menow, and from what I can gather, it would appear that the boy is not normal mentally. I suggested to the boy's father that we might send him to the school at Cross Lake, but he was afraid that the boy might get himself drowned if he tried to get home in the summer time.\n\nI would recommend that the boy be discharged and that another pupil be secured in his place.\n\nWill you kindly advise me of the Department's opinion in the matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.:\nMr Lazenby  \nIndian Agent  \n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must inform you about one of our pupils named George Menow the son of Johnnie Menow - We are unable to keep him any more. He is going away home all the time. We can't tie him up we have to let him go out for recreation. As soon as he is outside he is flying away - Once the police brought him back and told next time you are going away I put you in the prison. But he is scare of nobody. This boy is not intelligent at all. The sisters and me thing that he will never know anything about teaching. If you think so we could discharge him or send him to Cross Lake school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(S'gd) Rev: H.Boissin O.M.I.\nOttawa,\nApril 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant you may inform Rev. H. Boissin, O.M.I., that the discharge of George Menow, No. 137, is approved.\n\nThe new Cross Lake R.C. Residential School is completed and it was understood that the children from the Jack River section of the Cross Lake School would be transferred to the new school. It would appear from your letter that this has not yet been done. I should appreciate your advising when it is the intention to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nOttawa,\nJune 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letters of the 14 and 17th ultimo reached the Department today.\n\nFavourable consideration cannot be given to the suggestion that a number of girls be retained at Jack River. As you were informed in official letter of the 23rd ultimo, which no doubt has reached you by this time, all children now at Jack River and who require institutional care must be transferred to Cross Lake.\n\nThe discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\nNo. 119 John James Menow\n\" 151 Abel Taylor\n\" 128 Tom Harper\n\nIt is not necessary to apply for permission to transfer pupils from Jack River to Cross Lake as those who are at Jack River are on the Cross Lake return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. P.

Residential School, for the quarter ending 30th September 1940.\n\nWith reference to the two Miller children, pupils No: 156, William Miller, and No: 0173 Jane Miller, the Principal advises me that he is having some difficulty in securing the Application forms for these children. They formerly lived with their parents at The Pas, until both parents died. They then spent some time in hospital at The Pas; were examined for admission to a residential school first without being approved by the medical examiner. Later they were passed by the doctor and their admission to Guy Residential School was approved. However they did not go to that school, but were brought to Cross Lake school, and up to the present time, no proper applications for Cross Lake School have been sent in. The Principal advises me that he has written to Father Trudeau at The Pas to get the necessary particulars and signatures on the application forms, and will then have the children examined by Dr Corrigan on his next trip to Cross Lake.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

Caldwell, Principal of the Norway House United Church Indian Residential School who requested a ruling in connection with the above noted.\n\nMr. Caldwell gave me a statement signed by Albert and Sarah Richard - copy of which is attached - and explained he had received an application from these people to have their sons William and Walter who are now pupils in the Cross Lake Roman Catholic Indian Residential School admitted to the Norway House United Church Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal of the Norway House School refused to accept applications for admittance of these children until a ruling from the Department was received.\n\nRichard Albert states he has always been a Protestant. He married a Roman Catholic woman but he informed me she changed Faith and was accepted into the United Church at Cross Lake in 1933.\n\nIn 1938 the oldest child, Katie, now aged 12, was admitted to the Norway House School.\n\nIn 1940, William, now aged 11, was baptised into the Roman Catholic Church and admitted to the Cross Lake School, January 27th of that year.\n\nOn October 3rd, 1940, Walter, now aged 8, was admitted to the Cross Lake School.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nRe: Children of Albert Richard\nNo. 448 Cross Lake Band.\n\nThe father now wishes to remove his two sons from\nthe Cross Lake School and place them in the Norway House\nSchool.\n\nWill you kindly advise what action should be taken\nin this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nG. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nI am, and always have been, Protestant, a member of the United Church of Canada. My wife was Catholic but was received into membership of the United Church of Canada in 1932. My wife and I have six children, three being of school age. In August, 1938, I placed one child (my oldest) in the Norway House Residential School. In 1940, I placed two children in the Cross Lake Roman Catholic School, having been sent for by the Principal and requested so to do at the Catholic School.\n\nIt is the wish of myself and my wife that our children should be raised in the Protestant Faith and attend a Protestant school. I hereby voluntarily make the request that my children, at present in the Cross Lake Roman Catholic School, be transferred immediately to the Norway House Residential School.\n\nNo inducement has been offered and no influence brought to bear by anyone connected with the Norway House Residential School or with the United Church of Canada to require me to make this request.\n\nDated at Cross Lake Indian Reserve this 11th day of August 1941.\n\nSigned: (Albert Richard)\n(Sarah Richard)\n\nWitnessed: (F. G. Stevens)\n\nRead over and interpreted to the signatories:\n\n(Fred W. Stevens)\nOttawa, September 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the children of Albert Richard.\n\nIt is true that the oldest girl was admitted to the Norway House School in 1938. I also find that the two younger children were admitted to the Cross Lake School at later dates. In all three cases the application forms were signed by the father and approved by Indian Agent Lazenby. The information required on the forms was given and these application forms appeared in proper shape.\n\nI understand from your letter that the information you supplied was given to you by the Principal of the Norway House School. In cases such as this you should make your own enquiries and not depend on anyone else.\n\nYou should personally interview Albert Richard, without anyone else present, and ascertain his wishes. You should also let us know why, if the father is a member of the United Church, he signed application forms for his two younger children stating that he was a Catholic.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\nNorway House, Man.,\nSept. 12, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Nancy Dixon, No. 740 Norway House Band\nAge 13 years - (born Feb. 13, 1928).\n\nA complaint was received today from Rev. Father A. Rivard, O.M.I., i/c the R.C. (Jack River) Mission at Norway House, to the effect that one Tommy Dixon, No. 740 Norway House Band, proposed taking his niece, Nancy Dixon to his winter camp. Father Rivard stated that the child had been given into the care of the Rev. Gray Nuns of the Norway House (Jack River) Mission by her deceased father on January 3, 1939 - as per copy of agreement attached hereto.\n\nI explained to Father Rivard that although he has some Treaty Indian children in residence in the Jack River Mission, the operation of a day school only, is authorized by the Department.\n\nWill you kindly advise whether steps should be taken to return Nancy Dixon to the custody of the Jack River Mission in accordance with her late father's request or allow her uncle, Tommy Dixon, to have custody of the child.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nEnc. 1\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nNorway House Reserve, Man.,\nJanuary 3rd, 1939.\n\nI, the undersigned, Adam Dixon, declared today that it is my intention and my will, well determined, to leave, to the care of the Rev. Gray Nuns of Norway-House, my children, Henriette, Nancy and Emelie.\n\nI also renew my desire and my will that Henriette and Nancy be brought up in the Roman Catholic Indian School at Norway House.\n\nI also declare that I have not been induced to take this decision, neither by the Catholic Missionary nor by any other persons. But is is free-willingly and to follow my own and personal will, and also to accomplish the last will of my deceased wife, who before dying, asked me to send her children to the Catholic School at Norway House.\n\nDeclared in the presence of\n\nAdam X Dixon\nmark\n\nM. Jack Wright\n\nThis third day of January, 1939\n\nWitness: 1 - Thomas Menow\n2 - Johnny Tait\n\nSigned: J. Wright\n\na Police Magistrate in and for\nthe Prov. of Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th ultimo with reference to Nancy Dixon. I cannot see any reason why this girl should be placed in the care of her uncle. As a matter of fact the Department considers that she should be placed immediately in the Cross Lake Indian Residential School and you should make the necessary arrangements to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nA complaint was received from the Chief and some of the Councillors at Cross Lake at Treaty Time this year to the effect that certain Protestant children had been admitted to the Roman Catholic Indian Residential School at Cross Lake.\n\nThe names given me were:\n\n- Tommy Ross No. 355 Cross Lake Band\n- Ada Ross No. 355 Cross Lake Band\n- William Albert No. 448 Cross Lake Band\n- Walter Albert No. 448 Cross Lake Band\n- Thomas Alfred Ross No. 461 Cross Lake Band\n\nAccording to the Agency records Ada Ross is Roman Catholic, although the girl's father and balance of family are listed as Protestant.\n\nWilliam Albert has also apparently been baptized into the Roman Catholic Faith, although his father and balance of family are listed as Protestant.\n\nThis question was brought up just before I left Cross Lake and I did not have time go very deeply into the matter with the Principal of the School. I read Sec. 10 Sub-sec 2 of the Indian Act to the Chief and Council and members of the Band who were assembled at the time and informed them the matter would be brought to the attention of the Department.\n\nI also asked Rev. Father Chamberland, Principal of the School for a written report on the foregoing but he has since been transferred to The Pas and no report has been submitted.\n\nWill you kindly advise what steps should be taken in this regard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n| No. | Name          | Date of Admission | Band | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|--------------|-------------------|------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| 0182| Nora Ross    | 1/9/1941          | 8    |                   |                       |\n| 0183| Mary Dixon   |                   |      |                   |                       |\n| 0184| Christie McKay|                 |      |                   |                       |\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are both fourteen years old though you would think that they are sixteen. We don't know what to do with them and they won't listen to no one. We tried any thing to make them understand better but it seems useless. We certainly keep them any longer in the School as they corrupted the morals of the young girls and are spreading bad spirit in the school. I can not send them on the Reserve as they are orphans and nobody wants to keep them. We found a place in Winnipeg where they keep girls of that temper. They would accept these two girls at the same conditions that the Dept. pays for their children here and they would be ready to take them before the end of this month. Could you give us the permission to send them right away and would the Department be prepared to pay for them while they would be at the Good Shepherd until they will obtained the age of sixteen or eighteen.\n\nI would appreciate to receive an early answer as the travelling will soon be difficult and I would not like to be oblige to keep these girls until next summer in the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.E.Trudeau, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nPlease wire Mr. Lazenby instructions re these cases as soon as possible.\n\nP.E.Moore\nOttawa,\nMarch 19, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to Teresa Keeper and Harriet Ross.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter but the Department doubts the advisability of carrying out your suggestion at the present time. If these girls were sent to the institution you mention in Winnipeg it is doubtful if, when they reached the age of 16 or 18, they would be any better equipped to become reputable members of a community. It is unlikely that they could be placed in positions in Winnipeg and if they returned to the reserve at that age there would be no one to supervise them.\n\nI feel that disciplinary measures should be taken at the Cross Lake School.\n\nYou might write to me again about these girls at the end of the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nCross Lake, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn September last, Mr C. Roberts, Acting Indian Agent, brought to the attention of the Department, the matter of certain alleged Protestant children being admitted as pupils of The R.C. Residential School at Cross Lake, namely, the children of Albert Richard of Cross Lake Band, and I would refer you to Mr R.A. Hoey's letter No: 123-1-10 dated 26th September 1941, in reply. Mr Roberts also wrote to the Principal of the R.C. School at Cross Lake in the matter, and I enclose herewith for your information, a copy of Father Trudeau's reply.\n\nSection 10, sub-section 2 of the Indian Act provides that \"...no Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic School,....and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school,...\", but the Act does not define just what shall determine the religion of the child.\n\nFrom Father Trudeau's letter, it appears clear that he accepts the Baptismal Ceremony as being the determining factor, but from the final paragraph of Mr Hoey's letter, mentioned above, it would appear that the wishes of the father, (Protestant in the case of Albert Richard's children), should have some bearing on the matter.\n\nI beg to mention now, an instance which came to my attention yesterday. John Paupanakis, No; 590 Norway House Band, was married about 1923. He is a Protestant, and his wife a Catholic. They were married by an Anglican Minister. Their eldest child, Frank, was brought up as a Protestant, and attended the Jack River Church of England Day School here until he passed Grade 8. Two other children were baptized by a Catholic Priest\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont:,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nand are at present pupils in the R.C. Residential School at Cross Lake. Yesterday John Paupanakis approached the Principal of the United Church Residential School here at Norway House, with a view of having another of his children, (also I understand, baptized by a Catholic Priest), admitted to this school after the coming summer holidays. What is to determine the proper school to which this child should be sent; the wish of the father, who is Protestant, or the fact that the child was baptized according to the Catholic faith?\n\nThere is quite a number of cases of this kind, which are causing considerable dissension, and I beg to request that a definite and unmistakable ruling be brought down, legal if possible, stating clearly what shall determine the religion of minor children; whether they shall be regarded as being of the same religion as their father, regardless of baptism, or otherwise. There may possibly be something in Civil Law which would settle the matter. If such a legal ruling can be made, I would recommend that Section 10, subsection 2 of the Indian Act be amended so as to include such ruling.\n\nFor your further information, and to show the extent to which this mixing up of children has occurred, I am attaching hereto a copy of a statement handed to me some months ago, by the Principal of The Norway House Residential School. I may say that I have checked this statement with Census records as secured last summer by Mr C. Roberts, as to the religion of the parents concerned, and with the quarterly returns of the two schools concerned, with respect to the children. I may also say that prior to the Census record taken last summer, there were no records on file showing the religion of the Indians. With regard to the third paragraph of the statement, I may say that the Census records taken last summer, show both Norman Yellowback and Edmund McKay as belonging to the United Church, though they may possible have become affiliated with the R.C. Church since that time.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nSt: Joseph's Indian Residential School  \nCross Lake, Man:  \n\n1st October 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI reply to yours of September the 8th received last week concerning the complaint received from the Chief and some of the Councillors of Cross Lake at Treaty Time, that some Protestant children had been admitted to the St Joseph's Indian Residential School, I do not see any ground for such a complaint as all the children that you mentioned in your letter have been baptized in the Roman Catholic religion on the request of their parents. When these children were baptized as Catholics their parents have promised that these children would be brought up in the Catholic religion, and this is the reason why they have been accepted in the school after they were Catholics.\n\nAll the children of Albert Richards and his wife are Roman Catholic so Albert is the only one of the family who is Protestant.\n\nTommy and Ada Eleonore Ross were baptized Catholic long ago on the request of their parents. In fact I have baptized Eleonore Ross myself about ten years ago.\n\nThomas Albert Ross is the only one who was accepted into the school before being baptized a Catholic, but as his mother wanted him to be a catholic he had to be taken into the school to be taught the religion before he could be baptized. Another reason for accepting him before being a catholic is that his mother could not take care of him and the child was destituted.\n\nAs a matter of fact we do not accept into the school Protestant children and we have refused this favour to many people of Cross Lake who had wished earnestly to have some of their children into our school.\n\nHoping that this is found satisfactory to, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned:- G.E.Trudeau O.M.I.  \nActing Principal\n\nMr C.Roberts,  \nActing Indian Agent,  \nNorway House, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I therefore wrote to the United Church Missionary at Cross Lake asking him to see the child's father and verify this. However, I have to-day seen Lazarus Ross, the child's father, and talked the matter over with him, and he gave me the following information;\n\nLazarus Ross and his wife are both members of the United Church. They have two children now in the United Church Residential School at Norway House. When the above mentioned daughter, Therese Mabel Ross was five years old, she was given to her grandfather to look after temporarily. The grandfather is a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and when the child Therese Mabel was seven years old, two years ago, he had her baptized by the Roman Catholic Missionary, without consulting her parents, although he had not adopted the child, and was in no way her legal guardian, and although the child had already been baptized as a baby into the Church and religion of the parents, by Rev: W.W.Shoup, who was at that time United Church Missionary at Cross Lake. Lazarus Ross stated that he would rather have his daughter Mabel Therese in the United Church School at Norway House where he already has two other children, than in the R.C.School at Cross Lake. When asked why, if this was the case, he had signed the application to have her admitted to the R.C.School at Cross Lake, he replied that his grandfather had already put the child in this school, and the Principal had asked him to sign the application, telling him that he would talk the matter over with the Indian Agent. However, since receiving the application, I have had no opportunity of talking this over with Father Trudeau.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I should be glad to be advised if this child Therese Mabel Ross, is to be regarded as a Roman Catholic, and a proper candidate for the R.C.School at Cross Lake, or if she is still to be regarded as Protestant, as her father is, and be admitted to the United Church Residential School at Norway House as her father wishes. If the Department will make a definite ruling in the matter, kindly return the application, as I have not as yet signed it.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.;\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School of Therese Mabel Ross, daughter of Lazarus Ross of Cross Lake, and my reply thereto of December 11th, I beg to say that Mr H.Meadows, the United Church Missionary at Cross Lake, has advised me that according to the church records there, this girl, Mabel Therese Ross was baptized at the United Church in Cross Lake, on April 5th 1934 by Rev. S.D.Gaudin D.D. As stated in my letter to the Department of December 11th, I wrote to the Principal of the Cross Lake Residential School, asking to advise me how this child came to be a candidate for this school, as her parents and all the rest of the family were members of the United Church, and I quote the following from his letter in reply:\n\n\"When Therese Mabel Ross was about five years old, her father Lazarus Ross gave her to his father to stay with him. At the same time Lazarus told his father: I want this little girl to be a catholic and to pray like you. Not very long after Therese Mabel was baptized in the Catholic Religion by Rev. Father A.Chamberland on the 24th December 1939 and has been a catholic since that time. She then became eligible candidate for Catholic School as the law of the Department is 'No catholic child should be in a protestant school and vice versa.'\n\nSo last summer, Therese Mabel Ross being of school age I asked her father Lazarus Ross if he intended to put his daughter at the Cross Lake School? He answered me \"I want to put her here but I don't know what to do now as I saw the Indian Agent about this not long ago and he told me that I could not put her in the Cross Lake School but at Norway House School\". Then I told Lazarus Ross: may be the Agent does not know your daughter is catholic. Being a catholic she ought to be in a catholic school. If you want to put her in our school you can do it, so he did.\"\n\nA proof that he wanted his daughter here is that he himself duly signed the application form for admission.\" Before leaving for the harvest Lazarus Ross told his wife to bring the little girl after the children holidays. The day the children came back to school Mrs Lazarus Ross brought her daughter here which is another proof that Lazarus Ross and his wife wanted their daughter to be in the Cross Lake school.\n\n\"I believe that these facts will show you how Therese Mabel Ross came to be a candidate of the Cross Lake\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nschool and that she was neither put here by her grandfather as you stated in your letter nor against the will of her parents who deliberately signed the Application form for Admission and brought her to the school.\"\n\nFrom the last preceding paragraph, quoted from the Principal's letter, it might appear that I had stated in my letter to him that the girl had been placed in the school by her grandfather, and against the will of her parents, which would not be correct. What I did was to mention in my letter what Lazarus Ross, the girl's father had stated to me, and to make this particular matter clear I enclose herewith the duplicate copy of the letter I wrote to the Principal.\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of April 15th 1942, and the penultimate paragraph thereof particularly, in which I asked that if possible, the Department make some definite ruling in the matter of determining what shall be regarded as the religion of an Indian minor. My only concern in this matter of course, is to enable me to see that children of school age are sent to the proper school, and until such a ruling is made, these difficulties will undoubtedly continue.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent\nNorway House, Man:\n10th December 1942.\n\nDear Father Trudeau\n\nWith reference to the Application for Admission to the Cross Lake Residential School of Therese Mabel Ross, aged 9, daughter of Lazarus Ross of the Cross Lake Band, will you please advise me how this child comes to be a candidate for the Cross Lake Residential School, as both her parents and the rest of the family to which she belongs, are connected with the United Church. This information is required by the Department before passing upon her application. I may say that I saw Lazarus Ross and questioned him about the matter, and he stated that he and his wife and family all belonged to the United Church, and that the little girl above mentioned, Therese Mabel, was baptized at the United Church by Rev. W.W. Shoup who was the United Church Missionary at Cross Lake some years ago. Lazarus also stated that both he and his wife wanted this girl, Therese Mabel, to go to the Norway House Residential School, but that she had been staying with her grandfather since she was five years old, and the grandfather was a member of the Catholic Church, and placed the girl in the school.\n\nWill you kindly let me have all the information you can in this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.G.

Should the father's request be acceded to, and another application form prepared for his signature, and the boy removed from the Cross Lake R.C.School and placed in the Norway House U.C.School, or is the boy to be admitted to the Cross Lake R.C.School on the strength of the mother's signature to the application, and the father's request disregarded?

Residential School, of pupil No; 188, Wilbert Menow, was forwarded from this office, with covering letter of explanation under date 2nd February.\n\nWith reference to the Application for Admission of pupil No; 187, William Sandy Halcrow, I beg to refer to my letter to the Department concerning this pupil, dated 12th October 1942; Mr Phelan's reply No; 123-1-10 dated 19th December 1942, and my reply to Mr Phelan's letter, dated 31st December 1942. As stated in my first letter, this Application is being held at this office awaiting a definite ruling as to whether, in view of the circumstances, and the father's objection, this child is to be considered as a candidate for admission to this school. As soon as I have this ruling, I will sign and forward the application.\n\nI have written to the Principal of the Cross Lake Residential School regarding applications for pupils Nos; 189, 190, and 0193, and as soon as I receive these they will be forwarded to the Department.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nSt. Joseph's Indian Residential School\nCross Lake, Man.\n\n10th March, 1943\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. Of Mines & Natural Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nA few days ago I received a letter from the Indian Agent at Norway House quoting the following from the Department's letter:\n\n\"From the information we have received we do not feel that William Halcrow is eligible for admission to the Cross Lake School, and you should so inform the Principal.\"\n\nThen Mr. Lazenby adds:\n\n\"If this boy, William Halcrow, is now in the Cross Lake School, will you kindly see that he is returned to his home.\"\n\nI am rather surprised to just hear that this boy, William Halcrow, was not eligible for the Cross Lake School as the application for admission had been sent with the September quarterly return. I also regret that the Department before pronouncing on the eligibility of this child did not ask me for the particulars, if he thought this boy could not be admitted to our school.\n\nI am at a loss to send this boy home now as notified by Mr. Indian Agent Lazenby. The reason is that the father, Wilkie Halcrow, is working at the God's Lake Gold Mines and the mother is somewhere around Le Pas working too. The boy being homeless at present, the only solution I can see is to keep him in the School until I further hear from the Department.\n\nI would like to know why this boy, William Halcrow, is not eligible for admission to the Cross Lake School as I don't see why he can't be. The boy was baptized Catholic on the 8th of March 1935 by Rev. Father H. Boissin and was never baptized Protestant that I know of. At the time that Wilkie Halcrow was married to Alphonseine Cook I consented to perform the ceremony only after the solemn promise had been\nmade by both parties that all the children born from their marriage, either boy or girl, should all be baptized and brought up in the Catholic faith. So the promise was made and witnessed as you can see by a copy of the Church Records sent herewith.\n\nSo last fall when William Sandy Halcrow was brought to the school by his mother, I never thought for a moment that this child could not be eligible for the school. The Application form could not be signed by the father as he was at God's Lake about 160 miles from here. I told the mother about it but she answered that her husband had told her to put the child in the school. Any way she was forced to do it as she was not receiving enough support from her husband and was almost starving here at Cross Lake with her son.\n\nAfter Mrs. Halcrow had put her son into the School she wrote to her husband and told him. He answered her that he was glad that his boy was in the school here.\n\nSo considering these facts I am hoping that the Department will see that this William Halcrow is eligible for the school and will soon notified me that he is admitted to our School.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nG.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Trudeau also states that after your wife placed William in the Catholic School at Cross Lake, she wrote and told you about it, and that you answered her that you were glad that the boy was in the school at Cross Lake. The boy William was also baptized as a Catholic on 8th March 1935 by Rev: Father Boissin.\n\nIf therefore you made the above mentioned promise at the time of your marriage, and the boy was baptized as a Catholic, why do you now wish to have the boy taken from the\n\n- Catholic -\n\nMr Wilkie Halerow\nGod's Lake, Manitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nCatholic School at Cross Lake, and placed in the United Church School at Norway House?\n\nIn replying to this letter, please give your reasons in full, for whatever decision you make, regarding the school you wish your boy William to go to.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. G.

When I wrote the Department on October 12th last regarding the boy's application, I understood that she was at home on the Cross Lake Reserve.\n\nI note from Father Trudeau's letter to the Department, that this boy was baptized into the Catholic faith, and that at the time of their marriage, the parents had apparently promised that any children born to them should be brought up in the Catholic faith. Then against that there is the father's written and signed declaration to the effect that he wishes the boy removed from the Cross Lake R.C.School, and placed in the U.C.School at Norway House.\n\nThe Application for Admission in this case has been signed by the mother, but not by the father. If the father refuses to sign the application, what is to be regarded as the determining factor in rendering a decision as to what school the boy should be sent? Is it to be the wishes of the father, or the fact that the boy was baptized into the Catholic faith? I have asked the Department on a previous occasion, for a definite ruling in this matter, but no such ruling has as yet been given so far as I know, and until\n\n- such -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nsuch a ruling is handed down, these difficulties are bound to continue.\n\nSection 10, sub-section (2) of the Indian Act provides that \"...no Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic School,...and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school...\", but the Act does not define what constitutes a \"Protestant Child\" or a \"Roman Catholic Child\".\n\nMy only reason for asking that some definite ruling be given as above, is that I may be able to see that children are placed promptly in the proper schools when they are of the proper age.\n\nI have written to Wilkie Halcrow, the father of the boy in question, at God's Lake, and enclose herewith for your information, a copy of the letter I have written him.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Lazenby:\n\nOn April 13th I travelled across to Cross Lake in order to interview the Principal on the condition of over-crowding in the Cross Lake Boarding School. I was only partially successful on this trip as I found that the Principal was away. However I took the matter up with the Nursing Sister there and explained the situation to her rather carefully.\n\nOn arrival at the School I found that Father Trudeau had already discharged certain girls for one reason or another. Thus, Rosilda Thomas, Florence Masson, Agnes Ross, and Eleanor Ross had already been sent home. Three children had been sent to the Norway House Hospital namely, Nora Jane Ross, Stella Kespere, and Cellia Mamogesiac and on my return here I brought Etienne Froge with me for admission to hospital. I instructed the nurse to admit as patients in their infirmary, Julia Hastings, Theresa Thomas, Raymond Momias, Adele Trout, and John William McKay. These students had or have had very recently Erythema-Nodosum and were running temperatures. I instructed her to have Johnny Scotch, Richard Momias, Ross, and Ila Momias discharged from the School as they had not been accepted by the Department. This disposes of 16 children who together with the one child who died in the School with what I have every reason to believe was Tubercular Meningitis reduces the enrollment by 17.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCameron Corrigan M.D.\nOttawa,\nMay 5, 1943.\n\nMr. P.G.

It is usual in such cases to continue to allow the per capita grant for them. Unless other financial arrangements have been made by Dr. Corrigan I think that this is the practice that should be followed. From the information available the Department is not prepared to authorize their discharge from the school at the present time which would mean that no grant would be allowed for them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nNorway House, Man:\n24th April 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept' of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith the Quarterly Return for the Cross Lake R.C.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nSt. Joseph's Indian Residential School\nCross Lake, Man.\n\n17 April 1943\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Mines & Nat. Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter received two days ago from Mr. F.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent at Norway House, I am notified that the Department was not prepared to approve the Admission of Johnny Scatch, Illa Monias, and Frederick Ross to our School. The Agent quotes The Department's Letter No: 123-1-10 of the 1st of April 1943;-\n\n\"In view of the recent report of Dr. Corrigan regarding the health conditions at this school, The Department feels that it is inadvisable to admit any further children at the present time. Consequently we are not prepared to approve their admission.\"\n\nI wish to point out to the Department that these children were not admitted into the school since the recent visit of Dr. Corrigan but have been in the school since the 1st of October 1942. The Applications for Admission of these children could not be sent before, as I had to wait for the coming of the doctor to fill in the physical examination. The doctor came in the beginning of September and his next visit was only in March. Six months without the visit of the doctor seems to be too long.\n\nSince the visit of the doctor I have discharged two girls at the end of the March quarter. Then two boys and one girl have been sent to Norway House Hospital. Another girl who was sent to the hospital and was under doctor's examination for three weeks was sent back to her home by the doctor. I have also sent home two girls who had been sick for more than a month. In fact the doctor told me to send one home as he thought she had T.B.\n\nSo at present we have only 89 children in residence, counting Johnny Scatch, Illa Monias and Frederick Ross.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 1)\nWhen I received the notification from the Agent I could not send these three children home as their parents had gone away for rat hunting and I had no means to send them.\n\nSo as these children were not admitted into the school since the recent report of doctor Corrigan, but have been in since the 1st of October, and owing to the fact that I shall not be in a position to send them home until the return of their parents, at the end of May, I am kindly asking the Department to approve of their admission. Our school is approved for 100 children and at present even counting these three children we have only 89 in residence. Dr. Corrigan thought that if we had so much sickness lately, it was because our school was too crowded. The only reason, I think is that there has been an epidemic of influenza on the reserve since the middle of January which reached its peak in March. Nearly all the Indians had it twice and so the children. There was no doctor and no nurse on the reserve to stop this epidemic and the nurse of the school had more than she could do here. Even if she had wanted to try to do it, she did not have the medicines to do it.\n\nAs I could not send these children home and as it is expensive to keep them without receiving the grant, I hope that the Department will be prepared to approve their admission now.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.E. Trudeau, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. The health of the children seems to be fairly good now.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Nat.

Lasenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba,\n\nIn my letter of April 1st, I stated that the Department was not prepared to admit Johnny Seatch, Illa Monias, and Frederick Ross to the Cross Lake Residential School.

Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letters of October the 27th to Charlie Sinclair & Sandy Cook, I wish to let you know that these two men and all the members of their families are Catholics. These boys went astray and for a while joined the United Church but they soon found out their mistake and came back to the Catholic faith in which they had been brought up. Sandy Cook came back to his church three years ago and Charlie Sinclair one year and a half ago. I must point out also that Sandy Cook's wife and children were never members of the United Church but himself only.\n\nRegardless of this fact I don't see why you could refuse to these men the privilege to choose for their children the school where they want to send them, and this without being obliged to give their reasons for doing so.\n\nOn the application forms signed by the parents and witnesses it is said clearly to which religion the children belong, and the forms which are sent with the quarterly returns for the admission of the new children during the quarter also mention the religious denomination of the parents. As these are official documents I don't see why you have to write for some more explanations unless you do not consider these official documents to be truthful.\n\nAs for Christina Sinclair I told Charlie that she was under age but he insisted on having her in the school as he was hard up this year and did not want her to be destitute at home. In fact Charlie is very poor this winter as he has killed only one fox which is far from being sufficient to provide for himself and family.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned:- G.E. Trudeau O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nNorway House, Man:\n21st December 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith Applications for Admission to the Cross Lake R.C. Indian Residential School of the following children:\n\nMargaret Jane Cook\nEleanor Sinclair\nChristina Sinclair\n\nAs my office records showed the families to which these children belong, as belonging to the United Church, I wrote to the fathers in both cases for an explanation as to why they were applying to have their children admitted to the Catholic School. The Reverend Principal wrote me in reply to my letters, and I enclose herewith a copy of his letter of explanation.\n\nIt will be noted that Christina Sinclair is not quite six years of age, the date of birth given, being taken from this office records.\n\nKindly advise me in due course as to the Department's decision regarding these applications.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1944.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the applications for the admission of Margaret Jane Cook, Eleanor Sinclair and Christina Sinclair to the Cross Lake Residential School. I presume from your letter that you accept the information contained in Reverend Father Trudeau's letter as correct and, if so, these families are apparently recognized as Catholics.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Lazenby:\n\nRegarding the pupil 0175 Catherine Hastings as the Department did not want the children of God's Lake to come back to school this year and as I have heard that the Hastings family is infected with tuberculosis I have decided to discharge this girl. Unfortunately I have forgotten to put her on my list of the discharge of pupils for the December Quarterly Return. So I am forwarding you the two copies of the official discharge for her.\n\nI did not want to leave the girl any longer on the Records as I could take some new girl in while this one was not in residence.\n\nThere is another girl who was shown on my June Quarterly and by mistake was omitted on my September and December Quarterly Return. She is #0194 A Margaret Cook. Will you please ask the Department to pay us for the two Quarters in which this girl was in Residence as we can not afford to loose this amount. This girl is in Residence and her Admission to the School has been approved by the Department.\n\nSo I am sending you a Quarterly Return Form on which I am putting her for the two quarters she was in residence and not shown by mistake on the original quarterly Returns. The amount for the two quarters will be $87.50.\n\nAs Margaret Cook Number has been given to Frances Apitagan #0194 I am giving to Margaret Cook #0194\n\nHoping you will be able to obtain the payment for these two quarters as it would be too expensive in a mistake, when we are so short of money.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nG.

Trudeau, O.M.I.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr Philip Phelan's letter File 123-1-10 of January 24th, regarding pupil #0175 of the Cross Lake R.C.

Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, enclosing supplementary returns showing the attendance of Margaret Cook at the Cross Lake School for the September and December quarters.\n\nThe December quarter per capita allowance has now been paid as requested by the return previously submitted, but it is not our practice to make supplementary payments.\n\nHowever, when preparing the return for the quarter ended March 31, 1944, this girl's name should be included and grant should be requested for her for the September, December and March quarters. A note should appear opposite her name, in the space provided for that purpose, showing exactly why this extra payment is requested; namely, due to the fact that her name was omitted from previous returns.\n\nMargaret Cook on all future returns should be shown as No. 0194, as this was the number first given to her upon her entrance during the June, 1943, quarter.\n\nFrances Apitagan, who entered the school after Margaret Cook, should be shown on all future returns as pupil No. 0810. Please issue the necessary instructions to the Principal of the Cross Lake School immediately, in order that correct entries may be made on the March quarter return.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nMarch 7, 1944.\n\nMr. P.G.

Residential School the Department has received a request, I beg to say that the father of these children, Mr William D'Arcis, has given me the following information:\n\nThe ages of the children are as follows:\n\nElsie D'Arcis Age 11 Born 8th May 1933\nMargaret D'Arcis \" 7 Born 27th March 1937\nMay D'Arcis \" 4 Born 24th Sept: 1939\n\nThe mother of these children was Eva Bee, who was No; 115 Gods Lake Band. The mother died in January 1940, and her band number was deleted from the annuity pay list for 1941. William D'Arcis, the father, took Eva Bee off the Gods Lake reserve and lived with her without being married to her, and the above children are all illegitimate. None of the children have ever been received into membership of the Gods Lake Band, and have never been paid treaty annuity, and of course, they have no band number.\n\nThe above three children have the same status now, as the two children of Harry D'Arcis had before they were admitted to treaty as per Departmental letter 62-123 dated 18th September 1939, and who were admitted to treaty as members of Gods Lake Band under No; 77, the band number of their mother and later transferred to their own band numbers, 174 and 175 at the 1941 treaty payment.\n\nShould a vote of the Gods Lake Band be taken next treaty payment, in 1945, on the question of admitting the above three children to membership in the band under new band numbers? As stated above, the band number of their mother was deleted from the roll in 1941. When I receive the Department's reply, I will try to find William D'Arcis, the father of the children, who is at present on Lake Winnipeg, and have him sign applications for the admission of the children to Cross Lake School, though no band or band number could be stated on the applications at the present time.\n\nF.G. Izzenby\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1944.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to Elsie, Margaret and May D'Arcis. I have brought to the attention of the Trusts Branch your inquiry regarding the taking of a vote to admit them as members of the God's Lake Band. You will be advised regarding this by the Trusts Branch at a later date.\n\nIn the meantime it has been pointed out to us that these children require institutional care and, provided they are physically fit, the Department approves their admission to the Cross Lake Residential School. It should be understood, however, that this is only a temporary arrangement and, in the event of it being decided later that they are not wards of this Department, payment of the grant will be discontinued.

(RG 10, Volume 6261, file 577-10, part 2)\nNorway House, Man:\n8th January 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith another application for the admission to the Cross Lake Residential School, (Jack River, Norway House, Branch), of Elsie D'Arcis, who is not a treaty Indian.\n\nIn connection with this application, please refer to my letter of 15th December last, with which I forwarded applications for admission of this applicant's two sisters, May and Margaret, both these applications being recommended. The application for the admission of Elsie, however, though forwarded, was not signed by me, as the Doctor had stated that she had active tuberculosis. She was in hospital at that time. Dr Corrigan however now states that her condition has been arrested, and recommends that she be admitted to the school. This application is not signed by the father, as he died suddenly at God's Lake on December 6th last. The former application however was signed by the father.\n\nThese three children now have no parents, nor official guardians, and as they have all been in the Jack River School for over three years past, unofficially, I consider that they might now be admitted. The matter of their proposed admission into treaty is being dealt with in a separate letter.\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, February 12, 1945.\n\nMr. P. G. Lasenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the Department approves the temporary admission of Elsie D'Arcis to the Cross Lake Residential School. In this connection I would refer you to the second paragraph of my letter of August 31, 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nNorway House, Man:\n8th January 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept' of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to refer to Mr Philip Phelan's letter, File 123-1-10 dated 31st August 1944, in which he advises that he has brought to the attention of the Trusts Branch the matter of the advisability of taking a vote of the Indians of God's Lake Band regarding the proposed admission to treaty as members of God's Lake Band, the three children of William D'Arcis, who are named Elsie, Margaret, and May respectively.\n\nI have had no word from the Trusts Branch in connection with this matter as yet, and I have now to advise the Department that William D'Arcis, the father of these three children, died suddenly at God's Lake on December 6th last. They now have no parents or guardians, and this aspect of the matter should probably now be taken into consideration by the Trusts Branch.\n\nIf the Department approves of the taking of a vote to admit these three children as members of God's Lake Band, and the vote is favourable, should they be given a band number of their own, separate from any relatives that might still be living. The mother of these children, was a daughter of David Bee, No; 13 God's Lake Band. David himself died last January, but his wife is still living, though she is now about 85 years old.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 16, 1945.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq., Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of January 8th last, regarding the admission of Elsie, Margaret and Roy D'Arcis into the membership of the God's Lake Band.\n\nPlease forward a report giving all the particulars regarding these children, as it is our understanding that their mother lived for years as the common-law wife of William D'Arcis who was non-Indian.\n\nIt will not be necessary to have the Band vote on their admission, as the authority to admit to membership is vested in the Superintendent General, not in the Band. On receipt of your report their eligibility for membership will be considered and you will be advised as to the decision.\n\nJ. J.

Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 23, 1946.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Gross Lake R.C. Indian Residential School:\n\nJames Didymus,\nNorman James,\nJoseph Carlson Chubb,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDr. P.T. Moore,\nSuperintendent Indian Medical Services,\nDepartment National Health & Welfare,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Moore,\n\nI have just returned from a trip to Cross Lake where I checked over the schools. I found one thing which I did not think was quite right, namely that Day School pupils were being taken in the Boarding School. I believe there were 22 Day School students over and above the 90 students already in attendance as boarders. On top of this two or three of the 22 are non-treaty children. I consider this school already overcrowded as I have pointed out to the Department before. I believe this is a highly undesirable situation to exist, and in view of the fact that there is now in operation at Cross Lake a Public School, I see no reason that non-treaty children should be allowed to attend the boarding school. The same condition exists at the Roman Catholic boarding school at Norway House.\n\nI suppose I do not need to point out my opposition to this idea. But aside from the daily and constant exposure of a select group of children to the common acute infections they are exposed to such things as lice, scabies and impetigo with its resulting disadvantages. As a matter of fact this was how the matter was first drawn to my attention. I noticed that one of the Boarding School Students was lousy. Father Chamberland has told me it is a very bad arrangement to have day students and boarders mingling together, as it is so much harder to maintain discipline.\n\nI talked this matter over carefully with Indian Agent Goodman and we both believe this was a bad time at which to make any sudden or drastic change. With the advent of the Family Allowance, all children are compelled to go to school where schools are available, and this has necessitated the crowding in to the Boarding\nBoarding schools of day pupils. The fault is entirely our own as we have not sufficient day schools. For that reason I do not see why the Boarding Schools should be penalized in taking in these extra children. The Family Allowance Act states that children must attend schools only where schools are available and if the school is not available there is no reason that the allowance should not be paid. The Government cannot and will not deprive children of privileges because of its own neglect. In the case of the two non-treaty children at Gross Lake there is absolutely no reason why they should not be attending the Public School.\n\nCould I have your instructions on this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCameron Corrigan, BSc, MD.\nOttawa, April 2, 1946.\n\nDear Father Trudeau:\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Dr. Corrigan, directing our attention to the fact that 22 Indian children are attending the classrooms at the Cross Lake Residential School as day students. Of this number, two or three are non-Treaty children.\n\nCertainly, the non-treaty children should not be attending, and I doubt very much if it is advisable to have day students. There is always the danger of bringing contagious diseases into a residential school where the pupils are receiving special attention. I would appreciate hearing from you in the matter and I hope that you will be in a position to tell me that you have discontinued the day school pupils or that you will do so within the next month or so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend G.
