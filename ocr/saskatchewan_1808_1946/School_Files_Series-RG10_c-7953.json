In these different letters you mention various places where schools are required in your Agency.\n\nI have no doubt you are correct, but it must be distinctly understood by all parties concerned that in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48 we have only made provision for the erection of one school in your Agency (this means a classroom with teacher's living quarters attached).\n\nWhen preparing the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, we were confronted with dozens of requests for new schools all of which are, no doubt, necessary and will be built in time, but it was simply impossible to allot more than one to the Port Arthur Agency this year.\n\nWe were under the impression that you wanted the new school erected at Mission Bay. I refer to the school at which Mrs. Osborne is teaching and we have so notified the Survey and Engineering Branch.\n\nI thought you understood this, but possibly our previous letter was not fully explanatory and for that reason I am writing you again. If we are proceeding with the new school at Mission Bay, we cannot see any necessity for spending money on decorating the present school and residence, as requested in your letter of May 8th.\nIn view of what has just been said, we are not prepared to erect a school to replace the present Lake Helen School this year.\n\nIn your letter of May 7th you refer to Father Labelle who states that a school is required at Mountain Village. Is this the same place where a school was operated many years ago and which was finally closed in 1922. We have no recent correspondence about Mountain Village, if it is the same school as that to which I have just referred.\n\nWe have already written you regarding the situation at Aroland.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nPP/MED\nOttawa, May 31st, 1947.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence,\nI am forwarding to you under separate cover, plans and specifications of the building which we consider suitable for Mission Bay.\n\nIs there a contractor in the vicinity of Port Arthur who is prepared to tender on this building. If so, you might consult him and advise us. You understand, of course, that you cannot promise the business definitely as we have to secure an order in Council before any work can proceed.\n\nHowever, if we have the information requested in this letter it will be of considerable assistance to us and, naturally, the sooner we hear from you, the sooner we will be able to complete arrangements.\n\nYou will note that the plan and specifications read \"Serpent River School\". The reason for this is that it is a standard plan.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Mission Bay Indian Day School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of May 8th last relative to the above, we are advised that a large number of copies of plans and specifications for a typical one-room school have already been sent your Branch.\n\nIt would appear that this school is one of the class of buildings regarding which it was agreed upon recently that Indian Affairs Branch would undertake the construction in order to save time and that the responsibility of the Surveys and Engineering Branch in connection with the erection of such buildings would be limited to the furnishing of drawings and specifications and an inspection of the site if an officer was available.\n\nIn view of the foregoing and of the volume of work that must be carried out by our still inadequate Architectural Staff, it is thought you will wish to have the construction of this school undertaken directly by your Branch.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nYour letter of May 31st reached the Department while I was absent on holiday. At the present time Colonel Neary is absent from duty on leave. However, I have reviewed a number of our files and I cannot find any further letter from you in connection with the erection of a school at Mountain Village. You refer to this in your letter of May 31st.\n\nWe have plans and specifications for a combined one room school and teacher's residence. Possibly Colonel Neary has already sent these to you but I cannot find any record of it.\n\nWe are anxious to know if you can interest any contractor in building this building. If there is any prospect of having it erected within the next few months please let us hear from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MD\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 497-5, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 26th, I am enclosing estimates for the new Mission Bay Indian Day School.\n\nMay I point out that running water is approximately 150 feet from the chosen site for this school and the soil is sandy. I would strongly recommend that water be supplied to the school and also running-water toilets for the teacher's residence be installed. I am informed by the Contractor that the difference in cost would not be great and estimates for these installations are included.\n\nElectric power also is approximately 100 feet from the school. If the Department approves of wiring the school, separate estimates can be mailed at a future date.\n\nIn conclusion, I regret that I did not secure the plans for this school at an earlier date. It has been extremely difficult to find a contractor, as so much building is going on in the Twin Cities, but I will endeavour to secure another price.\n\nJ.G.

You will note that it calls for the construction of a one-room Indian day school with teacher's residence for $16,240.00, or, using concrete blocks for the basement, $15,900.00.\n\nAs we included only the sum of $6,000.00 for these one-room schools in our estimates, we would appreciate your immediate advice as to whether we should accept this contract.\n\nEnc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 497-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAugust 19, 1947.\n\nMemo\n\nIndian Day Schools\nMission Bay, Port Arthur Indian Agency, Ont.\nLake St. Martin, Fortescue Prairie Indian Agency, Man.\n\nIn connection with the above schools, we have examined the information contained in Mr. Hoey's memoranda, each of which was dated the 5th instant.\n\nIt is noted that for the first named building at Mission Bay, Ontario, W.A.

I do not feel it would be to the credit of our Department to have the school lighted by lamps and more especially with outside toilets, when modern facilities are at hand. The electric light is within approximately 100 feet of the school site and water approximately 125 feet. The approximate cost of installing a toilet, bathtub, hand basin and septic tank for the teacher would not exceed $400.00. If the Department would consider putting in an extra toilet for the school children, I could secure prices and forward them by airmail.\n\nI would appreciate, very much, a reply to my letter of August 2nd regarding the above.\n\nIn conclusion, may I also point out it has always been very difficult to secure wood for the kitchen stove for the school.

The lease, of course, would be negotiated with the local Indian Band, and would be of such a nature as to give them good financial assistance.\n\nThe purpose of this lease was to permit local authorities to develop the area at once, pending the investigation of this property and additional property as national park - a matter which we will consider at a later date.\n\nIt was noted at the meeting that the Indian Department is planning to erect a school on the property, and the suggestion was made that this school would be more picturesque if it were designed in logs rather than a conventional siding.\n\nWe would be very pleased if you would lend support to our suggestions as contained in this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, the Minister of Labour may declare the wages payable for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or fixed thereby by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister of Finance to pay such wages and hours and classification, or any part thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post Schedule (a) and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this Contract, the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to each, open for inspection by such officers of the Board as may be appointed by the Board; such inspection record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which Parliament would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work, labour etc., and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statement declaration setting forth: (1) the number and description of hands and various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrear; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; and in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour that the work has been completed and adjusted, the Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim for default of thereof is filed in the place of the Minister, the provisions of the Act shall apply thereto, and the Minister during the period the Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys collected at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as if such moneys were payable to them in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of all disputes which might arise from defective, the subcontractor shall be deemed to be undertaking that unless other than the such may be customary in the trades concerned, subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to conform to the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for the acts and omissions of subcontractors on the part of such subcontractor's contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work contemplated in and to be executed under this contract shall be Canadian citizens or residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

The septic tank, which includes one bathtub, hand basin, kitchen sink, toilet, hot-water tank and the septic disposal unit, would cost $500.00.\n\nI would strongly recommend installing an iron fireman as I find, from past experience, that it is extremely difficult to obtain a uniform heat when firing by hand, and the difference in the price of coal would pay for an iron fireman over a period of five years. I would recommend bin-fed which can be installed for $490.00 or hopper-fed at $395.00.\n\nWould you kindly confirm the above, as the electric wiring should be installed early next week.\n\nThe cost of connecting the water to the school is $50.00.\n\nJ.

We have now received a letter from Indian Agent Burk pointing out that this particular school is located at close proximity to a white community. The Agent therefore recommends that instead of erecting outside toilets, inside plumbing be provided. The Hydro line runs close to the school and the Agent suggests that electricity be installed in the school.\n\nIn view of the above I would appreciate it if you would approve the following extras to the contract already signed:\n\n(1) Wiring school and connecting with the Hydro line - $498.\n\n(2) Bath tub, hand basin, kitchen sink, toilet, hot water tank and septic disposal unit - $500.\n\nPP/MSD\n\nDirector\nOttawa, November 17, 1947.\n\nMr. J. G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario:\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing an account from Meyer School Supplies for desks shipped to the Longlac Indian Day School.\n\nIn your letter you referred to P.O. 22262. In this case, I would point out that this purchase order number was issued to Vilas Furniture Company, Cowansville, Quebec. Evidently, they delivered the eighteen desks as you forwarded voucher No. 1059 dated October 19, 1947 and a cheque for $274.50 has been forwarded to the company. We have no record of having issued a Purchase Order for desks to the Meyer School Supply Company.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/IM\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. B. F. Neary\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letter of November 12th, regarding new desks for the new Mountain Village School, on the Fort William Reserve.\n\nIn reply, I wish to refer you to my letter of November 5th and your communication of November 17th, 9-5-5 (WT), re desks shipped to the Longlac Indian Day School. I wrote the Principal and requested the size of desks required; apparently, she ordered the desks directly from Moyer School Supplies Limited. Thus, the duplication in this order. The Principal states she received 36 desks instead of 18.\n\nHowever, the extra 18 desks in storage at the Longlac Indian Day School could be shipped to our warehouse, for use in the Mountain Village School. As 25 desks are required at this school, only 7 desks extra need be ordered. Would you, therefore, advise if it would be in order to voucher the invoice for 18 desks from Moyer School Supplies immediately. The size of the seven desks required is as follows:\n\n3 only Model \"W\" Chair Desks - #1 (large)\n4 only Model \"W\" Chair Desks - #3 (medium)\n\nWith reference to the blackboards, chalk trough and moulding, this information is being obtained and will be forwarded at the earliest possible date.\n\nJ.

The Hydro line runs close to the school and the Agent suggests that electricity be installed in the school.\n\nIn view of the above I would appreciate it if you would approve the following extras to the contract already signed:\n\n(1) Wiring school and connecting with the Hydro line - $498.\n\n(2) Bath tub, hand basin, kitchen sink, toilet, hot water tank and septic disposal unit - $500.\n\nAPPROVED\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nOttawa, December 9, 1947.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 29th regarding the new Mountain Village School, the Minister has approved the following extras to the contract.\n\n(1) Wiring school with electricity and connecting with the Hydro line - - - - - $496.\n\n(2) Supply and install bath tub, hand basin, kitchen sink, toilet, hot water tank and septic disposal unit - - - - - - - - - - - $500.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of connecting the water to the school will be $50.00 and this expenditure is also approved.\n\nWe are not prepared to supply the Iron Fireman at the present time.\n\nBernard F.

Assuming we secure a janitor to look after the furnace, it would cost approximately $120.00 a year. Over a period of four years, we would have expended $480.00. The saving on fuel is approximately $54.00 per year which would mean a saving of $216.00 over a period of four years, bringing the total saving over a period of four years, to $390.00.\n\nTwo local firms would be willing to install a bin feed iron fireman immediately, and render their account next April.

A distance of four miles separates the two Indian Day Schools on this reservation. Mrs. Osborne said she did hope the Department would recommend an iron fireman. She is one of the best teachers we have ever had in the Agency, and if it is at all possible, I would appreciate if an iron fireman could be installed.\n\nJ.G.

Consequently it will be necessary to install a sump pump. I will be pleased to receive the necessary authorization to complete this work.\n\nIf funds are not available in this year's estimates, the pump could be installed and paid from the 1948 estimates.\n\nJ.G. Burk,\nSuperintendent.\nMr. J. G. Burk,\nSupervisor of Indians,\nCustoms Building,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn line with our conversation, re Mountain Village School.\n\nAs you know there is no natural drainage in this area, it will be necessary to have a Sump pump installed in the basement.\n\nWe will make necessary Sump Pit connecting to the tile drainage system under the floor, instal Sump Pump, cut necessary hole in concrete wall for discharge pipe, supply and instal necessary discharge pipes and prepare sufficient surface drain from end of discharge pipe.\n\nFor the above work, we can supply all necessary material and labour for the sum of One Hundred and Forty-five Dollars ($145.00)\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Joe Skopyk\"\nOttawa, March 16, 1948.\n\nMr. N.V. Feltier, Clerk in Charge,\nIndian Agency, Port Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWe are disappointed to learn from your letter of the 13th instant that the new Mountain Village School has been erected on low land and consequently that a sump pump will be required for drainage purposes.\n\nWas it not possible to obtain a better location so that the drainage would be satisfactory? However, I suppose there is nothing much can be done about the matter now and the only thing we can do is authorize the installation of the sump pump. It is noted that the cost of the necessary labour and materials will be $145.00. An expenditure of this amount is approved.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MDG\nMarch 8, 1948.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Port Arthur, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you advise that Mrs. Genevieve Slenski is unable to accept a position as teacher in an Indian school at the present time.\n\nAs previously decided, we feel that Mrs. Osborne should continue in charge of the Mission Bay School until the end of June. We cannot see any advantage in transferring her so close to the end of the current academic year.\n\nIf you can locate a teacher we would be prepared to approve an appointment at the Mountain Village School for the balance of the current academic year.\n\nIt appears from your letter that the building will not be completed for some weeks.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MOD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMountain Village I.D. School,\n\nYour letter under date of March 16th to hand at this Agency, in acknowledgment of Mr. Burk's letter and we note your authorization for the purchase of a sump-pump.\n\nConcerning your comments on the drainage problem, it appears there was no alternative but to erect the school in this location. The terrain of the Mountain Village Section of the Fort William Reserve is not in consonance with the given name, and is low lying land. However, to complement this, the school is otherwise ideally situated in an advantageous location and much favourable comment should be heard from all who see it.\n\nI have spoken to the contractors and have their assurance that they will be all through at the school about a week in advance of the stipulated date, which I understand is 31st March. If we had a teacher, it would be fitting should one of your officials in this section be on hand for the opening. However, we have no teacher, and in any event it is unlikely that the time could be spared, for the occasion is not so auspicious as to warrant the loss of time by anyone from HQ's at this busy time of year.\n\nN.V.

He has assured us that he will remedy the window situation at once, and that he will approach the sub-contractor who did the excavation to have him level off the pile of excavated earth. There still will remain a large amount of ground work, and landscaping to be done, as stated by Mr. Doucet.

I was unable to meet the Contractor while there but I left instructions with the Clerk as Mr. Burk was absent, to have these windows changed. It is essential to have fresh air in the bedroom.\n\nThe school itself has been very well built and the Contractor has done a commendable job. Unfortunately, the school has been set a little low. It could very easily have been two feet higher which would have avoided the necessity of a sump pump and at the same time would have improved the ground. The levelling off should be done by the Contractor. There is a small hill which drains towards the school. This may have to be levelled. I have asked the Clerk to have an estimate made and submit it to this office for consideration.\n\nI also visited the Mission Bay Day School and there interviewed Mrs. Augustine Osborne.\nI do not see any objection to transferring her to the Mountain Village School. She appears to be active and her principles of education are sound. Possibly, a younger person could contribute more towards the activities of the school but the dearth of teachers, I believe, make it necessary to give her this consideration.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J.

S. PIPER & SONS,\nper \"Allan C. Piper\"\nPort Arthur, Ontario\n27th September, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario\n\nAttention: Educational Division\n\nThis Agency already has on record authority from you for the purchase of required window blinds for the new Mountain Village School on the Fort William Reserve.\n\nActually, to date no such purchase has been made as we decided it would be better if the incoming teacher would make her own selections to her own likes and dislikes. Mrs. Osborne, the teacher, has been shopping around and we have obtained a quotation from a Fort William merchant, a copy of which is enclosed. It will be perceived from the quotation that Mrs. Osborne is intent upon having a well-made Venetian blind. While the price of these blinds may seem high in comparison with those regularly obtained, if the matter is looked at from a long-range viewpoint, undoubtedly, economy would be effected; this is not also to mention the added beauty to the school.\n\nBefore proceeding to purchase these blinds, we thought it would be well to seek your advice and it may be that you wish to check prices with the departmental purchasing officer. Your comments at an early date will be appreciated.\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nSuperintendent.\nSeptember 30, 1948.\n\nMr. J.G. Burk,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th instant, the Department is not prepared to authorize the amount required to supply venetian blinds at the Mountain Village School.\n\nAs previously authorized, ordinary blinds should be purchased.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MDG\n### Invoice 1\n\n**Date:** Sept. 2  \n**Invoice Number:** #9027  \n**To:** The Department of Mines & Resources  \n**Fort William Agency**\n\n| Articles                  | Credit Amount | Debt Amount | Total   |\n|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------|\n| 1 gallon glo-coat         |               |             |         |\n| 1 broom                   |               |             |         |\n| 1 dust pan                |               |             |         |\n| 2 jumbo Rinso             |               |             |         |\n| 1 mirror                  |               |             |         |\n| 1 sink stopper            |               |             |         |\n| 1 small S. driver         |               |             |         |\n| 1 small S. driver         |               |             |         |\n| 1 hammer                  |               |             |         |\n| 1 qt. window cleaner      |               |             |         |\n| handicloth                |               |             |         |\n| fryer                     |               |             |         |\n\nTotal: $10.13\n\n---\n\n### Invoice 2\n\n**Date:** Sept. 11  \n**Invoice Number:** #9367  \n**To:** The Department of Indian Affairs  \n**New Mission School**\n\n| Articles                          | Credit Amount | Debt Amount | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|-------------|---------|\n| 8-1 X 12 F.H. wood screws        |               |             |         |\n| 5/8 X 8 socket head wood screws  |               |             |         |\n| 2 only mats, @ .50                |               |             |         |\n| 1 enamel cup                      |               |             |         |\n| 2 towel racks, @ 1.00            |               |             |         |\n| 1 soap dish                       |               |             |         |\n| 2 night locks, @ 4.75             |               |             |         |\n| 4 sheets sandpaper                |               |             |         |\n| 1 coal scuttle                    |               |             |         |\n\nTotal: $14.75\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: R.

Also involved was the digging of latrine trenches underneath our toilet, as the cans which were supplied were very unsanitary and also presented a disposal problem.\n\nFurther work involved cutting of grass in the school area, and the hauling of gravel for the toilet beds. A payroll showing labour with team also is involved. A start has been made to landscape the grounds, the need of which was noted by Mr. Doucet on his last visit to the school.\n\nThis work was carried out in a period just before and just following the school opening. May the covering cheques be forwarded to the men in the care of this Agency as soon as possible, please.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. G.

Kresge Co., A/c., $13.29,\nMountain Village School.\n\nOur V't No.100, with the above account was sent by you to Mr. F. Matters, North Bay, and he has sent it on to us, stating that the items invoiced fail to correspond with the authorization, (ref. your 497-5, E.l, d/26 Jan.)\n\nWith reference to the whisks, apparently this was discussed with Mrs. Osborne by Mr. Matters when he visited the school. She explained that for quick removal of snow from the children they were required. Otherwise, with one whisk, school would be delayed many minutes while snow was being whisked from the children. Also one was for casual cleaning. He apparently concurred with their purchase and also the purchase of the tumblers.\n\nSeveral minor items amounting to around $1.00 were purchased by Mrs. Osborns, such as the six paint brushes at total of 50\u00a2, 10\u00a2 glue, 10\u00a2 ribbon. The paint brushes and glue she stated she required at once; undoubtedly she might have waited for authority for the purchase of paper plates at 45\u00a2, but except for this item, I feel the account is in order to be passed for payment.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 497-5, part 2)\nThe whiskers etc. had been purchased before I visited the school.\n\nThe teacher was informed to requisition for everything required in future and I concurred in the purchases that had been made - I recommend payment of the account.\nTo: Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMaintenance Work,\nMountain Village School.\n\nMrs. A. Osborne, teacher at the above school, has asked that certain repair work be carried out, as follows, and may we have your authority, please?\n\nShe asks for a step-ladder of sufficient length to enable the walls and ceiling to be cleaned. The ceiling is quite hard to reach and the step-ladder would solve this, and also be useful in many other ways.\n\nShe asks to have the windows above the blackboard open, so that proper ventilation can be assured.\n\nShe can hire an Indian who is a fair carpenter to do this first job, supplying materials, at an estimated cost of $6.00. The second job is a minor one and we do not anticipate any charge for it, but in case unforeseen difficulties are encountered, an open authority for $2.00 is recommended.\n\nMay we also have authority to purchase locally at 75-lb. drum of dustbane, at estimate cost of $5.25, for this school? This should last the better part of one school term and Mrs. Osborne is anxious to keep dust down in the school in the interests of cleanliness and general health.\n\nJ.G.

It is well located on the highway one and a half miles from the outskirts of Fort William. The only difficulty is with regard to the drainage of the basement and the school yard. In the spring there is seepage from the mountain back of the school and it will probably be necessary to run a tile drain across the playground.\n\nThere is electricity and running water in this school with a flush toilet for the teacher. There are dry closets for the children.\n\nTeacher\nMrs. Osborne is over 70 years of age but is still a very efficient and capable teacher. Her children tested well and it is obvious that she is in complete control of the classroom. Her teaching methods are fairly modern and she handles her class well.\n\nRecommendations\n1.

I wish to assure you that I appreciate this action on your part.\n\nUnfortunately, I was grounded, because of adverse flying conditions, at Armstrong, where I am putting up a building for the Ontario Department of Public Works, and was unable to get through to Fort Frances. I sent a query to the Superintendent of your Indian Agency, at Fort Frances, requesting certain information regarding the conditions. However, he seemed to feel bound by the general conditions of the tender to not make any statement. This has caused me to feel that there must be some type of difficulty to be encountered at this site, and I, therefore, feel it would be unwise for me to make any tender until I have made thorough examination of the location, as instructed by Specifications.\n\nI shall proceed to examine this site on my next trip to Fort Frances, and if, for any reason, the contract for this job is deferred, I would appreciate your giving me an opportunity to place my tender, if same is called at a future date.\n\nAgain expressing my appreciation for your extension, and my regret for being unable to have my tender in your hands, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPHIL SPENCE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD.\n\nPhil Spence\nPresident\n\nPHS:jbb\nJune 1, 1949.\n\nPhil Spence Construction Company, Limited,\nBurney Building,\nFort William, Ontario.\n\nNorthwest Bay Indian Bay School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 26 and regret that you were unable to submit a tender for the construction of this school.\n\nI note that you were grounded because of adverse flying conditions at Armstrong, Ontario.\n\nThe official opening of tenders has now taken place and the necessary submission to Council has been prepared.\n\nI hope that you will be able to tender on other building projects for our Indian schools in your area.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. LOCKHART\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      |         |        |\n|      |         |        |\n|      |         |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

It is true that transportation of material to this reserve is quite difficult, however this problem was well known to those tendering in the first place. I have no doubt that if we had not started to build a road into this Reserve that the school would of been built by this time. Good progress is being made on the road but it will not be finished this fall.\n\nI understand from Mr. Tompkins that he is writing further to the Department.\n\nJ.F. Lockhart,\nSupt.

Also, his letter states that the material could be taken in over the ice next spring, but if ice conditions next spring are the same as we had last spring this would be impossible due to slush conditions on the ice.\n\nI cannot understand why this firm should stall as both bidders contemplated barging in the material from Fort Frances when they submitted their tenders, and the building of the road into the Reserve should have no bearing on building the school at this time.\n\nThe letter from Tompkins' Hardware Ltd. is returned herewith.\n\nJ.F.

I think one should be built on the Rainy River at or near Long Sault Rapids and also one at or near Whitefish Bay on the Lake of the Woods. Rivers River on Lake Winnipeg should also have a school of this kind.\n\n(sgd) John Semmens.\nWinnipeg, Feb. 6th., 1907.\n\nA very earnest request was made for a Government Boarding School.\n\nIt is claimed in support of this that Norway House Boarding School is always over full. And that when Indian children are taken from their natural surroundings to St. Boniface or Brandon Industrial Schools that they are given false ideas of life, longing for those things which they cannot obtain, and without a single exception those who have returned from these Industrial Schools are utterly worthless and depraved. They therefore ask that the day school may be closed on account of the pernicious absence of children from the school they are not doing sufficient good work. And that a Boarding School may be established where children will be kept in their natural surroundings in touch with their own people and customs and continually under the care and guidance of an efficient staff.\n\nOn being assured at Berens River that all the Indians were absent from Bloodvein Reserve and Jackhead Reserve we went direct to Fisher River arriving Jan. 32nd.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSgd.

Even so long ago we realized the need. And now we feel it more than ever before.\n\nAbout this time last year - in a Council Meeting at which Mr. Simmons Inspector of Indian Affairs was present we were unanimous in making request that a good Boarding School be established at Barrie River - one large enough to accommodate children from some of the surrounding Reserves as well as our own. We have spoken with the Chiefs or head men of these Reserves and they agree with us that Barrie River is being central, and accessible for freight is a good place for such a school and they say they will be only too glad to put our children...\nWe beg leave to add, that we have already shown what we consider a good site for the school (160 acres of land just east of the Methodist mission property). This much land, or more if necessary, we are willing to give in connection with the Boarding School which we hope soon to see.\n\nAnd inasmuch as the Methodist Church has for the past thirty years\u2014and more\u2014been ministering to our spiritual needs and is still the only church having a resident missionary here at Bear River or anywhere near\u2014and as our present day school, and also the day schools where any in neighboring Reserves\u2014such head Anglican\u2014now closed\u2014only excepted; have all been conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, we would respectfully request that any Indian Boarding School to be erected here (unless it is to be conducted as a purely Government School and undiscriminatory) be placed under the auspices of the said Methodist Church.\n\nSigned\n\nJacob Burns Chief X mark\n\nWm.

This block of land contains about 320 acres exclusive of the Methodist Mission property of 77.15 acres.\n\nWe also agree to provide 80 pupils for this school one year after we have notice that this boarding school is to be built and we further promise to keep this school full of pupils as long as we have sufficient children on the above mentioned Reserves.\n\nWe also agree that we will not ask for any day school on any of the above Reserves.\n\nWe sign this request and promises believing them to be binding upon our successors in office and in harmony with the wish of a very large majority of our people.\n\n(Sgd.)

It does not appear that it will be possible to get a grant for this purpose this present year. There is a large building there which has been used by the Dominion Government as a fish hatchery. Would it be possible to utilize this building for the time being and commence the school therein with the distinct understanding that the arrangement is only temporary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will be as well to enquire whether the building mentioned is at all suitable for the purpose. It would, I presume, need remodelling, as it would probably cost a considerable amount to change a fish-hatchery into an Indian Boarding School. The Methodist Mission has been established for a long time on this Reserve and the Church is anxious to erect a Boarding School, but owing to the standard we have laid down for buildings of this class, I think it is doubtful if we should begin the school under the circumstances mentioned.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, February 21, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department is given to understand that your Department has at Berens River a building formerly used as a fish hatchery which is not now in use.

It might be raised and placed upon a concrete basement. The most of the basement could be above ground. The present ceiling could be lowered and thus give more room in the rooms above. An addition might be made to the rear of the building. The steam boiler that is there is in very good condition and could be used for heating. There is enough land surrounding the building for playgrounds, flower-beds, etc., and I understand that the people are willing to give more land to be used for stable, barn, etc. The problem for water and sewerage is easily solved.\n\nI do not think that this could be made as satisfactory as a new building on another site. At the same time it might be well for the Department to consider the advisability of utilizing this building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIndian Affairs.

SIR,\n\nReferring to the engagement of Mrs. Lowes as teacher of the Berens River school I beg to say that this appointment is confirmed and the Department will pay an initial salary of $400.00 per annum. Mrs. Lowes has been communicated with in reference to her work and advised as to the salary that she will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. McLean\n\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nREV. T. Perrier,\nMgr., of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nBerens River - Manitoba\nDecember 29th 1910\n\nMr. L. H. McLean\nSecretary Dept.\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nYour letter of November 29th received and contents noted.\n\nAs I have been asked to give a report of educational conditions on this Reserve I may say first - so far as I can see from my two years' observation on the Reserve, that the Day School are a failure in educating the children. Of course there are always two or three families who are glad to avail themselves of the advantages of the Day School. There are on this Reserve about seventy children of school age. This quarter I have fifty-six on the register with an average attendance of fifteen to sixteen each. This is the largest enrollment since March 1907. I believe the large number enrolled is partly due to the services of the native policeman who has been visiting the houses and persuading the people to send their children to school.\nThere are many reasons why the children do not attend regularly. Perhaps the chief reason is the indifference of the parents. Many of them live quite a distance from the school, and when the tracks are bad, or the weather stormy, the children cannot come. Some of them are not properly clothed. There were several this winter who could not have attended if Mr. Lowe had not supplied them with clothing.\n\nAnother reason for poor attendance are the fishing seasons. About the middle of May and sometimes earlier, the people leave their homes and move to the mouth of the river; where they remain until August. The distance is too great for any to attend school. They are home only a short time after this, until they are away again for fall fishing. Very soon after that the river freezes, and then there is a time again when they cannot attend. During two or more weeks last fall, the were not more than five in attendance.\n\nThe weather was so mild, the ice was not safe to cross. Every year is not as bad as the last one. Hunting also takes some of the people away. Every winter some of the families leave the Reserve for weeks and camp several miles away, the men only returning to trade their furs and meat.\n\nCompulsory attendance at Day School (when possible) would certainly help to a great degree; but the very best improvement would be a Boarding School on the Reserve and the attendance made...\nI spent about a year and a half in the Norway House Boarding School and could see the good it did not only to the children in the school, but also as an example to all on the Reserve. In the Boarding Schools they learn English for the reasons that they hear it all day and are compelled to speak it. In the Day Schools it is almost impossible to make them use the English they know; and when they leave school in the afternoon, they hear nothing but their own language. The people on this Reserve and also on the Red River Reserve will not send their children to the Industrial Schools. We have been here a year and a half and were at Oxford House three years, and although Mr. Louie did his very best he was not able to secure one child for the Industrials.\n\nIn reference to a mid-day meal being served in the school room\u2014would a teacher be expected to do the work without extra remuneration? No matter how simple the meal might be I cannot see how a teacher would be able to prepare it without taking time from the regular school hours. It would be quite impossible to prepare and serve a meal in the school-room here. However, the old School House is close to the one in present use and could easily be fitted up. Cooking utensils, stove, table and a few other articles would be needed. There are two or three Indian women who could be hired (say a week or two at a time) to prepare the meal under the superintendence of the teacher.\nIn absence of the teacher I feel certain the supplies could not be procured here this year at least. The Hudson Bay Co. trading post is the base of supplies on the Reserve and as a rule they Co. themselves are short by the time the spring boat arrives.\n\nI trust you will find this letter satisfactory and at least some slight assistance.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nHenriette A. Lewis\n(Mrs. J. W. Lewis)\nOttawa, February 7, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your very interesting report on the educational conditions on the Berens River reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department fully realizes the difficulties that confront a teacher in obtaining even an approximately full and regular attendance of children at the day school. However, even in the northern districts there are successful day schools and the Department hopes that you will be able through your efforts to produce a decided improvement on this reserve.\n\nIn regard to the mid-day meal it is noted that supplies cannot be had this year, but Mr. Calverley will be asked to bear this in mind next year. I may say that this meal as a general thing is served either in the school-room itself or, when such is available, in an adjoining building. The teachers who are now doing this work have not asked the Department for extra remuneration. The work is performed by the older girls under the supervision of the teacher and forms part of the regular programme. In some cases where the attendance is very large it has been found necessary to engage the services of an assistant, but this is rarely done. I may add that the object of the Department is not to give a full meal to the pupils, but rather\n\nMrs. B. Lowes,\nTeacher,\nBerens River Indian School,\nBerens River, Man.\nrather to supply something in the way of soup, etc., to supplement the lunches brought by them from home.\n\nThe Department would be glad to hear from you again at an early date in regard to the progress being made in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, February 7, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nSometime ago the Department wrote to Mrs. Lowe, the new teacher of the Barren River school, in reference to the supplying to a mid-day lunch to the children. Mrs. Lowe states that it would be impossible to obtain the supplies from the Hudson's Bay Company at the present time and I have to ask you, when you visit the reserve next summer, to look carefully into this matter. It might be necessary to supply a small cook stove and to have a table and some benches made. Some simple dishes also would be necessary. Mrs. Lowe states that the old school-room could be used as a dining-room.\n\nYou will be good enough, therefore, to report fully and the Department will be glad to have any recommendations that you may have to make. These should be received in time to have the supplies ordered and sent in next fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. G. Galway, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Keewatin.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of FEB 7th 1911\n\nNo. 118276/1 I beg to state that I have received notice that I will not pay at Berens River next summer. For the mid day lunch a stove will be necessary. Tables and benches could be made at Berens River if material were supplied.\n\nI have received no school reports from this place for some time so cannot judge the proper amount of supplies to estimate.\n\nMrs. MESSER, who has had considerable experience in Indian work is at Berens River and I would suggest that THE DEPARTMENT apply to her for a suitable supply and quantity for the proposed mid day lunch.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSIR\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of February 7.\n\nIn regard to the serving of a mid-day meal, I may say again, I do not think, in fact I may feel sure, a teacher could not do it and the class-room work also. That is and attend to the work properly. I have had enough of experience with new Indian girls, to know how much or rather how little they can do about cooking etc.\n\nOlder girls are mentioned as helpers if you will notice by my return, there are but three girls over twelve years of age, who come to school or are at all likely to attend.\n\nIf I may be allowed to suggest a plan, it would be this\u2014that the teacher be given a certain amount of money with which she could hire an assistant from among the women on the Reserve. This would not be necessary the whole term, but during December, March and part of April, January.\n\nTo be quite frank, I might say, the only way to\nKeep the children at school certain times of the year, would help to feed the families. The parents will have the reserves, at least in this part of the country. This cannot be helped, so long as their means of livelihood is such as fishing and hunting. What is really needed and very badly needed is a Boarding School.\n\nI understand that in the White Schools in Manitoba they are granting a weeks holiday during Easter. Does this rule apply to Indian Day Schools? What stated holidays are thus for these schools?\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nHenriette S. Louie\n(Mrs. J. H. Louie)\nOttawa, May 15, 1911.\n\nIndian,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th ultimo in further reference to the matter of supplying a mid-day meal at the Berens River day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the existing difficulties both in respect to obtaining food supplies and also having the work done, the Department has decided to abandon the proposition for the present.\n\nIn reference to the matter of holidays I beg to say that Indian schools are required to be kept open 216 days in the year as you will see by reference to the quarterly return forms. The Department hopes at no distant date to formulate a set of regulations in regard to holidays and other matters of interest to Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Post here, and more south at Blood Vein River.\n\nWell I seem that Mr. Macrae has just had a telegraph from Ottawa asking him to suspend operations, or be prepared to stop. I had some conversation with him yesterday and have no doubt we could secure some of his supplies very cheaply. Only we would want your approval and instructions first. Think I am right in saying, that aside from our own supplies, the plan would not cost the Department more than $100 for each teaching day, if indeed that much; and that would be just for necessary help as we have but few school-pails large enough to be of much use at cooking.\n\nOn this Reserve we have well over seventy-five or eighty pupils of school age, and most of them I think, would do well to attend pretty regularly this winter provided a hot meal could be served up at the noon hour.\n\nOn account of the very low prices for fuel, the Indians are not as likely to be away trapping this winter, and on account of that, and the higher price of provisions (owing to the war and perhaps other causes too) they are likely to be rather \"hard up,\" and therefore would all the more appreciate anything that might be done to help them or their children. So I hope the Department will help us in the experiment of these meals, at least for this coming winter.\n\nP.S. Am sending our local Indian Agent a copy of this and just await your approval.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nJoseph H. Lowes\nMethodist Missionary\nLater (Oct 4th)\n\nSince writing you on the 26th Sept there has been no boat calling at Bear River by which we could get our mail. There is a narrow way and the rail-road cut on the lake & such a passing steamer that might take his letters but I did not at the time know of that chance nor can I say yet if he succeeded.\n\nIf anything is to be done about furnishing a hot and dry meal pupils attending our Indian Day School here it should be done without delay. After both cease to call there will be no means of communication with the outside world until sometime in December when fortnightly mail by dog train begins.\n\nJoseph H. Lowe\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago your Department wrote the teacher of our Indian Day School here on the subject of the serving up of a hot midday meal. Our teacher at that time did not see her way clear to do this. There seemed to be too many difficulties in the way. It has been about two or three years ago I think.\n\nSince then, some of these difficulties have either been removed, or do not now seem to us so great.\n\nAlso the advantages of the plan appear to us more now than they did then; so that we feel disposed to put this plan of the Department into trial this winter.\n\nI speak for the teacher as well as for myself.\n\nI have also consulted with the Chief of this Band (Chief James Burns) and can say that he heartily approves. Moreover, he has promised for his Band that they will plaster and fix up the old day school as a dining room\u2014it stands just beside the new frame building.\n\nOf course we would require good supplies and some cooking utensils\u2014and it is now getting late in the season, so in fact near the close of navigation on Lake Winnipeg for this year.\n\nBut it so happens that Mr. Harnaway of the Dominion Lands Survey is now in this neighborhood with his party.

I may say that they are not favorable to going to the trouble and expense of cooking a hot meal. Personally I endorse the position they take. However, we have decided to compromise in a way that will be very much better, both for the Department and the School. It is that the Department supplement the usual supply of hard tack biscuits with, say, an equal quantity of mixed biscuits such as Cream Sodas, Sultanas, Abernethy, Fruit Gingerbread Biscuits, with possibly tea and Bovril. This last was suggested by Dr. Grain, who was present when we were discussing the question.

Mr. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, in a recent communication in regard to this school, suggests that a team of ponies be provided to be used in winter for bringing the children to school who are living at some distance from the school. The Department would like to have a report from you in regard to this suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. H. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRodgson P.O., Man.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the Beren's River School, I most respectfully beg to state that I am convinced that the attendance there has developed into a contest between the adherents of the Methodist and Catholic Churches respectively.\n\nMy office, if nothing else, prohibits me from taking sides with either, it being impossible to be fair to one without being just to all and it appears impossible for justice to be done so long as any Church has any power or influence, whatever in the day schools in the reserves. In the industrial schools it is a different matter, the Indians have a choice and can send their children to an industrial school managed by people of their own faith. I know the Department only grant to the Churches the privilege of appointing the teacher, but this courtesy is often sadly presumed upon and overreached, for in spite of our so called civilization and christianity we are apt to get narrowminded, and perhaps it is only natural, and therefore to be expected, that we should endeavour to enlarge the borders of our tents. From a christian standpoint this is commendable but for the Department, whose attitude must be the same to all Indians, its difficulties and tribulations are, un-necessarily multiplied.\n\nI believe every kindness and assistance possible should be given our Churches to establish Christian teaching to our Indians in the reserves, but, as the bi-lingual system in our white schools has been the cause of race prejudice, in many districts, the abuse of a privilege, in connection with Indian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-1, part 2)\nIndian day schools, given to the Churches, is developing rapidly into denominational strife; this, with the advancement of the Indian in education and independence will not decrease but rather the opposite.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 118276/I of the 1st instant referring to the Beren's River Day School.\n\nIn reference to the suggestion of the Revd Mr Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, that a team of ponies be supplied to bring children, who live at a distance from the school, in the winter, that they may attend the Beren's River school, I respectfully beg to state that, I do not think such a provision would be of any great benefit.\n\nBeren's River reserve, and surrounding district, is composed of granite rocks, sloughs, muskegs and bush, sleighs could not be depended upon to travel to the homes of the children for more than 2 months, to use wheels would be almost an impossibility, anywhere at Beren's River, added to which, the cost of maintaining a team there and the entire absence of a responsible person to care for them would seem to render such a scheme prohibitive.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nFisher River Agency,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, September 30, 1915.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 10th of August last, in which you ask for the opinion of the Department in purchasing a team of ponies to be used in winter for bringing the children to the Berens River School, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Carter, who was asked for a report on this matter, states that he does not consider that this would be of any great benefit, as the Berens River Reserve and surrounding district is composed of granite rocks, sloughs, muskeg and bush. Sleighs could not be depended upon to travel to the homes of the children for more than two months, so use wheels would be almost an impossibility anywhere at Berens River, added to which, the cost of maintaining a team there and the entire absence of a responsible person to care for them would seem to render such a scheme prohibitive.\n\nIn view of this report the Department does not consider it is justified in entertaining such a proposition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Mr. Perrier's suggestion that a team of ponies be supplied to bring in the winter the children who live at a distance from the Red River School to school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Perrier has been informed that, in view of your report, the Department does not consider that it is justified in entertaining such a proposition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

J. Ferrier our Dept. of Indian Education it seemed to us wise to change our programme somewhat\u2014instead of doing much cooking to order a variety of biscuits and some brown and tea to go along with the usual supply of hard tack biscuits\u2014the same this being considered easier for the teacher and at the same time less expense to the Department.\n\nAccordingly a requisition was made out on the basis of last winter's attendance and forwarded to Mr. Carter our Indian Agent. Mr. Ferrier also said that when he visited Ottawa he would consult Mr. Scott on the matter.\n\nMrs. Lowes is teaching again this year and I would like on her account as well as my own to know if my requisition is being filled that our suggested programme may be carried out.\nI know that Mr. Carter is not altogether in favor of the free day meal for Indian Day Schools. However, this plan did not originate with me but with the Department I believe and it certainly worked all right here last winter. If there were some form of compulsory education and the Department enforced it we might get along without the meals or even the hard tack biscuits to encourage attendance.\n\nIt was suggested in addition to the provision of biscuits and bread requested for that for the winter we be authorized to hire a team & pony here to bring some of the children at a distance to school. Would act if our request in this matter is receiving attention.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJoseph H. Lowe\nMissionary\nOttawa, October 19, 1925.\n\nRev.

Stevens informed me that, when he was at Berens River in the early part of September last, he met George Sinclair returning from the Pekangakum reserve where he had been as teacher of the summer school. There being no teacher at Berens River Mr Stevens placed Mr Sinclair in charge and notified the Revd T. Ferrier of his action.\n\nWhen at Pekangakum at the treaty payments, Dr J.P. Palsson, M.D., drew my attention to the fact that George Sinclair was in a very advanced stage of consumption and that as Mr Stevens knew this Mr Sinclair should not have been appointed to the office of teacher, his unfortunate condition being a menace to the health of the children. Dr Palsson stated that he would make mention of this matter in his report.\n\nI advised Mr Stevens that, while there was perhaps not so much danger of Mr Sinclair spreading his disease at Pekangakum during the summer weather when the door could be always open, it would appear undesirable in a closed and warm building during the winter months. While every sympathy can be shown Mr Sinclair for his lamentable state of health it would seem wise to appoint a person more robust to conduct the Berens River school.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, October 15, 1916.\n\nRev.

Mr. Carter further states that when at Pekanakum at the treaty payments Dr. Palsson drew his attention to the fact that Mr. Sinclair was in a very advanced stage of consumption and that, as Mr. Stevens knew this, Mr. Sinclair should not have been appointed as teacher at Berens River.\n\nDr. Palsson informed Mr. Carter that he would make mention of this matter in his report, but, as this has not yet reached the Department, it was thought proper that you should be advised of the unfortunate state of health of Mr. Sinclair, so that you may take immediate steps to have a more healthy person placed in charge of this school, as Mr. Sinclair's presence there during the cold weather when the doors and windows are closed and the school-room overheated would be a menace to the health of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

I therefore beg to submit for your judgement the Berens River school returns, unsigned.\n\nMr G.

This action was commendable.\n\nI would recommend that the wishes of the Chief...\nChief, with reference to a teacher should receive favorable consideration, as I feel that he was conscientiously asking for what he believed to be in the best interest of the school and of the children of his band, he also intimated his desire in of assisting the school work in the way he thought would give the greatest satisfaction to all concerned.\n\nI would also ask that the wish of the chief in this matter should be considered and action taken so that provisions would be made to meet his wishes for the opening of the school on the 1st September next.

The Rev. Gentleman urges that more new desks be supplied, as the old ones are most unsatisfactory.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am addressing this letter to you with the hope that it will catch you at the Union Conference. I have no doubt you will meet Mr. Merritt at that point.\n\nYou are both cognizant of the fact that Mr. Street has rendered us nearly 3 years of excellent service as teacher at Fort Resolution. But even in the schoolroom, although here, the pupils have known a state of efficiency, unparallelled hitherto; but in everything pertaining to the spiritual uplift of the people Mr. Street have given the full measure of their very best consecrated effort.\n\nCrowded conditions in the Schoolroom. Consequently upon a large average in attendance, and an earnest desire on the part of Mr. Street for this progress caused him to give his time off and it became absolutely necessary to close school for 3 weeks and go out to Winnipeg for medical service and advice. He returned here and took up the work again, and so far as his health is concerned, is progressing very favorably.\nThe purpose of the trip, together with medical fees, cost him a great deal, and now since his return here, his good wife has taken seriously ill and is in bed. It will absolutely be necessary for her to have the very best medical attention and also an operation. \"A matter of care.\"\n\nAll of the trouble and expense is very hard on Mr. Street\u2014indeed, I might say confidentially he is in no way able to meet the financial part of it.\n\nCould you please take the matter up with Mr. Ferrel, and let me know if anything could be done in the way of a medical grant or failing this\u2014perhaps a quarter's fee in advance so that Mr. Street might have the operation right away before it is too late.

He was trading for the Hudson Bay Company. Some of the Indian people brought Copper for Samuel. And Samuel made his mind to go Coppermine River with his men. He packed some food and some of their clothes. Samuel Hearne had a guide, and his guide left them on their way. Samuel Hearne was servant. Samuel came back to the fort again with his men. Samuel had a quadrant. He knew where he wanted to go. One day he put it in the rock and it fell.\n\nSamuel had no food to eat and was starving with his men.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-1, part 2)\nLeather and burnt bones was their only food. He was now five hundred miles away when they had broken the quadrant. The Indian people used guns to kill one another. Some of the men lost their lives. It was very bad for the men. He was the first white man to see the Arctic ocean by land.\n\nRonald Green.\nAge 12\nGrade 9\nOctober 21st 1925\n\nRussell T.

Inasmuch as you have been very good to us, in the way of recommending school supplies to be sent us by The Indian Dept; I am taking the liberty of sending you a paper that has been sent me from our Day School Teacher Mr Street, which will show what progress is being made in our School under our teacher.\n\nThe boy who wrote this paper is a treaty indian from an ordinary indian home and a very small fellow for 12 years of age.\n\nA number of others in the same grade can do the same work, but I have not their papers at hand and the Steamer going South will be here in a few minutes so I cannot get them in time to send by this mail.\n\nI had once 7 years experience in Boarding School work, but never saw anything to beat this work now going on.

He will appoint a presiding examiner and would make the arrangements. A fee would be charged, however.

In my former letter I asked if they would be allowed to write here under their present Teacher.\n\nWe are in good hopes that they will qualify; and if such be the case it will be a great credit to both the Teacher who has labored so faithfully with them all and also to the School. Then Mr Ferrier what about the \"Fees\"? No pupils from any Indian Day School so far as I know in the West ever wrote for Entrance before. I am aware that they have done so from Residential Schools. In a case of this kind and as an encouragement to the Indians and pupils could not the Indian Department put up the fees?\n\nThe reason I have written you again in this matter is that the Post Office at Riverton has been burned down with all of the mail and we do not know whether or not your reply to my former letter was destroyed.\n\nPlease write me with the needed information at your earliest convenience.\n\nAnd Oblige Very Respectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She is now going on to take up Grade 9 work. The Chief's son Gordon was to have also written, but too much tobacco and attending dances at night and Wakes caused him too much sleep the following day so we had to drop him. The Chief is exceedingly angry and blames Mr Street which I need not say is most unjust.\n\nWe have a number of boys around the age of 12 and 13 who will be now in grade 7 and we are hoping in the future that at least 4 of them will qualify for entrance. I think the Indian Department should be informed of the work of Mr Street here.

Mr. Niddrie at Berens River with reference to the difficulty he and the teacher, Mr. Street, are having with the Chief of the Band. It appears that his oldest boy (age 17) was guilty of a serious misdemeanor and he left the school rather than take any punishment. The Chief then withdrew his four other children from the school and is now doing his best to damage Mr. Street's reputation as a teacher.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nDear Mr Ferrier:\n\nWe have just returned from the inland trip to Little Grand Rapids, Pekangecum, and Deer Lake. We were away 21 days and travelled between 6 and 7 hundred miles by canoe. The first news which reached us here upon our return was that the 3 pupils who wrote this summer for entrance to High School have all passed and read certificates to High School. This is very gratifying to us and I hasten to pass the good news on to you. There is only one man here who does not feel elated over this piece of good news and that is the Chief. This will show you what kind of a man we have to deal with. You will remember we were up against it with him as we could not send his son up a year ago on account of his immoral conduct. Ever since then he has been using his influence against Mr. Street (of course in the dark). This makes 4 Berens River pupils who under Mr. Street's efforts have qualified. You will no doubt get a copy of Mr. Inspector Dunlop's report on his visit here. He told me that Mr. Street was 100 per cent teacher and that his School was 100 per cent in standing. Mr. Street has now (between white and indian Schools) sent pupils up 4 times for Exams to P.A. and never had one fail. It makes us feel that his services should be retained at all costs. Next week our teacher Mr. Kirkness will be on his way to open the School at Pekangecum.\n\nAll of which is most respectfully submitted.\n\nWith Kind Regards,\n\nVery Faithfully Yours,\n\nRev. J. W.

This makes 4 children at Berens who have qualified. Altogether between White Schools and Indian Schools Mr. Street has sent up pupils for Entrance four times and never had one fail. I rather think this speaks well for his work, and I am sure his services should be held here at all costs.

There appears to be a great deal of friction between these schools regarding the attendance of the children mentioned in the correspondence, as well as some others, as each church or school claim these children. As I am not very well versed in church matters, I would greatly appreciate if you would give your ruling and views on the subject, as to which school these children should attend.\n\nKindly return enclosures when finished and oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nCopied from the filebook.\nOttawa, April 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th ultimo, with enclosures, with reference to friction between the managers of the Protestant and the Roman Catholic Indian Day Schools at Berens River. In reply I have to state the Department believes it is in the best interests of its wards if each child attends a school conducted under the auspices of the church with which the child and its parents are affiliated. This is in harmony with the provisions of the Act which reads (Subsection 1 of Section 10): \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nHowever, parents may change their religion, and further, the father has the legal right to determine the religious education of his child. Whenever the parents change their religion or a father exercises his right to direct his child's religious education and the child's attendance at one school or another is affected, the Department, if called upon to make a decision, asks for evidence concerning the bona fide nature of the change or of the father's wish.\n\nIn practice, if there is doubt concerning the school a child should attend, the Department endeavours to ascertain the religion of the parents and the real wishes of the child. Thus keeping in mind the best interests of the child, a decision is given. The child must then attend the school selected. In the case of residential schools, such attendance must be for the entire tuition period, as it is not considered wise to transfer a child from one residential school which the Department maintains to another for religious reasons.\n\nA child that has been resident in a school may have imbibed religious opinions and even convictions, and it is the Department's opinion that this should be a deterrent. In the case of day schools, the parents are maintaining the child at home, and the Department does not assume as much responsibility in these matters. If the parents have changed their religion or if the father has changed his wishes concerning the religious education of his child, generally speaking the Department does not interfere.\n\nC. A. Stevenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-1, part 2)\ninterfere if the child is transferred from one day school to another. However, such transfer should be only during the summer holidays. If there are any friction between the management of two day schools and the Department's attention is drawn to any case, a decision will be given after all the facts have been placed before us.\n\nYou, no doubt, have noted that it is the father that is usually right to determine the religious education of his child. If the father is dead, his right to have his child educated in his own religion is recognized, generally speaking, after his death. The widowed mother is allowed equal rights if she is maintaining the child.\n\nI am returning the correspondence you forwarded and am expressing the hope that, if you explain the Department's opinion and practice, there will be no further trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This is about the maximum that is allowed for this type of work. The reports concerning your classroom activity are very favourable, and, if you are able to obtain more harmonious relations with the other school on the reserve during the next few months, the Department will consider this sufficient reason for securing a slightly larger appropriation for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

Our school is only too glad to adhere rigidly to the text of the said letter.\n\nSince coming here 7 years ago I have not once interfered in any way with the other school. Not one contentious word has been spoken between their teachers and myself. Only on one occasion did I write to defend the action of an Indian parent which was in answer to a challenging letter from the other teacher. I have never asked or in any way persuaded one of their pupils to come to our school. We have an Attendance Officer here who enforces compulsory. I maintain my sole duty is to teach my own school to the limit of my ability.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-1, part 2)\nWould you judge me presumptuous now to cite briefly the cause of all the past discord. Many years ago this band of Indian people were won over to Christianity by Protestant Missionaries. Not so many years ago the Roman Catholics began a Mission here. They were able to re-baptize a certain part of the same people into their faith. Now in recent years these same people are coming back to their first faith. Upon doing so they have sent their children to our school. These people have publicly taken this stand and have consulted the Chief and Councilor Everett before sending their children to my school. And here I wish to solemnly affirm that I have not even in the remotest way been responsible for this condition of affairs.\n\nWere I to lose for love my manhood as to refuse admittance to these children and begin to dictate to them concerning their faith I would surely merit instant dismissal from my post.\n\nThe above is not written to defend or condemn any school, person, or people on this reserve. It is just a truthful statement of the\nCondition of school affairs here. I believe it is only just to lay the case before you.\n\nI know the type of work we do here does not call for a large salary. Nevertheless I believe your Dept. should encourage good results among its civil servants. And I not gone through 42 months war service I may have qualified for a higher type of work.\n\nChrist was the author of true harmonious relations. My dear Sir better we keep in His way than our honest relations be sacrificed for a little veneer, a little falsehood, a little putting on new, and in the finest goods equity and judgment.\n\nMr. Herron I am very strictly a Protestant in faith. Had I the promise of your treasury in Ottawa and therefore harbored any scruple concerning my religious principles such a thing could only bring upon me eternal shame.\n\nPerhaps more even than yourself I covet harmony between our schools here; but above all let us have harmony seasoned with justice from your Secretary's Circular Letter. I must thank you.\nfor your past employment\nand consideration.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nC.R. Street.\nMr. Russell T.

It interferes very much with our average attendance. My immediate object in troubling you with this letter is to ask if the Department of Indian Affairs would be willing to make a grant of say TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS......per year to purchase Gasoline so that we could send for the children every morning and take them back every evening. This would facilitate matters and keep up a good average attendance. Every effort is being made to keep the work going forward here in the Schoolroom and very evident progress is being made.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of an early reply\n\nVery Faithfully Yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is considered that the parents must take some responsibility, and, when the Department provides the expenses of a school, they should, at least, show sufficient interest in the education of their children to send them to school regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

D. Sutherland,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. C. D. Street, the teacher at Berens River, Manitoba, in which he brings before me a question upon which I think I ought to have your advice. The following quotation from his letter dated March 28th, 1935, will place before you the problem:\n\n\"Would it seem presumptuous to you if I were to ask you to intervene in a small matter concerning our school? We desire to introduce typing to our advanced pupils. Our chief obstacle is the procuring of one or even two machines. These may be of any kind, even obsolete, as long as the key-board is fairly similar to the later makes. What we want is something to hammer away on until we get the idea of fingering, etc. If we can get such machines then I shall endeavor to take a course in the theory. I am not decided as to the shorthand. Would you advise it?\"\n\nYou will gather from this that Mr. Street is trying to keep up to date and is endeavoring to interest the young people in the various lines of work. The question in my mind is whether the Department would agree with his proposition to teach the use of the typewriter. We think that we could find him a couple of second hand machines if the Department would be willing that he should put this on his curriculum. I shall be much obliged for your mind on this subject.\n\nI trust that you are all keeping well and that Dr. Stone is improving in health.\n\nWith very kind wishes to all,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-1, part 3)\nOttawa, April 17, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Banner:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to a communication received by you from Mr. C. D. Street, teacher of the Berens River United Church Indian Day School, regarding the teaching of typewriting to the advanced pupils.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department would offer no objection to Mr. Street conducting a class in typewriting. I note that your Church Mission Board would be able to supply a couple of second hand machines. I may say that the Department will have no funds to provide equipment of this nature for use at Indian schools. To my mind, it is doubtful what benefit would be derived by the pupils at this rather outlying post in acquiring a knowledge of typewriting. However, as I have stated, if the teacher wishes to take up this work with the advanced pupils, there will be no objection on the part of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Arthur Banner,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nBerens River, Man.,\nAug. 26th, 1935\n\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nPlease be kind enough to inform me re the following:\nI have been a school-teacher in the \"Berens River United Church Indian Day School\" for thirteen years. I have received my salary at all times from the Indian Department at Ottawa. Would I be considered a \"Civil Servant\" by your commission? If so would I be entitled to regular pension benefits? Also, when would I be able to qualify for such benefits?\n\nTrusting to be informed by you at your earliest convenience, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Civil Service Commission has no record of Mr. Street and the letter is therefore forwarded for your attention. I shall be obliged if you will be good enough to let me have a copy of your reply to Mr. Street for the information of this office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo addressed to the Civil Service Commission, I beg to say that teachers of Indian day schools are classed as \"Temporary Civil Servants (Exempt by Order-in-Council), Full Time\".\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are not entitled to superannuation. As you are aware, no deduction is made from your salary for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. D. Street, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBerens River U. C.

W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSeptember 26, 1935,\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, your file 58-1-IA, I am enclosing herewith for your information, copy of the reply which was sent to Mr. Colin Douglas Street's letter of the 26th August, in which he made enquiry with regard to his status as a Civil Servant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Foran, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\nI without presumption draw your attention to the fact that the hours for day schools are perhaps too long. I think your regulations call for 9-12, and 1-4. These hours could be shortened by an hour for the winter months and one-half hour for the summer months. I am sure this would be an improvement. This action need in no way interfere or lessen the efficiency of the school-room education, but may rather increase its capacity for such. The days get real short in the winter and in summer it is important that pupils get a maximum of sunshine, when we remember that T.B. is the worst physical enemy of the Indian. With many day-schools which are not the last word in means of ventilation I do not know of any better suggestion than making it possible for our children to have these added hours of pure fresh air. Where a day-school teacher has say 25 pupils in 5 or 6 grades in a not too large room I submit that he can do better work with the shorter hours.\n\nC.D.S.\n\nFrom C. D.

Brown who states he was formerly employed as a Teacher at the Barrens River Indian Day School.\n\nAs there is no record here of Military Leave having been granted to Mr. Brown, will you please let me have a report and your opinion as to whether the Branch would desire to re-employ him if his services are available after the war.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa,\nMay 15, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Mr. Douglas W. Brown\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Jackson's memorandum of May 15, in which information is sought with respect to the re-employment of Mr. Douglas W. Brown.\n\nThe records here indicate that Mr. Brown was employed for a period of two years as teacher at the Berens River United Church Indian Day School and was nominated for this position by the United Church. Mr. Brown resigned from this position early in the year 1942 and his resignation was accepted by the Department in a letter to the Home Mission Board of the United Church dated June 2, 1942.\n\nIndian day school teachers are classified as temporary Civil Servants. They do not contribute to the superannuation fund and do not qualify for superannuation allowances. A deduction, however, of $6 to the retirement fund is made from their salaries. The amount deducted in each case is returned to the contributor when he leaves the Service. It would appear that a cheque for the sum of $64.08 was sent forward to Mr. Brown in a letter dated August 25, 1942. This cheque, owing to the failure of the postal authorities to locate Mr. Brown, was returned to the Department. This cheque will be sent forward immediately to Mr. Brown at his present address.\n\nThere is no definite understanding that Indian day school teachers will be re-employed by this Department at the close of the war and, in view\nof the large number of teachers who have joined the Armed Forces, it will be exceedingly difficult to secure positions for all of them. It is our intention, however, to do everything humanly possible to secure schools for returned soldiers with full academic and professional standing.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring holidays Miss Windsor acting for the Dept. organized an Indian Women's War Service Club. This club wishes to meet in the school two Fridays each month beginning at three P.M. for the purpose of serving etc. May I have your permission to dismiss school at that time on these days and allow the meetings?\n\nYours truly,\nJean B. Reid.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 16, 1943.\n\nDear Miss Reid:\n\nI was glad to learn from your letter of September 2 that Miss Windsor had succeeded in organizing an Indian women's war service club at Berens River. Groups of Indian women have been doing exceptionally good work throughout the Dominion in the remodelling of discarded military clothing and in the betterment of home conditions on reserves. It is my earnest hope that this group of women at Berens River will be successful in the tasks they undertake. Anything that you can do to guide and direct them would be very much appreciated by the Department. It will be satisfactory to this Branch if you dismiss your pupils an hour earlier on the regular meeting days of the club. Care should be taken, however, not to encroach on the time of the pupils unless such encroachment is fully justified by the work of the club members. It has occurred to me that the senior girls might well remain and take lessons in sewing with the older women.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Jean E.

Cormie, Superintendent of Missions for Manitoba, has recommended to us the name of Mr. C.D. Street, who is now out of the army, as teacher of the Berens River School. We are therefore nominating Mr. Street and feel that we are fortunate in being able to secure a teacher who has had considerable experience. The Department has his record, which I believe, is a very worthy one.\n\nMr. Street feels that he should get $110.00 a month salary, and I understand that, in addition to this, there would be the usual bonus. This is the salary which I believe was paid Mr. Street when he previously taught at this school. In view of the fact that the salary of Mr. Henry Falk, who has just been appointed to the Island Lake School, is set at $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus, it would seem only fair that a man of Mr. Street's experience should get at least $10.00 a month more. We submit this to your favorable consideration and trust it will meet with your approval.\n\nWe shall be glad to hear from you as soon as you have had an opportunity to give this request your attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMCM.MIT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Street,\nRosons River, Manitoba.\n\nCopy sent to Agent Olson\nREGISTERED MAIL:\n\nOttawa, February 24, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Street:\n\nI have to advise you, that after considerable effort on the part of our Department, the Treasury Board has recommended the permanent appointment of certain Indian Day School teachers.\n\nYou are included among those who are now eligible for appointment to a permanent position for the purpose of superannuation. It will, of course, be necessary to present the required evidence of age and health to the Chief of the Superannuation and Retirement Fund Branch of the Department of Finance before you may become a contributor under the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nYou will find attached the following documents:\n\n(a) Two copies of Physical Examination Record (H.H. & W. Form 502).\n(b) One copy of \"Civil Service Superannuation Act\" (Form FA 74).\n(c) Three copies of Civil Service Superannuation Act Election Form (Fin No. 64).\n(d) One copy of Memorandum re War Service (5/1947).\n(e) One copy of Memorandum re Pensionable Employment (6/1947).\n\nPhysical Examinations:\n\nWe will require completion of the attached physical examination record (H.H. & W. Form 502). It is suggested that you have this form completed by either your own personal doctor or by a doctor of the Indian Health Services of the Department of National Health and Welfare. This form, when completed, should then\nCivil Service Health Division,\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nPlease note that any expense attendant upon this examination will be borne by you.\n\nElection to Contribute for Past Service:\n\nWhen a Civil Servant has served in a temporary capacity, prior to being a contributor to the Civil Service Superannuation Act, he may, within twelve months of the date of his permanent appointment, elect to contribute an amount equal to five, five and one half or six percent of the total salary received by him during such period of service with simple interest thereon at the rate of four percent per annum. By reference to section II para 2 of the Civil Service Superannuation Act pamphlet (FA 74) attached, you can determine the rate of contribution in your instance.\n\nOur records show that you have been an Indian Day School Teacher for a period of approximately twenty-one years. Therefore, it will be necessary for you to pay contributions, if you so elect to the fund in either one lump sum or in installments. You will find a table of installments on page 2 of the election form (Fin No. 64).\n\nIf you desire to have this temporary service count for Superannuation purposes, kindly complete the enclosed forms (Fin No. 64) and return them in duplicate to this office. I may point out that by Section 7 A (1) of the Act, only service which is fully paid for shall be counted.\n\nWar Service:\n\nA memorandum is attached for the information of contributors who may be eligible to count their War Service for purposes of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\nPensionable Employment:\n\nIf you have had service with the Dominion Government prior to your present appointment, you should immediately furnish this office with full particulars regarding the nature of such service and the salary received.\n\nIf you have had other pensionable employment (e.g., as a provincial teacher) you will find details as to conditions, procedure, etc., outlined in the memorandum attached, dealing with \"Pensionable Employment\" (6/1947).\n\nYour attention is directed to para 2 under \"Conditions\" in this memorandum in which you will note that your contribution \"for such employment shall be twice the amount that he would have contributed etc.,\".\n\nUnder para 2 of \"Exceptions\", you are not entitled to count provincial service for Dominion superannuation services, when you are already receiving or have received a provincial superannuation benefit.\n\nDeductions:\n\nI may add that from December 27, 1947, a percent (as determined by the Civil Service Superannuation Act - Form 74 A) will be deducted from your salary on account of the superannuation fund. Whether or not you decide to contribute for past service, I would appreciate being informed at the earliest possible date of your decision.\n\nI would finally remind you that you are given twelve months to make the election described above and that this offer expires on December 27, 1948. Therefore, it is most important that you inform the Department of your decision whether to allow for past service or not.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

The annual contribution of $1,000 to be contributed, therefore, would be $1,000 x 5% = $50. The instalment for $1,000 at would be $1,000 x 5% = $50. In terms of instalments during the five-year period no further payment would be required.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Street.\nDear Mr. Streets:\n\nThis is in connection with your letter of March 10th regarding the payment of the arrears for Superannuation purposes. There are so many points I want to bring to your attention that I will take them up one at a time.\n\nFirst, although your Form No. 64 is quite complete our records show that your estimated arrears are quite higher than you have, also we have more of the details; therefore, I am returning you your copies and am asking you to complete the front part of our three copies and forward two to this office. You keep the third. I wish to point out that the figures are, but an estimate and may be revised by the Department of Finance. Paying for these arrears will give you a credit of eighteen and one half years.\n\nSecond, your election to contribute for Active Service is quite in order and I shall keep the form on file until I get Form 64 from you and will forward the two with the copy of the Military Discharge Certificate to the Department of Finance. However, I will point out that you will not get credit for service during the World War II.\n\nThird, the Department has ruled that your service in Provincial Schools cannot be counted towards Superannuation purposes. The regulation reads that an employee must have been employed in a \"Pensionable Employment\", which is employment where there was an established Superannuation fund or plan. Such a plan was\nadopted in Manitoba in the Fall of 1925, while you were employed in Provincial Schools prior to that.\n\nFourth, it is noted that you have not forwarded your Birth Certificate. It will be necessary for you to send it in, as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. C.D. Street,\nBerens River U.C.

I shall be 55 years old next Oct.\n\nI would like very much to contribute to the Supernumerary Fund No. 5, in instalments, i.e., that you accept my Feb. and April cheques each year until the computed amount is paid. I would wish the computation to cover 27 years. If possible I would be thankful if any part of my war service could give me credit on my contribution to the supernumerary fund.\n\nI have been delayed in returning the enclosed application as I attended a summer school in the Manitoba Industrial Institution in Winnipeg for weeks. I took a course in General Shop which I am planning to gradually introduce in my school here.\n\nIt will interest you to know that our school received one first, six second, and a third prize for the huts we sent to Brandon Canadian Exhibition.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The instalment will be found by dividing the amount due by 3%, which comes to $452.58 per $1,000 to be contributed, namely, $558.77.

Neary\nSupt. of Education\n\nI have just received a letter from Walter S. Cook, the U.C. Missionary at Berens River, informing me that Mr. G.D. Street, our teacher of the Berens River U.C. School, is on the verge of complete nervous breakdown. Recently when the writer and Dr. T.W. Brokovski visited Berens River Mr. Street was not well and Dr. Brokovski examined him. At that time it seemed questionable to the doctor as to whether Mr. Street would be able to finish the remainder of the school term, and advised that if so he should obtain an easier school next fall. Accordingly, Reverend Cook's letter was not entirely a surprise to me.\n\nI have consulted with Dr. Best in Winnipeg, who is personally known to you. At the moment Dr. Best is unable to supply a teacher to replace Mr. Street for the remainder of the school term, however, he expects this to be possible within the next few days.\n\nMr. Street is unable to continue teaching at Berens River and this is to advise you of said circumstances.\n\nMr. Street is requesting sick leave but it is not clear in this office as to how much sick leave Mr. Street has coming, but your records in Ottawa would indicate this.\n\nI will advise immediately another teacher is obtained.\n\n[Signature]\nB.E. Olson\nSupt., Clandebaye Agency.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n1. Would you estimate such claims near Mr. Street?\n2. We will be credited with 10 months in 3 months.\n\n4/1/214 months or May 17, 1910\nworks up to May 31, 1918\naccording to Treasury\n\nreceived & Treasury\n\nM.F.\nExtract from report of Field Agent Waite regarding his inspection of the Berens River U.C. Day School on 1st February, 1949:\n\n\"The Teacher, Mr. Street, appeared to me to be on the verge of a breakdown, and I would suggest that a lighter school be made available to him.\"\n\nWith reference to the above, Regional Supervisor Davis writes, \"Mr. Street is now out on account of health, and doubt if he will return.\"\nMarch 12, 1949.\n\nMr. B.H. Olson,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\n\nThe Department is considering allowing Mr. C.D. Street, Teacher, Berens River U.C. Indian Day School, sick leave with pay, based on his accumulated credits towards such leave.\n\nBefore further consideration can be given, it is necessary for Mr. Street to submit to a medical examination and have the doctor fill the attached form in duplicate and submit one copy to Ottawa. The other copy is for retention by yourself. Any expense incurred will have to be borne by Mr. Street.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAtt'n: Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education\n\nRe: Valin D. Street - Berens River U.C. Day School\n\nFurther to my recent letter regarding the captionally noted wherein you were advised that Mr. Street was compelled to stop school owing to a complete nervous break-down, Mr. Street is now in the Deere Lodge Hospital in Winnipeg and has placed the following enquiries before me:\n\n1. What amount of sick leave is he entitled to at this time?\n2. Would he receive his ordinary salary while on sick leave?\n3. Should he be unable to continue his teaching activities what pension would he be qualified to receive?\n\nI submit the foregoing questions for your consideration and on receipt of your advise will report to Mr. Street regarding same. There seems no reason at the present time why Mr. Street should not be back for our school term commencing next fall. You will be further informed as to his progress.\n\nDr. Best and I are endeavoring to obtain a teacher to carry on with the Berens River U.C. Day School to the end of this term. As yet we have no available teacher but immediately we have one I shall advise you.\n\nE.E. Olson,\nSuperintendent,\nClandeboye Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nHerewith attached is a copy of Medical Examination relating to Mr. C.D.

Originally, we had thought that he would be able to return to his teaching duties. It now seems evident that he will not be able to return to this type of work.\n\nMr. Street is a Veteran of World War I and of World War II. He has qualified as a Permanent Civil Servant and it would now seem that he is ready to retire on superannuation. I would like to discuss the procedure in such cases with you, as this is the first teacher we have yet had ready for retirement.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Street, Teacher, Berens River, U.C. Indian Day School, who may not be able to resume his duties, I have to give you the following information:\n\nMr. Street's date of birth is October 22, 1892. He has, therefore, not reached superannuation age. Before action can be taken to retire him, prior to the age of sixty, on account of ill health, it would be necessary for his Physician to complete a Medical Certificate, in triplicate, on the required form (Physician's Certificate, Schedule \"J\"), which certificate must be concurred in by the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nOn Mr. Street's Salary Service Record hereunder, his length of service is shown as 17 years, 10 months, to May 31, 1948. This does not include his military service. While the file does not indicate that he elected to pay to the Civil Service Superannuation Fund on his war service, the application in this respect was received in the mail a day or so ago and forwarded to you.\n\nSo far as retiring leave, with pay, is concerned, Mr. Street may be granted leave, with pay, based on continuity of service provided he has a credit of leave. As this is an exempt position the leave requires approval by Order in Council.\n\nI do not know whether leave credits were set up for Mr. Street on his being given permanent status.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nMemorandum:\n\nColonel B. F. Neary.\n\nWith respect to your memorandum of March 31, asking to be advised as to the procedure in case of the retirement of Mr. C. D. Street, Teacher, Berens River, U.C. Indian Day School, who may not be able to resume his duties, I have to give you the following information:\n\nMr. Street's date of birth is October 22, 1892. He has, therefore, not reached superannuation age.

Indian Day School.\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence concerning the sick leave to which Mr. Street is entitled.\n\nHis record shows his length of service to be seventeen years and ten months to May 31, 1948. This does not include his Military service. He is, therefore, entitled to leave with pay for a period up to three hundred and thirty days.\n\nHe has not yet reached the superannuation age as his date of birth is October 22, 1892. Before action can be taken to retire him prior to the age of sixty, on account of ill health, it will necessary for his physician to complete a medical certificate on a special form. This certificate must be approved by the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nI will send to you as soon as one is received, a copy of the Superannuation Act so that Mr. Street can calculate his superannuation pay.\n\nYou will note that Dr. Musgrove of the Deer Lake Hospital does not expect Mr. Street will become sufficiently fit to return to school teaching. Therefore, you can appreciate the fact that this matter must be treated with some tact and diplomacy. We do not wish Mr. Street to gain the impression that we wish him to take his superannuation now.\nI would suggest that you visit him on one of your trips to Winnipeg and discuss with both he and the Doctor, the possibility of his returning to work. We can then work out the exact number of days leave to which he is entitled, and apply for the necessary Order-in-Council.\n\nBernard F.

Gullock)\nChief, Superannuation Branch.\n\nN.B. Please return Service Records \"Attention Mr. Anderson\".\n\n[Stamp: Treasury Office Received APR 22 1949]\nATTENTION: Mr. B. F. Neary,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMr. G. D. Street, teacher at the Beren's River U.C. School, called on me yesterday requesting information as to what is coming to him in the form of sick leave or pension.\n\nMr. Street, I understand, was put on the permanent staff about a year and a half ago. However, I have no record here on the matter. Mr. Street has been in the Deer Lodge Hospital since February, and it will be necessary for him to retire from the service owing to his health - as the doctors' advise him he will not be able to work anymore. I understand Mr. Street has taught in our day schools for the last twenty years or more, and he would like to know if, when he was put on the permanent staff, it was dated back to the beginning of his service with the Department.\n\nWill you please send me all the necessary information and I will call on Mr. Street and advise him accordingly.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nJune 1st, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of June 3, 1949 in reference to Mr. C.D. Street.\n\nMr. Street has not yet reached the superannuation age as his date of birth is October 22, 1892, and before action can be taken to retire him prior to the age of sixty, on account of ill health, it will be necessary for his physician to complete a medical certificate on the attached form \"Schedule J\". Kindly ask him to have this form completed and forwarded to me for approval of the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nAs to Mr. Street's service with the Department he will receive credit for all service with the Department since September 1, 1922. Treasury records show that this service amounts to 225 months of actual teaching. Therefore, his credit will be 18 years and 9 months to June 30, 1949.\n\nI have contacted the Superannuation Branch of the Department of Finance who advise me that they have written Mr. Street to his Berens River address advising him that if he wants to claim his service in World War II he can do so. I point this out to Mr. Street as he might have not received his mail from Berens River and is not aware of this privilege.\nMr. Street has been on sick leave with pay since February 19th, and the Department feels that it will be necessary to place him on retirement from September 1st, 1949.\n\nSince securing approval for teachers to obtain retirement leave benefits, this is the first case and will form a precedent. With the above in mind it should be distinctly understood by all parties concerned at the present time that we are unable to state definitely if this retirement leave will be granted.\n\nRetirement leave must be approved by Order-in-Council; therefore, you can appreciate the work involved in getting this authorization, and it is imperative that Schedule J be forwarded to me as soon as possible as this document must be approved by the Department of National Health and Welfare before any action can be taken.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMFT/IM\nAir Mail\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter under file No. 202-11 dated June 3, 1949. Mr. Street again called in the office today and is most interested in endeavouring to have his status as a Civil Servant cleared at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe reason for Mr. Street's request is that he is in receipt of a letter from the Department of Finance signed by Mr. G. L. Gulloch, Chief of the Superannuation Branch, and until advice is received regarding his status Mr. Street is unable to reply to Mr. Gulloch's letter. Therefore, it would be greatly appreciated if we might have your early reply to my letter previously mentioned.\n\nJUN 14 1949\n\nP.

I inspected this school last fall and would recommend that the requisition be approved. The outhouses should be moved as they are at present too near the school. This will cost approximately $10.00, with a screen placed in front of each.\n\nThe school itself inside requires a fresh coat of paint.\n\nMr. C.D.

The Department will also approve of having the closets moved to a new site and will pay for the labour in having the work done. It is noted that the teacher will perform the labour in the repairing and repainting of the school without charge. The total expenditure in the purchase of the materials required and for the labour in moving the closets should not exceed your estimate of approximately $65.

Mr. Nidari of Berens River which explains itself.\n\nThe rain proof roof referred to would have to be shingles. I can only endorse Mr. Nidari's contention that such a building is very badly needed and the cost should not exceed $60.00.\n\nIf approved an early reply would be appreciated in order that sufficient time may be allowed to have the job completed before freeze up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSelkirk, Man., Sept. 10th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. C. D. Street of the U.C. Indian Day School at Berens River has written to say that their school stove is in a very bad condition. It is one of those long \"Camp Comfort Heaters\" and the heat has caused it to buckle in on both sides. This buckling has made a dangerous opening on the front.\n\nMr. Street states in his letter that the stove is no longer safe and recommends a cast iron box stove, 3 feet six long as being the most suitable for his school. The cost of this stove would be $20.75\n\nIf approved kindly advise at earliest convenience in order that shipment may be made before navigation closes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 10th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the erection of a suitable storehouse at the Barons River U. C. Day School. It is noted that this can be erected at a cost not exceeding $60, including both material and labour.\n\nYou may also supply to this school a new box stove, which, it is noted, you can obtain for $20.75.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

T. A. Crear,\nMinister of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nHon. Sir:\n\nWe, the undersigned, are extremely loathe to address this letter and request to you; when we are quite aware that it may appear to be a breach of your department's rules; And also when we appreciate the fact that you may be unduly bothered by such requests as we are about to present.\n\nTwenty years ago The Indian Department erected a schoolhouse here twenty feet by thirty feet, with logs for foundation and no concrete. The walls were siding outside, and un-seasoned rough lumber inside building paper (long since rotted or eaten by mice) was put between. It is possible now to shove a pencil through from outside, or from inside.\n\nFor some years requests have been made for the erection of a new building, the last one being made last winter. All of these have been turned down, the last one ignored.\n\nBoth the Indian Agent and Doctor have seen the building this week. The Doctor thought if a new building were erected, this old one could be used as a dining hall; and playroom in wet weather. The Agent is afraid that it is too late this year for the erection of a new building and thinks the old one could be repaired, and has asked us to send in a requisition for material.\n\nNow, sir, at the risk of being considered presumptuous, we would most earnestly impress upon you the fact that it would be a deterrent to our work here to go into the erection of a new building. For nearly twenty years our children have eaten their mid-day meals on the same desks as they study on. Children roast and freeze at the same time. The place is an ice house not a school house. The foundation is rotten and the walls are weak and only having been held together for some years by an iron rod across in the inside. The roof is buckling and will very soon compel attention, and it would be a very unwise proceeding to spend an amount of money to repair such a building.\n\nPlease do not conclude that we are seeking to overrule the agent. We know he has much to contend with and we would not in any way criticize his ruling. However, in the interests of our work here, we feel very much exercised over the fact that now we must have a new building in order to carry on in an efficient manner. We have strong opposition here with two priests and two nuns coming out next month. They have other sources to...\ndraw from for their buildings, &c., which are denied us. Ours in the reserve school, being situated on the reserve and recognized as The Reserve School, your instant decision and action are much hoped for, and may we hope that two thousand dollars be allowed at once, and the building erected immediately to be ready for September.

McGill\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter the Minister has received from Rev. J.W. Middrie, at Berens River. Will you please draft a reply for the Minister's signature. Kindly return the enclosure to this office when you are through with it.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure (1).\nOttawa, July 4, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Hiddrie:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, regarding the condition of the present old school building at the Berens River United Church Indian Day School and requesting the erection of a new building.\n\nThe Department is aware of the need of a new building for classroom purposes, but it was not possible to provide the amount required to erect a building in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year. The need will not be overlooked, and, when the Estimates are being prepared for the coming fiscal year, the matter of providing the funds required will receive consideration. In the meantime, it will be necessary to carry on the work under present conditions.\n\nIf any minor repairs are required to place the present old school building in a more comfortable condition for the coming winter, I would suggest that you take up the matter through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend J.

NIDRIE\nMISSIONARY\n\nSeptember 5th, 1956\n\nW. J. Sutherland Esq.,\nSupt. Indian Education Ottawa,\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nWill you please pardon the liberty I take in trespassing upon your valuable time with this letter, and allow my object to be my apology. First by way of introducing myself to you; may I say that I have just finished 46 years in the active work amongst the Indian peoples. Twenty-one of that time... or nearly so... was spent at Morley Alberta, and the remaining twenty-six... or nearly so... in this north land. Sixteen of this time in the North has been spent at Berens River.\n\nI must submit to you in a most courteous way, for your information a few facts and figures regarding school children and their education at Berens River and other adjacent points. At the present time there is in the course of erection at the Church of Rome Mission here a building which we are told is to be a Residential School. We are further informed that the Dept. of Indian Affairs have contributed the sum of four thousand dollars towards the expense of this building. Now I shall not ask anything at all regarding the number of names appearing on their school register here, as I might be misled, and it is quite unnecessary for me to seek this information from your office as I know every last child of school age belonging to the Church of Rome here.\n\nThe children of school age belonging to their Mission... that is Treaty Children number in all six... or at the outside certainly not more than seven. Please note, these are treaty children of school age who owe their allegiance to the Church of Rome here; and we understand that no provision is made in a Mission Indian School by the Dept. of Indians Affairs for \"Non Treaty Indian children\". We have at our Mission and belonging before United Church Day School here FORTY-FOUR children of school age. Allow me to be still more explicit... four of our children living at five mile point, have been co-opted into the other school but are still Protestant. It seems perfectly impossible to induce the Dept. of Indian Affairs, to assist us, in transporting, and returning these pupils to and from school. I cannot understand it, as the cost would be but small; and in the old days in the west, provision was always made for this. Then the amount of food supplies allowed us for the mid-day meal is altogether inadequate. Please understand I am most respectfully submitting this information for your consideration, and not in a spirit of criticism. At the same time if it is convenient I shall be deeply grateful if you will be kind enough to favor me with a reply as to these matters. We have sent in a Supplemental requisition for more supplies for we always fall short before spring, and our people are living from hand to mouth, and we cannot hope for them to supply lunches for these children. In any case the pupils... should always... during the winter months not only have a mid-day meal; but also a hot cup of cocoa are they begin work in the morning. Coming a considerable distance and being but poorly clothed it seems unreasonable to do their best work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nof rather shall we say\u2014for us to expect them to do so\u2014if some mode of transport could be arranged, and a good warm dinner supplied at mid-day it would be a great factor in facilitating the question of education for the pupils of The United Church Day School at Berens River.\n\nPerhaps exception may be taken to my reference regarding the erection of the Residential School at the Church of Rome Mission here; and it may be pointed out that such institute would be fed from other Reserves. We may perhaps be pardoned right here for again supplying some facts and figures regarding this matter.\n\nFirst then, Porlier River Reserve:\n\nMay I very respectfully point out that very few people upon that Reserve own their allegiance to the Church of Rome; certainly not more than one or two families at the most.\n\nSecondly: At Berens River: We have some two hundred and sixty or more Indians belonging to the Protestant Faiths against some Seventy Roman Catholics.\n\nAgain at Little Grand Rapids: The Protestants far outnumber the members of the Church of Rome.\n\nAgain at Pakangoom: Not one family to draw pupils from there.\n\nDear Lake... Again... Not one\n\nSammy Lake... One man, one woman and two children that are not Protestants.\n\nWe must admit that there are a number of non-treaty children but as we understand it, the Dept of Indian Affairs do not supply schools and teachers for them. Then \"Indian Act\" sets forth very plainly the law regarding Protestant children attending a school under the auspices of the Church of Rome. We have for considerably over forty years assured the Indians that the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa have and are always ready to assist the Indians in anything that is right and reasonable. Hence the liberty I have taken in bringing these matters to your attention.\n\nI must here express our deep gratitude to the Dept of Indian Affairs for assisting us by way of renovating our Day School Building here, as well as the promise of Hon. Mr. Grear re the erection of a new building for School purposes next summer D.V. I trust I have made myself sufficiently clear in this letter; and that you will fully understand that it is neither jealousy or malice that has caused me to write; but a sincere desire to solicit your assistance in helping to arrange the transport of our pupils 96 and from five mile point to our school; and also to request that you will be able to assist in granting a supplemental supply of food for the mid-day meal. Already such requisition has gone in to the Indian Office at Selkirk.\n\nApologizing for taking this liberty.\n\nVery Respectfully Yours,\n\nJ.W. Niddrie.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 17, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, regarding the erection, by the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, of a building for residential school purposes on the Berens River reserve.\n\nIn this connection I would say that the Department has no knowledge of any building, of the type mentioned by you, being erected on the Berens River reserve. The Catholic Church authorities are fitting up a residence for the teachers - it being understood that they are sending a couple of Reverend Sisters, one of whom will carry out the teaching duties. The Department is allowing a grant towards the cost of altering and repairing the building. It is not the Department's intention to conduct a residential school on this reserve.\n\nRegarding the food supplies allowed for the midday meal at the Berens River Protestant School, the Department has ordered and paid for the following, for next winter's use:\n\n- 150 lbs. beans,\n- 200 lbs. peas,\n- 50 lbs. rice,\n- 40 lbs. cocoa,\n- 100 lbs. granulated sugar,\n- 4 cases Carnation milk,\n- 50 lbs. dairy salt,\n- 5 lbs. baking soda.\n\nBesides, we have supplied a number of kitchen utensils and other equipment. I would point out, also, that 900 pounds\n\nRev. J. W. Hiddrie,\nUnited Church Mission,\nBerens River,\nvia Winnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-5, part 2)\nof biscuits have been supplied. Our funds for the supplying of provisions for midday meals at the Indian day schools are extremely limited, and, as there is a large number of schools to be considered, it is not found possible to provide any further quantity of food supplies than the amount already sent for use at the Protestant School on the Berens River reserve.\n\nI regret the Department has no funds to provide for the transportation, between their homes and the school, of several of the Protestant Indian children who reside at a considerable distance from the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Street, schoolteacher, who stated that they would require a school 50 x 30 with a full size basement. The building to have a belfrey and a bell size 22. The School to accommodate 60 pupils. The building to be built on the present site and equipped with storm windows, screens, eavestrough and a furnace. Also to be painted grey.\n\nThe old building could be torn down and the lumber used by Indians only for the repair of their homes on the Reserve. The R.C.M.P. could distribute this old lumber.\n\nI would recommend a building of frame construction with a full size basement. I would also recommend that this work be let by contract and that the contractor be allowed to take one man with him and the rest of the labour be taken from the reserve, as there are no Indians competent to do the carpenter work but many could provide the rough labour.\n\nI consider that the school should be equipped with a cloakroom and also two new toilets. The reason we have asked for eavestroughing is to protect the cement basement. The new chimney should be of brick and a full length to the basement.\n\nBuilding materials could be supplied from Selkirk and should the Department consider building this school this year, I would suggest that the work be started at once in order to be ready by the last of September when school opens.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

They have to prepare the noon meal for the children which causes a lot of work. I would suggest that the request of the principal, Mr. Street, that they have a woman assistant appointed to teach domestic science and primary work, and prepare the meals, is a proper request.

The average attendance for the month of June, 1926, the last month for which figures are available, was also 24. The salary of the teacher is $1,100. This is approximately double the salary paid one-room rural school teachers in the province of Manitoba.\n\nIn view of the salary paid and the comparatively small average attendance, it would be difficult to justify the appointment of a second teacher at this date.\n\nMy understanding of the noonday meal, to which you refer, is that this meal consists in the main of the distribution of biscuits supplied by the Department and, at certain schools, the preparation of soup or broth.

J. Semple, #334 Berens River Band, who in return are looking after a number of Indian children who live a long distance from the school and if it were not for this arrangement could not attend. Some of them do not even get home for week ends.\n\nMr. Schuetze has given considerably from his own supplies to assist in this undertaking and has requested that the Department have the following supplies sent this year -\n\n6 bags of flour\n100 lbs. beans\n50 \" peas\n1 Case milk\n2 lbs. salt\n\n6 lbs. baking powder\n50 \" rice\n25 \" cocoa\n50 \" sugar\n5 \" baking powder.\n\nThis does not involve a large expenditure and I am sure would be used to good advantage. If authority could be granted by wire for this purchase, it might yet be possible to have it shipped to Berens River. I would recommend that the supplies be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to certain Indian children who are residing with Mr. and Mrs. J.J. Semple near the Berens River U.C. School.\n\nAs you mention in your letter the quantity of food supplies requested is not expensive but there are other features of this matter which I believe should receive your further consideration.\n\nIt is felt that it is not advisable to encourage miniature residential schools. This Branch has no supervision over Mr. and Mrs. Semple and it would be impossible to ascertain definitely the number of children actually kept by this couple and the arrangements made for the children's maintenance.\n\nAs you are aware we have already forwarded supplies for midday meal purposes. It is felt that the arrangement now in effect at Berens River should not have been started without first consulting us.\n\nChildren who are residing too far from a day school should be placed in a residential school. If there is no accommodation in any of the residential schools at the moment consideration could be given to discharging from the residential school some children whose parents are able to provide for them and who reside close to a day school and in this way accommodation could be made available for more deserving cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

With reference to the above, I have to report\nsometime ago, Mr. McPherson, Esq., schoolteacher for the United\nChurch Indian Mission called at this office and requested\nthat I attend an Indian Council meeting in connection with\nthe demolishing of the old school.\n\n2. This P.M. accompanied by Chief Mr. Berens I\nproceeded to the Department school and attended the meeting.\n\n3. After some discussion thirty-eight local Indians\nwere nominated to demolish the school, beginning May 16th and\nin return for their labor each would receive portions of the\nused material to repair their homes.\n\n4. Everyone appeared satisfied and the meeting\nclosed at 4:30 P.M.\n\n5. In conclusion I might say I believe this the\nquickest way to demolish the school, and it will help those\nwho work, as it now stands it spoils the appearance of the\nnew school and interferes with the playgrounds.\n\n6.

McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that seven children of our faith between the ages of six and fifteen are residing on the Berens River Reserve, a distance of from four to five miles away from school. I have been paying a man to bring these children to school by horse and sleigh but find that I am unable to continue, for financial reasons. I understand that the Indian Department is operating school vans on other Reserves, as for instance Fisher River. The man that has been doing this work satisfactory so far is a former Fisher River Indian, now residing in Berens River. He is willing to continue for a consideration of seventy-five cents to one dollar per day.\n\nPlease give this your immediate attention that these children may continue to attend school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned\n\n\"Luther L. Schuetze\"\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: School Van for Berens River\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from Luther Schuetze, Missionary at Berens River.\n\nOn receiving this letter, I immediately wrote Lance Corporal Galcraft, R.C.M.P., Berens River. I wish to quote the following from Mr. Galcraft's letter:\n\n\"The longest distance anyone is from the school is 2\u00bd miles. It seems funny that these children went to school in the past without all this fuss, at least I never heard of any. Mr. Schuetze is only asking for trouble and making the Indians lazy. The man who has been driving these children to school is Alex Cochrane, who is not a member of the Berens River Band and has no right to be living on the Reserve. There are other children going to the R.C. School who do not complain about the distance they have to walk. I understand that Mr. Schuetze wants a school van like they have at Fisher River.\"\n\nI wish to state that in my opinion Lance Corporal Galcraft has given a very fair view in this matter. I would like to point out that if the Department starts this at Berens River, they will want the same for every Reserve along the Lake. I have had requests of this nature from time to time but the children have always managed to get to school and have done so on this Reserve for many years. You will note in Mr. Schuetze's letter that Cochrane wishes to receive 75\u00a2 to $1.00 per day. I would like the Department to advise me what I should do in a case of this kind.\n\nI cannot understand why Mr. Schuetze is taking up this matter as he is not the teacher on this Reserve. This is not the first time that Mr. Schuetze has interfered in the handling of this Reserve. Lance Corporal Galcraft has always been able to adjust any trouble that has come up on this Reserve.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant with reference to the request that you have received for the transportation to the day school on the Reserve of certain children who attend the Berens River U.C. Day School.\n\nThe Department has no funds for such expenditure at the present time and consequently it is impossible to give any consideration to the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nRe: Inspection of Indian Day Schools\u2014Reserve River, Man.\n\nIn connection with the above I beg to report this day, I proceeded to the Roman Catholic Indian Day School for the purpose of making a general inspection.\n\nThis school was found in a clean tidy condition except for the latrines which need rebuilding. The school teacher, a Sister of the Roman Catholic Order, was interviewed and had no complaints to make. Thirty-two children are recorded on the register, but only twenty-five were in attendance. Of the thirty-two recorded, fourteen were white or non-native children and the remainder treaty. Various students' books were examined and note was taken of the children's desks. Quite a number of these are broken and need replacing. Approximately thirty single desks would be sufficient.\n\nThis P.M., I proceeded to the United Church Indian Day School and found the school in a very neat condition. The teacher Mrs. A. Chenoweth was interviewed and complained of irregular attendance. (This matter is being looked into in course.) Considerable improvement was noticed in the children since a new teacher has been placed there. For instance due to reasons I noticed all the children spoke English instead of Indian, and when examining them during their lessons I found their books exceptionally neat. Forty-two children are recorded here but only twenty-two were present; those recorded are mostly children. During my inspection I noticed the teacher's desk is an old table. If a new desk were supplied it would place this school in first class order.\n\nFurther to the above I might add a hot meal is supplied to the children at noon which is very beneficial to them as the larger portion appear undernourished.\n\nI respectfully request that a copy of this report be forwarded to Mr. Macdonald, M.A., Indian Agent, for his information.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nO.C., \"D\" Divn., RCMP,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nForwarded, 21-3-40.

He requests 3 screens for windows and one screen door. If you consider these are required, you may arrange for the purchase.\n\nHe also requests 15 gallons of paint & paint brushes, one kalsomine brush and 15 gallons of shingle stain. As the total cost of these items will probably exceed $50, purchase will have to be made through our Purchasing Branch. Repeated instructions have been issued to Indian agents to the effect that when purchases exceed $50 detailed information must be given, and such requests should be accompanied by an explanatory letter stating the agent's opinion regarding the request. For instance, in this case very little information has been given regarding the quality of material required, and besides no mention is made of labour. Is it the intention of the teacher to do the work free of charge if the material is supplied? If labour is required, you should state whether Indian or white labour can be secured and the approximate cost. You must realize that our funds are limited and very explicit information must be given so as to enable us to make a decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., July 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding Mr. Brown's requisition for paint, shingle paint, screens, etc. for the Berens River U.C. Indian Day School, I wish to advise that at the time this requisition went forward to the Department we were very busy here as we had just returned from paying Treaty on Lake Winnipeg. I regret very much that we did not attach a letter giving particulars as to the condition of the school, etc. However, I wish to state that at Treaty time I inspected this school and found it badly in need of paint both inside and out. I would recommend that paint be supplied for the outside this year and possibly funds will be available next year to paint the inside. The labour of putting on the paint will be done by the school teacher, assisted by the Indians without any cost to the Department. Regarding the quality of paint, I would consider that a good quality of paint should be supplied.\n\nRelative to the screen windows and the screen door, I wish to advise that when the school was built these items were not supplied. I consider that they are required and I am having them made and shipped at a cost of $20.40 as instructed by you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE.

McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to amounts of $14.28 and $19.65 that you state are still owing to the Codville Company Limited, Winnipeg.\n\nIt is true that these items were included on your voucher No. 206, but, as the accounts covered by that voucher referred to supplies purchased for three different schools, it was found necessary to file each account on a separate file. As you are aware, separate vouchers should be forwarded for each school; otherwise, the Department is unable to keep a proper record of the expenditures.\n\nI have made inquiries today and for some unaccountable reason the two accounts to which you refer have been mislaid. As far as we can find at the present time they have not been paid. It will, therefore, be necessary for you to secure duplicate accounts for the amounts of $14.28 and $19.65. When submitting them a separate voucher should be forwarded for each one, as the first-mentioned account applies to the Berens River R.C. School and the other to the Little Grand Rapids R.C.

School re the residence there.\n\nApparently high water conditions there have flooded the basement to a depth of 14\" and the water remaining there during the summer has swelled the supporting posts and caused the floors to heave so that the doors can not be closed. I would ask for authority to have this water taken out and some interior decorating done in this residence for the new Teacher. I am enclosing herewith a requisition for the approximate cost.\n\nI might add here that I have included in our 1946-47 estimates a sum to cover this decorating and also painting of exterior but if possible would recommend the interior be done this fall if possible.\n\nE.

Day School.\n\nThe basement of this residence has been flooded for the last two summers with the result that the supports have swelled and are heaving the floor. This matter was gone into by Mr. McPherson with Cpl Newton during treaty payments and it was decided that the best method of keeping this basement dry was to install the drain for which I have included pipe and labour estimate.\n\nMr Street, the Teacher has also asked for 2 new doors and window shades for the residence. The present doors are cracked and beyond repair. I would recommend that if at all possible these supplies be granted and the labour authorized so as to get this residence repaired before the cold weather sets in.\n\nF. M. Hughes,\nActing Indian Agent\nOttawa, 14 September 1946.\n\nMr. F.M.

I was also pleased to note that Manual training equipment has been purchased and has been used for a few months. A new water cooler has been received and also the lunch supplies for the next term.\n\nI am enclosing a Report on buildings and equipment that is used in Manitoba. I would like you to note the comments thereon.\n\nMr. Street has charge of this school with 39 children enrolled, and 29 were present on this visit. Mr. Street has been engaged in the teaching of Indian children for many years. He has the work of his school very well organized, and the work of the classroom is progressing quite well. I have noticed that the Indian children do not read with much expression, and their voices are low and inclined to be somewhat of a monotone.\n\nI was impressed with the work that has been done in Nature Study, and the collections and designs of leaves is very good. The work of the boys in Manual is very good and leads me to think that a school programme for these children should be made as practical as possible. Here also the writing, printing and drawing are good.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn B. Menzies\nGimli, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6227, file 500-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nComments based on visits to the Indian Schools at Barans River.\n\nI was fortunate on this visit to meet the Indian Agent, Mr. Olson, and had a very interesting and informal chat with him. I regret I was unable to get to the school at Bloodvein.\n\nAs a result of observations in classrooms it is my opinion that we should not expect Indian Schools to follow the curriculum of any particular Province. I am becoming a firm believer that the Indian child does require a special Programme of Studies with a trend to the practical, and any approach to the theoretical should be made as practical. My reason for this is that the Indian child has skillful hands and this should be utilized to a much greater extent than it is at present.\n\nWith regard to the teachers, I do believe that they should have at least a Normal Training, and also a Course on Special Methods that would be based on the Programme that they would be using.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The smoothing planes are too awkward for boys. So we returned them and asked for an iron vice with a vise which we need for the craft. We had marked the planes as we have marked all our tools to prevent theft, with 3 pipe markers.

Their ages are not given, but taking the usual average this would give from 15 to 20 children of school age. I may add that the pay list does not show the religious persuasion of any of the Indians, but I take it for granted that the Indians who signed the petition are all Roman Catholics. The census return for the Berens River Band for the year ended 31st of March, 1912, shows that there are 285 Indians in the Band, 239 of whom are Methodist and the balance, 46, are given as Roman Catholics. The Methodists have a large day school on the reserve with an enrolment of from 40 to 50 children out of a school population of 56. No doubt some of the children attending the\nthe Methodist School are Roman Catholics and if the Department decides to establish a second school on the reserve there would be enough children to justify its doing so.\n\nI may mention that this is one of the reserves in which the religious work was exclusively carried on by the Methodists, but the Roman Catholics have been gradually working in until they have the number of adherents above mentioned.\n\nThere is an application now before the Department for the establishment of a boarding school on this reserve under the auspices of the Methodist church.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Perrault.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to report how many Roman Catholic Indians there are on the reserve and how many children of school age among them, also whether they are so situated that they could take advantage of a school if one were established.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

There are thirty-two children of age to go to school.\n\nIn consequence of these facts, we humbly apply to the Indian Department that a day school be established on the reserve as soon as possible.\n\nWm Boucher, constable,\nJames Bear,\nJames Flett,\nDonald Bruce,\nAlexander Swain,\nJohn Whiskis,\nWm \" Alexander Patrick\n\nElija Baptiste\nDonald Everett\nMaggie Everett\nAndre Felix Rei\nFrancis Rei\nCatherine Patrick (Widow)\nMary Bear\nDonald Bittern\n\nThe above names have been signed in presence of Wm Boucher, constable of this reserve, who handed them to me to forward to you.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS.

The statistics for 1912 in this office gives the number of Roman Catholics in Berens River at 44. The Revd Mr Perrault informed me that it was desired to have the school built near the Catholic Church which is not a central position but is on the Lake shore, and would be inconvenient for the children who live up the river.\n\nThe present school is roomy and in good repair, but the returns for the quarter ending March 31st 1913, showing the No of children of school age as 76 and the No of Pupils on Register only 19 would indicate a reason other than sickness for non-attendance.\n\nSo far as schools are concerned, the presence of two opposing creeds in so small a reserve would seem a drawback.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report on the project of a Catholic Day School for Berens River Indian Reserve. I have the following reasons to give in recommendation thereof:\n\n1st.\u2014There are about 30 Catholic children of school age on the Reserve, as appeareth from List enclosed, drawn up by Rev. Father Allard last October.\n\n2nd.\u2014These children and their parents are mostly grouped around the Catholic Mission, and at a distance of about 3 miles from the Methodist Mission and school. As a matter of fact they do not attend the school at the Methodist Mission because of the distance.\n\n3rd.\u2014We have a Missionary stationed at Berens River, which should be a guarantee of permanency and success for the school.\n\nFor these considerations I trust the Government will see its way to provide a sum for the construction of said Day School and a salary for the Teacher.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour most obedient Servant,\n\nChas. Cahill, Supt. of Missions.\n\nP.S. I presume accommodation should be provided for 40 children.\nJanuary 14, 1915.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with an application for the establishment of a Roman Catholic day school at the Berens River reserve, the erection of a building and the provision for the salary of a teacher. The Estimates of the Department have been already prepared for submission to Parliament. This year we are compelled to be economical in our demands upon the Treasury, but your application will be given due consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

I have been thinking that possibly a compromise could be arrived at. The matter of a School Building might be waved for the present. I am told there is a large house near the Mission that would be suitable for school purposes and could be rented reasonably. A beginning could be made in this way, and the Department would have more time in which to acquaint itself with the requirements of the situation. If you think this latter plan presents less difficulties you are free to adopt it.\n\nThere would be no question of opening the school before next summer,\u2014probably in August.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChas.

(RG 10, Volume 6228, file 501-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 474654 of January 19th requiring that I check over the list of children who would be likely to attend a school if erected and under the management of the Roman Catholic Church, I respectfully beg to state that I have visited Beren's River and have ascertained that the number of children who would probably attend a Roman Catholic school at Beren's River, if built, would be about 30 as shown upon the list.\n\nWhen I examined the Beren's River on the 22nd ultimo, I found that Nos. 5, 6, 7, 19, 20, 27, 27 and 29 were entered on the school register, and had been attending during the winter, five of whom were at the school at the time of my inspection.\n\nThe distance between the Roman Catholic and the Methodist Missions is not more than two miles; and the erection of another day school would appear to be a waste of money, so far as education for Indian children is concerned; for all of the children named on the list can attend school during the winter months. During the summer many families are away so that there would not be many attending any school.\n\nI beg to return the lists.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nA word in regard to the request from the Roman Catholics for a day school at Beren's River. I have just been looking over the report of 1913, (I have no report for 1914 by me), and I find that in 1913 the population at Beren's River is given as 285. 239 are Methodists and 44 Roman Catholics. There are 51 children from 6 to 15 years inclusively. This would give the Roman Catholics a little less than 8 children of school age. I knew it would be a great imposition on the Methodist Church for the Government to give assistance to the Roman Catholics at that point for any kind of a school. A couple of years ago I had considerable difficulty in holding down the fire-brands which were preparing to make a blaze over the Cross Lake situation, and I am afraid the blaze would flare up if any assistance were given by the Government to the Roman Catholics to establish a day school at Beren's River. The Methodist Church would never think of asking for Government help on a Reserve where the percentage of population were reversed.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nT.F./M.C.E.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the presence of the Chief and Councillors I put the question to each applicant for annuity, as to what denomination he or she belonged, but as in your letters you only asked for the names of parents of Catholic children of school age, I did not submit names of Catholic adults who had no children. In making up the census for the past fiscal year, I could not be positive that the number of Catholics exceeded 15, but a considerable increase will be shown in the...\ncensus column of the statistics for the present fiscal year as a result of my enquiries at the last annuity payments, there being several families where the husband is a Protestant and the wife a Catholic, also one Wm Gibault, who has a son in the Brandon Industrial school, is stated to be a Catholic, but as this man was absent at treaty time, I was unable to ascertain as to the correctness of this statement.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nDuncan C.

There are already 29 treaty Indian children of school age without counting 4 non treaty, according to the Catholic Mission register furnished to me by Father C.Perrault in charge.\n\nThose children cannot attend the only school already established as it is denominational, being conducted by the Methodist Church, therefore it would be only but fair that the Indian Department grants to the Roman Catholic Indians of Berens River a school where their children be educated according to their faith, as they are in sufficient number to furnish the required attendance.\n\nI ask you to kindly recommend the petition and allow me to forward to the Indian Department through a deputy M.P. whom I know personally.\n\nPlease return to me as follows\n\nS.Perrault O.M.I.,\nHoly Ghost Church,\n341 Selkirk Ave,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nyours truly\n\n(Signed) S.Perrault O.M.I.\nI have received a letter from the Revd. Father S. Perrault, O.M.I., of 341 Selkirk Ave., Winnipeg, Man., stating that a petition has been sent asking for a further consideration of the request for the establishment of a Roman Catholic School in the Berens River Reserve.\n\nI enclose a copy of the letter but the petition did not accompany the letter. There is a difference between the number of children of school age quoted by Father Perrault and the number in my list submitted to the Department on October 19th 1915, but it is possible some children have attained school age since that date.\n\nFather Perrault spoke to me at Berens River upon this matter stating that, as I was the representative of the Government in regard to matters pertaining to Indians of the Berens River Band, it would be necessary that the petition should have my recommendation to be favourably considered.\n\nI do not know what to say about this, for everything seems to show that the Churches are defeating the object they profess to have in view by their determination to secure control in the Indian schools, and in many cases it seems to be a cause of strife, an obstacle to education and creating a contempt for Christianity. However, Father Perrault quoted sub-section 3 of Section 97 of the Indian Act, and I find myself undecided as to what attitude I should assume in the matter.\nIf it is necessary for me to make a recommendation for or against the petition for a Roman Catholic School to be established in the Berens River Reserve, I respectfully beg to ask that the Department grant me guidance that I may act in accordance with your wish.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\nFisher River Agency.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nRennie River\n\n290 Mette RC Other beliefs\n230 - 56 - 4\n84 Children of school age\n\n43 on River at 20.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was shown at the time that the number of Roman Catholic children of school age was larger than required for the establishment of a separate school according to the Indian Act and Regulations made thereunder.\n\nThe answer of the Department is somehow lost, but was to the effect that the Department did not understand how such could be the case with the data on hand. The matter seems to have been referred to the Indian Agent T.H. Carter, who on the 19th, of October 1915, wrote to the Department enclosing a list of the Roman Catholic children at Berens River, then amounting to 23. This was two years ago, and at present there are 50 well authenticated Roman Catholic children of school age who would attend - not including a few non treaty Indian children living closely in the neighborhood.\n\nI, therefore, again urgently submit this matter to the most careful and early consideration of the Department.\n\nI enclose my own list of the Roman Catholic children of school age now at Berens River, and also the one of T.H.

His application on behalf of the Roman Catholic Indians of the Beren's River Band Treaty No.5, that a separate Indian School be allowed them on their reserve, is one which deserves every consideration, and accordingly I strongly recommend it. After carefully examining the Statement herewith enclosed, I am satisfied that the Department will admit the justice of the petition, and the desirability of readily complying with it. May I hope that you will see your way to establish in a near future, a separate school for the Roman Catholic Indians of the Beren's River Band Treaty No.5, and hear that the application hereto annexed has met favorably.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was able to give a good dinner for the seven cents as I did the work myself and had no expenses to pay.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\n(Signed) F.

I respectfully beg to recommend that these be sent him direct to Berens River via. the Northern Fish Co., Selkirk, Man.\n\nI also beg to submit copies of letters relative to a request for providing a meal to the children attending this school.\n\nI must leave this matter entirely to your judgement as my experience teaches me that, except in very rare cases, the supply of provisions in any way free, to Indians is unnecessary and only teaches them to neglect their usual means of obtaining food for themselves.

Arthur Barner who is now visiting the Lake Winnipeg District. He writes from Berens River under date of July 8th\u2014\n\n\"The Roman Catholic Church has 156 acres of land here about half a mile west of the Hudson's Bay Buildings, with a church and a small mission thereon. There are stationed here now one Priest, and two Brothers, one of whom, a Mr. Leech is here with the distinct understanding that he shall organize a school. The Priest is now away in Selkirk purchasing lumber, etc., and hiring men to build a school house, which they tell the people will be a Boarding School in which the children will be boarded all week and sent home over Sundays. There seems to be no question that this movement is in progress. The present Chief Berens has not been consulted. He is simply hostile and threatens to go to Ottawa regarding the matter. Mr. Ferrier has been informed.\"\n\nI am, of course, aware of the regulation of the Department, which provides for the establishment of an additional school where a Roman Catholic or Protestant Minority can furnish Official evidence.\nof a sufficient number of children of their denomination.\n\nI had not heard, however, that this Department had provided in their estimates for the building of a Roman Catholic School at Berens River during the present year. I feel quite sure that in any case no Boarding School has been authorized, or in any way provided for by the Indian Dept.\n\nMr. Barnet, however, is very careful in his observations, and exact in his reports, and I cannot help feeling disturbed as to the effect upon our work at Berens River if the facts are as stated in his letter, even though the course of action reported may not yet have received official sanction by the Indian Dept.\n\nI should be very glad to learn the present position of affairs in the Indian Dept. as relating to the question of schools at Berens River. I also feel that the information contained in Mr. Barnet's letter, unless already known at Ottawa, ought to be put into your hands. Mr. Perrier is on a visit to Nelson House.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHA/M.\nOttawa, July 30, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant embodying an extract from a letter from the Rev. Arthur Burner in reference to the establishment of a Roman Catholic school at Barrens River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that six years ago an application was made for the establishment of a Roman Catholic day school on the Barrens River Reserve. This was renewed from time to time until February of this year, when the Department consented to the establishment of a Roman Catholic day school there, as it was shown that there were a sufficient number of Roman Catholic children of school age to entitle them to a school of their own. Mr. Agent Carter, in a statement of the Roman Catholic children on the Barrens River Reserve, showed that there were twenty-three of school age. The Department agreed to allow a salary of $600.00 a year for a teacher and to pay the ordinary running expenses of the school, such as fuel, books, etc., on condition that a suitable building was provided by the church. The school is in charge of Mr. Frederick Issach.\n\nThe Department has no intention of establishing a Roman Catholic boarding school at this point, and in fact a school of this class was never applied for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Day School at Berens River has been shipped to the Rev. Father Leach as directed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nOfficer in Charge of L.D. Warehouse, Winnipeg.\nDear Sir:\n\nI feel it my duty to write you regarding the day schools here at Berens River. At Treaty Time I asked the Inspector Mr. Bunn about the school that the Catholics were building here, as I had heard nothing about it before. He assured me that the Government knew nothing about it and was not giving it their support. However, I am not satisfied as the teacher tells me that the Government is supporting them. I would like to say here that I as chief am not in favor of this school. For years we have been asking for a Boarding School to be erected here under the Methodist Church and were assured that when the Government saw its way clear they would give us one.\n\nOne school is enough on this reserve, and I am sorry that just as everything is running smoothly another should come in to make trouble. Our Teacher has been doing good work during the past winter and we would like to see the Government enforce education here and make the children attend the Government school. We thought the Government needed all the money they could get while the war lasted and therefore do not see the necessity of paying two teachers when one can do the work.\n\nHoping you will give this matter your earliest attention, and waiting your reply. I am Your Obedient Servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Of Berens River Band.\nOttawa, August 17, 1918.\n\nDear Chief,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the opening of a second school on the Berens River reserve. Under Section 97 of the Indian Act, the Roman Catholic minority of the Berens River reserve were entitled to ask for the establishment of the school; this they did, and when it was shown to the satisfaction of the Department that there were sufficient children of school age belonging to that faith on the reserve to warrant the opening of a school, the consent of the Department was given.\n\nYour contention that one teacher could do the work is not borne out by the representations made to the Department, the last census showed that there were over 80 children of school age on the reserve; these could not possibly be accommodated in one building and taught with any proper results by one person.\n\nChief W.

H. Allen Davis was there and did not get any pay yet...and as for the reason why I could not stay any longer it was because of my health being sick I had to come back to be treated by the doctor after being sick last fall with pneumonia. So should you be kind enough to send the $50 dollars which was supposed to come according to my duty of teaching class for that month as for the same purpose of my well Education and enough Experience for that cause I think I should get the payment I deserve as I hope you will forward it to me soon some time as I need the money just now...much obliged to you.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Day School during the month of September and part of October, 1920, and request that payment be made you for your services.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has no record of your having been teaching during the period stated, but inquiry will be made and as soon as a reply is received you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss M. Kent,\n33 Victoria St.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nOttawa, April 2, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Miss M. Kent, 83 Victoria St., St. Boniface, Man., claiming payment for one month and a half, which period she states she taught school at Berens River under instructions of Rev. Father Vales.\n\nThe Department has no record of the appointment of Miss Kent and it is presumed that the school to which she refers is the Roman Catholic Indian Day School at Berens River. Returns received from this school show that Miss Josephine St. Denis was appointed and took charge after the summer holidays, namely, on September 1st, 1920. The amount claimed by Miss Kent is $50.00. As Miss St. Denis is the teacher recognized by the Department and as she has been paid for the period which Miss Kent claims to have taught, it will not be possible to make any further payment. I shall be pleased if you will make inquiries into this matter and inform the Department as soon as possible as to who authorized the appointment of Miss Kent and the amount promised her for her services. You should consult Father Vales and furnish full information in the matter at an early date, in order that the claim of Miss Kent can be given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Kent, as teacher of the Berens River R.C. Indian Day School and at that time I inquired of him if Miss Kent's appointment was approved by the Department, and he stated that he was taking her out on approbation, and he later informed me that she did not prove satisfactory and she returned shortly after. I cannot state how long she taught as she did not send in any return.\n\nFather Vales left Berens River at the beginning of last month and intends going to France, and he informed me that he would interview the Department in regards to the Berens River R.C. Indian Day School and if the information required in your letter have not been furnished by him, I have written to the present teacher of this school, Miss Josephine St. Denis, requesting her for a report which I will forward to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This came to hand on the 22nd Oct., last.\n\nWhen I received this letter I sent it to the Indian Office at Selkirk, here I was informed by Mr. Agent Latulippe, through his clerk Mr. E. Millidge, that there was no letter authorizing the appointment of B. Guimond as school teacher at the R.C. Day School at Berens' River. It was also stated through the same medium that Father Grandpr\u00e9 had mentioned this change, but Mr. Agent Latulippe did not insure the regularity of this matter by making mention of his information to the Department. If this had been done the matter would have been properly closed and adjusted.\n\nI got the letter back on the 27th Oct., and a suggestion to call up the Father Provincial, the Rev'd. Father Beyes. I called up and found that the Father Provincial was absent for an indefinite period. Father Magnan, who was acting for him, was also out. Later I was fortunate enough to get in touch with Father Magnan, and I got the required information, that was on the 10th Nov., instant. This is as follows.\n\nThe R.C. Church have started a Day School at Little Grand Rapids, and as Reverend Brother Leech is well experienced in that kind of work, he was sent to assist in organizing this work, and he was replaced, at Berens' River Day School, R.C., by Boniface Guimond, acting under the tutelage of the Reverend Father who is in charge of the R.C. Mission at Berens' River. All these facts would have been placed before the Department by the Church, but unfortunately when the arrangement was completed and the Rev'd. Missionary of Berens' came to meet Rev'd Father Beyes, he missed him as he had just left for the absence I have mentioned, and the matter was overlooked.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 30th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, regarding the teacher of the Boreas River R.C.

Day School\nBerens River, Man.\nMarch 31st 1923\n\nThe Indian Agent\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter experiencing the winter in the above school and observing the suffering of the children caused through the absolutely inadequate care, which as teacher, I have been unable to give them, I am resolved to plead on their behalf, to the Government's generosity for aid in providing them with better care for the next winter.\n\nThe aid I would ask is a log house, size 20x30 ft., half of which I could use as a home for myself, the other half would be a dinning room and rest room for the scholars.\n\nUnder the present conditions, the children walk two and three miles, crossing the open lake in the bitterest weather, and remaining all day without even a cup of hot water.\n\nWhen taken suddenly sick, as repeatedly happened in this February and March epidemic of La Grip, I had only the cold floor on which to lay them.\n\nWith the above building opening into the schoolroom, I could provide decent care in cases of emergency, without neglect of the other scholars, and hot meals at noon, which I am positive would prevent much of the sickness among the children in the winter time.\n\nMy idea of living in the building myself, is to be in a position to train the girls in housekeeping and cooking, of which they stand in so much need as future wives and mothers.\n\nAlso I would open up free classes of child nursing and care, and sick nursing, both for the girls and for the present mothers, which I feel would reduce much of the sickness and death which now prevails in the reserve.\n\nTrusting my plea will appeal to the Government's generosity,\n\nI remain\nYours faithfully\n(signed) Patricia F. Fuller\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find herewith copy of communication received from Miss Patricia F. Fuller, the teacher at the Berens River R.C. Indian day school, requesting the Department to erect a building for the use of the teacher and dining room and rest room, for the children.\n\nI have obtained from a local dealer the approximate cost of material to erect a building of this size, would be about $375.00, not including legs or labour.\n\nFor the benefit of the children attending the Berens River R.C. day school from a long distance, I would recommend that they be provided with provisions for a mid-day meal during the winter months similar to the other day school on this reserve.\n\nWould you kindly let me know as soon as possible what can be done in regard to above requests.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 26th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the teacher of the Berens River R. C. Indian Day School, in which she requests that a building be erected to provide accommodation for a teacher, as well as a dining and rest room for the children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the conditions at this point as outlined by the teacher in her letter, and the work that could be done if proper accommodation were provided, the Department would be favourably disposed to provide a grant for the purchase of the material required to erect a small log building. However, before we can definitely decide this matter, I shall be pleased if you will write and inform this Department as to whether the Indians would be able to raise the necessary funds and perform the labour in erecting the building. If, of course, the Indians would be able to do so, it would be necessary for the Department to provide the material for finishing the building, such as flooring, windows, doors, shingles, hardware, etc. I shall also be pleased if you will state the present accommodation provided for the teacher, and where she is residing. If the Indians will do all the work in securing the logs and erecting the building, you should, if possible, forward an itemized estimate of the materials we would be called upon to supply.\n\nRegarding the providing of a midday meal, I beg to say that, if a building is erected and accommodation provided for preparing and serving the same, we will be prepared to authorize the supplying of the necessary provisions.\n\nAs soon as we hear from you, giving full particulars as asked for, we will be in a position to decide whether we can provide a grant for the supplying of the material required in the erection of the building or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She will reopen the school on Augt. 1st and thus put in the month lost this quarter.\n\nMaterial for the building of a lavatory for the school, is included in her requisition. This I understand is greatly needed, and would cost in the neighbourhood of $65.00, including painting. Should this requisition for expenditure be forwarded to the Commissioner at Regina, or am I right in submitting it to you?\n\nI also enclose Poplar River school returns, for quarter ending 30th June, and requisition for school material.

Indian Day Schools, together with requisitions for school material and other supplies.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that both these schools closed at the end of May and will re-open on the last of August, next. The salary for the June quarter is being paid to the teacher of each of these schools for two months.\n\nWith reference to the request of the teacher for the building of a lavatory at the Berens River R. C. School and your estimate as to the cost, I beg to say that you may arrange during the present holidays to have a suitable building erected. Separate toilets should be provided for the boys and girls, as well as for the teacher. You should have this work done as inexpensively as possible. It is noted that you estimate the cost to be approximately $65, including painting.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase and delivery to the school of 24 cups, 6 spoons, 6 plates, 100 pounds beans, 100 pounds rice, 20 pounds cocoa and 1 case milk. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the lumber and other material required in the erection of the toilets and for the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the above authorized supplies for the midday meal.\n\nI may say that we are placing an order with the Government Stationery Office to forward the stationery, etc., asked for by the teacher for the use of the classroom. We are ordering the anatomy chart asked for by the teacher, but I would point out that this chart, which costs $15, is not authorized for the use of day schools. However, after the report as to the benefits which she derives from its use, we are making an exception in this case. The teacher should see that the chart is properly cared for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. O.

This building (see Dept letter #125-16-5, dated 21st June) as originally estimated on, was intended to be a log building, separate from the school and to be used as teachers residence and dining and rest room for the pupils. As the Indians did not get out the logs last winter, the R.C. missionary and the school teacher decided to build an all frame \"lean to\" addition to the school, which they considered would be more convenient and require less fuel in the winter, than two separate buildings. When I was at Berens River in July on my inland trip, the building, as a \"lean to\" had been started and I thought with a little more expense it could be carried to the height of the school house and give more accommodation for the teacher upstairs. This alteration I promised to take up with the Department on my return, but owing to a misunderstanding they went ahead, and on my return from inland the building was completed. Father Grandpr\u00e9 had supplied the extra material required from lumber he had bought for another building and has sent in the bill for amount, as above stated.\n\nI regret exceedingly that this mistake has been made, and trust you will see your way to pass the account, after this explanation from me,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n| ARTICLES          | Moody | Reid | Robins |\n|------------------|-------|------|--------|\n| Supplies for     |       |      |        |\n| Reserve River R.C.| $150  | $73  | $21    |\n| Dry Salt         |       |      |        |\n| Letter 125-16-5   |       |      |        |\n| 28th June 1924    |       |      |        |\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory, for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\nDept. of: Indian Affairs\nDate: Sept. 22, 1924\nCity or town: Ottawa\nProvince: ON\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Tin cups #9      | 24       | $1.60 per doz | $3.20 |\n| Desert Spoons    | 6        | $0.74 each   | $4.44 |\n| Plates           | 6        | $1.28 each   | $7.68 |\n\nTotal: $15.32\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are willing to prepare the ground for this purpose (the proceeds when ready to the children) if the Department will furnish us with sufficient turnip, onion and carrot seeds. Each child will his or her own little plot to look after. The garden would be about one acre in extent. To stimulate interest at Treaty time the Agent could come and judge which he considers the two best gardens and we would give small cash prizes.\n\nWill you kindly ask the Department if they will agree to furnish seed. I am asking now because if I send my request by the March quarter I could not get the seeds until open water and I need them before this.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n(Signed) F.

If so it seems strange to me that the department should do so. I ask for one when we built the school in 1918. None was sent. Again about five years ago I requisitioned for one and again none was given. The table I am using at present belongs to the mission and is a very old and dilapidated one. I trust that you will do your best to see that one is sent out before the close of navigation.\n\nHerewith enclosed you will find a short requisition for drugs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6228, file 501-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLICUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of a requisition dated the 29th ultimo for supplies for the Berens River R. C. Day School.\n\nOur records show that 1500 pounds biscuits have been supplied this school this year. In addition to this, you may purchase two cases Carnation milk and twenty-five pounds sugar. Owing to the reduction in our Appropriation, these are the only articles that can be supplied for midday meal purposes. No authority can be given for the purchase of beans, rice, tea, salt and soup plates.\n\nYou may also purchase one water pail, two brooms, twelve bars soap, one scrubbing brush, one wash basin and twelve cups.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nE. Millidge, Esq.,\nIndian Office,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man. 21st August, 1933\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 125-16-4 of 21st ultimo authorizing the purchase of a small amount of mid-day meal supplies for the Berens River R.C. Day School, I beg to advise you that the School Teacher, Mr. F. Leach, called at the office today enquiring about these supplies. I read the department letter to him and he expressed his regret that these supplies had been reduced to such an extent. He pointed out that there was no necessity to supply sugar, if the tea and rice were cut out.\n\nHe also informed me that the teacher at the protestant school at Berens River had told him that he had received all the mid-day meals requisitioned for this year and that the fact that one school would be in a position to give the pupils a hot lunch, would tend to greatly reduce the attendance at the school where none was provided.\n\nHe requested me to write to the department and asked them to reconsider their decision.\n\nKindly answer by return mail so that these supplies can go forward as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Millidge,\nActing Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 26, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, in which you advise that the teacher of the Berens River R.C. School states that a smaller quantity of midday meal supplies is being allowed for his school than for the Berens River U.C. School.\n\nIn this connection I would request you to state what supplies have been purchased for midday meal purposes at the Berens River U.C. School. Our files do not show that any authority has been given for the purchase of midday meal supplies at this school for the academic year 1933-34. The last authority for midday meal supplies was contained in official letter of April 26th, last, and it is presumed that the articles purchased at that time would be used during the June quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. Millidge, Esq.,\nIndian Office,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Mar. 29th, August, 1933\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, No. 125-16-5 of 26th instant, referring to the reducing of supplies for mid-day meal at Berens River R.C. Day School, and requesting information regarding the supplies that have been already purchased for the U.C. Day School on the same Reserve.\n\nThese supplies were authorized in letter, No. 125-8-5 of 26th April last and were intended for the mid-day meal for the term 1933-1934.\n\nNo midday meals are given to the pupils during the summer months or in fact from last May th 15th, October and it was on account of the U.C. School teachers at both Berens River and Pekangkum requisitioning for these supplies so early that the requisitions were forwarded to the Department in April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Milligan,\nActing Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 1, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in further reference to midday meal supplies for the Berens River R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of your report that the supplies purchased in April, last, for the Berens River U.C. Day School were intended for use during the academic year 1933-34, I beg to say that you may purchase for use at the Berens River R. C. Day School the following midday meal supplies: 150 pounds beans, 50 pounds rice, 2 cases milk, 50 pounds sugar, 50 pounds salt and 40 pounds cocoa.\n\nThe midday meal at both schools should only be served from November 1st to April 1st. The supplies already authorized for both schools are considered ample for this period, and no further expenditure for midday meal supplies can be authorized at either school during the academic year 1933-34.\n\nYou may also purchase, for use at the Berens River R. C. Day School, 24 plates, 1 water pail, 2 brooms, 12 bars soap, 1 scrubbing brush, 24 cups and 12 pounds yarn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. Millidge, Esq.,\nIndian Office,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI received a request from Rev. Father Degrandpre at Berens River that the Department supply a number of seats for the R.C. Day School at that point. There are a number of seats and desks out of the old Brandon School which are at present stored in one of the barns. Dr. Doyle informs me that he has no further use for them, and if the Department would consent to the expenditure in connection with freight charges, I could have these transferred to Brother F. Leach, the teacher in charge at Berens River. A small expense will also be incurred in crating the desks for shipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nYou do not state in your letter what it would cost to crate some of the old desks at Brandon and ship them to Berens River, but, if this can be done for a small cost, you may make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

DeGrandpre,\nUniversity of Ottawa\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Father:\n\nI am very sorry that I did not have this estimate ready for you last sunday. But the job was much larger than I had anticipated. I appreciate you writing me.\n\nThe enclosed estimate will give you practically all the information that you will require. You will notice that I have described the pieces and their uses as well as the price per each or thousand. This is an approximate figure of course. In giving you the cash discount of 20% on the items marked other than net, this bill amounts to $1,196.56. These figures are based on all number one material. A saving of at least additional 10% could be arrived at if number 2 material was used.\n\nTrusting that this meets with the Government's approval, I will be expecting you in to see me on your way back north. Wishing you the best of holidays. I am.\n\nYours truly,\n\nNorth American Lumber & Supply Co., Ltd.,\n[Signature]\nManager - Selkirk Yard.\nMr. P.

And with the authorisation of Rev. Fr. Magnan, Provincial and of Rev. Fr. O. Plourde, O.M.I., instantly ask the D. of Ind. Affairs to stand for the cost of this material, which will be supplied by the N.A.L. Co., Selkirk, Man.\n\nThe other expenses for freight on the boat and labor will be at my charges. The amount shown on the bill is $1195.55 that is for first class material, but to make it smaller I would be satisfied to use all second class, what would bring the amount down to $1086.00.\n\nI would be so pleased and grateful to the Ind. Dept. if my request is granted even if it is only next winter when it is possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. de Grandpr\u00e9, O.M.I.\nOttawa, September 6, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, submitting an estimate of the cost of a teacher's residence for the Berens River R.C.

It is noted that all the materials have been shipped and that the building is now in the course of erection.\n\nIt is also noted that it was your understanding that the Department would provide $4,000 towards the cost of this building. In official letter of the 6th instant we mentioned the sum of $2,000. Owing to the absence of the Deputy Superintendent General on official business, it is not possible at the present time to promise a larger amount than that mentioned in our previous letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. G. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDecember 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to a letter dated October 8th, addressed to the then Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs, and signed by the Acting Deputy Minister of Public Works, enclosing an account for dredging at Berens River in September.\n\nThe cost of the work as shown by this account is in excess of the amount that was considered the work would cost when same was authorized. As explained in your letter this high cost was due, no doubt, to difficulties over which you had no control.\n\nAs this department has only a limited appropriation available for this work, I would be very glad if you could give consideration to reducing the amount charged to cover only the time taken up by the dredge until it left Berens River.\n\nI am anxious to have this account which is outstanding settled, and will be pleased to have your reply as soon as possible, as it will be necessary to submit a memorandum to Council.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Public Works,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6228, file 501-5, part 2)\nJanuary 4, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have given consideration to your letter of December 25, 1936, in reference to the account rendered by your Department for dredging at Berens River, in September last.\n\nIrrespective of the work of the dredge, the total account rendered this Department for tug hire for towing amounts to $8,600., which expenditure would certainly not have been necessary had the Department not acceded to the request from your Minister to stop at Berens River and do certain dredging there. It was, therefore, considered only fair that the account covering the lay time at Berens River, the towing from Hanusa to Victoria Beach and the lay time at Victoria Beach should be met by your Department.\n\nOur District Engineer reports that unless this amount is collected from the Department of Indian Affairs he will not have sufficient money to maintain the half-pay men employed on this Department's plant during the winter, as this additional tug hire has eaten into the amount allotted for that purpose. However, as you say your Department has also only a limited appropriation for this work, I am willing to meet you by offering to split the total towing account of $8,600., in two, your Department bearing one-half, $4,300., and this Department a similar amount, which would, in effect, reduce the account rendered from $1,797.50 to $1,300., a reduction of $497.50.\n\nI trust this will enable you to get this outstanding account settled.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.F.

I. have recently completed a building at Berens River, Manitoba, for the staff employed in Indian welfare work in that section of the country. This building includes necessary living accommodation for the staff of four (4) Sisters and, also, sufficient room to operate a small hospital. At the present time, there is a staff of four (4) Reverend Sisters, one of whom is in charge of the Berens River R. C. Day School and the other three are handling the hospital work and the social work among the adult Indians of the reserve.\n\nI am attaching to this letter a signed blueprint showing the size and dimensions of the building. I also attach a photograph of the building.\n\nThe expenditure by Les P\u00e8res Oblats to October 1st, 1936, amounted to $9,821.51. Since that time, we have found it necessary to incur an additional expenditure of $1,300.00, which makes the total cost approximately $11,000.00. I understand that an Order-in-Council has been passed authorizing the grant to the Reverend P\u00e8res Oblats of $4,000.00 towards the cost of this building. I would appreciate if cheque for this amount could be forwarded at once to Les P\u00e8res Oblats de M. I., 340 Provencher Ave., St. Boniface, Man.\n\nOn behalf of Les P\u00e8res Oblats, I desire to express our appreciation of the grant that has been made and I trust that the Department will find it possible to favourably consider reimbursing us for our total expenditure and, by so doing, assume complete ownership of this building, which we feel was much needed on the Berens River Reserve. As I mentioned above, this building provides both hospital accommodation and living quarters for a staff who will, in our opinion, give very devoted services to the Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Les P\u00e8res Oblats de M. I.\nReferring to your memorandum of the 3rd instant, relative to providing a grant to the amount of $4,000 towards the cost of the construction of a combined teachers' residence and small hospital erected by the authorities of the Oblate Order at Berens River, Manitoba, I would say that this is a frame building, two stories high, on a cement foundation. The building provides living accommodation for a staff of four (4) Sisters; one of whom is the teacher in the Berens River R.C. Day School and the other three have charge of the hospital work and the social work among the adult Indians of the reserve. This building will be used by the Church authorities as a residence and small hospital, also to provide living accommodation and school facilities for six (6) to eight (8) Indian children who will be kept in residence.\n\nThe expenditure by the Oblate Order on the construction of the building to October 1st, 1936, amounted to $9,821.51, and they state that, since that time, they have incurred an additional expenditure of $1,300., making the total cost of the building approximately $11,000. A blueprint of plan of building has been submitted by the Oblate Order.\n\nThe necessary Order-in-Council having been secured, I recommend that you approve the payment of $4,000 to Les Reverend Peres Oblats, which is the amount provided towards the cost of the construction of the building.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n26th April, 1937.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT P.C. 22/195 of 26th January, 1937, authorized grant of $8,304.00 towards the construction of a residence by the Roman Catholic Church at Berens River, Man., to provide accommodation for the staff employed in Indian welfare work in that section of the country.\n\nTHAT, when the above Order-in-Council was passed, it was understood that the total amount expended by the Roman Catholic Church authorities was $9,521.61.\n\nTHAT information now available shows that the amount expended by the Roman Catholic Church authorities for this building was $11,000.00.\n\nThe undersigned, accordingly, has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of an additional amount of $1,500.00 towards the cost of the building mentioned at Berens River.

Evidently the teachers want the outside of the school painted. This will necessitate not only the purchase of paint but the cost of labour and as you will realize, the Department has to know the approximate cost so that we can decide if funds are available.\n\nThe biscuits will be shipped later as these have not yet been manufactured.

This is a very poor showing and leads the Department to take into consideration means of improvement.\n\nYou will be good enough to visit the parents and impress upon them the necessity for sending their children regularly to school. The experience of the Department shows that the matter of attendance is one which rests very largely with the teacher. If he is interested in his work and enthusiastic and also makes the school attractive to the children there is generally little cause for complaint in so far as attendance is concerned.\n\nThe Department would, therefore, like you to use every effort to effect an improvement and it is to be hoped that the next report from the Agent will show a decided change for the better.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Bagshaw, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nBig Eddy Indian School,\nThe Pas, Sask.\nA well attended school is an encouragement to any teacher, and will stimulate him to making efforts in the work; but a poorly attended school, which is caused by the indifference of parents, will discourage the bravest of teachers.\n\nDear Sir, as a servant of the Department who always tries and has tried for more than 15 years faithfully to do his duty, though often discouraged, I beg you to consider the present state of things, particularly here at The Pas, where the white population is on the increase, bringing with it attractions which are not good for the Indian any more than the White man, making parents more careless and indifferent than before towards their families.\n\nDo not hold the Teacher responsible for these irregular attendance of children, but establish one of two things, either a Boarding School, or Compulsory Education in the Way Schools for a definite number of days in each year, then I think good results may be looked for.\n\nI have the honour to remain\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. H. Bagshaw (Indian Teacher)\ninstead of going to school.\n\nI have here shown to defend myself, and the Teachers in Indian Schools, from the injustice of laying the blame on them, instead of placing it on the right shoulders, which is first the parents, then the Department, and lastly the Teachers.\n\nI always amongst the Indians for their future welfare as well as the present, and believe that all Indian Teachers have striven to do the same, until discouraged by the prevailing circumstances.\n\nIf the Department fully realized (as those who are working amongst the Indians do) the rapid change from morality to immorality which takes place as soon as civilization comes into their midst, undoing all the good that has been done in the past by Teachers as well as missionaries, they (the Department) would lose no time in taking measures to enforce all that is good for the welfare of the Indian and community at large.\n\nThe Teacher needs the Department to back him up, so his work at best, is discouraging, and when the Department takes the side of the Indian against the Teacher, the Indian is not slow to perceive it, and the result is injurious to one and all.\nYou want the Teacher to interest, and attract; there are essentials which must be applied in all schools, but the Indian child needs a great deal of variation, and these alone without good discipline, and the cultivating of self reliance, will not make good men and women of them.\n\nI shall endeavour to do my best to improve the attendance this quarter; but owing to the prosperous time in cat hunting, the first 6 weeks of quarter will be influenced for the worse, as most of the children will be away with their parents.\n\nI regret to state that the average which I gave Mr. Fisher for the month of February was not correct, as I gave him by mistake, the average of scholars, which included Non Treaty Indians. The correct average was only 4, and not 6 for February; and now at the end of quarter, the average is only 3.96.\n\nYou will notice in the column for remarks on Quarterly Returns, I have given an explanation for the irregularity of each scholar, and you will also notice that only 15 out of 25 children, whose names are on the Register attended School at all.\n\nWhen I go to school in the morning, I often meet children going to the stores with their parents, or others.\nthat the child was sent to school, but went off with some other children instead, elsewhere.\n\nAs you request me to visit the parents in order to get the children to school, I take it for granted that you would have me do it in school hours, as you surely do not expect the teacher to do so in his own time, when the salary granted by the Department is so small.\n\nUnder the present circumstances, I cannot visit in my own time, as the Department does not provide houses for the teachers, and the present shack is not large enough to accommodate a white man, with his wife and family; therefore I return to The Pas every evening after school, which is 4 miles distant.\n\nI cannot understand why the teacher should be blamed for the non-attendance of scholars, without any justifiable complaint being made against him; the blame is the parents, and as they are unable to rule their children for their own benefit, the Department must act for them, by compelling them to attend school.\n\nThere are very few Indians who really value the efforts that are made for their children.\n\nUnless discipline and independence are taught and impressed upon the children, the next generation will be worse than the present.\nThe Pas\nVia Hudson's Bay House\nN.W.T. April 5th 1910\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of March 15th 1910 re attendance at my school at Big Eddy. I am sorry that the attendance should be so small, and think the only way of improvement, that will have a lasting and beneficial effect, is Compulsory Education, because Indians are not capable of managing their children. It allows his child to absent himself from school for trivial things, and too often the child is left to do as it likes.\n\nWriting and impressing upon Indians the necessity of Education, if only by word of mouth, has no lasting effect but has to be done continually, and is disheartening to the teacher. I tried it years ago, but found out that the more I went after the children, the more the parents relied upon me to do it, and thought they were doing me a favour by sending their children at all. I have visited parents on their children's account, and they have absented themselves to know the reason; the reason has either been that the child did not want to go, because of the other children, or the excuse has been...\nOttawa, April 25, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reference to your work as teacher of the Big Eddy day school in the Pas Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the letter of March 15th, last, was not written as a criticism of your efforts at this school, but with a view of impressing upon you the necessity for a teacher interesting himself in the parents as a means to inducing regular attendance. The difficulties with which you and other Indian school teachers have to contend are well known to the Department, but, notwithstanding this, many of the teachers of our Indian schools, even in the more remote districts, are meeting with splendid success and the personality of the teacher is perhaps the greatest force for good. Where a feeling of confidence is established between the parents and the teacher the apathy of the former is generally to a large extent overcome and the necessity for reverting to more extreme measures, such as provided in the Regulations relating to the education of Indian children, avoided.\n\nIt is hoped that future returns will show some improvement in the attendance at your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Seeing that half the quarter is all that I can teach, and my rent...\noccupation more desirable, I do not wish to return to Big Eddy to teach the other half of quarter from May 15th to June 30th.\n\nTherefore I would ask you to allow me to find someone or other person who would teach till the end of June or till another was appointed for the office.\n\nI trust you will grant me this privilege, or accept any resignation immediately:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

I have no Returns to send you. First, because the first half of Quarter from April 1st to May 15th there were no scholars on the Reserve; and secondly as a result of my correspondence with you when I sent in my last Returns, School was not opened.\n\nPerhaps you remember, that I stated in my letter, that I had procured other employment more profitable than school teaching (pecuniarily) and I asked your permission to find some one to take my place for the remainder of Quarter. In your reply, you stated that I need not find a substitute so, I did not open school, but continued at my fresh employment.\n\nIndian Affairs.

For the last 4 years at Le Pas, I have not been able to keep out of debt, and as each year came round I found myself still further behind. This is the chief reason I have for leaving the work, as it became harder and harder to bear, and my interest in the work was growing less and less.\n\nNow I find I am in a more difficult position still, with debts to be paid, a family to provide for, and lastly, the greatest problem perhaps of all, a house to build.\n\nThe favour I ask of you, is to grant me the salary for the quarter above mentioned, not for my services; but on the ground that\nmy time had not expired till June 30th\nand (as I understand) the Department vote\nannually a certain sum for each school,\nand lastly, the circumstances I am placed in.\n\nI have not had an successful career during\nthe 16 years I have served the Indian Depart-\nment, but it has been an honourable one,\ntrust.

You will be good enough to see that the school is not kept open any time after the majority of the children leave. Mr. Cook will be paid at the rate of $300.00 per annum.

Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe Indians of Big Sandy, near the Pao, have asked me to help them to have a day-school re-opened there, & I gladly do so.\n\nI believe Inspector Jackson or Ind Agent Taylor are in favor of this. There has always been a day-school there till lately. There are over twenty (20) children old enough for school, but who can not be admitted to this Boarding School. They are a decent, law-abiding, moral set of Indians in the whole. I trust Mr. S.D. will sanction this school. I should like to know as soon as possible that I may secure a teacher. I should like to know (in that answer) the terms offered. I suppose it will be $400 salary & $50 for dispensing rations.\n\nThey remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. M. Maclean\nChief of Saskatchewan\n\nThank you for reply about Big Sandy School.\n4th August, 1915.\n\nDear Bishop Newnham,\n\nI have your communication of the 28th ultimo in reference to the Big Eddy school. We have agreed to re-open this school if a suitable teacher can be obtained and the Agent was so informed on the 30th June. I would suggest that you communicate with him. The salary will depend upon the qualification, for a competent person it will not be less than $400 with $50 for dispensing medicine.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Right Rev. J.A. Newnham, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishopsthorpe,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\n4th August, 1915.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 30th June last in reference to the opening of Big Eddy school, I would remind you that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan has the privilege of nominating a teacher for this school. Kindly confer with him so that the services of a teacher may be secured if possible before the time of re-opening.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.H. Taylor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6228, file 502-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to notify the Department that His Lordship Bishop Newnham has appointed Mr. Robert Thomas as teacher at the Big Eddy School. I have approved of this appointment as I am always anxious to see educated Indians filling these positions, as they invariably make good teachers. Robert Thomas is a member of the Pas Band, and has a very fair education. I think he will make good.\n\nUpon his Lordship notifying me through Rev. A. Fraser I instructed Mr. Thomas to open the school, which he did on the 7th inst. with an attendance of 19.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for some school material for this school, as all school material was sent to the Pas Boarding school when the Big Eddy School closed.\n\nI have the Beginner's Reader asked for and I think it is a very good book for our Indian Schools. It can be procured here, and I would ask for authority to buy some for each of the schools in this Agency.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour Obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.
