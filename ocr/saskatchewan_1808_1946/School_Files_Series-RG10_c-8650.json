Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nI visited the school last week and can assure the Department that the fence referred to should be renewed.

Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nExtract from letter from Rev. J. A. Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, dated May 16th, 1936.\n\nFollowing our conversation yesterday, I am writing you in connection with the fence posts required here as early as they can be secured. In moving the fence to take in more of the very sandy strip in the centre row of fields, we found a number of the posts were rotted so badly that it would be unwise to use them. Then, in our rotation of crops, we are using the north centre field, which was blown out so badly two and three years ago, as pasture. The partition fence between this field and the north-east field is so badly covered that only three strands of the wire are above ground in some places. About three-fourths of this fence will have to be pulled up and re-built. A number of these posts, in fact, the majority of them, judging by the age of the fence and the condition of the posts in the fence we have already taken up, cannot wisely be used. Further, someone set a fire on the road on the correction line, which is just north of this farm, and about twenty posts are burned off and will have to be replaced. In all, it will take 100 posts to meet our immediate needs.\nOttawa, May 21, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 209-11A. U., of the 19th instant, with attached excerpt from a letter you received from the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, requesting that approximately 100 fence posts be supplied. It is noted that the cost will be approximately $30.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the posts required. It is understood that the school authorities will perform the labour in the renewing of the fence. Please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the posts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G.

The road allowance east of this property extends from the correction line for a mile and a half south, covering Section 35 and north-east quarter of Section 28 but is not open on the east side of the south-east quarter of 28.

The road allowance between this Valley Road and Lake Percy, which is about one third of a mile farther south, has never been fenced off. The Municipality of Cornwallis is now requesting that we give them possession of this road allowance.\n\nI have looked up the municipal maps in the Cornwallis Municipality and they would indicate that this right of way is in the survey and it would appear as if they have a right to it.

Hamilton\n\nThe Council here assembled do hereby Resolve\n\nWHEREAS- An agreement has been entered into between the Municipalities of Elton and Cornwallis for the construction of a market road on the correction line between the Townships Nineteen and Twenty; dividing the cost equally between these Municipalities; and Whereas the Municipality of Cornwallis does not receive revenue from Section Thirty-Three lying to the South of this road, therefore\n\nBE IT RESOLVED that this Municipal Council request a grant of One Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($150.00) from the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, to cover half the cost of this mile of road construction for which we receive no revenue; the cost being Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for the grading, and One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for graveling, total Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00).\n\nThis resolution was carried unanimously.\n\nCarried A. P. Wilton Reeve\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is extract from letter received from Dr. Doyle, together with the resolution referred to -\n\n\"The enclosed resolution is self explanatory. The agreement under negotiation between these two municipalities involves six miles of road construction, one mile of which is immediately north of our Section, Thirty three. It seems to me very reasonable that this request should be made, and we will all appreciate your good offices in making the necessary representations to the Department at Ottawa.\"\n\nAs pointed out by Dr. Doyle, one mile of this road is on the North side of the school property. The request for assistance to the extent of $150.00 is quite reasonable and in my opinion some assistance should be granted.\n\nI would like to be advised as to the Departments decision in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

In the event of this road being constructed would it be used to any great extent by the Brandon School?\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 133-0-9, dated May 28th, I note that funds are not available to assist the municipality of Cornwallis in building their road.\n\nThe road is never used by the school for anything more than driving around the property to see that everything is in order. However, as the municipality has received no taxes from our land they were of the opinion that we might be in a position to make the grant suggested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe quote the following letter just received from Dr. Doyle, Brandon school -\n\n\"The new grade on the road north of the School is now complete. A deputation, representing the municipalities concerned, waited on me yesterday, asking permission to get gravel out of the pit on the West boundary of the north section, and about half a mile from the north-west corner, as they wish to gravel this piece of road this fall. I told them I would write the Department in this connection.\n\nI am of the opinion that there is plenty of gravel in that ridge to last almost indefinitely at the ordinary rate of use, but it might peter out as the bed did here just north of the school. They would like as early a reply as possible.\"\n\nIn May, a request was received and forwarded to the Department for assistance in building this road, which runs along the north boundary of the school property. In view of the fact that no assistance was granted and some help can be given in the way of allowing them to use gravel from the school property, I would recommend that they be allowed, free of charge, sufficient gravel to do the road lying north of the school property and any further quantity required would be paid for at the regular rate at which gravel is sold.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

If so, Inspector Hamilton was advised in official letter dated October 14 that this Branch has no objection to the municipality of Cornwallis being allowed to remove gravel free of charge for the road lying north of the school property.\n\nIf Mr. Medd is not acting on behalf of the municipality of Cornwallis please let me know if you have any objection to our allowing him the permission he requests and, in this event, you might let me know what price per yard you consider should be charged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

In this connection it seems to me quite fair that the Department should allow the Cornwallis Municipality sufficient gravel for the road which has just been constructed, for the mile north of the School property, and I have no serious objection to them taking gravel for the road extending westward providing that they do not remove our fence and that they keep the pit in good workable form. The experience at this School in the past has been that neighbors or others hauling gravel from the pit have not followed along the seam of gravel at its full depth, but have taken the course of greatest convenience to satisfy their immediate need, allowing the top soil to cover a good deal of the best gravel at the bottom of the pit. If this Municipality is allowed to take the gravel, a good clear understanding of this kind should, I think, be entered into. The Reeve tells me they can secure gravel quite adjacent, at 7\u00a2 per cubic yard, and it is my opinion that they would have no difficulty in finding gravel on a section of land immediately west of the School property, this section being owned by the Municipality itself.\n\nI am leaving the matter entirely for your decision and will be glad to comply and give assistance to any\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nWith further reference to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of November 7 I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School in connection with the application of Mr. George Medd to take gravel from a gravel pit located on the Brandon Indian School property.\n\nSubject to your approval it is our intention to advise Mr. Medd that he may obtain gravel from the school gravel pit at a cost of 7\u00a2 per cubic yard on the understanding that the gravel will be removed from whatever point the Reverend Principal directs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe recommendation contained in Mr. MacInnes' memorandum of the 28th ultimo that Mr. George Medd be permitted to take gravel from a pit located on the Brandon Indian School property at the rate of 7\u00a2 per cubic yard is approved.\n\nC.W.

McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn reference to the request that was made to the Minister's Office for permission to allow Mr. George Medd to take gravel from the old gravel pit located on the Indian Residential School property at Brandon, Manitoba, it has now been suggested to the Minister that the price of 7\u00a2 per cubic yard is too high. Will you please advise how this rate was fixed. Is it covered by any regulation of the Branch or was it set by the Indian Agent?\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of March 27 with reference to a charge for gravel taken from the old gravel pit at the Brandon residential school by Mr. George Medd.\n\nIn my memorandum of November 28, 1938, I forwarded to you a copy of a letter, dated November 22, received from the Principal of the Brandon residential school. You will note that in that letter the Principal suggested a price of 7\u00a2 a cubic yard.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n\nMar 31/39\nMEMORANDUM\n\n6th April,\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nYou referred here Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 30th ultimo in connection with the application of Mr. George Medd for permission to take gravel from the Brandon residential school property. This does not seem to cover the points raised in my memorandum of the 23rd idem and reference to the report submitted by the principal of the school on the 22nd November last does not help. One might reasonably take it from the principal's report that he had no objection to the Municipality taking the gravel free of charge. He simply mentioned that the Reeve told him they could secure gravel elsewhere at 7\u00a2 a cubic yard. However, in the letters going out from this office we said the Department was prepared to let them take gravel at that rate.\n\nIs 7\u00a2 a cubic yard the usual rate charged for gravel taken from Indian property? Would the Department be prepared to authorize the taking of sufficient gravel free of charge for those portions of the road adjoining the residential school property?\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor report.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, April 11, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Pratt's memorandum of April 6, in which he seeks additional information with respect to the charge of 7 cents a cubic yard made by this Branch for gravel taken from the gravel pit of the Brandon Residential School.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to state exactly what the price of gravel actually is throughout the Dominion. It should be stated, however, that the price of 7 cents a cubic yard is a very nominal charge and far below the charges usually made. A representative of the Surveys and Engineering Branch states that the price frequently paid is $1.50 per cubic yard and that they have at times paid as high as $5.00. In view of the fact that the road upon which this gravel is being used adjoins the residential school, an agreement might be reached whereby the municipality would be permitted to take a certain amount of gravel without cost.\n\nI shall be glad to communicate with Inspector Hamilton, should you consider an arrangement such as the one I have suggested advisable.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH.\nBrandon, April 1, 1939.\n\nMr. J. E. Matthews, M.P.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReceived your letter this week. With regard to the road in question, the main facts are that the road built is along property belonging to the experimental farm for 1/2 mile & industrial school for 1 mile. This property does not pay taxes, therefore I think that we should receive some help by way of grant. This road will cost when gravelled (the grading is finished now) about $350.00 per mile.\n\nThe fact that Elton uses this particular road more than Cornwallis, the bulk of the payment comes from Elton. If you could get about $300, it would be quite a help as I am financing this road out of my ward appropriation.\n\nWith reference to the dugouts you mentioned, we have already contracted for about 40 in this municipality.\n\nWas glad to see that you done so well in your first speech in the House, but knew that you could do it.\n\nWe are back on the farm again but had a very nice time this winter.\n\nThe wife sends her best wishes.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sg.)

E. Matthews, M.P., from Mr. W. Davidson, of Brandon, Manitoba, attached thereto.\n\nThere is no appropriation in this Branch from which a grant could be paid for the construction or maintenance of the road to which Mr. Davidson refers in his communication, nor is there anything on file here to indicate that we have at any time in the past spent money on roads other than roads lying within the actual boundaries of Indian reserves.\n\nIt would appear that this particular road runs east and west along the northern side of the school property, whereas most of the traffic originating at the school proceeds in a southeasterly direction toward Brandon City. It is just possible, however, that an agreement might be reached whereby the municipality of Cornwallis would be permitted to take, without cost, from the gravel pit on the school property the gravel necessary to maintain this road. This is a matter that might be referred to Inspector Hamilton.\n\nWe have no Indian agent or inspector in the Brandon district, and it is somewhat difficult to carry on these negotiations with the Principal of the school, who is not an employee of this Branch.\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Davidson's letter.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n15th April 1939\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nRe - Gravel pit - Brandon Residential School.\n\nAs suggested in Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 11th instant, I think it would be advisable to obtain a report from Inspector Hamilton. If the Department benefits from the road which passes the school property then it would appear that the waiving of the proposed charge of 7\u00a2 a cubic yard would not be an unduly large contribution. So far as the figures quoted by the Surveys and Engineering Branch are concerned, I should imagine these must refer to the price of gravel delivered.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nTo note.\nOttawa, April 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis Branch has been requested to contribute to the construction of a road adjoining the Indian residential school at Brandon. This road is described as follows:\n\n\"The road built is along property belonging to the experimental farm for one-half mile and industrial school for one mile. This property does not pay taxes, therefore I think we should receive some help by way of grant. This road will cost when gravelled (the grading is finished now) about $350.00 per mile.\"\n\nThis excerpt is taken from a letter received by the Minister.\n\nNo doubt, you are aware that this Branch has never contributed at any time to the construction or maintenance of roads other than roads within the actual boundaries of Indian reserves. Permission was granted, however, a few weeks ago to the Cornwallis municipality to secure gravel from the residential school farm at a cost of 7 cents per cubic yard. It is altogether likely that this gravel is being used for the maintenance of the road adjoining the farm and the school. It has been suggested by the officials at the Minister's office that if this gravel is used for the maintenance of roads surrounding the government property, permission might be given to the municipality to secure this gravel free.\n\nI was -\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n528 Federal Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nI was requested, therefore, to submit the matter to you for your consideration and recommendation. It might be well if you discussed this matter with the Principal of the school, just as soon as you can conveniently do so. It has occurred to me, also, that there should be some limit put on the amount of gravel the municipal authorities would be permitted to secure in a given year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 133-0-9 dated April 20th, I beg to advise that I interviewed Dr. Doyle and the councillor of Cornwallis municipality.\n\nThey expect to gravel four miles of road. Then the work will be finished for an indefinite period. I would recommend that we give the gravel for the 1\u00bd miles along the Government property and that a charge of 7\u00a2 per cubic yard be made for the gravel needed to cover the other 2\u00bd miles. I understand it takes about 500 yards per mile.\n\nThe councillor stated the municipality owned a farm adjoining the school, on which some gravel is available. A pit may be opened on this property and if so they would not take any from the school pit as it would involve too much work to properly open up two pits. It was understood if the school pit was operated, it would be left in good condition. My impression was that there is little intention of taking gravel from the school if a sufficient quantity is available on the municipal property.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

This park was originally called Suburban Park and the main portion of the park was leased from the Department of Indian Affairs in 1920. The lease was for a term of 99 years and the City paid the sum of $6,000.00 rental in advance at that time, which comprised the total consideration for the lease. The City subsequently purchased two other parcels of land adjoining, and these two parcels, together with the portion leased from your Department, is a public park under the jurisdiction of the Parks Board of The City of Brandon.\n\nThe City of Brandon has several parks and park sites, but only two of these have been actually in use for park or recreational purposes. Curran Park, to which I am referring, the principal part of which is subject to lease from your Department, is being used as a park notwithstanding that it is not within the boundaries of the\nCity proper. I have been authorized by the Parks Board to write you in connection with the possibility of surrendering the lease referred to herein and to ascertain if your Department would be disposed to rebate the prorata rental paid in 1920. The reason for making a request of this nature is that if a rebate were obtained the money from same could be used to good advantage in establishing one or more of the smaller parks inside the City, which would probably benefit the general population to a larger extent than the continuing of the large suburban park, and would accrue particularly to the benefit of the children residing in the vicinity of the last mentioned park sites. The Parks Board would still be in position to continue that portion of Suburban Park which is not under lease from your Department as a park, or might be disposed to sell those portions which are owned outright by the City to your Department or to adjoining owners. All portions of the park at present constituted adjoin the Assiniboine River on the Southerly portion of same.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated by the Mayor and Council of the City and the City Parks Board if you would\nGAVIN A.

We would not, therefore, be prepared to refund, as you suggest, a pro rata portion of the rentals paid in exchange for a surrender of the 99-year lease presently held by the City.\n\nIt has, however, occurred to us that the Experimental Farm which, according to our information, adjoins the parcel of land in question might be interested in acquiring your rights under the lease.

It is assumed that it is satisfactory to you that the lease be assigned except as to the roadway running from Lake Percy to the north boundary, reference to which is made in my letter to Mr. Tinline.

The lease is dated January 13th, 1921, made\nbetween His Majesty, represented by the Superintendent\nGeneral of Indian Affairs, as Lessor and The City of Brandon\nas Lessee, for a term of 99 years. The parcel is shown on\na plan of survey made by R. J. Jephson and contains, accord-\ning to the said plan, 63.33 acres, from which is excepted\nthe Assiniboine River, comprising 6.55 acres. The land is\nbounded on the east by the easterly limit of the said quarter\nsection, on the south by the southern limit of same, and on\nthe west by the western limit of said quarter section. The\nnorthern limit of the leasehold as shown on the plan roughly\nfollows the boundaries of Lake Percy, and also contains a\nroadway running north from the portion under lease to the\nnorthern limit of said quarter section, about half way\nbetween the east and west limits of said quarter section.\n\nOn behalf of The City of Brandon and the Parks Board\nof The City of Brandon your Department is offered the un-\nexpired portion of the leasehold of the abovementioned land,\nwith the exception of the roadway running from the north\nboundary of the quarter section. The rental paid by the City\nin advance at the time the lease was executed was the sum of $6,000.00, and on a pro rata basis the unexpired portion of the lease should be worth approximately $4,545.00, together with any increase in land values during the unexpired portion of the lease. The sum which will be accepted for the unexpired term aforesaid is $2,000.00, and this sum will be accepted for an assignment of the aforesaid lease, excepting the roadway from Lake Percy to the north boundary of the quarter section.\n\nI would explain that the reason for reserving the roadway is that there is at present no public thoroughfare joining the valley road, which, with the portion of S.W. 28, which is owned by the City and used for park purposes. It is considered that this roadway would not be of any particular value to your Department as it runs through land under the jurisdiction of the Department of Indian Affairs, but negotiations might result in exchanging the road with the Department of Indian Affairs for the necessary thoroughfare on the west side of S.E. 28.

The lease was for a ninety-nine year period and the rental paid in advance was six thousand dollars. In 1944 there was some correspondence between the writer and Mr. Hoey, concerning the possible surrender of the lease by the City in consideration of rebate of a portion of the rental paid in advance.\n\nThis land comprises only a portion of Curran Park and the other portions are owned outright by the City. There have been inquiries by individuals who wish to purchase or lease the land leased from the department by the City, and in the previous correspondence there was a suggestion that the Experimental Farm might be interested in taking over the property but no progress was made in this connection at that time. The Parks Board and the City desire to renew negotiations in respect to cancellation of the lease on the basis of a rebate of the rental for the unexpired term which is approximately fifty years.\nWould there be any possibility of the Department of Indian Affairs retaking possession of this on the basis suggested above, that is to say, cancellation of the City's lease with an equitable rebate. Please let me hear from you in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.A. Hall,\nCity Clerk.\nOTTAWA, February 13th, 1947.\n\nGavin A.

Under such circumstances should the City of Brandon cease to use the property as a park the lease will automatically terminate and the property will revert to the use of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\n8th March, 1949.\n\nMr. W.

The Municipality, I understand proposes to build this portion of the road without any help other than the granting of the land for the purpose of making the road 100 feet wide from fence to fence, which will permit of raising the grade so that snow will not lodge in drifts on the road.\n\nThe matter of the road from the South East corner of the portion of our farm, lying North of the present road to 18th Street, which is the main road as far as we are concerned, is the portion with which Mr. Hopper, Supt. of the Dominion Experimental Farm, is also concerned. In conversation with Mr. Hopper he informed me that the cost will approximate $3,000.00 and the suggestion is that Indian Affairs undertake to provide a contribution of $1000.00, the Department of Agriculture $1000.00 and the City of Brandon $1000.00.\n\nI believe it would only be fair for us to share in the construction of this Mile as we, with the farmers West of us are the sole users of at least one half of the road up to the Experimental Farm main drive. The Township in which the lands of this school are located is, as I have already mentioned, proposing to bear the cost of the construction through our property. The construction of this road will certainly be to the advantage of this school.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\nO. B. Strapp, Principal.\n\nP. S. Herewith a rough sketch of property requested.\nDEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\nExperimental Farm\nBrandon, Man.\nFebruary 14, 1948.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton,\n\nYou will recall the Valley Road that extends west from 18th Street is not an intersectional right-of-way, but is approximately half a mile north of the intersectional line. This portion of the Valley Road is within the City limits, but has been maintained without their help for many years. A movement is afoot by the municipalities to improve the section of the Valley Road that extends west from the City limits. The portion of the Valley Road that extends through the Experimental Farm serves both the Experimental Farm and the Indian Residential School as well as the farmers residing in the valley.\n\nIt is planned that the Valley Road be widened from its present width of 66 feet to a width of 100 feet. The municipalities plan constructing a standard graded all-weather road with a 20 ft. top. Farmers adjacent to the road are prepared to move their fences north a distance of 34 feet to provide a right-of-way of 100 feet in width. I have discussed with Mayor Williamson the possibility of having the mile improved that lies within the City limits. I am of the opinion that some help can be obtained from the City. I also interviewed the Good Roads Engineer and obtained from him an estimated cost of constructing the mile of road in which we are primarily interested. Mr. Stanley, the Engineer, has estimated this cost to be approximately $3000.\n\nThe present road as you know is due for improvement. Work involved in keeping it open in winter months has been heavy and costly. It would seem an opportune time for us to give any support we can in order to ensure that a good graded road is constructed on the first mile leading west from 18th Street at the same time as the remainder of the Valley Road is being improved. I am writing you in order that you might take it up with your Department and determine what support they will be prepared to give in constructing the road. A similar request is being made to the Department of Agriculture for support of this project.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) R. M. Hopper,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose two letters, one from Mr. R. M. Hopper, Superintendent of the Experimental Farm at Brandon and one from Rev. O. B. Strapp, Principal, Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nThe letters are self-explanatory and I understand that it is necessary to obtain the Department's decision in regards to sharing a third of the cost. A rough sketch of the property requested is also attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncls.\n\nP. S. - Mr. Hamilton is on annual leave.\nOttawa, March 3, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Archibald:\n\nThe Brandon Indian Residential School is located close to your experimental farm at Brandon, Manitoba. We have just received a letter from the Principal of the Brandon School stating that the Township of Cornwallis in which the school is located, desires to improve the road which is used by the Brandon Residential School and, I presume, for the purposes of your experimental farm.\n\nThe cost of the improvements as stated, is expected to be $3,000, and the Principal of the Brandon School requests this Branch to provide $1,000., and he states in his letter that Mr. Hopper, Superintendent of the experimental farm, has advised him that he intends to ask your Department to provide $1,000.\n\nWe have not made arrangements for any special appropriation for this amount in our appropriation for the next fiscal year but it is possible that we could find the funds. However, before making a final decision we would be pleased to know if the Department of Agriculture intends to allow $1,000. towards the cost of the improvements suggested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nDoctor E.S. Archibald,\nDirector,\nCentral Experimental Farm,\nOttawa.\n\nPP/MD\n\nSee also 2 31/7-5\nOttawa, May 14, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Matthews,\n\nI have received your letter of May 10th in regard to the rebuilding of the road known locally as the \"Valley Road\" which runs through the Experimental Farm and property belonging to the Brandon Indian Residential School, about which Mr. D. Birdsell, Reeve of the Municipality of Cornwallis, has written to you.\n\nIn reply I would say that a few months ago representations were made by the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School that assistance should be given in the improvement of the road referred to in your letter. At that time the Indian Affairs Branch wrote to Doctor Archibald, Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, asking whether his Department was prepared to share in the cost of the improvements suggested. The Indian Affairs Branch informed Doctor Archibald that funds might be found for the share providing his Department would be prepared to spend an equal amount. The improvements were estimated at $2,000.00 and it was suggested that the Indian Affairs Branch provide $1,000.00, the Department of Agriculture $1,000.00 and the City of Brandon $1,000.00.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch is again writing to the Central Experimental Farm at Ottawa to ascertain whether that Department is prepared to make any contribution. No funds have been provided in the Indian Affairs Estimates for any contribution towards this work but if the Experimental Farm decides to contribute I believe that this Department would be justified in making a similar contribution.\n\nVery Poor Copy\nI shall be pleased to get in touch with you further on this subject when the Experimental Farm has arrived at a decision as to what action they intend to take.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.E.

This\nroad leads from the city limits westwardly through the\nExperimental Farm and the Indian School properties for a total\ndistance of approximately one and a half miles, thence\ncontinuing westwardly in the Valley on the north side of the\nAssiniboine River.\n\nThis is an expensive undertaking for the Muni-\ncipality, more so because of the numerous culverts that are\nnecessary as a result of the tremendously heavy spring freshets\ncoming from the high hills that form a northern background to\nboth Government properties. This road, while used considerably\nby farmers living west of the properties mentioned, it being\ntheir only means of road connections with Brandon, is used to\npossibly by an equal extent by the Farm and the School. This\nresults from the fact that both institutions carry on farming\nactivities quite largely, besides being a visiting point for many\ntourists and others.\n\nThe Municipality feels unequal to the task of\ncompleting this work, now long overdue, in a permanent and\nsatisfactory manner, without some financial assistance from the\ntwo Federal Departments.\n\nI am thoroughly familiar with the conditions that\nhave to be encountered, and I have no hesitation in saying that\nunder the circumstances referred to reasonable assistance to the Municipality should be forthcoming.\n\nTrusting that the proposal may receive favourable consideration, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgd.

I also have a letter just received from Mr. Agent Clarke, which would indicate that these children were sent forward before receiving your letter in which the admission of Lorna was not approved.\n\nWe are arranging to return this child to Hodgson a week from today and will endeavor to go as far as Westside by car as otherwise it would be necessary to send an escort as far as Winnipeg entailing overnight expenses.\n\nI beg to add that Lorna has been responding to extra food and care and has been doing well. I have just had a talk with the Primary Teacher and she took some time to demonstrate that her progress in school has been quite satisfactory during the short time that she has been with us and, as I stated to Mr. Clarke through a letter a few days ago, I feel quite confident that if this girl's physical condition was back to normal her apparent mental deficiency would be fairly well corrected and there would be no objection on our part if later it was deemed advisable to return her to the school. The tubercular clinic has just been held and I will forward a report to the Agent as soon as it is received.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nRev. J. A.

I told the police that there was no Indian here by that name and that none of these Indians were away but that if he got in touch with Mr. Morrison from the White Bear Reserve near Carlyle, he could get more news. If I have any of the Indians from that reserve. Apparently there was some delay in phoning to Mr. Morrison, I believe the constable phoned to the Inspector of Police at Weyburn, who was in touch with Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Affairs, Regina, the constable later phoning Mr. Morrison and when it was found it was Alex Poll of White Bear Band, told Mr. Morrison that his Inspector had told him to return the boy to White Bear. At the same time Joyce who is this boy's guardian made the request that this boy be sent to a residential school so he couldn't do anything with him at home and if he came back to the reserve he would only run away again. This information Mr. Morrison phoned to me when I got in touch with Dr. Boyle at Brandon explaining to him what the boy was like and if he could handle him I would have the police take him down to Brandon.\n\nThis boy was adopted eight years ago by Joyce No.241 of the White Bear Band and has been in treaty ever since, he has attended the White Bear Day School for five or six years and with his indifference to attending the school lately was not a good influence to the other children attending there. The past quarter he was absent fourteen days and it was very evident that he badly needed disciplinary treatment which was the large factor in my sending him to Brandon school.\n\nUnder date of Moh.15th, Dr. Boyle writes me that he is adapting himself to his new surroundings quite readily and is mixing with Stanley Lone-thunder, another White Bear boy who is at Brandon school and he does not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining this boy's loyalty to the school and a real interest in his own welfare.\n\nThe only other alternative I had was to let the police put him in jail and in view of his age I was very loathe to permit this course to be adopted.\n\nI trust this explanation will permit of his admission to Brandon school being granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Eagle, of Moose Woods reserve.\n\nAbout four years ago one of the inspectors at Regina recommended that I visit the Moose Woods Reserve with a view of securing children from there. I did not find it convenient to make the visit but had correspondence with the teacher and, as a result, secured a number of pupils. There has since been a change in the teacher there and last summer I found an attitude on the part of some of the parents of desire to have their children remain home and attend the day school. Archie Eagle was one, also William Littlecrowe, who has two children, Lorne #454, and Margaret #0426. I have had a letter recently from Mr. Littlecrowe stating that he has enlarged his house and can give his children better care than formerly and would like them to remain home this year. I do not know of any special reason why these children should be in a residential school and, if the Department deems it advisable, we will arrange for their discharge at the end of June.\n\nI also had a letter from John Royal, father of Harry #459, whom we expect to discharge this year and Donald #460, stating that he wanted Donald home as well as Harry. The conditions in the Royal home are not as good and I would think it much better for\nOttawa, April 21, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, the Department considers that it would be advisable to grant the discharge of Archie B. Eagle's daughter and the two Little Crow children at the end of June.\n\nI note from the last paragraph of your letter that you will write shortly regarding the children who, you consider, should be discharged at the end of the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

This boy is now seventeen years of age and a recent report regarding him from the Principal reads as follows:-\n\n\"This boy is immature for his age. A very good student. Naturally mechanical and likes looking after stock. Needs careful guidance and if a home is available should be discharged this year.\"\n\nPlease let me know, as soon as possible, if there is any home on the Moraviantown Reserve to which he could be sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

Another year of training will probably benefit him.\n\nWith reference to Ivan Ahensakew - No. 448, please let me know what course he is taking at the Technical School and how long it will require for him to complete the course.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nWould it be possible to secure employment for Helen Cochrane - No. 0265? It is rather difficult for the Department to favourably consider her remaining longer in the school.\n\nWill Herman Crate - No. 371, complete his collegiate course this year? He is now eighteen years of age and, unless he shows very special qualifications, it is doubtful if there would be any great advantage in his remaining longer at school.\n\nMabel Crate - No. 0355, is eighteen years of age and, if home conditions are satisfactory, the Department feels it advisable to have her discharged. A final decision will not be made until your reply is received.\n\nWhat has been said regarding the above pupil also applies to Vera Gray - No. 0414.\n\nJulia Ironstar - No. 0422, is also eighteen years of age and I am inclined to feel that she should be discharged.\n\nIt is noted that Violet Sinclair - No. 0410, is anxious to go out working. It might be assumed that she will not benefit by further training. The Department would appreciate it if you would review this case and write again, when a final decision will be made regarding her.\n\nElijah Sinclair - No. 444, is now eighteen years of age. What grade has he reached? Unless he is fairly well advanced, the Department is not prepared to consider allowing him to remain as he would be quite old when he completes his education.\n\nIt is noted that Mary Tapotat - No. 0464, wishes to become a nurse. Has this girl obtained her matriculation standing? If not, it would require several years for her to complete the nursing course and she is already eighteen years of age. In addition, it must be kept in mind that the Department finds it increasingly difficult to place graduate Indian nurses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter No. 133-0-10, dated May 17th, regarding Lillie Kahgee, a pupil at the Brandon School.\n\nI beg to say, this girl's mother is living on the Saugeen Reserve for the summer, she recently married a member of the Sarnia Reserve but she owns her home here and intends staying here until her daughters return from school. I may say there are two Kahgee girls at the Brandon School, Lillie and Lottie, they are both expected home this summer, I think their mother would be capable of looking after them.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nHighgate May 21st 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th instant file No. 133-0-10, regarding a home for Alvin Anthony, on the Moravian Reserve, who should be discharged from Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nI have had an interview with his half sister Mrs. Bert Noah and husband, who have been looking forward to the discharge of this boy, and are prepared to make a home for him here. This couple have no children, and should make a good home for the boy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nStuart Spence,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa Canada.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 22, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of May 17th, #133-0-10, has just come in.\n\nI appreciate the fact that Charlie Littledeer, #405, will remain with us for another year. The improved attitude in this boy of late has been very marked and I am quite hopeful that another year in school will help him very much in the future.\n\nIvan Ahenskew, #448, has taken two years in the Brandon Technical School for Automotive Mechanics. It is a three year course but of late the third year has been reduced in time. It does not commence until after Christmas holidays. Ivan would very much like to finish this course and secure his diploma and it is quite desirable that he should. If the Department does not see fit to have him continue with us for the full year I would suggest that he be given leave of absence from August 1st until January 1st and then be allowed to return to complete this course and if the school is full at Christmas that he be granted a supernumerary relation. I mention August 1st instead of July 1st as he wishes to remain during July to get more practice in the use of machinery, especially the tractor.\n\nHelen Cochrane, #0265. I cannot add anything to the description I have given of Helen in my letter of May 4th. She is a discouraging proposition. To turn her out on her own respons-\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would like to suggest that you leave her with us for the time being. We will do our best to secure work for her in a home where she will be looked after as far as possible and we will get her off the list just as soon as we can reasonably do so.\n\nHerman Crate, #371, is completing his Grade XI this year. He wishes to take Grade XII next year. As I have stated in my previous letter, he is decidedly ambitious, a good and careful student, exceedingly promising and I feel confident that he will make good use of the best education he can get. He would pass for a white boy and I feel quite sure that he will qualify as a good, useful and reliable Canadian citizen and I sincerely hope that you will see fit to give him this next year, at least, to continue his studies.\n\nMabel Crate, #0355. This girl feels that another year in school would be very helpful to her in gaining experience and character to stand up against conditions which exist on the reserve and which she very much deplores. She has developed greatly during the past year and will be a very helpful influence in the school if allowed to remain. She wishes, also, to remain with us during the holidays and we will be very glad if she continues with us for another year.\n\nVera Gray, #0414, is completing Grade X. She is ambitious to make something of herself and her people are anxious that she should. She is perfectly white in appearance and is anxious to qualify herself to take her place in the regular citizenship of our country. She would take Grade XI next year if allowed to remain.\n\nJulia Ironstar, #0422. This was a very backward girl when she came to us and a very marked improvement in her attitude and development together with her father's wish in the matter caused us to recommend that she remain in the school. She, however, has not the personality or appearance that would enable\nher to be more than a domestic servant and I am quite willing that she should be discharged.\n\nViolet Sinclair, #0410, will be benefitted considerably by further training in housework and another year would give added maturity which she very much needs. I would like to retain her, as with Helen Cochrane, and get a place for her if a suitable one became available and let her go just as soon as it seems wise to do so.\n\nElijah Sinclair, #444, is in the class with Herman Crate. He is reliable, ambitious, a good student, completing Grade X, would like to have the opportunity of continuing at school and we would very much like to have him do so.\n\nWith Mary Tapotat, #0464, was sent to us last fall/the backing of the Woman's Missionary Society as a girl of outstanding personality whom they would like to see given a nurse's training with the confidence that she will make good. We are well pleased with her. She is quite above the average and I understand the W.M.S. will assist in financing her during her course. We sincerely hope that she can remain with us. She will complete Grade IX this year.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A.

Alvin Anthony, No. 340, should be discharged at the end of the current academic year and sent to Highgate, Ont. The Agent advises that this boy's half-sister, Mrs. Bert Noah, and her husband, are prepared to provide a home for him on the Moraviantown reserve. You should notify Stuart Spence, Indian Agent, Highgate, Ont., a week or so before Anthony leaves Brandon, in order that the Agent may meet him on his arrival at Highgate.\n\n2. Mr. Don Robertson, Indian Agent, Chippawa Hill, Ont., advises that the mother of Lillie and Lettie Kahgee has a suitable home and is expecting the two girls home this summer. Under these circumstances, the Department considers it advisable to discharge both these girls at the end of the current academic year. They should be sent to Southampton, Ont. Mr. Robertson, whose address is given in the first part of this paragraph, should be advised a week or ten days before they leave Brandon, in order that he may meet them on their arrival at Southampton.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

This amount is intended to include the transportation of those being discharged from the school and whose homes are in any of the Prairie Provinces. We will allow, over and above this amount, the transportation of the three pupils who are being sent home to Ontario.\n\nIn allowing children holidays, only those at a reasonable distance from the school should be sent home.

Agent at Brandon allows the reduced rate for Indian children, at least as far East as that rate applies. The accounts covering the cost of these tickets will be forwarded to the Department by the railway company with these transport warrants attached.\n\nYou will, also, note that the warrants have been issued for first class tickets, but the Department is not prepared to supply berths.\n\nAs requested in official letter of the first instant, I trust that you will notify the Indian Agents concerned regarding the exact date on which these pupils will reach their destinations. I presume that all three will proceed together as far as Toronto and you should obtain from the C.P.R.

Therefore, 175 days should be deducted from the total of 15,958, making the correct total, 15,783 and making the average attendance of pupils during the quarter 173 instead of 175. These errors, however, do not affect the earning of the school for the quarter.\n\nThen, in the form recording Discharge of pupils, Jessie Bear, #0402, Peter Ryder, #430, and Tommy Linklater #366, whose discharges have already been approved should have been included to keep records straight.

J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nI recently received a letter from Norman Collins, in which he made an urgent request that his brother's children, a boy of ten and two girls of twelve and eight, be accepted as pupils of the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nI am informed by Dr. Doyle, principal of the school, that Adam, Joseph and Roderick, Nos. 107, 108 and 109, attended Brandon School in 1903; then Kenneth and Norman, Nos. 173 and 174 were there in 1911; and that three girls attended school back in 1889. None of these pupils took treaty, although I understand that the mother of the children now in question was a treaty Indian and a member of the Jackhead Band. These people live at Little Bullhead on Lake Winnipeg. The mother died recently and the father is finding it impossible to look after the children.\n\nThey present their case on the ground that they themselves received this consideration and feel that now the children are deprived of their mother, similar treatment might be considered. I happen to know the uncle, Norman, who wrote in and made the request. He was a pupil at the school at the time I was there and perhaps was one of the best boys ever to attend the school.\n\nI realize that, strictly speaking, they have no claim on the government. However, in view of the fact that many of the family before received consideration, and as the need now is apparently urgent, I am presenting the case for your consideration and would like to be advised, as soon as possible, if the children may be admitted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines &\nResources,\nOTTAWA.\nMr. Harvey\n\nI do not think we should accept this.\n\nP.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, your letter of the 9th instant, in which you refer to a communication received by you from Norman Collins, asking that his brother's children - a boy of 10 and two girls of 12 and 8, respectively - be accepted as pupils at the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nYou do not state in your letter the distance that these children live from an Indian day school or if they have been attending a day school until now. I cannot possibly see how the Government can permit children to enter our residential schools from this time forward, other than those children for whom we are responsible under the provisions of the Indian Act. The Indian school population is increasing at the rate of approximately 400 pupils per annum, with the result that there are large groups of Indian boys and girls in certain sections of the Dominion for whom no educational facilities whatever have yet been provided. In view of this fact and the limited appropriation at our disposal for educational purposes, I regret that I cannot approve of the admission of these children to the Brandon School. If, however, they are unable to attend an Indian day school and if they are in a destitute or semi-destitute condition, the matter may be reconsidered. I am convinced, though, that we shall have to insist on a more rigid enforcement of the regulations governing the entrance of pupils to Indian residential schools from this time onward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

School at Brandon would be the proper place for him to be sent to.\n\nI have no doubt Dr. Doyle would take him in hand and I feel that it would be the means of saving this lad. We had the case of Alec Poll early this spring who was sent to that school, seems well contented and from reports from Dr. Doyle is doing very well indeed.\n\nIn this school they go on to higher grades than our local Indian schools and there would be no difficulty in his being allowed to remain in this school until he was 18 years of age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. A. W. H. McKenzie\nIndian Agent\n\nDr. Thos Robertson\nInspector of Agencies\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nRegina Sask.\nRegina, Sask.,\nAugust 10, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Thomas Standing Ready.\n\nFurther to my interview with you today in connection with the above named Indian boy, I may say that he was tried by me on the 5th instant, at Carlyle, for theft of a club bag and contents. This is the second appearance in court and I understand from information I have obtained on both occasions that the boy cannot be trusted on the Reserve, either so far as property of Indians is concerned or white persons at the lake resort.\n\nThe boy is now 15 years of age and will be 16 on the 23rd of January next. I do not think that the Industrial School for Boys at Regina would be a proper place to place this Indian boy for correction, in that he would learn more from the boys there, who are mostly extremely delinquent cases. The boy has to go back to the Reserve after whatever training he may be given, and it seems to me that he would receive better training in an Indian training school than elsewhere. I have understood that the age limit in your schools is 16 years, but if you could have the Department make an exception in this boy's case, so that he could stay in the school for two years, I think it would be the best thing for him. I should appreciate your letting me know what the Department will do as to this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJudge.\n\nDr. Robinson,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nFederal Building,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to attach a letter from Juvenile Court Judge Burgess re Thomas Standing Ready, together with a report by Agent McKenzie.\n\nI might say that the judge called and discussed this matter with me. She is strongly of the opinion that not only the best interest of the boy himself, but also that of the other boys on the reserve would be served by sending him to Brandon.\n\nI would recommend that her wishes be granted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

However, he does do odd jobs around this community; he hauls cord wood to town, cuts hay, and when permitted, sells same, but his livelihood is mostly hunting and trapping, for which he has been trained.\n\nInsofar as the future activities of this girl is concerned we are not sure whether she is going to train for a nurse, as stated. She has a tendency towards nursing, but she has shown a distinct aptitude to teaching. She needs a couple of more years schooling before she can decide as to her future. Her present surroundings offer little in the way of proper training to a girl who wishes to improve her lot.\n\nWe would strongly recommend that this girl be given an opportunity.

Burton Hurd, of McMaster, at 68 Whittier Road, Hamilton, Ontario, and has been giving the best of satisfaction both in her work and conduct. A neighbor of Mrs. Hurd, Mrs. G. S. Parlor, of 1212 King St., W., has written asking if it would be possible to get Clara's sister, Dora Wabidee, #0312, of this school for domestic service in her home. In my letter of May 4th, 1937, on the last page I recommended that she be continued in school for another year and in your letter of May 17th you acceded to this request. Now that this offer for employment has come, where she would be closely under her sister's influence, I would recommend that she be given the opportunity, providing the home is as suitable as would appear from Mrs. Parlour's letter. She claims to be interested in the character and general well being of those she employs and I have written Professor Hurd, whom I know personally and very favorably, for information concerning her.\n\nDora is probably eighteen years of age now.\n\nAnnie Flett, #0412, did not return after holidays as her mother required her services and I recommend that she be discharged.\nOttawa, October 1, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Doyle:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 24th, in which you ask for an expression of opinion with respect to the discharge from your school of Dora Wabidee, #0312.\n\nI am personally disposed to think that this girl should be permitted to take up domestic service, particularly in view of the fact that she will be in close contact with her sister. I am quite prepared to allow you to exercise your own judgment in dealing with this particular case.\n\nI note your recommendation with respect to Annie Flett, #0412; Elijah Sinclair, #444; Helen Cochrane, #0265; Allan Sanderson, #475; and Dora Favel, #0341.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Oct. 12, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have found the regulations that the parents, or guardians of pupils, having their children home for holidays being required to pay the fare one way is the source of a great deal of dissatisfaction, complaint and a feeling of injustice. This has come from almost all the reserves from which our pupils come and when at Hodgson this year, bringing the pupils back from holidays, a deputation of four councilmen, mostly from Fisher River, I think, waited on me with a very earnest request that the requirement be discontinued.\n\nThe arguments used in this connection are: First, that many of the parents who really should have their children home, or think they should, find it a burden, especially when there are four or five children in the same family. Then, other schools where neighbor children attend bring the pupils to the very door of the Indian home without any charge whatever.\n\nI told this deputation that they should make representations to your Department in this connection and that I would write you, telling you of their representations to me. I might say that some of the agents have also mentioned the matter, hoping that the regulation would be discontinued or made universal with all the schools alike.\n\nThe total amount I was able to collect this year, with the help of the agents, was $97.15. A few dollars may yet come in. As the highway conditions are improving we are going to be able to use our own conveyance for this purpose more than we have been doing.\nwhich will cut down on the actual cash expenditure on our part to some extent. And if the Department sees fit to add $50.00 to the annual grant of $300.00 made in this connection, I would be glad to take care of the other $50.00 which we collect from the parents.\n\nWe will appreciate your consideration of this matter. Awaiting your reply.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 29, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letters of October 12, with reference to the amount allowed for the transportation of children to and from the Brandon Residential School. The amount available for this service is rather limited, but in view of your special request, it has been decided to allow $350 towards transportation expenses of the Brandon school children.\n\nI find it necessary, however, to return the account which you enclosed.\n\nPlease prepare a new account showing in detail the names of the children and their destination in each case. The exact railway fare should be stated in regard to each of them in order that the Auditor General may take no exception to the charges that are made.\n\nIt will only be necessary for you to submit an account amounting to $350.\n\nAs previously informed, all accounts should be submitted in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

For your information above mentioned boy has been at the Brandon School, since latter part of August by consent of his grand-father who is his guardian by adoption, for some reason J. L. Prince would not sign the application form when requested but admitted he wished him to remain at the school. The old man has been a patient at the St Boniface Hospital for some months now and should the boy be returned he would not have a home as the grand-mother died a year ago.

Has passed successfully. Will receive his diploma and we recommend his graduation.\n\n#306 Charles Clovin \" 17 Is completing Grade VI. Is a fair student, a fairly good worker. Splendid at supervising smaller boys. His mother, Mrs. George Perger, of Thicket Portage, whose husband is a section boss, requests that he be discharged.\n\n#0267 Mary Louise Clovin \" 18 Completing Grade IX. Her mother wishes her home.\n\n#426 Gordon Cline \" 16 Has been ill with chronic heart trouble for over a year. Is now in Dynevor Hospital. No doubt, he should be off our books.\n\n#371 Herman Crate \" 19 Completing Grade XII. A good student. Good mechanical genius. Willing.\nThe Secretary - 2.\n\nHerman Crate (cont.) thorough and rapid in all his work. Most reliable. (See special letter).\n\n#0399 Winnie Gray Age 17 In Grade VIII. Splendid at housework and in the care of younger children. Parents wish her home.\n\n#356 Archie Hall \" 18 Grade IV. Very dull at school. Big, strong young man. Good worker, especially good with horses.\n\n#0402 Alice Hotomani \" 17 Completing Grade X. Good at housework. Taking home nursing course. Parents wish her home.\n\n#315 Alfred Hope \" 18 Grade VII. Naturally mechanical. Will make a very good farm hand. Has no relatives that we know of. We will endeavor to get suitable work for him.\n\n#0440 Maggie Kirkness \" 18 Grade VI. Mother requests her home.\n\n#0441 Maudena Kirkness \" 16 Grade IV. Not a very bright girl. Faithful and good at housework. Would be better in school another year but in view of the mother's insistent request it would, no doubt, be as well to let her graduate with her sister.\n\n#405 Charlie Littledeer \" 19 Grade VIII. This boy has improved wonderfully during his years here. Was incorrigible at first but is now one of our best and most reliable young men. His father would like him to remain still another year and we would very much like to keep him but in view of his age I do not feel like urging it.\n\n#599 Sandy Lone Thunder \" 17 Grade VI. Not a good student. Somewhat undersized. Fair worker. Not improving as he should. Parents request his discharge. He has somewhat changed his own attitude and would like to remain another year but we think it just as well to let him go this year.\n\n#0389 Nellie Ryder \" 18 Completing Grade IX. Sister of Rosabell Ryder, who is doing so splendidly in training at St. Boniface hospital. Is a fairly good student. Good at housework. Has improved remarkably in her attitude. Is quite definite in her desire to remain in school and she would profit by another\nyear with us but again I feel that it might be better to fill her place with some younger child who would otherwise be kept out of school.\n\n#460 Donald Royal Age 13 This boy is only 13 but his father who is a very old man is exceedingly anxious to have him home. His older brother died during the year at home. The agent feels it would be better to comply with the father's request. He could attend school on the reserve.\n\n#0562 Margaret Sinclair \" 18 In Grade IX. Parents request her discharge.\n\n#361 Thomas Sinclair \" 17 In Grade VIII. Good mechanic. Should make a useful man. Father wants him home.\n\n#467 Wilbert Spence \" 15 Parents claim he is sixteen now but he is on our books as fifteen. He was sent here for his moral welfare. Was a bit difficult at first. Is now quite amenable. A very poor student but a good worker. Parents claim they need him urgently. I think it would be as well to let him go home.\n\n#0457 Hazel Swanson \" 18 Doing well in Grade X. Has improved wonderfully in her attitude. Would like to remain in school as conditions at home are not the best and we would be glad to keep her but as there is not much chance of her qualifying for any special work I do not feel we can urge that she remain with us.\n\n#0312 Dora Wabidee \" 18 Probable age now. Given leave of absence to be employed in the home of Mrs. Parlor, 1212 King St., W., Hamilton. Splendid reports have come in in regard to this girl. We recommend that she be discharged.\nMay 3, 1938.\n\nIt is our very definite conviction that the following should be continued in school:\n\n#0418 Katie Ahenakew Age 18\n\nThis girl was sent here as I have learned indirectly on account of some undesirable conditions on the reserve. She has settled down with a splendid attitude to faithful study and good work in everything assigned to her. She is very anxious to remain. Her parents also very desirous that she should. She got somewhat behind in some of her subjects in Grade X while in the hospital for an operation for appendicitis. She wishes to remain here during the summer that she may get up her Latin and write a special paper on it in the fall. I strongly recommend that she be allowed to stay with us.\n\n#481 Angus Anderson \" 17\n\nCame here from File Hills to take Grade IX. Is a fine, upstanding, gentlemanly young man of splendid promise. Good student. A good acquisition to our stringed orchestra. Is ambitious to make something of himself and we are glad to help him.\n\n#0287 Mabel Anthony \" 17\n\nFrom Ontario. Has developed slowly. Quite immature. Needs the help, which we trust the school will be able to give her. Unless the home to which she would go would afford protection and guidance she should remain with us. She is a good student and a good worker if given the type of work she likes to do. Does beautiful needlework. Would like to see her trained for the next year along this line especially.\n\n#0395 Charlotte Bear \" 17\n\nIn Grade IX. Is developing splendidly. One of our best girls. She is a daughter of Mr. William Bear, of the New Reserve, north of Prince Albert, who is one of our most progressive Indians. He has the confidence of all who know him. He has written me a special letter, asking me that Charlotte remain with us for another year. She also is anxious to stay.\n\n#0438 & 461 Lavina and Walter Bear (twins) 17\n\nTaking Grade XI at Brandon Collegiate. Have been interrupted by quarantine both for chicken-pox and diphtheria. Have missed much of their work but they are anxious\nMay 3, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary - 5.\n\nLavina and Walter Bear (cont.)\n\nto continue in school. Their parents are anxious that they should. Both Walter and Lavina lack somewhat in that compelling ambition that so many of the others in this list possess but another year might bring out more of the desire to fill some useful place. They are bright, likable young people.\n\n#0470 Gladys Bear Age 18 These sisters were transferred here last fall from Round Lake. They are exceedingly good students, taking 1st and 2nd in their examinations in Grade IX. Keen, attractive, ambitious to succeed and to make something of themselves. Have no hesitation in urging their continuance.\n\n#0471 Alice Bear\n\n#0468 Winnie Bird Age 16 In Grade VI. Fairly backward. Has improved a great deal during the year. Comes from a very good home as reported to us by the agent and needs the help the school can give her.\n\n#0284 Irene Black Age 17 One of our very best girls. Is exceedingly capable, thorough and willing, both as a student and in housework. She is altogether the best girl we have in looking after the sick. Has taken the home nursing course. Is ambitious to get employment in a hospital. We have inquired in regard to home conditions and both from the agent and missionary learn that the situation is very undesirable. In the light of this fact Irene does not want to go home. We would like to keep her here until a good opportunity comes to secure for her employment in an institution like the Indian Hospital at Qu'Appelle. Will be glad to let her go any time such employment can be secured.\n\n#0288 Alma Cree Age 17 She is on our books as 18 but will not be 18 until July. She is in Grade VIII. Comes from Oka, Quebec. Has developed slowly. Improving very much recently. Is cultured and dainty in her manner. Fair student. A good little worker and very anxious to stay here for another year. We will be glad to have her, especially if home conditions are not harmful to a girl of her sensitive nature.\nMay 3, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary - 6.\n\n#0372 Chrissie Donkey Age 16 In Grade VI. From Nelson House. Came to us as a very crude and backward child. Is developing very satisfactorily in every respect. Should remain with us.\n\n#0456 Gladys Dreaver \" 17 In Grade X. Good, strong girl, daughter of Chief Dreaver, Mont Nebo, Sask. Good faithful worker, anxious to get a good education and make something of herself.\n\n#0351 Oriel Flett \" 16 In Grade IX. An attractive and ambitious girl. Have just received a letter from her parents asking that she remain in school.\n\n#0414 Vera Gray \" 19 Taking Grade XI. Notwithstanding interruptions with quarantine is doing well. Is ambitious to become a teacher and without a doubt has the ability, splendid perseverance and ambition; well backed up by her parents and we are very anxious to see her have the opportunity.\n\n#0361 Ethel Hall \" 16 Backward, undeveloped child in Grade VI. Home conditions undesirable. Needs the protection of the school.\n\n#0429 Matilda Hart \" 16 In Grade VI. Undeveloped. Needs the help and care of the school.\n\n#367 Hanson Hart \" 16 In Grade V. Undersized, retarded development. A nice, likable chap. Should remain in school.\n\n#0420 Agnes Haywahe \" 16 In Grade VII. Decidedly irresponsible but making favorable progress. Has it in her to make good and is fairly ambitious.\n\n#0397 & 0398 Elizabeth and Leona Haywahe 17 Have improved in attitude and progress remarkably during the past year. Elizabeth is a very good student, applies herself faithfully. Leona turns more naturally to housework. Both should remain in school.\n\n#0386 Doris Ironstar 17 In Grade IX. A fine, wholesome type of girl. Progressing satisfactorily. Very ambitious to make something of herself.\n\n#0474 Agnes Kay 18 Came here from Round Lake for High School work. A clean, bright, capable girl, ambitious to succeed and we are glad to help her.\nMay 3, 1936.\n\nAge 17 A bright girl, ambitious to make something of herself. Continues to improve. Has no home.\n\n#0292 Frances Lodge\n\n17 In Grade VIII. Ambitious, good outlook on life, bright and promising. Would like to attend Technical School next year. Will write later in this connection.\n\n#422 Joseph Mason\n\n17 Was brought here on account of undesirable home conditions. Has developed slowly but has made good advancement recently. Should remain in school.\n\n#298 Arthur Murdock\n\n16 Strong, healthy girl in Grade VI. Should continue in school.\n\n#0450 Christina Murdock\n\n17 Has made good progress during the past year. Wishes to and should remain in school.\n\nAccording to the best information we can get this boy has just turned 16. Is small physically and quite backward. Needs our help.\n\n#0449 Violet Murdock\n\n16 The improvement in this boy since he was brought here by the Mounted Police over a year ago is very delightful. He has just reached sixteen years of age.\n\n#432 Howard Murdock\n\n16 Naturally a backward boy but a good attitude.\n\n#479 Alec Pola\n\n16 Has been an exceedingly difficult child. A violent temper, abnormal sex urge but I believe conscientiously struggling to overcome her wrong tendencies and has a strong undercurrent ambition to make good. The mental clinic carried on in Brandon by Drs. of the Mental Hospital has helped us much in Mary's case. She should remain here.\n\n#0323 Mary Sinclair\n\n16 Backward at school. Conscientious and faithful in his work. A very dependable and promising boy.\n\n#417 Lawrence Spence\n\n16 Backward but improving steadily. Needs a lot of help and guidance.\n\n#0442 Margaret Strange\n\n16 A nice, attractive, likable girl, developing very well.\n\n#0447 Nancy Swanson\nMay 3, 1938.\n\n#345 Albert Thompson Age 18 In Grade VI. A marked case of retarded development. Has been much undersized and behind his normal age in mental development and outlook. Has improved greatly during the past year. Even yet would not rank mentally as more than thirteen years of age. Has no home. Feel strongly that he should remain with us for another year.\n\n#433 Rodney Thomas 17 A good student.

Would like to see him get at least another year in school.\n\n#434 Allan Thomas 16 A good, faithful, reliable boy. Would like to attend Technical School next year. Has a good mechanical turn. Will write later in regard to him.\n\n#0464 Mary Tapotat 20 Was out of school for a time, which accounts for her not being further on in school. Is very ambitious to be a nurse. Is one of our most trustworthy and promising girls. Splendid personality. Attractive and pleasing in manner. Should do exceedingly well.\n\n#0361 Florence Thaddeus 16 A good, average girl.

Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMay 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant the discharge of the following pupils from the Brandon Indian Residential School is approved:\n\n# 448 Ivan Ahenakew # 405 Charlie Littledeer\n306 Charles Chovin 389 Sandy Lone Thunder\n0267 Mary Louise Chovin 0389 Nellie Ryder\n426 Gordon Cline No. 460 Donald Royal\n371 Herman Crate 0362 Margaret Sinclair\n0399 Winnie Gray 361 Thomas Sinclair\n356 Archie Hall 487 Wilbert Spence\n0403 Alice Hotomani 0457 Hazel Swanson\n315 Alfred Hope 0312 Dora Wabidee\n0440 Maggie Kirkness 0464 Mary Tapotat\n0441 Maudena Kirkness\n\nYou will note that we have included among those to be discharged the name of Mary Tapotat, No. 0464. In view of her age the Department feels that we have dealt very generously with her. If she is anxious to finish her high school course there is no reason why she could not do so by a correspondence course conducted by the Manitoba Department of Education.\n\nI note your remarks regarding Vera Gray, No. 0414, and Agnes Kay, No. 0474. With regard to the former you suggest that she wishes to become a teacher. I doubt the advisability of encouraging her in this regard in view of the fact that throughout the Dominion we have found it increasingly difficult to secure a school for any qualified Indian teacher.

With this in mind it would appear to be a waste of money to encourage Indian girls to train for teachers.

J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 25, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary - page 2.\n\nI have had a good talk with Vera Gray. I have also been in touch with her brother, Maurice, who attended Round Lake, took Technical course while a pupil in this school, was employed with us for about three years, is now employed on the Crooked Lake Agency in charge of one of the breaking outfits, getting, I believe, $60.00 per month, a good, steady, industrious young man. Both he and the parents are very anxious for Vera to continue in school. Maurice, in a letter received today, states that he would be able to give some financial help but they are needing this help at home. He has been sending them part of his wages. Vera is ambitious. She is quite determined not to return to the reserve and certainly has the ability to qualify if given the opportunity. She is ambitious to teach and shows decided aptitude. Physically, she has no indication of Indian blood. I am enclosing a picture herewith of Ivan Ahenakew, who attended Technical school for the past three years, Herman Crate, Grade XII, Walter Bear, Grade XI, Lavina Bear, Grade XI and Vera Gray, also taking Grade XI. I am very anxious myself that she should be given the opportunity to continue at school and we will spare no pains in getting a school for her if it is at all possible when she is through. She certainly is under no handicap as far as racial appearance is concerned.\n\nI was very favorably impressed with the background of Agnes Kay. Her parents, while unable to talk English, seem to be a fine type of Indian, especially the father and he is anxious to have Agnes make something of herself. She is white in appearance, kindly and cordial in her attitude with others, an exceedingly pleasant manner. She was really only seventeen years of age on March 31st. She became eighteen a few days ago. She is anxious to be a nurse. She is a good student, standing third at Christmas, fourth in March, in a class of fourteen. I would also very much like to see that this girl given an opportunity to go on at school.\n\nTrusting that these cases may have your favorable consideration,\n\nI am,\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 25, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have delayed replying to your letter, #133-0-10, of May 12th, that I might make some further investigation in regard to Mary Tapotat, #0464, Vera Gray, #0414, and Agnes Kay, #0474.\n\nLast Thursday I drove over to the Round Lake School to interview Mr. and Mrs. Ross in regard to all three of these girls. I was anxious to become more familiar with their background, both in regard to their homes and their attitude and application while in attendance at Round Lake.\n\nI am unable at the present time to make any definite suggestion in regard to Mary Tapotat but would like the privilege of doing so after Mrs. Ross has written to some W.M.S. officials in the East in regard to the possibility of funds to give this girl assistance. The Rosses are unqualified in their confidence that Mary will make good if given an opportunity. It was not her wish to quit school when she did but her parents urged it and their consent for her to return to school a year ago last fall was somewhat reluctant. She has certainly made good here. Coming in just before Christmas, she covered her Grade IX work but stayed through part of the holidays a year ago to give further study to a couple of subjects on which she was weak. She is ambitious to be a nurse and manifests very decided natural qualifications for this profession. She expects to go to the Indian Hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle for the summer to earn what money she can to help with her education. I will be able to make some definite proposal in regard to her within a couple of weeks.\nOttawa,\nJune 3, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to Mary Tapotat, Vera Gray and Agnes Kay.\n\nAs we intimated to you in official letter of May 12 the Department doubts very much the advisability of encouraging these girls to qualify either for nurses or teachers. Our experience shows that it is practically impossible to obtain positions for them except in our own schools or hospitals and the vacancies in these institutions are quite limited.\n\nMr. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare & Training, will be in Winnipeg within the next two or three weeks and I would suggest that you get in touch with him through Mr. Hamilton's office and discuss the matter further with him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

It is also understood that children whose homes are at a considerable distance from Brandon will not be allowed home for holidays.\n\nIt is always advisable to make inquiries from the Indian Agent concerned regarding home conditions before sending children for holidays.

She is listed as seventeen years of age, but as we advance the age of each pupil at the end of the March quarter, she may be eighteen years old now. Mabel has been a very temperamental child, a couple of years ago was very anxious to leave the School and return East, but this year she is just as anxious to stay; and her change in attitude during the past year in every respect has been very marked and very satisfactory. She is one of the very best girls at needle work that we have ever had in the School. Her embroidery and other fancy needle work has taken first prize every year in the Brandon Fair, and also at Regina; and it does not matter whether it is shown with the Indian work or in the open class. She has completed Grade X and would naturally go on to Grade XI, but we felt it decidedly better that she should turn aside from academic studies and take the course in Domestic Art provided by the Collegiate Board in the City of Brandon. She is already started on this and is liking it very much. There is no extra fee charged for this course, and the material required will cost about $15.00. At least part of this we can supply from the\nOttawa, September 22, 1938.\n\nRe: Mary Snake, or Mabel Anthony\n\nDear Dr. Doyle:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant and to state that your recommendation - that the above-named girl be permitted to continue with her studies at Brandon Collegiate - is concurred in by the Department.\n\nI note, with interest, that this girl is very capable and efficient at needle work. In view of this fact, the desirability of employing her at an Indian residential school, preferably Mount Elgin, should be seriously considered at the end of the present academic year.

Leona's sister, Gladys Haywahe, has been appointed teacher at the Sunny Valley School northwest of Dallas. It is a non-English speaking Community, the teacher must live in a teacherage. We were unable to secure a suitable older person to live with Gladys, and under the circumstances felt the best thing to do was have her sister Leona, who is now seventeen years of age, who is in Grade IX, and who is especially interested in housekeeping, to go and live with her. She is a splendid reliable girl, will likely continue the study of Grade IX with her sister, and we are suggesting that she be given leave of absence for the balance of this year and then come back and graduate with the others in June. We are getting splendid reports from these girls for the short time they have been there.\n\nQ476, Olive Olsen. This girl took ill during the Summer, was sent to the St. Boniface Sanatorium for observation and treatment, and is therefore given leave of absence.\n\nQ477, Gladys Olsen.

The parents took decided and concerted action, deciding that their children should remain at home and attend the Day Schools in the Community, which are adjacent to their homes. The two main reasons given were: first, the children only attended School a half day here, and could attend the full day at home; 2nd, they were required to work the other half day, and as they put it, they might as well be working for them as for somebody else. Some of them stated that they only sent their children for a year on trial. At first I was decidedly of the opinion that they should be compelled to come back at the regular time and settle the difference afterward, but after talking the matter over with the Agent, and in view of the fact that it is an easy matter to have their places filled by new pupils,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Statement in regard to each case is necessary. The first eighteen in the list \"Discharge of Pupils\" have been approved by the Department.

They are as follows:\n\n0322. Mary Sinclair. Her father, Henry Sinclair, built a house on the Reserve, wanted Mary home to keep house for him. She was of age to be discharged. The Missionary and Agent both recommended it, and we decidedly approved.\n\n0379. Sophie Williams. Mother ill, Father urged that her help was needed. The acting Agent thought it better she should remain home, and we approved.\n\n0449. Violet Murdock. Similar circumstance in the case of this girl. The Father's request was quite urgent.\n\n0450.

J.

R. School.\n\nJoyce the Head Man of White Bears Band married this lad's mother when he was 6 years old and the boy was subsequently taken into the White Bears Band.\n\nIn 1937 at the age of 14 years he was out of control, continually running away from home and would not stay there. He was picked up at Glen Ewing Sask by the R.C.M.P. and eventually taken at quite an expense to the Department to Brandon School.\n\nSince he went to Brandon he has behaved himself well and the Revd. Principal under date October 15th, 1938 writes to me that Alec is a good worker and deserves great praise etc.\n\nJoyce now states that this boy is 16 years old and he is getting old, not feeding well and wants this boy home to help him but the Revd. Principal at Brandon feels that in view of the circumstances that caused the lad to be taken to Brandon and Joyce could not manage him at 14 years of age it would be as well to keep this boy at Brandon School until he is 18 years old and possibly make a man out of him with which views I must say I concur.\n\nThe boy seems content to remain at Brandon being perfectly happy and content there.\n\nI would be glad to have the Department's instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben. A. W. H. McKenzie\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to Alec Poll, a pupil of the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of this boy to remain at the Brandon Residential School for another year and you may so inform the Principal of the school and the boy's father.\n\nAt the end of the current academic year, namely June 30, 1939, this case can be reviewed and a decision will be made at that time whether he should be discharged or should remain for a further year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

You will note from the quarterly returns that he did not return after holidays. I went personally to pick him up, but the Father refused to let him come. I took the matter up with Mr. Young, the acting agent, and he was very emphatic in his statement that Charlie was not needed at home, as there are two older boys besides the father, lying around doing nothing most of the time. They are in very poor circumstances, were on rations last winter and will be again this winter. The Agent, Mr. Young, was over a short while ago and interviewed the father, Wallace Crowe, in this connection, but without success. I wrote Wallace last week telling him that another matter of business required me to go that way this week, and I would call for Charlie, trusting that he had made up his mind not to obstruct his coming any further. I called on Wednesday, he still declined. I talked to Mr. Young over phone in regard to the matter, and in view of the conditions mentioned above, and also in view of the fact that a number of the Indian families were watching to see whether this boy would be compelled to return or not, we were both decidedly of the opinion that in the interests of everyone concerned, it was better that he should be brought in. I therefore called that evening on the Mounted Police at Reston and asked the Officer to pick up Charlie on Thursday morning, bring him in to Reston, and I would take him from there. He did so. The Father came in with him, and also John Starr as interpreter, and they laid their\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A.

WESLEY'S Family, (Treaty Indian), Fisher River, Manitoba. Enquiries for Indian Department.\n\nHeadquarters Reference to the above I beg to report that on the 17th inst., I received a letter at this detachment from Rev. J.A. DOYLE, D.D., Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School. The following is a copy of the letter received:\n\nBrandon, Man., Oct. 11, 1926.\n\nOfficer in Charge,\nR.C.M.P. Office,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will no doubt receive from your Office here notice concerning a boy, Kara Wesley, who deserted from here yesterday just after dinner. He is sixteen, 5'9\" in height, weighs 125 pounds, most likely wearing dark trousers, light green shirt, blue and white striped sleeveless sweater, brown zipper jacket, light cap, black overalls. His parents belong to Fisher River but are, and have been all summer, somewhere up Lake Winnipeg. It is not unlikely that the boy would endeavour to find his way to his parents and probably through Hodgson.\n\nFour of the younger children of this family, who are enrolled here were allowed home for holidays. The parents promised to have them back when we brought the children from Hodgson about September last, but have not yet returned them. If any of your men are up the Lake and run across this family, I would appreciate it very much if you would have the parents notified that the children must be returned without delay.\n\nIt is urgent for the discipline of our School that this boy be brought back as soon as possible, and we will certainly appreciate your assistance in this connection. I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.A. DOYLE, (Signed)\nPrincipal.\n\nEnquiries were immediately made around Hodgson with regard to Kara WESLEY but no trace of him could be found. A patrol was made via private car from Hodgson to Halfway where I interviewed Mr. J.F. CLARKE, Indian Agent, who stated he thought the WESLEY family were up the Lake somewhere fishing but was not sure.\n\n(P.S.O.)\n\nFile numbers must be quoted\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6258, file 576-10, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nEnquiries were made from Indians I know who come from Fisher River and the only information I could get was that the Wesley family had not been seen since Treaty time at Fisher River. Whenever I questioned any of the Indians regarding Ezra Wesley they seemed as though they may have seen him but did not wish to say.\n\nOn the 22nd inst., a patrol was made via private car from Hodgson to Fisher River in connection with the above and other police matters and upon making enquiries around Fisher River I am satisfied that neither Ezra Wesley, nor the Wesley family, are anywhere around Fisher River or on this side of the Lake.\n\nI happened to meet a non-Treaty Indian by the name of Willie Cochrane who lives on Matheson Island, (or Snake Island as it is called by the Indians), and Cochrane informed me that the Wesley family are at West Dog Head, just across from Snake Island. Cochrane states he is sure that the Wesley family is there, although he could not say if Ezra Wesley was with them or not.\n\nIn view of the foregoing this file will now be shown as closed at this detachment. However, if Ezra Wesley is located in this district the necessary action will be taken and a further report submitted.\n\nPlease may I respectfully suggest that a copy of this report be forwarded to L/Cpl. Galcraft, 1/c Berens River Detachment, and in the event he locates the Wesley family he can notify them to return the four younger children to school as requested by Rev. J.A. Doyle, D.D. It is also quite possible that Ezra Wesley has gone home via boat from Selkirk. Extra copy of this report attached hereto for the information of L/Cpl.

With reference to the above I have to report that Dr. J.A. Doyle, principal of the above named school, called at this office at 8:30 p.m. this date, and reported that the captionally noted Indian boy had run away from the school sometime after the noon dinner that day.\n\n2. Ezra WESLEY is described as follows; Age, 16 yrs.; Weight, 135 lbs.; Height, 5'9\"; Build, slight; Hair, dark; and has the general appearance of a half-breed. At the time of running away he was dressed in a light green shirt, dark trousers, blue and white striped sweater, a brown zipper jacket, light cap, and black oxfords.\n\n3. It was learned from Dr. Doyle that Ezra has a brother, James, at Hnausa, Man. This boy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Isiah WESLEY are located somewhere north of Hedgson, near Lake Winnipeg, and belong to the Fisher River Indian Reserve.\n\n4. In view of the fact that it is believed that the two places mentioned in para. 3 of this report are the two most logical places that Ezra would visit, may I respectfully request that investigations be carried on at these two points by Mrberg and Hedgson Dets. respectively.\n\n5. May I also request that the facts of this report be circularized, please.\n\n6. Extra copies of this report for the information of the O.C. Winnipeg S/Div.\n\nH.D. Wrenshall\n(H.D.

BEMBRIDGE I/c Hodgson Detachment dated 11th. Ult. at Brandon, had returned to the school. He stated that when these children returned they were surprised to learn that Ezra was not there; they had not seen him, but they stated that they had been with their family at Dog Head and had been looking for Dorie Peterson who is at Black Bear and receives mail at Matheson Island.\n\n(3) The matter of expenses regarding the return of this boy to the school was taken up with Dr. DOYLE, he stated that he wanted this boy returned to the school even though he was out on Lake Winnipeg and for the sake of discipline if the Department would not pay the expenses, he would do so himself. Dr. DOYLE was informed of course of the nature of the expenses that would be incurred should this boy be located, i.e. the expenses of the escort and the boy travelling from where he is located to Brandon and return of the escort.

Referring to the above, and to marginal noted reports submitted in this connection, I have to report the following:\n\n2. When on general police patrol in the Bloodvein, East and West Doghead, Matheson Island, Birch Point, and Fisher River districts, Lake Wpgen, the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th insts., I made extensive enquiries, but was unable to learn the whereabouts of Ezra Wesley.\n\n3. I interviewed this boy's parents who live at east Doghead, Lake Wpgen, and they informed me the four younger children were returned to school on October the 26th, 1938, but they have no idea where Ezra could be.\n\n4. I later questioned different parties at Matheson Island and no person appeared to of seen this boy. Interviewing various residents in the above districts, I learned that Ezra's brother Jason is of a roving nature, usually travelling between Fisher River, Selkirk, and Kenora, Ont., and it is possible Ezra is travelling with him.\n\n5. I then learned that Sgt. Bembridge J. was absent from Hodgson and thought it advisable to continue to Fisher River, in case Ezra had returned there. However, enquiries made did not reveal anything of this boy's whereabouts.\n\n6. I then continued on to Hodgson, Man., where I later interviewed Sgt. Bembridge J., who informed me he was positive Wesley was not in the Fisher River district.\n\n7. In view of the foregoing this file will be closed at this detachment for the present, and if Ezra Wesley is located the necessary action will be taken and a further report submitted.\n\n8. Please may I respectfully suggest that copies of this report be forwarded to the Selkirk and Kenora detachments as it is possible someone may know of one of the above lads passing through the district.\n\nCONCLUDED at Berens River.\n\nSgt.

At 1.30 P.M., above date, acting on instructions from N.C.G. L/C Kenora Detachment, I left Detachment and travelled by private auto to the Cecilia Jaffreton and Stanley's Indian Schools and interviewed a number of the older pupils who might have seen the above mentioned Ezra Wesley had he been in this district. None of the boys interviewed could tell me anything concerning him and did not know the brother, James Wesley. The Principals of the Schools had never heard of them and never knew of them visiting their Schools.\n\n2. Capt. F. Edwards, Indian Agent was interviewed in this connection and stated that he had never heard of the Wesley's being in this district. Rev. H. Sanderson, Church of England missionary who travels all over this district also stated that he had never met them here.\n\n3. As it was felt that had the boys been around Kenora they would very likely have gone out to the Rat Portage Reserve, I patrolled to that point by private auto in the same P.M. and questioned the Indians there but could learn nothing. The Indians all promised that should they discover any trace of Ezra Wesley they would notify this Detachment immediately.\n\n4.

Her mother took ill and requested through the agent that she be returned home.\n\nNo. 0287 Mabel Anthony, Age 18.\nThis girl has improved very much during the past year, has attended Brandon Collegiate, taking Domestic Art, and has done well. She is exceptional in needlework, and we hope work can be found for her where this outstanding talent can be used to the best advantage. She comes from Ontario.\n\nNo. 0438 Lavina Bear, Age 18.\nPartly on account of illness during 1937-38, Lavina did not pass her Grade XI examination and has taken the year over this year, but as she has not made up her mind to qualify for any special line of work I do not think she should be continued in School and would recommend that she graduate this year.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.\n\nNo. 0284, Irene Black\nAge 18.\n\nIrene is one of our very best girls, thorough and willing, very kindly in attitude, and should have trained as a nurse. We hope to get her employment at the Indian Hospital at Que Appelle. Her mother lives on Christian Island but has not a suitable home for this girl.\n\nNo. 0288, Alma Cree\nAge 18.\n\nAlma is not very strong physically, has a very kindly spirit, is attractive in appearance, does her work real well, and would be exceedingly acceptable as a maid in a type of home where her finer qualities would be appreciated. There is an element of culture and refinement about her. Miss Daly who taught for some time at Caughnawaga states that Alma has not a suitable home to which she can go. We will do our best to get her a suitable home here in the west, and unless the Department is satisfied that suitable provisions can be made for her in the east, we would like to keep her in the School until we can find a desirable place for her. I think it is better for her to graduate and be perfectly free to go as soon as an opportunity occurs.\n\nNo. 0305 Elsie Hart\nAge 17.\n\nElsie is a splendid girl, is taking grade X, but has nothing special in view for the future, and her father wants her to work out, and a good home seems to be open for her at the present time.\n\nNo. 0398 Leona Haywahe\nAge 18.\n\nLeona has had leave of absence since September last to keep house for her.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

From the best reports we have had these girls both seem to have had a good influence in the community.\n\nNo. 0420, Agnes Haywahe,\nAge 17.\n\nThis girl is not particularly bright at school. The parents need her help and request that she be discharged.\n\nNo. 0292, Frances Lodge,\nAge 18.\n\nA very promising girl, is exceptionally good with little children, has no home and we hope to find suitable employment for her.\n\nNo. 0476, Olive Olson,\nAge 16.\n\nOn account of illness this girl did not return last fall. We think she should be discharged.\n\nNo. 0477, Gladys Olson,\nAge 13.\n\nGladys did not wish to come back in the fall without her sister, so the parents kept her home. She attended day school on the reserve and the father has not answered my letter enquiring concerning their wish for her for next year. I think she should be discharged.\n\nNo. 0304, Nora Wabidee,\nAge 18.\n\nGood worker, wishes to get employment in a home. She should do well.\n\nNo. 449, Charles Crowe,\nAge 16.\n\nThis boy had to be brought back last fall, has been one of our best boys during the year; would be glad to remain in school, but I am sure his father would not hear to it. Has become especially interested in the bees which have recently arrived. If we had him for a couple more years I\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man.\n\nthink he would make a good man. As matters stand now I think he should be discharged, but if the father changes his mind I think it would be the best thing for the boy to remain with us.\n\nNo. 397, Norman Flett\nAge 16\n\nThis boy is immature, but the parents are moving in from Birch to do some farming on the Reserve. They are very anxious to have Norman home to help them and the Agent recommends that he be discharged.\n\nNo. 507, Fraser Kesick,\n20 years.\n\nFraser came to us for one year to attend Technical School. He will finish his course next month.\n\nNo. 398, Arthur Murdock,\nAge 18.\n\nArthur has improved very much during the past year, will make a very good farm hand.\n\nNo. 345, Albert Thompson,\nAge 18.\n\nAlbert's development has been retarded but he has come on very satisfactorily during the past year. We will get work for him on a farm nearby, as he has no home to which he can return.\n\nNo. 433, Rodney Thomas,\nAge 18.\n\nRodney's ambition to make something of himself has not been maintained this year. He found study irksome, so we have taken him out of school and are giving him as thorough a training as possible in every type of farm work and he is improving rapidly, supervises other boys efficiently and with a kindly manner.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

He should be off our list.\n\nNo. 375. Morley Williams\nAge 17.\n\nThis boy is probably eighteen now.

This would involve considerable additional education with consequent expense. Having in mind the number of qualified white nurses and teachers who find it difficult to obtain employment and the further fact that it is even harder for Indian young people, even though trained, to obtain employment the Department hesitates making an immediate decision as to whether they should proceed or be discharged. With this in mind I should appreciate your again considering these cases and letting me have your view.\n\nWe have no criticism whatever of the splendid course that is given at the Brandon residential school but with changing conditions the officials of the Department are beginning to wonder whether the plan that we have had in operation for some years; namely, assisting Indian children in obtaining higher education, is really in their best interests. We do not advocate any sudden change but we would like to have from you a very full explanation of your views in the matter. Would you consider that instead of featuring higher education it would be preferable for the Brandon residential school to have special courses in domestic arts for the girls and more varied manual training for the boys? This, of course, would be a radical change from what we have been doing for the past few years but as intimated above we feel that it might be in the best interests of the children whom we are endeavouring to train in such a manner that they will be properly fitted to make a real contribution to reserve life.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\"D\" Brandon Brandon\n\nManitoba April 26th, 1939\n\nRussell MALLETT (Indian) missing from Brandon, Man.\nThe Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man.

Time of phone call, 3:05 p.m. At 3:10 p.m., I left Deloraine via pol.Cam. #1796 and proceeded to Regent and Dist., where a search for the boy was made, but without success. Search being continued until 8:45 p.m.\n\n(2) There was no official instructions regarding MALLET, but information as to his whereabouts was passed on to me as the result of a radio broadcast. There is no doubt that the Indian boy at Regent was MALLET, information examined the clothing of the boy and found the No.54, his general description also tallied.\n\n(3) MALLET was next seen on April 26th in the Deloraine Dist., S.E. when search was continued with Town Cst.

All farmers in the Dist. were advised regarding MALLET, but no further information of value was gained.\n\n(4) Other duties interfered with continued search.

I am therefore making request for the former grant of $250.00 to meet these expenses and the home-going expenses of our pupils residing in the west. The department has been paying the fare of those who return to Ontario.\n\nAnother matter, I would like to have your authority in regard to parents retaining their children at the close of holidays without any previous arrangement with us. Last year this took place in connection with a number of families at Hodgson, thereby upsetting our fall attendance very seriously. I would like this year to have each parent requesting their children home for holidays to sign a statement that they will return them promptly to the School at the close of holidays. Awaiting your reply, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nJAD/RS\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 1, 1939\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent, E. MacPherson, of Selkirk, re George Harper, No. 474, as follows:\n\n\"We have received a request from Nancy Harper, Matlock, to have her son remain at home with her after the summer holidays. Mrs. Harper is quite old now, and as she has no one to help her cut wood, etc. I would recommend that her wish be granted.\"\n\nThis boy is now fifteen years of age, is in Grade IV; his development and progress, both in School and work have been very satisfactory. He is a promising boy if given opportunity and from our standpoint, we would be glad to have him remain in School. I am writing for your direction and authority in the matter. Awaiting your reply, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nJAD/RS\nOttawa, June 6, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you request a grant of $350.00 to meet the expenses of certain pupils returning home on holidays.\n\nThe Department is prepared to pay transportation costs to the extent of $350.00, just as soon as the vouchers in this connection reach the office.\n\nI note with interest your reference to Indian parents and their reluctance to send back their children to school at the close of the holiday period. I can see no objection whatever to your suggestion that Indian parents sign a statement that they will return their children promptly to the school at the close of the holiday period. In addition to this, I am of the opinion that you should discuss the matter very fully with Inspector Hamilton and the Indian agents concerned. It appears to me to be only reasonable that the Inspector and the Indian Agent should cooperate with you in securing the return of pupils who have not been discharged from your institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nOttawa, June 6, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you refer to a request received from Indian Agent McPherson for the discharge of George Harper from the Brandon Residential School.\n\nIn view of the agent's recommendation and the apparent need for this boy at home to help his mother, I am of the opinion that he should be discharged.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to make arrangements with the Indian agent, whereby this boy might attend one of the public schools or, if this is impossible, he might enroll as a pupil with the Correspondence Branch of the Department of Education at Winnipeg. I make this suggestion in view of your reference to the boy's encouraging progress while in attendance at your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 29, 1939\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of May 22 No. 133-0-10, concerning graduates and other senior pupils in connection with this School.\n\nI appreciate very much that Alma Cree, No. 0288, is allowed to remain in the School for another year. We will certainly do our best this year to find a suitable place for her.\n\nIn the lists you submit, there are four names omitted: No. 0284, Irene Black, page 2 of my letter of May 12; No. 0476, Olive Olson, page 3; 449, Charles Crow, page 3; 447, Samuel Wabideeska, page 5. Take it that these have been omitted from the list of those which should be discharged, and I will regard them as belonging to this list unless I have further word from you and will be glad if you will forward in due time Diplomas of Discharge for all of these except Gladys Olson, who is only thirteen years of age,\u2014her number is 0477; and Ezra Wesley, 377, who truanted from the School last fall.\n\nIn regard to the eleven names of pupils set apart for further consideration, I have taken up each case with the individuals themselves, penetrating as well as I could into their own ambitions and desires, and willingness to sacrifice if need be, to achieve their purposes; have also talked each case over with their teacher and other members of the Staff who are most familiar with their attitude, spirit, and the type of work they do; and will review each case in detail. Before reviewing these cases I wish to say that I very definitely agree with you in the belief that we should work into a variety of very practical courses for both boys and girls, and turn as many as seems wise of our pupils into these courses; at the same time leaving the way open for those who have the ability and a real burning ambition to take up higher educa-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6258, file 576-10, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\ntion and qualify themselves for the very highest form or type of work and service of which they are capable. I think only a very few should be encouraged to qualify as teachers, but with the girls I feel there are a large number who could qualify, and would qualify, as Nurses, and would be exceedingly proficient in that profession. The experience with Rosabelle Ryder, who is now completing her second year in St. Boniface Hospital, is very encouraging. Rosabelle had to study hard to get up her work in School, but she did have that burning ambition, of which I speak, to be a Nurse; and while she was not as promising as many other girls, we felt confident that this ambition would carry her a long way, and I can say now with confidence, that I have never had reports in regard to anyone taking this or similar training that have been more satisfactory and consistently fragrant with praise. The Sisters whom I have consulted in the Hospital have been unqualified in their commendation of Rosabelle's attitude, efficiency, and general deportment. I have the impression also that graduate nurses could be employed in connection with our Indian Hospitals, Residential Schools, and even to some extent on the Reserves, to very great advantage. We have now adopted the policy of having a trained Nurse on our Staff, and when a vacancy occurs I would have no hesitation in taking one of these girls, after she had received her training. In fact I am now making it a policy to keep one graduate employed on our Staff regularly. We have had as many as three at one time, but this does not work to as good advantage as having one or possibly two.\n\nOur graduates who have gone through as teachers have given us splendid satisfaction. Four of them are teaching this year, and the reports in each case are splendid. Lulu Ironstar taught for nearly three years. She is now married, living at Nelson House, and is keeping a good home. The same can be said of Winnie Steinhauer, who taught for about five years, then married in northern Alberta; and these girls are certainly better housekeepers and better homemakers on account of the training and experience which they have had. The same thing would apply in regard to nursing. If a girl who is adapted to it took a Nurse's training and then married a progressive type of Indian young man, and lived on the Reserve, she ought to be a very valuable acquisition for the betterment of conditions on the\nWe have already made some start on the more practical courses to which I have referred, along the line of domestic art. The course in plain sewing, dressmaking, and fancy needlework, on which we have made a commencement, has given us good satisfaction. The work we exhibit at the Brandon, Regina, and Prince Albert Fairs has brought us satisfactory prizes. Then, as you know we have had Mabel Anthony attending the School for Domestic Art in Brandon and I had a talk with the lady directing this work this morning. She was exceedingly well pleased with Mabel's work. I asked her where she would place her as to standing in her class of over forty. She said she could not say without going over her list carefully, but that she was easily in the first ten in the class. I have a feeling that as many girls as possible should be given this training and then a few of the more talented and ambitious girls singled out for special training with a view of them getting employment along this line. I feel also that there should be a certificate or diploma given in this branch as well as a number of others which I will mention later.\n\nApart from the practical training that every girl gets in the kitchen and dining room, we have been giving a number of them special lessons in the art of cooking, and some instruction in food values, balanced menus, and such like. I think that this course should be enlarged and those that attain proficiency and pass a written examination on dietetics should also receive a special certificate or diploma.\n\nOur course in home nursing, under the auspices of the St. John's Ambulance, has been exceedingly helpful and satisfactory. We endeavour to have ten to about fourteen girls take this course each year. The trained nurse on the Staff is able to give the instruction, the girls take to it very readily, and a Doctor and Nurse from the City are appointed to conduct the examinations, and the diploma they receive is an added incentive for them to take this course, and it certainly has given the girls more confidence in themselves and made them much more useful and helpful in the dispensary and hospital wards when there is sickness.\nI feel also that it is very important that these practical courses, followed by examination and the granting of diplomas, should be put on for the boys. We have already made a start in Automotive Mechanics, in having a few boys each year attend the Technical School for this purpose, in Brandon. On the whole we are well pleased with the results. At least two of our boys have distinguished themselves in handling tractors, and others have secured employment more readily and proven themselves more efficient on account of taking this course.\n\nWe now have a man on the staff, Mr. Clarence Zee-land, who has taken the Diploma Course in connection with the Agricultural College. He was with us last summer and returned this year after completing his course; and we are in a position to put on, or at least to make a start, in some other courses we have in mind. There should be one course, I think, in Field Crops, including everything in the line of grain and fodder; then under Horticulture, the cultivating of all garden produce, shrubs, fruit trees, etc.; under Stockraising, types and breeds, feeds and feeding should be taken up. Then I think there should be a separate course for Poultry, and a fifth one for Dairying, including Bacteriology; and now with the acquisition of the bees which we have secured, a course on Beekeeping. Later I hope that a course could be put on in Fur Farming. This makes seven courses under the general head of Agriculture, and I feel that there should be a diploma or a certificate of standing granted to each boy who responds well in the practical side and passes a written examination on the material given. Being situated right here by the Experimental Farm, we could get very valuable help in connection with these courses. We already avail ourselves of the opportunity of sending a group of our boys to the ten-day short course which is given in Brandon in connection with the Experimental Farm, just previous to and part of the time of the Winter Fair. I think also there should be taken up here, and perhaps in most Schools, a course on Woodwork, Handicrafts of different types, and Instruction in Building Construction. This, of course would have to be somewhat elementary, but many of our boys would take to it readily, and a diploma should be granted for this\nalso after satisfactory examination had been passed. I have a feeling that the Department would like to, with the aid of the Agricultural Department at Ottawa, lay out some practical courses along these lines, which we could take. So many pamphlets are now produced, that it seems to me, courses could be outlined very readily and without much expense.\n\nI do think it would give the boys a greater desire to go ahead and make something of themselves, and greater confidence in their ability, if they were able to secure a number of these diplomas before they finish their work in the School. With most of them it would mean that their academic training would perhaps not go beyond Grade VII; some of the brighter ones would be in Grade VIII; but I do not think their entrance to these classes should depend either on the Grade they are in, or on their age, so much as their natural aptitude, and general I.Q.\n\nNow, as to the individual cases in the list of eleven on page 2 of your letter. No. 0351, Oriel Flett.\n\nThis girl has made such decided improvement, and now seems so determined to go ahead and train as a nurse, that I would very much like to see her have the opportunity. There is almost no sign of the Indian about her, none of that shyness or backwardness that handicaps so many of our pupils, and she is just seventeen years of age.\n\nNo. 0386, Doris Ironstar\n\nShe is a sister of Lulu, who took a teacher's course and did well as a teacher and now keeps a good home. She is a wholesome, frank, honest, go-ahead type, inspires confidence, and should do well as a nurse, and will be glad if she is given the opportunity of going on.\nThis girl is the third sister we have had of William Bear's children. They are certainly a family with more than ordinary ability. In my talk with her last evening she revealed that church work of some form is in the back of her head, and would like very much another year in School to be qualified suitably to take any additional course that might help her toward the desired end. She is attractive in appearance, would pass for a white girl anywhere, and has the ability to succeed.\n\nNo. 0397, Elizabeth Haywahe. Elizabeth will be greatly disappointed if she has to turn aside to some other course. She has lots of driving power, will give up anything for her studies, is so wholesome, straightforward, and ambitious, that I dislike very much to see her turned aside. I know however she will have a real struggle to make the academic standing necessary to train as a nurse. She would like to have a talk with Gladys, and Leona, her twin sister, before making a final decision. I would like to see the way left open for her.\n\nNo. 0414, Vera Gray. With the new regulation that students must have an average of 60% on the four English subjects, and an average of 55% on all the other subjects of Grade XII, before being admitted to Normal School, it is just doubtful if Vera can qualify for Normal School next fall. If she reaches this standing I certainly think she should be allowed to take Normal next year. If she does not, I feel it is asking the\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nPage 7.\n\nNo. 0414, Vera Gray. (Con.)\n\nDepartment for a good deal to have her repeat the year. It might be, however, that if she did not have the clear percentage when the reports came out, she could pull up the average by taking supplementals on one or two subjects. It seems to me if the privilege of attending Normal next year hinged on whether she could qualify to enter or not would be fair treatment as far as she is concerned.\n\nNo. 0418, Katie Ahenakew.\n\nThis girl is a niece of Canon Ahenakew, who is, I believe rendering valuable service in connection with his Church. A first cousin of hers is teaching successfully, I am informed, in an Anglican Mission School in the north. Katie feels she has a family standard to live up to, and wants to be a nurse. I have the feeling, however, that her ambition has weakened somewhat during the past six months, and that she has not, during this year, devoted herself to her work with the same untiring energy that she manifested last year and previously. If the Department does not see fit to continue her here next year, it may be that her Church will get behind her and give her the assistance she will require.\n\nNo. 0456, Gladys Dreaver.\n\nShe is a daughter of Chief Dreaver, of Leask, Saskatchewan; has powers of leadership, is devoted to her\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev.

Later, she sent me a list of nine under date of July 10, ranging in age from eight years to eleven years, which up to date had never been in school. Four of these are living three miles or more from the school.\n\nI am simply writing this letter to state that, if, in the wisdom of the Department, it is advisable that any of these children should be sent here we would be very glad to receive them.

Her people have also been making requests in this regard and I told them I would write to you in regard to the matter.\n\nThis girl is fairly capable as a student, seems conscientious and diligent in her work, and if she had a business course would be able to do some lines of work quite successfully. But, in view of the fact that there are such large numbers of well-educated, capable girls out of employment, I do not think it would be advisable to comply with the request of this family.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

When the children were returning to Brandon after holidays a younger sister was sent by the parents to replace Dora at the Brandon school, she was admitted as a new pupil coming into the school. Dora is the only one of the family that is old enough to attend to her mother and the younger children at home and the parents request that she be left with them for this purpose until such time as the mother can attend to the household duties herself. The family are in very poor circumstances and would have no means of securing the services of anyone else to do the work if Dora was sent to school at present.\n\nIn view of the above could this girl be granted a temporary discharge from school for the purpose of attending her mother.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R.

I noted the senior children could have all the bread they desired and all the pupils were supplied with a good helping of vegetables and meat. None left the table hungry.\n\nThis year the root house is filled with potatoes; in fact, the quantity cannot be used for school purposes and at least a carload will be sold. There is also a good supply of cabbage, beets and parsnips. The carrots were diseased and did not keep. The turnips all went to neck, but a supply is being obtained from a neighbour.\n\nSince September 24th, nineteen head of cattle have been butchered; these averaged 1180 lbs. and dressed out to an average of 610 lbs. Dr. Doyle has a quantity of this meat in the ice house and there are six head yet to kill. A carcass is used every two weeks.\n\nThe Chovin children came to Brandon School in January, 1928, while I was on the staff. Frank was 5, Mary Louise 4, and Charlie 2. Frank was discharged last summer; Mary Louise is close to 17 and weighs 120 lbs., a fine healthy girl. Charlie is around 16 and weighs 110 lbs. Both are in good health.\n\nThe boys who stole had both been discharged; in fact, one was from Elkhorn, although previously in Brandon. Freddie Omen was the Brandon school boy and David Small the Elkhorn boy. They were both discharged and working out at the time. Last summer, four small boys, aged 9, 11, 12 & 14, went into Eaton's and stole some candy, toys, and sugar. The matter was brought to Dr. Doyle's attention by Mr. Hunter, of the Y.M.C.A. Dr. Doyle immediately found out all the particulars,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\ngave the boys money to settle for the goods, and\naccompanied them to make sure the matter was adjusted.\nHe then punished the boys by making them work on Saturday\nafternoons and holidays until the value of the money had\nbeen refunded. He has had no further trouble and the\nincident certainly was not brought about by hunger.\n\nDr. Doyle does occasionally use the strap if\nhe considers such punishment necessary. He emphatically\nstates that he has never hit a boy with his fist.\n\nDr. Doyle states Frank was discharged in good\nhealth, but that he was not as robust as the other\nchildren. The boy who went north six weeks ago was Sammy\nFoster. He was discharged in September, 1932. He worked\nfor a farmer west of the school and gave good service.\nHe visited the school a few days before leaving for the\nnorth and left on December 2nd for Thicket Portage. On\nleaving, he came to the school office and thanked Dr.\nDoyle for his kindness and incidentally remarked that the\nspirit of the school was the best he had known. Later,\nhe sent a Christmas card to Dr. Doyle and the pupils.\nI know Sammy well. He is slight in stature, but healthy.\n\nThe children are all well clothed. The mother\nhas sent clothing, especially the last two years; in\nfact, she does everything in her power to make the\nchildren dissatisfied. Her donations of clothing are\nnot essential to the children's comfort.\n\nThe children have not been allowed home,\nbecause the distance was too great and the mother had\nno intention of allowing them to return. Another reason\nwas on account of the mother's conduct while in Brandon.\n\nI have covered the complaints and now wish to\nset forth other particulars which will no doubt supply\nthe motive for these complaints.\n\nThe three children were left at school in 1928\nby Mr. & Mrs. Chovin. This couple parted and I do not\nknow whether Chovin obtained a divorce or not. He now\nlives in St. Paul, U.S.A. Mrs. Chovin apparently became\nMrs. Perger. Perger works on the railroad north of The\nPas and no doubt makes a fair living. Almost ten years\nafter leaving her children, Mrs. Perger wrote asking if\nthey were at Brandon or Edmonton and asked for information\nconcerning them. In 1933, she and Perger came to Brandon\nand took a room for one month. They called at the school\nand may have had a meal or two there, but usually took\nthe children to town Saturday afternoon. The husband\nreturned north, leaving his wife. She called several\ntimes in a big taxi, and eventually was arrested in a\nhouse on the flats. The house is known as \"Old Pete's\"\nand is reported to be a rendezvous for loose women,\nespecially Indians. She resisted arrest and was taken\nto the Mental Hospital. She sent for Dr. Doyle and\nrequested him to get her clothing etc. from Pete's\nhouse. The police went with Dr. Doyle and secured her\nbelongings.\nbelongings. She had contracted debts and Dr. Doyle wrote her husband for money to pay the bills and send her home. Dr. Doyle felt he could not depend on her to leave the City, so drove her, in company with a matron, to Neepawa where he put her on the train. Within a short time, she was arrested in The Pas and brought back to the Mental Hospital at Brandon with a black eye and other bruises. The hospital authorities refused to release her until Perger appeared in person. He came several weeks later. Together, they taxied to the school, saw the children for a few minutes at breakfast, and then left for the train. The children have never been informed concerning any of this and only know the best side.\n\nPerger claims to have a homestead near Edmonton and stated the boys would be of great help.\n\nI am familiar with the whole situation and would recommend that both Mary and Charlie be retained until they are 18 yrs. of age. The lack of interest during the first ten years hardly justifies their deep interest now - the boys and Mary have now reached a useful age. Undoubtedly, Mary is much better off in school than any place else.\n\nI trust my report covers the whole situation. However, in closing, I would draw the Department's attention to the Provincial School Inspector's report dated December 2nd, 1935. This is the opinion of an outsider and one well qualified to express his views.\n\nDr. Doyle granted me the freedom of the school and stated I was free to talk to any of the children or staff.\n\nI trust my recommendation that Charlie and Mary remain at school will be approved. Mrs. Perger's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nPicket Portage man\n\nNov 18/35\n\nI am writing this letter in regards to the Brandon In. Res School and also about the treatment of the school. Mr. J. B. Doyle, it is the way the children are treated, these children don't get enough to eat their plates of food for them all, lots of meat and vegetables, vegetables are thrown away in the fall, instead of canning them for winter use.\n\nThe boys are getting in jail for stealing, one boy done a month, and some more boys done some shoplifting at T. Eaton store in Brandon. They took food because they were hungry. These things never happen before, about children going out to steal food to fill their empty bellies. I know Mr. Simmons before Mr. Ferrier, who was principal, before Doyle and I knew them well, and about the punishment at school, these children are afraid to say anything, about not getting enough to eat, they are scared of Mr. Doyle, because he strips them to clothes, also makes his fists to the boys, I don't think this thing should be allowed, it would be very nice to ask these children at school, while they are there, they are scared of Mr. Doyle, Mr. Doyle should deny anything I say in this letter. I will be there this spring about March, I seen things in that school that would make your heart sick. Mr. Doyle has the Big Paw in front of him, at half past...\nthe Big Boys has to drive team ten miles and to see the clothes that they have to wear. It's a shame what you see in that school, who gets the thanks to the principal, and it's the boys that look after stock and garden, and what. Sure enough they have a man over them. I can prove all I say is true. I have a boy who was at Brandon school; that boy was not fit to do a real man's work. He was too weak, if you would let clay, with some beef up to bone, be a real man, and another boy came from there six weeks ago. He was in the same condition, where he did not have much life in him. Everybody around here seem how my boy was when he came home, and to see him now after three months' home, he working to clay doing a real man's job. I've been in Brandon school writing, my husband and myself, and she seen plainly, and what a person sees with their own eyes is the truth. I know my husband could not forget, show the children our feet, when they go to the table they just swallow their food. I buy clothing for my children out of my own pockets, to give them clothes & shoes this season for the winter. I asked Mr. Doyle to let me have my children for summer holidays. He wrote and told me about him unwilling to allow about $15, and said I could not have them. I send a pass for them to come, so he told me. I had to pray their face I am in the position to pay the fare. He made me pray.\nfor my boys fare, when we came home for good\nand the Indian agent told me to go to the\nschool to pay their fare when they go home for\ngood. I have letters to show for this; he lets\nother children go home for summer holidays\nbut I can't get mine.

I noted the senior children could have all the bread they desired and all the pupils were supplied with a good helping of vegetables and meat. None left the table hungry.\n\nThis year the root house is filled with potatoes; in fact, the quantity cannot be used for school purposes and at least a carload will be sold. There is also a good supply of cabbage, beets and parsnips. The carrots were diseased and did not keep. The turnips all went to neck, but a supply is being obtained from a neighbour.\n\nSince September 24th, nineteen head of cattle have been butchered; these averaged 1180 lbs. and dressed out to an average of 610 lbs. Dr. Doyle has a quantity of this meat in the ice house and there are six head yet to kill. A carcass is used every two weeks.\n\nThe Chovin children came to Brandon School in January, 1923, while I was on the staff. Frank was 5, Mary Louise 4, and Charlie 2. Frank was discharged last summer; Mary Louise is close to 17 and weighs 120 lbs., a fine healthy girl. Charlie is around 16 and weighs 110 lbs. Both are in good health.\n\nThe boys who stole had both been discharged; in fact, one was from Elkhorn, although previously in Brandon. Freddie Omen was the Brandon school boy and David Small the Elkhorn boy. They were both discharged and working out at the time. Last summer, four small boys, aged 9, 11, 12 & 14, went into Eaton's and stole some candy, toys, and sugar. The matter was brought to Dr. Doyle's attention by Mr. Hunter, of the Y.M.C.A. Dr. Doyle immediately found out all the particulars.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\ngave the boys money to settle for the goods, and\naccompanied them to make sure the matter was adjusted.\nHe then punished the boys by making them work on Saturday\nafternoons and holidays until the value of the money had\nbeen refunded. He has had no further trouble and the\nincident certainly was not brought about by hunger.\n\nDr. Doyle does occasionally use the strap if\nhe considers such punishment necessary. He emphatically\nstates that he has never hit a boy with his fist.\n\nDr. Doyle states Frank was discharged in good\nhealth, but that he was not as robust as the other\nchildren. The boy who went north six weeks ago was Sammy\nFoster. He was discharged in September, 1932. He worked\nfor a farmer west of the school and gave good service.\nHe visited the school a few days before leaving for the\nnorth and left on December 2nd for Thicket Portage. On\nleaving, he came to the school office and thanked Dr.\nDoyle for his kindness and incidentally remarked that the\nspirit of the school was the best he had known. Later,\nhe sent a Christmas card to Dr. Doyle and the pupils.\nI know Sammy well. He is slight in stature, but healthy.\n\nThe children are all well clothed. The mother\nhas sent clothing, especially the last two years; in\nfact, she does everything in her power to make the\nchildren dissatisfied. Her donations of clothing are\nnot essential to the children's comfort.\n\nThe children have not been allowed home,\nbecause the distance was too great and the mother had\nno intention of allowing them to return. Another reason\nwas on account of the mother's conduct while in Brandon.\n\nI have covered the complaints and now wish to\nset forth other particulars which will no doubt supply\nthe motive for these complaints.\n\nThe three children were left at school in 1925\nby Mr. & Mrs. Chovin. This couple parted and I do not\nknow whether Chovin obtained a divorce or not. He now\nlives in St. Paul, U.S.A. Mrs. Chovin apparently became\nMrs. Perger. Perger works on the railroad north of The\nPas and no doubt makes a fair living. Almost ten years\nafter leaving her children, Mrs. Perger wrote asking if\nthey were at Brandon or Edmonton and asked for information\nconcerning them. In 1933, she and Perger came to Brandon\nand took a room for one month. They called at the school\nand may have had a meal there too, but usually took\nthe children to town Saturday afternoon. The husband\nreturned north, leaving his wife. She called several\ntimes in taxi and eventually was arrested in a\nhouse on the flats. The house is known as \"Old Pete's\"\nand is reported to be a rendezvous for loose women,\nespecially Indians. She resisted arrest and was taken\nto the Mental Hospital. She sent for Dr. Doyle and\nrequested him to get her clothing etc. from Pete's\nhouse. The police went with Dr. Doyle and secured her\nbelongings.\nbelongings. She had contracted debts and Dr. Doyle wrote her husband for money to pay the bills and send her home. Dr. Doyle felt he could not depend on her to leave the City, so drove her, in company with a matron, to Neepawa where he put her on the train. Within a short time she was arrested in The Pas and brought back to the Mental Hospital at Brandon with a black eye and other bruises. The hospital authorities refused to release her until Perger appeared in person. He came several weeks later. Together, they taxied to the school, saw the children for a few minutes at breakfast, and then left for the train. The children have never been informed concerning any of this and only know the best side.\n\nPerger claims to have a homestead near Edmonton and stated the boys would be of great help.\n\nI am familiar with the whole situation and would recommend that both Mary and Charlie be retained until they are 18 yrs. of age. The lack of interest during the first ten years hardly justifies their deep interest now - the boys and Mary have now reached a useful age. Undoubtedly, Mary is much better off in school than any place else.\n\nI trust my report covers the whole situation. However, in closing, I would draw the Department's attention to the Provincial School Inspector's report dated December 2nd, 1935. This is the opinion of an outsider and one well qualified to express his views.\n\nDr. Doyle granted me the freedom of the school and stated I was free to talk to any of the children or staff.\n\nI trust my recommendation that Charlie and Mary remain at school will be approved. Mrs. Perger's letter is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, January 29, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant in connection with Dora Favel, the following letter has been received:\n\n\"This girl attends day school each day and attends to her mother after and before school hours. When the children were returning to Brandon after holidays, a younger sister was sent by the parents to replace Dora at the Brandon school. She was admitted as a new pupil coming into the school. Dora is the only one of the family that is old enough to attend to her mother and the younger children at home, and the parents request that she be left with them for this purpose until such time as the mother can attend to the household duties herself. The family are in very poor circumstances and would have no means of securing the services of anyone else to do the work if Dora was sent to school at present.\"\n\nIn view of the above information, the Department considers that it would be advisable to leave this girl at home, and I am so informing Mr. McKenzie.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

On October 25th I received a letter from Mrs. Werthenbach, of Hoosier, Sask., where Helen was stopping, stating that her daughter, Mrs. Nelson, of Calgary, had found it impossible to comply with the arrangement and that they were sending Helen back to us. We took her in as there was nothing else to do and sought at once to get work for her. The only place we could secure was with Mrs. Dr. Buckley, whose husband is Assistant Superintendent at the Experimental Farm across the road. She could only take her on condition that she sleep here at night. This arrangement worked out satisfactorily as Helen is perfectly reliable and trustworthy. But about two weeks ago she took ill. The doctor is afraid of T.B. and recommends that she be plated on first opportunity and, if possible, removed from the school.\n\nI am writing to ask that you grant us the privilege of restoring her to our list as a pupil of the school until final disposition can be made in regard to her.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

The Principal of this school replied stating that there was plenty of room in the Brandon School and that he would be most glad to have the children. He sent me forms for me to fill up and sign instructing me to take the completed forms to the Indian Agent, Mr Clark for transmission to Your Department of Indian Affairs for approval, adding that he was sure the Indian Department would make no objection as other children were admitted to the Brandon School who were not treaty Indians.\n\nLast week I called upon the Indian Agent who informed me that the Department of Indian Affairs had refused to allow my children to be admitted to the Brandon School.\n\nMy mother was a member of the St Peters Band of Indians, my father was a non treaty Indian and I was adopted by John B. Stevenson who was a treaty Indian of the St Peters Band and my wife is still taking treaty as a member of the Peguis Band.\n\nI find it very strange that my children are refused admission to the Brandon School and would respectfully ask to be advised of the reason. If it is because I am a member of the Church of England it is more strange as my neighbour who is also a Church of England member had three children in the Brandon School both parents of whom are not Indians.\n\nI am unable to provide sufficient food or clothing for my children owing to the lack of work or anything to enable me to obtain necessary supplies and when the Principal of the Brandon School informs me there is plenty of room for my children and that they will be most welcome I do not know what to do.\n\nIf my children cannot be admitted to the Brandon School will you please direct that they be admitted to a Roman Catholic School?\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

He is about seventeen years of age, medium height and size, angular features, pointed chin, hesitant and backward in conversation, dressed in a dark suit without an overcoat, cloth cap and Oxford, black I think, also a pair of running shoes in his pocket. He said to one of the boys that he might go to Selkirk to visit an aunt whom they think is Mrs. Lisette Smith, some few miles out on the St Peters Reserve.\n\nIt is quite essential for the sake of the boys and also for the discipline of the school that he be returned to us. He left yesterday morning to go to church but instead turned off towards the highway. Said he would either catch a freight or hitchhike. As soon as I learned about it I informed the Mounted Police Office and they immediately sent word to their office at Portage. I have also phoned the Mounted Police at Hodgson to be on the lookout for him. I would be glad, therefore, if you would be good enough to turn this information over to the Mounted Police officer at Selkirk and if he locates the boy, take him in charge and let me know at once by wire or telephone at my expense and I will come for him. I presume that the highway to Selkirk is open.\n\nIf he should come your way we will appreciate very much your kindly helpfulness in getting him back.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A.

Reference the above I beg to report that this date Dr Doyle telephoned this office that an Indian boy living at the school had disappeared and in all probability was endeavoring to get back to his home at Fisher River, Man. This boy in company with other boys from the school had come into the city to attend church at about 11:00 a.m. and it is learned from the others upon their arrival back at the school that SINCLAIR had not attended church but had said something to the others about beating it away.\n\n2. The description of this Indian boy follows:\n\nStanley Sinclair, 17 years old, undersized for age, thin face and pointed chin, very shy and reserved, wearing dark cap, white shirt, collar and tie, dark suit, no overcoat.\n\n3. Upon receiving this complaint the writer patrolled as far east as Douglas on No.1 highway in Police Car Code #2296, accompanied by Sergt. Mitchell of this Detachment. Enquiries were made at Douglas and along the road but no one had seen SINCLAIR either on the highway or on the railway tracks.\n\n4. Brandon City Police were notified and given a description of the missing boy. Portage La Prairie Detachment were communicated with by telephone and instructed to watch the highway and the trains moving east in an endeavour to locate this boy.\n\n5. Dr Doyle telephoned this office this date to say Stanley SINCLAIR has an aunt living four or five miles out in the St. Peters Reserve, Selkirk, and her name is Lizzie SMITH. He was thinking Stanley might try to reach his aunt and stay there for awhile.\n\n6.

The parents say this boy wasn't sent to do wrong to\nget hungry, and if that's the case its no use to keep that\nboy any longer, also that school, Brandon should be\ninvestigate according to the complaint if heard. Its no use\nfor them children to get hungry when the Dept. supplies\nit or look after it. Wishing to see this boy to return home to Fisher River\nvery soon.\n\nEXTRACT\n\nAlso, I would like to know where this Alex James Murdoch really\nbelong? I know his from pages name Fred Asham, son of deceased.\nIsaac Asham and this Alex Jas. Murdoch, he's got four kids he got\nafter three different girls, and I told the agent about this and he\ntold me to ask the girl that one has after if Alex ever promised\nher to marry and she told me yes. Things went so far so\ngot to check these things especially in the reserve, and I want\nyou to press on to our Indian agent. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChief Moses McKay\nHon. J. A. Brean\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 8, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Chief Moses McKay, requesting the discharge of Stanley Sinclair, No. 379, from the Brandon Indian Residential School. This is the boy to whom you refer in your letter of the 2nd instant. The quarterly return shows that he is 16 years of age, and the Department feels that it would probably be advisable to discharge him at the end of June, or even sooner, if he can be returned home conveniently. Please let me hear from you regarding this boy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D. D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., April 13, 1936\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of April 8th, No. 133-0-10, concerning Stanley Sinclair, No. 379, and in reply wish to say that we have this boy in the list of those we intended to recommend for discharge at the end of this academic year.\n\nWhen Stanley ran away, Inspector Hamilton happened to be here. I talked the matter over with him and he suggested that Stanley be kept in the school till the close of holidays as a matter of discipline. When he landed at Winnipeg in a freight car he was arrested by the railway police, charged with breaking and trespassing and was turned over to the Juvenile Court. Judge Hamilton, of the Juvenile Court, is a very warm personal friend of mine and is much interested in our school. He decided to turn him over to me without any other sentence, recommending that I administer what discipline I thought wise in his case. After bringing Stanley home, I wrote the Judge, stating that I had decided to keep him here till the close of holidays. Stanley quite agreed to this and agreed also that the time should be extended beyond the close of holidays if he did not give good conduct from now till then. I have the Judge's letter of approval.\n\nAfter reviewing the whole situation and noting the type of letters from the parents recommending good conduct it seems to me that it is better to follow out the plan we have outlined.\n\nTrusting that this may meet with your approval,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/W\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., April 13, 1936\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of April 6th, No. 133-0-10, in reference to Gladys Haywahe, No. 0287, and was quite surprised that I had not written you before Christmas in regard to her case. I had talked the matter over very fully with Inspector Hamilton during one of his visits and was under the impression when I sent in the returns that I had also written you.\n\nLast fall, when we had our flu epidemic, Gladys was laid aside for some time unable to attend school. Then for another period we were quarantined with a fear that Scarlet Fever was developing. I talked the matter over with Mr. Reid, the Principal of the Collegiate, and he strongly advised that, owing to the amount of time that Gladys had been out of school, she only write on three of the six subjects required to complete her Grade XI. We followed this advice and she passed successfully on the three subjects, leaving the other three to be written on in June. Gladys is one of our most promising girls, is exceedingly ambitious to be a nurse, has a promise from the Mother Superior of St. Boniface Hospital that she will be admitted on the completion of her Grade XI and we are all exceedingly anxious that she be given the opportunity if it is at all possible. I do not feel however, especially in the light of the cut in grant which has recently taken place that we would be justified in continuing her in the school at our expense for another quarter. I will be very much pleased, therefore, if you can see your way clear to overlook our neglect in writing you in regard to her and allow the per capita grant in her case as from January 1st till the end of the present quarter.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, April 17, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 13th instant, grant will be continued for Gladys Haywahe, No. 0387, until June 30th.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department approves Stanley Sinclair remaining in the Brandon Residential School until the close of the holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 27, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been longer reporting on the pupils who are sixteen years and over than I have expected to be. I have been awaiting answers from some parents.\n\nThe following is the list, given alphabetically, with recommendation in each case that seems best for the pupil from our standpoint:\n\nIvan Ahensakew, No. 448 - A good, strong, healthy young man sent here from Prince Albert by his father, who was becoming somewhat anxious about the boy's moral life. Ivan has improved very much in his attitude, both religiously and morally, is a member of our boys' council, had some desire last year to prepare for the Ministry but decided in favor of a Technical course. Has done well in that course this year. He is very anxious to return and complete his course and his parents are very anxious also that he should and we would strongly recommend it. He is now seventeen.\n\nBetty Bear, No. 0370 - This girl is developing splendidly. She is one of the most trustworthy and promising girls we have in the school. She is eighteen, her people are anxious to have her continue at school, and she wishes to do so. Her case has been the worst trachoma case we have had. Dr. Wall's last visit in the fall revealed a rather discouraging situation but Nurse Thomas, who was here a few days ago, states that there is a decided improvement and she seems on her way to complete recovery. Betty also was a valuable member of the girls' council and we would be glad to have her here for another year.\nJessie Bear, No. 0402 - This girl is now nineteen years of age. She is taking Grade XI, is just a fair student, ambitious to be a nurse, and gives splendid service in the dispensary and hospital ward when there is illness here. She would make a good nurse, is an attractive and promising girl, and wishes to return here for Grade XII, which is required for entrance to a hospital in Saskatchewan and generally in Manitoba. We would think it would be decidedly better for the girl to do this.\n\nFlossie Bear, No. 0434 - This girl is now sixteen. She came here last year from Dundurn. She is receiving decided benefit from the school and should continue.\n\nFrederic Baptist, No. 445 - This boy was sent here three years ago chiefly on account of questionable conduct at home and has done exceedingly well with us. He is eighteen years of age and should be discharged.\n\nAlex Bradburn, No. 382 - This boy is eighteen years of age. He is a good worker, a steady, reliable fellow and gives every promise of making good. He should be discharged.\n\nHazel Bunce, No. 0301 - This girl has developed slowly. Last year she was exceedingly anxious to get away but her attitude this year is quite different. She has no home to go to. She has recently learned conditions as far as her mother is concerned and wishes to stay in the west to get work. We would recommend that she be continued on our list for another year but that employment be secured for her and that she be under our supervision as far as possible. Hazel is now eighteen.\n\nJessie Buffalo, No. 0476 - This girl is now eighteen. She was sent here two years ago as her parents were anxious about her conduct. She has been doing very well. They now want her home and we recommend that she be discharged.\n\nMabel Buffalo, No. 0417 - This girl was sent here chiefly as company for her sister. She will be fifteen in June. The parents would like to have her discharged this year to continue in the public school on the reserve. We would recommend this.\n\nMary Louise Chovin, No. 0267 - This girl has just turned sixteen. She is doing very well and should remain in school.\n\nChista Cochrane, No. 0428 - This girl is sixteen. She is doing very well. She is giving much better\nconduct than was expected of her and should remain in school. She gives promise of being a very good girl, if given a chance.\n\nHelen Cochrane, No. 0265 - This girl is seventeen. She is a very backward, unpromising girl. She has no home to go to. She needs protection. She should remain with us.\n\nHerman Crate, No. 371 - Herman is now seventeen. He is in Grade X. He is one of our very best and most promising boys. He has no home. He is anxious to continue in school. He will benefit from every opportunity given him and will, I am sure, do exceedingly well at anything he may undertake.\n\nLeonard Crate, No. 384 - Leonard is now eighteen. He did well at Technical School this year. He is a promising boy, very willing to work, ambitious to make good, wishes to continue his course, his parents being willing that he should. We will be glad to have him.\n\nMabel Crate, No. 0355 - This girl is now seventeen. She is improving as time goes on. She is a promising girl. She wishes to remain in school and she should do so.\n\nPercy Crate, No. 413 - This boy is now eighteen, naturally mechanical, paints well. He should be discharged this year.\n\nGabriel Crowe, No. 420 - While this boy is on our books as seventeen, he is in every way like a boy of fifteen. He has developed very slowly. He is not very fond of work and should remain in the school.\n\nAgnes Greenbird, No. 0297 - This girl is now twenty years of age. She has been given leave of absence to try herself out in the home of Inspector Hamilton. She is rendering good service. She should be discharged.\n\nFrances Greenbird, No. 0298 - Her father has written asking that both girls be discharged this year. If the home is suitable this, no doubt, would be the best thing to do. She is a fairly bright girl but still needs protection and care. We will be glad to keep her if the Department so directs. Age sixteen.\n\nVera Gray, No. 0414 - Vera is now seventeen. She is now in Grade IX. The father is anxious that she should continue in school but has given no definite expression of desire in regard to returning here with the hope, I believe, that a class will be established by the Department at Sintaluta town for high school pupils from that reserve. Vera is a promising girl and should con-\ntime in school.\n\nArchie Hall, No. 356 - He is sixteen, has grown considerably during the past year, but is very immature and should remain in school.\n\nMarita Hart, No. 0316 - This girl is eighteen. She does not seem to have any home. She is a splendid worker, a bit flighty, very much needs protection and guidance and we feel should be continued in school.\n\nGladys Haywahe, No. 0267 - This girl will complete Grade XI this year and has arrangements to enter St. Boniface Hospital to train as a nurse. She should be discharged.\n\nThelma Hart, No. 0306 - The records here show that this girl is sixteen years of age. She will be seventeen in July. The parents would like to have her discharged. We feel that she would be much better under the control of the school for another year. Before making a final recommendation I would like to consult Mr. Stevens, the Missionary, who will be here at Conference next week. In many ways Thelma is quite a promising girl but needs protection.\n\nElizabeth Haywahe, No. 0397 & Leona Haywahe, No. 0398 - These girls have just turned sixteen. They are quite irresponsible, doing just fairly well at school and should continue with us.\n\nDorothy Haywahe, No. 0404 - This girl is now seventeen. She is in Grade IX. She would like to attend a class in Sintaluta if one is established. She is a promising girl and we think should remain with us.\n\nWallace Haywahe, No. 442 - This boy is sixteen, is undeveloped for his age and should continue in school.\n\nAlfred Hope, No. 315 - This boy is decidedly under his age, in development. He should remain in school.\n\nSelina Ironstar, No. 0415 - This girl is now eighteen. She is a reliable and promising girl. She should be discharged.\n\nJulia Ironstar, No. 0422 - This girl is seventeen, a fair student, needs care and guidance. She should remain in school.\n\nLillie Kahgee, No. 0310 - This girl is now seventeen. She has recovered completely to all appearances from tuberculosis. She is a reliable, resourceful and promising girl, ambitious to be a nurse or to follow some other useful work.\nShould remain in school.\n\nLottie Kahgee, No. 0311 - This girl is now sixteen. She is not as advanced for her age as her sister but a promising girl.\n\nMaggie Kirkness, No. 0440 - This girl is now sixteen. She came last year and should remain with us.\n\nCharlie Littledeer, No. 005 - This boy is seventeen, a fairly good worker, under his age in mental and moral development but has improved considerably. He should remain with us.\n\nLeonard Maness, No. 350 - This boy is sixteen years. He is quite undersize physically, not very reliable and should remain in school.\n\nWilliam Moose, No. 265 - While down as nineteen in our records, he is quite convinced he is only eighteen years of age. He should be discharged this year.\n\nLucy Moses, No. 0308 & Maria Moses, No. 0309 - Twenty and seventeen respectively, from Southampton. Both these girls have improved decidedly this last year and should be discharged.\n\nGordon Murdock, No. 381 - This boy is now eighteen. He has a good home and should be discharged.\n\nHoward Murdock, No. 432 - This boy turned sixteen, is small physically, and quite backward and should continue in school.\n\nEwart Monias, No. 415 - This boy is completing Normal. Should be discharged.\n\nCecil Peters, No. 362 - This boy is sixteen. He has grown well, is just a fair student, immature morally, responds to guidance. He should remain in school.\n\nRosabell Ryder, No. 0377 - This girl is twenty-one years, completing Grade XII. Ambitious and promising, expects to train as a nurse in Yorkton hospital. Should be discharged.\n\nPeter Ryder, No. 430 - This boy is now eighteen. He is doing well at Technical School. He seems quite recovered from threatening tuberculosis. Decidedly ambitious to qualify for a mechanical position. He wishes to complete his Technical course and we are anxious that he should.\nNellie Ryder, No. 0389 - This girl has just turned sixteen, a fair student. She is large physically, easy-going, should remain in school.\n\nHarry Royal, No. 459 - This boy is just sixteen. He came to us last year with not very good promise but has done very well. He should remain in school.\n\nStanley Sinclair, No. 379 - This boy is seventeen years old. He has been doing well lately. Arrangements made with the Department that he should be discharged at the close of holidays this Summer.\n\nMargaret Sinclair, No. 0262 - This girl is sixteen. After a long fight with tuberculous glands this girl seems real well physically, is a bit slow at school, needs protection and guidance. She should remain in school.\n\nWilliam Sinclair, No. 360 - This boy is now seventeen. He is backward at school but a good mechanic. His father desires him home. His discharge is recommended.\n\nElijah Sinclair, No. 444 - This boy is now seventeen. He has developed well during the past year. He should remain in school.\n\nGeorge Spence, No. 354 - While this boy is on our books as eighteen, he is quite sure himself that he is only seventeen years of age. His development would indicate that he is even younger. He is developing better lately, can take more responsibility and desires to remain in school and we think it is much better that he should. A man, Robbie Spence, at Nelson House, has written the agent, stating that George is his boy and he wants him home. It would seem, however, that George's father has been dead for some time and, while this man may be a relative, George states that he has no claim upon him and does not wish to go to his home. He would like to remain here another year and then get work on a farm. This meets with our approval.\n\nSusan Spence, No. 0316 - This girl is seventeen, somewhat backward girl, improving as time goes on, does not seem to have a home to go to and we think should remain here.\n\nAlbert Thompson, No. 345 - This is a bright, promising lad but quite below his years in development. He has no home and should remain in school. He is sixteen now.\n\nKenneth Thompson, No. 443 - This boy is sixteen is not more than ten or twelve in mental development and attitude. He should remain in school.\n\nMarjorie Thompson, No. 0425 - This girl is sixteen, a rather promising girl and should remain in school.\nRodney Thomas, No. 433 - This boy is just sixteen, a fair student and fairly promising. He should remain in school.\n\nViolet Walker, No. 0407 - This girl is seventeen, strong, healthy girl, full of life, needs care and guidance. Should remain in school.\n\nMary Wabideeska, No. 0344 - This girl does not seem to have a home where she can be cared for. Her conduct during the holidays three years ago was not good. Though she is eighteen she very much needs the protection of the school and we recommend that she remain.\n\nxxx Alvin Anthony, No. 340 - This boy is a good student and a good mechanic, careful and dependable in looking after stock, somewhat immature for his age, but in all a promising boy. He should remain in school.\n\nYou will note from the above that we have definitely recommended the discharge of sixteen pupils.\n\nAwaiting your direction,\n\nI am,\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A.

This Department has not considered making any such arrangement, and I would appreciate your advising from whom you received this information.\n\nIt is noted that Agnes Greenbird is now employed by Mr. Inspector Hamilton. I believe, however, that if we send Frances Greenbird home the father will also expect Agnes to go. I am writing to the Indian Agent regarding these two girls, and you will be further advised when his reply is received.\n\nThe Department agrees that Lucy Moses, No. 0308, and Maria Moses, No. 0309, should be discharged, but when we wrote the Indian Agent last year he informed us that he was not aware of any home to which they could be sent. However, I am writing him again to see if arrangements can be made this year for placing them. Would it be possible to secure employment for them near Brandon?\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

It is not possible to secure employment for them near Brandon, and I would, therefore, request that you make additional enquiries with a view to securing homes for these girls and advise the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Robertson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill, Ont.\nOttawa, June 3rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of May 18th, 1935, and your reply of May 27th, with reference to Agnes and Frances Greenbird, daughters of Lazarus Greenbird of Walpole Island.\n\nThe Principal of the Brandon Residential School states that both these girls should be discharged at the end of June. The older girl, Agnes Greenbird, has secured a position with Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man., and is doing well. It is not possible for the Principal to secure a position in the West for Frances Greenbird.\n\nPlease let me know if you consider it would be advisable to send Frances Greenbird home. It is felt that it would be inadvisable to return Agnes Greenbird to the reserve, in view of the fact that she holds a position at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

Doyle, Principal of the Indian Residential School, Brandon, he states that \"During the past few years the Department has laid down the rule that parents receiving their children home for holidays must pay at least half their expenses\".\n\nI would be glad if you would send me a copy of this ruling for my files.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Booth,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 5, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are getting definite arrangements made in regard to pupils' holidays. The number will be approximately the same as last year and the expense very similar. Would appreciate the information as to what we may expect from the Department in this connection. Last year we had $300.00 covering holiday transportation expenses and transportation for graduates and incoming pupils, apart from those going to Ontario. As you know, our financial need is greater than last year.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\n\nJAD/W\nOttawa, June 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, the Department allows the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School a specified amount to cover the cost of transporting pupils to and from the school. If the transportation expenses exceed the amount allowed by the Department, the school management has to provide the difference.\n\nWith the per capita grant reduced, the Brandon School is having a difficult time to operate without a deficit and, consequently, in order to assist them in keeping down expenses, the Department expects Indian agents to cooperate with the Principal by arranging with the parents to either go to the school for the children and return them without cost to the school management, or to arrange with the Indians to provide a part, if not all of the cost of the transportation of their children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nFrank Booth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuscow, Sask.\nOttawa, June 10, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has carefully considered your letter of the 5th instant, but as you have previously been informed, our Appropriation this year has been again reduced and, therefore, we cannot allow more than last year for travelling expenses of pupils to and from the Brandon Indian Residential School this year.\n\nThe Department will pay transportation expenses to an amount not exceeding $300. If it is decided later to return any children to Ontario the cost of their transportation will not be included in the amount just mentioned.\n\nYou should enlist the cooperation of the Indian agents, with a view to having them arrange for the parents to either come for their children or, in the case of those pupils allowed home on holidays, to provide as much of the cost as possible.\n\nChildren should not be sent home unless you feel assured that home conditions are suitable. Pupils residing at a long distance from the school should not be allowed holidays in view of the expenses involved in sending them home.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nENC.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 8, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary - 4.\n\nIf it is your opinion that Lucy's graduation should be deferred for another year and also Maria's we would be glad to keep her in the school and keep her employed continuously if possible. She would then have a home to come to. But if you deem it advisable that she should be discharged, kindly forward her diploma with the others.\n\nWe are planning to have some graduation exercises on Sunday evening, June 21st, and would appreciate it if the diplomas could be here before that date.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A.

Dr. Wall\nhas been here since my letter to you of May 27th and\nis greatly pleased with the progress being made in\nher case. She was altogether the worst case we have\nhad in the school and would certainly have gone blind\nhad she not had this treatment. It seems now that\npermanent recovery is in prospect.\n\nIn regard to the seven in paragraph\nfour listed for further consideration I beg to report\nas follows:-\n\nGeorge Spence, No. 354.

Here also I have had no opportunity for further light and in this case can consult the missionary when he is here. But, knowing her as we do, I would very much dislike having her sent back to the reserve without some provision being made for her care and protection.

When the day school teacher, Miss Hodgson, was here at Easter time I asked her if there was any prospect of such a class being organized. She had, she said, no definite information but that the parents were agitating for such a class and that they had hopes of it being established. Her conversation indicated that she did not think it would be a wise step to take for the welfare of the girls concerned. Both these girls are promising and we would like to see them continue in school. If, however, you decide that they should be discharged this year, kindly include diplomas for them.\n\nIn regard to Agnes Greenbird, I learned from Inspector Hamilton the other day that she desires to go East this summer at least for a visit, so if it is thought desirable that Frances should be discharged she would go East with Agnes. Their diplomas, if both are to be discharged, should be included.\n\nIn regard to Lucy Moses, No. 0308 and Maria Moses, No. 0309, if there is not a suitable home in which they could be cared for on their reserve I would think it better that they should remain here. We have been securing temporary employment for Lucy with Mrs. Dr. Buckley, on the Experimental Farm, to train her in domestic service, she remaining here at night, and we could get employment for her. Maria would be more difficult to place. If she does not go East she should remain in the school, I would think, for at least part of the year and we could try her out as we have been doing with Lucy with the hope that she might develop into a useful and reliable girl. She leaves a good deal to be desired in this regard.\n0306 - Thelma Harlow\n0344 - Mary Wabidoeskaw\n0298 - Frances Greenbird\n0297 - Agnes\n\nJune 21, 36\nOttawa, June 16th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the honourable discharge certificates requested are going forward under separate cover.\n\nThe discharge of Thelma Hart - No. 0306; and Mary Wabidweska - No. 0344; from the Brandon Indian Residential School is approved.\n\nCertificates of honourable discharge are also being forwarded to you for Frances and Agnes Greenbird, but they should not be sent home until you hear further from us.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 9, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFrom time to time I have received intimations in letters from the Department in regard to children's holidays that the parents should be induced to pay at least part of the cost of transportation. I have been endeavoring as diplomatically as possible to bring these suggestions into effect. Most of the parents are responding very satisfactorily but the parents at Sintaluta have not remitted anything in this connection. Last summer was the first year that I definitely asked them to pay a dollar apiece to cover the cost of operating our van by which we transport them one way. I have written them this year stating that the amount for last year, $1.00 per child, and the same for this year would require to be in my hands before the children left the school. I have received remittance from one family but another letter from another father states that the parents were protesting to the Department at Ottawa against this requirement. I am now writing for your direction as to whether I should send forward the children of parents who refuse to pay this amount or retain them in the school during the holidays. One letter states that they will send a truck and bring the children home on their own account. This, however, does not meet the demand for last year. Your direction and authority in this matter will be greatly appreciated. I would also appreciate an early reply.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\n\nJAL/W\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to refer to Department letter NO. I33-0-10, dated June 3rd, regarding Lucy and Maria Moses who should be discharged from the Brandon Indian Residential School this year.\n\nI beg to say, the only relative these girls have on the reserve is an uncle, George Nawash, the girls could make their home with him for the present and it may be possible for them to secure employment. As it is impossible to secure employment near Brandon I would advise returning them to the reserve and I will assist them in securing homes or employment.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nWalpole Island Ont., June 15th 1936,\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant file 133-0-10 in reference to Francis and Agnes Greenbird daughters of Lazarus Greenbird, I would beg to say that last year Mr. Greenbird had hoped to have the two girls home together as he lives in rather lonely part of the reserve. But as Agnes has a permanent position and is of age, he see no reason why she should not be allowed to do as she see best.\n\nMr. Greenbird is quite a responsible and reliable Indian, and is living alone and could use Francis at home. Mr. Greenbird also operates an Indian handicraft and souvenir store at Tashoom Park during the summer months, and could use both girls here, but the other 9 or 10 Month Agnes would not like have any position.\n\nMr. Greenbird is quite willing for Francis to come home, but I do think he would have any objection to Francis staying at the school if it was thought advisable, for another year.\n\nPersonally I always feel that the longer the girls can stay at the residential school the better, up to the age of 18 at least. In the present case I think Agnes would be well advised to remain with her position, in Winnipeg, while probably Francis would be better at school, her father home her would be better than the majority of Indian homes.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent,\nMONTHLY MEETING OF THE SARNIA COUNCIL HELD ON JUNE, 6/36.\n\nMoved by Chief Plain seconded by Alfred Rodd that this Council approve of the request of Wm.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, June 22nd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to Minute of Council of the Sarnia Band regarding Leonard Maness and Hazel Bunce. In your letter, you mention that the Council wishes these two pupils to go home for holidays. We are not prepared to consider allowing the expense that would be involved in carrying out their wishes in this regard.\n\nWe have recently received the following reports from the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School regarding these two pupils:-\n\nHazel Bunce - This girl has developed slowly. Last year she was exceedingly anxious to get away but her attitude this year is quite different. She has no home to go to. She has recently learned conditions as far as her mother is concerned and wishes to stay in the West to get work. We would recommend that she be continued on our list for another year but that employment be secured for her and that she be under our supervision as far as possible. Hazel is now eighteen.\n\nLeonard Maness - This boy is sixteen years. He is quite undersize physically; not very reliable and should remain in school.\n\nIn view of the Principal's report, the Department considers it in the best interests of these children to remain at the Brandon School for another year. However, you might let me know if the uncle, Wm. E. Jacobs, has a suitable home. If so, we are prepared to consider discharging these children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. C. Trenouth, Esq.,\nIn charge - Indian Office,\nSARNIA, ONT.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 22nd, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, the Indian Agent at the Saugeen Reserve advises that Lucy and Maria Moses may be sent home. You may, therefore, arrange for sending these children to Southampton, Ontario. Payment of their transportation will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate. You should keep the expenses as low as possible.\n\nPlease advise D. Robertson, Indian Agent, Chippewa Hill, Ont., regarding the date and time of the girls' arrival in Southampton, in order that he can meet them.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Walpole Island considers that, as Agnes Greenbird has a position, she should retain it because, while her father has a reasonably satisfactory home, it will be difficult for her to obtain work. However, if she does not wish to keep her present position, you may send both the girls home. In any case, Frances should be sent home.\n\nTickets should be purchased for these girls to Wallaceburg, Ontario, and A. Highfield, Indian Agent, Walpole Island, Ont., should be advised of the date and time of their arrival in Wallaceburg in order that he may meet them. Payment of their transportation will also be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate.\n\nFor your information, I may say that the four girls can travel together to Toronto, Ont., at which point they will separate - two going to Southampton and the other two to Wallaceburg.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland.\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J.A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBRANDON, MAN.\nOttawa, June 22nd, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of today's date regarding certain children who are being returned to Ontario from the Brandon Indian Residential School, I may say that there is a possibility that homes can be found on the Sarnia Reserve for Hazel Bunce and Leonard Maness. Under these circumstances, the Ontario children should not be sent home until you hear further from me as, in the event of the two children mentioned above being returned, all of them can be sent at the same time.\n\nWhen I am writing you about them, I will, also, enclose transport requisitions, which will enable you to secure the necessary tickets without making any expenditure of cash.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D. D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., June 29th 1936\n\nThe SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe- Agnes Greenbird No. 0297 and Frances Greenbird No. 0298. Inspector Hamilton brought Agnes to the School yesterday and owing to change in his plans they will not be able to keep a girl in the home for some weeks. Agnes came in this morning to tell me that she had definitely decided not to go East but with her father's consent she is remaining expecting to get employment either with Inspector Hamilton or in some other home. Her services are very satisfactory and she will no doubt be able to get work.\n\nThis change of plan on the part of Agnes complicates matters as far as Frances is concerned. Frances is barely sixteen and is under-size and immature for her age, is a bright girl but very much needs protection and guidance; she should remain in school and I do not think the father would wish her to be returned East unless Agnes was with her.\n\nOur graduation exercises have been deferred until Wednesday evening the 24th and I would appreciate it very much if you would send a wire at my expense directing me in regard to Frances. Agnes and also those who know Agnes best are very much of the opinion that she should remain in school for at least another year.\n\nAwaiting your direction,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, June 24th, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the Greenbird girls. The Department wrote you regarding these girls in official letter of the 22nd instant, and you have, no doubt, received our letter by this time.\n\nWe have had considerable difficulty in the last two or three years to place the children from Ontario who were sent to the Brandon School several years ago and, therefore, when suitable homes are available, the Department considers it advisable to return these pupils. If such action is delayed it might be much more difficult to find homes next year.\n\nI note that Frances Greenbird has expressed a desire to remain in the West, as she can obtain employment. This attitude does her credit, but in the event of her obtaining a position in which her services proved unsatisfactory, or if she became ill, she would again expect the Brandon School to make provision for her maintenance. Taking these matters into consideration, it is felt that, as the father is now willing to assume responsibility for the two girls, they should be returned to Walpole Island.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nF.133-0-10;\nJune,22nd,1936.\n\nSir:- Re:- Hazel Bunce,and Leonard Maness,pupils at Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Sarnia Council passed a minute requesting that these pupils be allowed to come home for the holidays at the request of their Uncle,Wm.E.Jacobs. What they really intended was that the children be discharged at Summer Holidays and sent to the home of Wm.E.Jacobs here.\n\nW.E.Jacobs their Uncle,who raised the children states that Hazel Bunce will be 21 years of age on her next birthday,and that Leonard Maness,will be 18 years of age,next birthday. He states he has a good home,for them and asks that they be discharged and sent here this summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Dr. Doyle, the Principal, and he stated that there must be some mistake regarding the age of this girl.\n\nI therefore looked up the annuity books and it appears that she was born on Jan. 3rd, 1932. She is therefore 4 years and eight months old.\n\nThis family was sent to school as the mother was dead. The children were young and the father could not look after them and at the same time earn his living by trapping. I would therefore ask you to re-consider your decision regarding admitting her; as if she is sent back from school, it will be a very long journey for such a young child to travel alone and I would have difficulty in having her taken care of when she reached the Reserve.\n\nIf you decide that this child can be admitted, I will forward the admission form.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn view of the explanation contained in your letter of the 26th ultimo, you may inform the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School that the admission of Christina Mear is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

She seems to us in every way like a child of five, weighs 43 lbs., three pounds more than Alice Bonnar. I understand, also, that the home conditions are such that it made it necessary that these children be cared for.\n\nWill you kindly let me know what should be done under the circumstances. It may be that, after further consideration, you will deem it advisable that her admission should be approved from the date that she came and, if not, should we retain her here at our expense until some definite date when she would become a revenue bearing pupil. The cost of returning her to the reserve is very high. I will be glad to have your instructions as to what should be done under the circumstances.\n\nI am,\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle,\nRev.

Sutherland,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nOn Sunday last we had a visit from the Principal of the Lebret School and an accompanying priest. After supper, and just before leaving, the Principal mentioned that Denis Wasna, of the Sintaluta Reserve, had approached him in regard to having his children transferred from the Brandon School to the Lebret School. The children are, Violet, Hazel, Mary and Catherine Walker, numbered in the same order as, 0407, 0408, 0409, 0437. As I stated to the Principal, it is my opinion that Denis Wasna is not making this request on account of religious conviction and that I did not think that it would be in the interests of this family in particular or of residential school work in general that such requests as his should be granted.\n\nI might say that these girls seem to be getting along usually well in school and that as far as we know they are quite happy and have no desire to change. The third of these four girls has a kleptomaniac tendency which seems to be lessening as time goes on. Mr. Indian Agent Booth can give you further particulars in regard to the family. I felt it only fair that you should have this personal and confidential word.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\n\nJAD/W\nOttawa, September 28, 1936.\n\nDear Dr. Doyle:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the request made you by the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask., for the transfer of four pupils from the Brandon Indian Residential School to the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, viz., Violet, Hazel, Mary and Catherine Walker.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the first three named have been in the Brandon School since August, 1933, and the last named since August, 1935. It is not the policy of the Department to transfer pupils from one residential school to another on religious grounds, and the Department could not favourably consider any request that might be received for the transfer of these girls from the Brandon School to a school conducted under Catholic auspices.\n\nWe have not received any request from Mr. Agent Booth for the transfer of these girls, and the Department is writing to him along the lines stated above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, September 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School in which he states that, on the occasion of a visit from the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, a request was made for the transfer of Violet, Hazel, Mary and Catherine Walker to the Qu'Appelle School.\n\nThe first three named girls were admitted to the Brandon School in August, 1933, and the last named in August, 1935. It is not the policy of the Department to transfer pupils who have been regularly admitted from one residential school to another on religious grounds. Should any request be made to you by the parents of the children or the Principal, you may inform them that the Department could not favourably consider the transfer of these four girls.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. Booth, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSintaluta, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, No. 133-0-10, in connection with William Bryant, formerly pupil No. 141 of the File Hills Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this boy was sent to the Brandon School on very short notice, pending some arrangements being made, of a permanent nature, later. The boy's parents are separated and he was living wherever he could find a bed and meal, during the summer holidays, and no one was taking any interest in him. He came to me two days before Doctor Doyle's visit and asked me if he could continue his education at the Brandon School and go to the school when Doctor Doyle came to get another boy, Walter Baldhead, who is continuing his studies at that school. There was no time to make proper arrangements, consequently, when Doctor Doyle came, I explained the circumstances to him, informing him that I had been unable to get in touch with the boy's father, who was away from the reserve at the time, and had not had time to make arrangements through the Department. Doctor Doyle therefore decided that he would take the boy back to the school with him in the car, and await instructions. He also understood that, if the Department did not approve of the admission of the boy to the Brandon School, he would have to be returned to his reserve.\n\nI have since seen the father, Alfred Bryant, of the Cote Band, and he approves of the boy continuing his education and staying away from the reserve, to keep him out of bad company, and I think it would be advisable in this case, as he seems unusually ambitious and there is certainly nothing for him on the reserve and no home fit for a young person to live in. As you know, I am not very much in favour of forcing higher education upon a young Indian against his will, but this boy begged to be given a chance, and I believe his intentions are good.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the admission of William Bryant, an ex-pupil of the File Hills Indian Residential School, to the Brandon Residential School. I have to inform you that, in view of the circumstances in his case, the Department will approve of his admission for the present academic year only, and the Principal of the Brandon School is being informed accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamsack, Sask.\nOttawa, September 26, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the admission of William Bryant, of the Kamsack Reserve, an ex-pupil of the File Hills Indian Residential School, to the Brandon Indian Residential School, I have to say that a communication has been received from Mr. Agent Ostrander, Kamsack, setting forth the reasons for requesting his admission to your school.\n\nIn view of the circumstances in his case, the Department will agree to his admission to the Brandon School during the present academic year. It is noted that he is desirous of taking the technical course in automotive mechanics at the school. However, in view of his age, it is considered that he should be discharged at the end of the above period and, in applying for discharges at the end of the school year, you should include his name.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Oct. 8, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Quarterly Returns for the September quarter, together with list of admissions and discharges.\n\nThe only admission for which approval has not been received is that of Lawrence Spence, #471. During holidays Mr. Indian Agent Clarke wrote me that the parents of Lawrence were anxious to have this boy attend school here and also that they wanted their youngest boy, Felix, #470, home for the coming year. Mr. Clarke recommended this change but I just learned a few days ago that application for admission for Lawrence was not made. I have had him examined and the forms have gone forward to the Agent for signatures and to be forwarded to your office.\n\nYou will further notice that Cecil Peters, #362, and Thomas Linklater, #366, are reported absent. A misdemeanor occurred in the school during the week-end of September 20th. When it was discovered five of the boys concerned left but three of them returned after a day's absence. The other two boys, named above, are still away. It is our opinion that Cecil has got by Winnipeg and is likely in Ontario by now. This boy is over sixteen years of age, is a big, strong boy and can make his way. If he is East, we would not think it advisable that the expense of bringing him back should be incurred. I will report later in regard to both these boys. The Mounted Police have the matter in hand.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, October 14, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing the September quarter return of the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nNo application or certificate of health has yet been received for Lawrence Spence - No. 471. Please communicate with the Indian Agent and have him forward the necessary form.\n\nThe name of Helen Black - No. 0254, was shown on the June quarter return but does not appear on the September quarter return, although no application has been received for her discharge. Please advise regarding this girl.\n\nIn preparing the return, I would point out that the grade of each pupil should be shown and that all columns should be correctly totalled. Please arrange to have this done on future returns.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.

She was then at Hoosier, Saskatchewan, but soon after unexpectedly returned to Brandon. We secured work for her with Mrs. Dr. Buckley, at the Experimental Farm, but in November she took ill. We took her into the school and by your authority placed her on our per capita earning list. Then after correspondence we sent her forward to the File Hills Hospital on March 19, 1936. This was by authority of your letter, February 20, 1936, #133-0-10. Helen made a good recovery and I understand is now employed in the New Hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nWe dropped her name from the list in our last returns on account of the temporary nature of her recent residence with us.\n\nI am, Yours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., Oct. 20, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn October 8th I wrote you concerning the truancy of Cecil Peters, #352, and Thomas Linklater, #266. No word has come to us in regard to Cecil Peters but this morning a couple of letters received by boys here from Thomas reveal that he had reached Ontario, worked for a couple of weeks on a farm and when writing the letter, October 11th, was employed at Westboro, Ontario, six miles from Ottawa with a man who had a store and a small farm. He said he milked one Jersey cow, fed a few pigs, etc. He stated that he was not returning to his home at Wabowden for some time.\n\nSince these boys have gone, others have run away. When Cecil and Tommy were not brought back they seemed to feel that the matter was not taken very seriously. In conversation with some of the senior boys I find also that they have a notion that if they get to Ontario they will not be brought back. We have had wonderful Indian Summer weather and have been observing quarantine regulations on account of the prevalence of infantile paralysis in the district. We feel that it is exceedingly urgent and essential for the discipline of our school and also for the good of the boy himself that Thomas be returned. The Mounted Police here have had the matter in hand and in conversation with them this morning it was decided that I should write you at once for authority to have this boy brought back.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle.\nOttawa, October 28, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department does not consider it advisable to return Cecil Peters, No. 362, to the Brandon Indian Residential School, owing to the expense that would be involved. He should be considered discharged from the Brandon School.\n\nIf Thomas Linklater, No. 366, is located and is within reasonable distance of the Brandon School, you may arrange with the R.C.M.P. to have him returned to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I might say that under date of September 21st, 1935, I have a letter from Mr. McPherson, or his clerk rather, stating that the Department had approved of the admission of Allan Sanderson to the Brandon School.\n\nI am exceedingly sorry that some serious error has occurred in the returns recently sent forward. I have gone over our copy carefully and the only error I can find is that the 27 days for Mary Taypotat, #0464, on page 4 were not included in the adding of that column of figures.

You will observe that, in the case of a number of the boys, the total number of days they were in residence during the quarter has not been filled in. If these boys were in residence during any part of the quarter, you should fill in opposite their names the exact number of days each was present.\n\nYou will, also, note our calculation of the aggregate attendance written in pencil. We had no choice but to pay the grant for the number of days as shown by the return. When you amend same, you should send it back to the Department and any further balance of grant due will then be paid.\n\nI regret that we overlooked the application and certificate of health for Allan Sanderson - pupil No. 475.

Clarke, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHodgson, Man.\nRe: Alex POLL (Indian) Juvenile Delinquent. Theft of Mail - Oxbow district, Saskatchewan.\n\nRelative to the above, W.A. Staples, farmer, Oxbow district, got in L.D. telephonic communication with the writer at 10 a.m., this date, he stating:\n\n\"My neighbour, Wilfred ROWLEY, brought out my mail from Oxbow last night, leaving it at the north-west corner of my farm, but when I went for it this morning, I could not find it, and I am sure that it has been stolen and would like to have the matter investigated.\"\n\nI left at 10.30 a.m., per auto hired livery and patrolled to Glen Ewen, where I was informed that an Indian lad had walked into the Village that morning from the west, about half-an-hour before my arrival.\n\nI located this lad in the hotel, where he was eating a meal, and he gave his name as \"Billy POLL\" and that he had walked from the Indian Reserve at Broadview, where he had been staying with his uncle Andrew ALEXSON, since 1935, and he had left the Reserve in the a.m., of the 6th instant, and he was not in possession of any identification. In his possession he had a catalogue and a copy of the \"Producer\" newspaper, addressed to W.A. Staples, Oxbow. On questioning him, he admitted that he had taken a bundle of mail, which he had found on the top of a corner fence post, N.W., of Glen Ewen, and he had left the balance of the mail in a granary where he had spent the night.\n\nThis lad took me to the granary where he had slept the night previous, and I found three copies of the Free Press, a Pictorial Review and the Oxbow Herald, all addressed to W.A. Staples. He stated that there were four letters in the bundle of mail, which he claimed he had taken at the foot of the fence post where he had taken the mail. I continued my patrol to the corner where this mail had been left by Wilfred ROWLEY, where I was met by W.A. STAPLES and Wilfred ROWLEY, but no letters could be found so I questioned this lad further and he finally admitted that he had opened the letters this a.m., and threw them away between highway No.18 and the railroad track, where I patrolled to and found the four letters, they just being circular letters, and Wilfred ROWLEY stated that he was sure that there were no letters of importance in the bundle of mail he had brought out from Oxbow for Mr. Staples.\n\nI am satisfied that all the mail was recovered, which I handed over to W.A. Staples, and he stated that he would not prefer any charges in the matter, being as the culprit was an Indian and just a lad.\n\nI escorted this lad to Glen Ewen and got in L.D. telephonic communication with our Broadview Detachment, but failed to receive any information in regards to this lad and he was not known to Mr. McKenzie, the Indian Agent, in Charge of the Reserve at Broadview.\n\nFile numbers must be quoted\n\nContinued on Sheet 2\nActing on your telephonic instructions, I detained the above named and escorted him to Carnduff and he stated as follows:\n\n\"I was born on Aug. 7th, 1920 at or near Dunseth, N.D. My father is dead, he died about four years ago on the Turtle-Mountain Reserve, near Dunseth. I belong to the Indian Reserve in the Turtle Mountains, North Dakota. My Mother got married again about two years ago to an Indian by the name of Louis DESCHANT or DESCHAMP. My step-father took me to the Indian Reserve near Broadview in September 1935, and left me with my Uncle, Andrew ALEXSON, who is parted from his wife, but living with another Indian woman. Mr. McKenzie is the Agent on the reserve, but I never saw him. I helped my uncle to do some work on the farm and I got along good with him and he was kind to me. I wanted to see my Mother, who is now living on the Turtle Mountain Reserve, so I left the Broadview reserve on Saturday morning last, to walk to Dunseth. My Uncle gave me some food to eat on the way, but I finished it last night. I slept in granaries coming down. I got to Manor yesterday afternoon and kept on coming south. When I was some distance from Manor, I came across some mail on top of a fence post, which I took, so as to have something to read, and took it to a granary about one mile south, where I stayed for the night. It was mostly newspapers. The letters I opened and threw them away as I am an U.S. Indian and I never lived in Canada before my step-father brought me here. I have no identification card and the Indian Agent at Broadview did not know that I was leaving, but my Uncle said that he would notify Mr. McKenzie that I had left. When we entered Canada, we came through Northgate, we were travelling in a car, just my step-father reported when we entered Canada. He and my Mother stayed only three days in Canada and they then returned to the States. I have never heard from my Mother or Step-father since they left me in Canada, and I have never written to them. I can read and write, I went to school in the States reaching the sixth grade. I have never been in trouble before. I have three sisters and two brothers younger than myself.\"\n\nI got in telephonic communication with the Canadian Immigration at Northgate, Sask., but they had no record of the DESCHANT or DESCHAMP family entering Canada in 1935 and neither did the American Immigration Office at Northgate, N.D.\n\nI also got in telephonic communication with Mr. McKenzie, Indian Agent at Broadview, Sask., but he had no knowledge of this boy being on the reserve at Broadview, and he was positive that he could not possibly have been there since 1935, but there was an Indian by the name of Andrew ALEXSON, who was living with another woman, being separated from his wife, whom he would interview in regards to the above named.\n\nI still continued to question this lad and on the 11th, inst., he finally admitted that his name was Alex POLL and that he had run away from the White Bear reserve, near Carlyle, and he had been adopted, and he wanted to go and see his Mother at Dunseth.\n\nI got in telephonic communication with Mr. Morrison, Farm Instructor on the White Bear Reserve, and he stated that he was looking for Alex POLL, an Indian lad 14 years of age, who had run away from the reserve during the night of the 7th, and 8th, inst., and I informed Mr. Morrison that I had this lad in my custody.\n\nI had a telephone message from Mr. Morrison on the 12th, inst., who requested that I escort this lad to the Indian School at Brandon, Manitoba, he having received these instructions from Mr. McKenzie at Broadview and I informed Mr. Morrison that any instructions in regards to me escorting this lad would have to come through my Officer Commanding at Weyburn, and Mr. Morrison stated that he would take it up further with Mr. McKenzie.\n\nContinued on Sheet 3\nActing on your telephonic instructions in the a.m., of the 13th instant, and my telephone message in the a.m. of the 14th instant, I escorted the above named to the Indian School, Brandon, Manitoba, where I handed him over to the Matron in charge, together with some clothes which had been donated to him by some citizens of Carnduff, via private auto, on the 14th instant, but I am only charging mileage in lieu of railroad fare, which amounts to $6.50, being as I will be engaged on other police duties this week, there being no train service from this point to Brandon on a Sunday, and to use train service, it would take two full days.\n\nI might state, that when I picked up the above named, the clothes he was wearing were very ragged and dirty and he himself was filthy, so I gave him a bath and was successful in obtaining for him a change of clothes from a few of the citizens of Carnduff, and I burnt his old clothes. I did not keep him in the cell, but he slept on a cot in a spare room at these Detachment quarters.\n\nThe following is a list of expenses incurred in picking up the above named, holding him at Carnduff and escorting him to the Indian School at Brandon, Manitoba:\n\nMarch 9.\nAuto Livery - Carnduff to Glen Raven and Oxbow district and return 40 miles @ 20\u00a2 ..... $8.00.\nMeal - Cst.

Sir: Forwarded. I took this matter up direct with the Indian Department office at Regina, and an effort was made to ascertain the antecedents of this boy, from the United States authorities. The Indian Department office advised me that they were unable to obtain any information in regard to him and requested that we would hold him pending their ascertaining where he came from. Inquiries were also continued at Carnduff, and as will be noted, information was eventually obtained through a friend from the White Bear Reserve at Carlyle. On request of the E.A.F.R. McKenzie, this boy was escorted to the Reside at Brandon. The Indian Department office advised me that I would be responsible for all expenses in regard to this. I have instructed Cst. Thrussell to submit voucher etc.\n\nHANDED OVER TO DEPARTMENT CONCERNED\n\n16-3-37\nK/D/JWM\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am not able to locate any correspondence on our file regarding this boy and I would appreciate having an immediate report from you in connection with him.

The Indian School has been kept in touch with regarding any information they might have received in this respect, but they have had no word regarding the whereabouts of this boy.\n\n(2) As it is quite evident he has left this district, there is nothing more that can be done at this detachment in the line of inquiries as when this boy left this area, he was lost touch of until he showed up around Regent and Deloraine districts when a report was submitted from Deloraine detachment. This was the last that was heard or seen of MALLET. At that time it was thought that he had gone into the U.S.\n\n(3) No report has been received by Dr. DOYLE of the Indian School at Brandon regarding this boy from any source although he has made many inquiries through the children of the school, and other Indians coming from different parts of the Province whom he has been in contact with. Also from different Indian Agents whom he has corresponded with, there has been no report. It would therefore appear that MALLET has not gone to his home and has succeeded in keeping away from other Indians in the Province that come to Brandon and district. This might lead to believing that the boy did make his way into the United States.\n\n(4) Under the circumstances there does not appear to be much that can be done at this point and should MALLET be located and Dr. DOYLE informed other than through this Force he will notify this detachment.

If he failed to secure this standing it was tentatively understood that he would not continue in school here. He failed in four and a half subjects, and notwithstanding the definite arrangements we made with him he came back with the other pupils and asked that his case be reconsidered. He saved $12.00 out of what he earned this summer and has handed that over to me and has now secured a short period of work on a farm and states that he can make up $25.00, including this $12.00, toward his fees for this coming year. I talked to the Principal of the Collegiate concerning him. He considers Walter a bright and promising student, thinks he did not apply himself as diligently as he might have done. I told Walter I would write you and await your decision as to whether he should be continued in school or dropped entirely from our list.\n\nI might say that we are filled to the limit of our pupilage but will be willing to carry Walter as another extra pupil if the Department thinks he should go on.\n\nHe is a bright likeable chap, fairly ambitious, and I think if given this opportunity will de-\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Mines & Resources.\n\nvote himself more faithfully to his studies than he has in the past.\n\nAwaiting your direction, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Since then I have been exceedingly busy getting pupils back from holidays, and I have been unable to write you until today.\n\nThree of the Sammy children have been with us for the past two years as pupils. When I went to Carlyle the other day Mr. Morrison laid the case before me of the two younger children, hoping that we could take them. I of course objected on account of their age, Thelma is four years old and Kenneth three, and on this account I phoned you.\n\nChester Ewalk and his wife had taken all five children after the death of the mother and grandparents. He felt however that he could not continue to care for them, and no other home on the Reserve seemed either able or willing to undertake it, so we brought them with us. We have our full quota of pupils without these children, and unless the Department would care to regard them as supernumerary, we would be keeping them without cost to the Department until some other pupils would be discharged.\n\nAwaiting the direction of the Department in the matter, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Principal of the Indian residential school at Lebret, requesting that Florence Sammy, No. 0480, Priscilla Sammy, No. 0481, and Richard Sammy, No. 490, be transferred to the Lebret school on account of a request made by the father who is now on trial for murder. His request also included that the two younger children who are with us be returned to his parents. I have written the Rev. Father stating that we will be glad to comply with the Department's wish in this matter and would be pleased if an early decision in the matter was reached as we have now more pupils enrolled than we should have.\"\n\nThe application forms for Florence and Priscilla Sammy were forwarded to the Department in August, 1937, and were approved by Mr. E.A.W.R. McKenzie, Indian Agent. The form stated that the children were Protestants.\n\nFrom the contents of Dr. Doyle's letter it might be inferred that the children should have been recognized as Roman Catholics.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would make immediate inquiries with a view to definitely ascertaining whether the Sammy children should be educated under Protestant or Roman Catholic auspices. If the father has always been recognized as a Protestant the Department does not see any reason why the children should be placed in the Qu'Appelle school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 29, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant with reference to the Sammy children. I am communicating with Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, and as soon as his reply is received you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Doyle, Brandon School,\nre Sammy Children.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of the above letter I wrote our Agent at Broadview, also J. R. Morrison, our Farming Instructor at White Bear, for information.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from W.J.B. Hall, Clerk-in-Charge at Broadview, in which he states, \"I understand that these children were originally at the request of the father admitted to Protestant school and that he was recognized as a Protestant.\" He goes on to say, \"I may say that the early part of this week one of the Priests of the Qu'Appelle School was at this office and mentioned the matter to me and said that Nelson Sammy had asked him to take these children but as long as they were well provided for he was not concerned any further and now that they were at Brandon it would be quite satisfactory to them.\"\n\nMr. J. R. Morrison, Farming Instructor, replied as follows:\n\"Re Nelson Sammy family now in Brandon School. Children namely Florence, Priscilla and Richard were admitted to Brandon School at their Father's own request. The two younger needed care and as Nelson Sammy's parents are destitute and morally unfit to care for them they went along with their sisters and brother to Brandon. I do not think the Father and Mother had any religious ties although both of them attended Protestant Schools, namely File Hills and Brandon.\"\n\nI have not made a special trip to White Bear to go into this matter but will do so if you consider the information contained herein is not definite enough.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Dr. Doyle points out that in accepting these children he expects to be allowed supernumerary grant for them.\n\nCases such as this occur at frequent intervals and I believe it would be advisable for you to discuss the matter with the Principals of the residential schools in Manitoba with a view to arranging with them that when such cases arise certain children at present in the school and whose parents are able to support them and live on the Reserves where day schools are located should be discharged to make room for these needy cases. The setup of our appropriation at the present time makes it extremely difficult for us to allow supernumerary grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A. G.

I think I am safe in saying that Vera will not likely improve sufficiently in health to be returned to the school. I am hoping to have her transferred to Dynevor Hospital. There are, also, three pupils recommended for sanatorium treatment and these will be taken out of the school as soon as Dynevor Hospital is opened.\n\nIn addition to these children, there are five or six others, whom, I understand, Dr. Doyle is prepared to discharge.\n\nWhen these changes have been made, his enrollment will then be 174, which is four in excess of the number of grant earning pupils allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nThe under-mentioned pupils over 16 years of age are, we understand, taking high school work:\n\nNo. 0289 Alma Cree No. 0397 Elizabeth Haywahe\n\" 0351 Oriel Fleet \" 0456 Gladys Dreaver\n\" 0386 Doris Ironstar \" 0470 Gladys Bear\n\" 0395 Charlotte Bear\n\nIt is hoped that many of these will complete their course this June. If, however, you wish some of them to continue for another year it is understood that you will make application to the Department. I may add that while the Department will be prepared to favourably consider assisting those who have already started courses it is very unlikely that the funds at our disposal will permit our considering any applications to take high school courses during the year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Brandon Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Hector William Pratt\nAge: 16\nName of Band: Gordon\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 112 Gordon Band.\nFather's full name and No.: Colin Richard Pratt\nMother's full name and No.: Clara Pratt\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Church of England\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes\nPreviously attended: Gordon and white schools school for 9 years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

At 2:00 a.m., this date I patrolled by Pol Auto #2440 to File Hills Indian School accompanied by Sgt Slater, from where accompanied by Mr Rhodes patrol continued to Little Black Bear Indian Reserve, where the Bigknife family reside, the result being that this youth was not in the house and his parents deny any knowledge of his whereabouts, they stated that they had only learned of his absence from school at Brandon, on the 30th ultimo.\n\n3. This matter is receiving attention and Mr Rhodes is co-operating in this regard, it is necessary to patrol in the early a.m., to locate this youth as otherwise he keeps hid in the bush only returning to the house to sleep, this information is obtained from Mr Rhodes who has had previous experience with him.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 9, 1940\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing your letter of February 26, I have gone over very carefully every pupil in the school who is sixteen years of age and over. In a letter which I have just written, we have listed 31 pupils who might be discharged. Before listing in detail those whom we recommend to be continued in school, I would like to make some report on the work we have been trying to do during the past year along the lines referred to in my letter of May 29, 1939.\n\nClass in Home Nursing. The class in home nursing is progressing favourably. There are twelve girls being trained and will be ready for examination at the end of this month. Some of these girls are quite intent to train as Nurses if at all possible. Miss Rosabelle Ryder will graduate from St. Boniface Hospital next Monday. Though she did not possess outstanding ability as a student, she had a set purpose and a dogged determination and has maintained a very excellent standard, especially in her practical work, in her entire course. There is no question in my mind but that a number of these girls could do equally as well.\n\nDuring this school year, we have had employed an extra teacher in the sewing department, with the view of giving the older girls a thorough training in all kinds of needlework. Twenty-four girls have been trained in this class this year, every girl has made two complete sets of clothing for herself, one or more other articles made-over, such as child's coat out of an old coat, boy's pants out of an old pair of pants, two or more articles of clothing for a smaller child, three articles of clothing for a baby, sewn by hand; two or more house dresses; one or more boys' night-shirts, one or more pairs of pyjamas, one or more nightgowns,\none jumper-dress for a little girl.\n\nCareful account has been kept as to efficiency, quality of work, speed, etc., and they rank as follows: Excellent, 13; good, 5; fair, 5; poor, 1.\n\nEach girl retains the patterns used in all of these garments.\n\nThis department has taken in old coats from families in town and made them over for younger children and their work has been decidedly acceptable. We are quite pleased with the start we have made in this department and are confident we have given a number of the girls the feeling that they can go ahead and do this kind of work when they go home.\n\nDuring the winter months we have conducted two classes in Agriculture and Stockraising. Mr. Zealand has taken the Diploma Course in the Agricultural College, Mr. Waldon has had some training in the Agricultural College, and we have secured from the Department a splendid supply of pamphlets and booklets covering the whole field. Examinations were held at the close of the course in which fifteen boys took part, securing an average of 76.2%, ten over 60%, the highest 92.5%. We would like very much to give some kind of a certificate to those taking over 60%. If the Department can provide something of this kind we would be very pleased indeed to have them do so, and present these certificates at our closing exercises.\n\nAs we did not have a suitable Beehouse, we decided to destroy our bees last fall and purchase new colonies this spring. Instead of purchasing eight, as we had last year, we have secured twelve. The boys are taking a good interest in this Department and instruction in Beekeeping was given in the course during the winter.\n\nFrom time to time we have been having a few pupils tested by the Mental Clinic which carries on very helpful work, from the Mental Hospital here. For our own information and to correct our impressions if they were wrong, that the majority of our pupils are an average of two years or more behind the ordinary white child, we had eleven pupils of sixteen years of age tested this year. These form a cross-section of our student body and were not picked either with a view of cleverness or dullness. The following list and standing is the result.\nSchool Grade Chronological Age Mental Age I.Q.\nElmer Anderson 9 16 12.8/12 84\nLeslie Cochrane 5 16.5/12 10.2/12 68\nJohn Peters 7 16 12.6/12 84\nArnold Spence 3 16.5/12 9.5/12 63\nMary Bud 6 17 9 60\nEmily Linklater 6 16.9/12 10.1/12 67\nJean Prince 9 16.1/12 105\nMary Ryder 8 16.6/12 14.7/12 97\nRosalie Weanta 4 15.9/12 9.8/12 60\nMary Walker 6 16 10.6/12 71\nLibby Wesley 5 16 10.6/12 70\n\n(Signed) J.G. Creasy, i.c.\nPhysician, Child Guidance Clinics.\n\nThe average of the above shows for the eleven pupils a mental age of 11.5/12, and I.Q. of 75 on the basis of a chronological age of 15. Omitting Jean Prince who is above the average for a normal white pupil, the average is 10.9/12 years, I.Q. 72. In my mind, the inference from the above is that 16 as a general thing is too young for Indian pupils to leave school. With a mental age of 10 or 11 it is impossible for them to get as much out of these practical courses which we are trying to give them, as they would a year or two later in life.\n\nWith this in mind, and also keeping in mind the urgency of getting the older pupils out of the way as early as possible to make way for younger ones who might be available, I have gone over very carefully and discussed with members of the Staff each pupil 16 years and over, and beg to recommend that the following remain in the school for at least the coming school year:\n\nNo. 0356 Belongs to Fisher River Agency.\nLibby Wesley Exceedingly objectionable home.\nAge 16 This girl needs the help and protection of the school. Her mental age is 10.6/12.\n\nNo. 0353 Also from Fisher River. Dr. Stevens urges that she be kept in school as long as is possible and not allowed home for holidays.\nJane Amos Age 17\n\nNo. 0364 Emily is under treatment for hip and limb trouble, is improving, has no home; should remain here as long as possible.\nEmily Linklater Age 16.\nRosie's two sisters are doing exceedingly well in service in Hamilton, Ontario. Her half-sister, Nora, returned to the Reserve last year, and is doing anything but well. If, next year, Rosie could secure work under the influence of her sister's in the East, it would be the best solution, I think, for her. She is a likeable girl, but easily led.\n\nI find, since sending the returns for the last quarter, that this girl is not yet 16 years of age.\n\nSister of Rosabelle, who is completing her Nurses' training. Mary is improving very much as time goes on and I think has it in her to be a splendid girl. She certainly should remain in the school.\n\nA very likeable and promising girl, has no home to go to. Should remain with us.\n\nDoing exceedingly well at school. Is responding to the training she is receiving. Her parents and she herself agree that she should remain in school for another year.\n\nNot as promising a girl as Wilma, they are great chums and in the same class as far as need of training is concerned.\n\nVery immature. Is difficult in some respects, but has possibilities if properly handled. Should remain in school.\n\nA girl with a good deal of ability, in grade IX, her mother, a widow, Mrs. McKay Flett, is anxious for her to remain in school for another year. We strongly recommend it.\n\nHome conditions very objectionable. Dr. Stevens, the Missionary, urges that\nshe be kept here as long as possible and not sent home for holidays. Her mental age is 9.\n\nNo. 0485 Rosalie Wacanta Age 15.\n\nI also learn that this girl should be down as 15 instead of 16. She is undeveloped, mental age 9;8/12, I.Q. 60, but is improving as time goes on.\n\nNo. 0493 Selma Francis Age 16.\n\nIs decidedly clever at school, in grade X. Her father is overseas, the mother is anxious for her to remain in school. We recommend it.\n\nNo. 0494 Irene Gaddie Age 17\n\nIs decidedly promising, good student, fine spirit and nice attitude. The senior teacher regards her as one of the most promising girls we have. I quite agree. I would like to see her have a chance to continue in school.\n\nNo. 0510 Edna McKay Age 16.\n\nA very promising girl, one of the best we have received from Round Lake school, came last year for grade IX, doing well in her work.\n\nNo. 0511 Ruth Watson Age 16.\n\nA little more retiring than Edna, but a good promising girl. Should be given an opportunity of continuing in school.\n\nNo. 0518 Jean Prince Age 16.\n\nMental age above normal, I.Q., 105. In grade IX. Came last year from Portage la Prairie, is very promising.\n\nNo. 0519 Edna Tanner Age 17.\n\nAlso came from Portage la Prairie, is doing well, and we are anxious that she should remain with us.\n\nNo. 0520 Helen Myerion Age 17.\n\nAlso from Portage. These three, together with Grace Johnnie, who is only 15, are very promising girls and we are anxious that all four should have the opportunity of going forward with their education.\n\nNo. 363 Johnnie Peters Age 16.\n\nFrom Walpole Island. Has been very slow in developing, but improves satisfactorily as time goes on; mental age, 12.8/12, I.Q., 84.\nIs good with horses and stock generally, has no home to which he can go.\n\nNo. 367\nHanson Hart\nAge 17.\n\nWas recorded last year as 17, but this seems to have been an error. Hanson has developed slowly, is improving satisfactorily, giving good conduct, is a good mechanic, greatly interested in Beekeeping. Should remain in school.\n\nNo. 368\nJames Taylor\nAge 17.\n\nIs quite crippled with a bad hip, is undersize, quite ambitious; hope to give him manual training next year and find some work for him away from the Reserve. He is from Nelson House and is quite determined not to go back.\n\nNo. 418\nJohn Charles Spence\nAge 17.\n\nFrom Nelson House, a promising boy, but immature for his age; is anxious to remain in school and prepare for some useful work without going back to the Reserve.\n\nNo. 456\nLeslie Cochrane\nAge 16.\n\nMental age 10.2/12, has improved during the past few years, but needs a good deal of training to make him a useful man. Should remain in school.\n\nNo. 478\nDonald Bigknife\nAge 17.\n\nThis boy was incorrigable at File Hills, a chronic deserter; ran away a couple of times when he first came here, then settled down to be one of our very best boys, a willing worker and responsive, but unfortunately was led into this trouble three weeks ago and ran away again. We have located him two or three times but he is very elusive. I would like to reserve judgment as to what is best to do with him next year until we get him back and see what his attitude may be.\n\nNo. 479\nAlex Poll\nAge 17.\n\nWas incorrigable at home, brought here by the Mounted Police, became\neminently satisfactory, attended Technical School this past year and his reports are excellent. He was implicated in the trouble three weeks ago but has avowed his intention to give good conduct in the future. I have faith in him. He is very much interested in the tractor and in any mechanical work. We believe he should remain in school for another year.\n\nNo. 481\nAngus Anderson\nAge 18.\n\nAngus has been the best student we have had in the school this past year, or perhaps two years. He is always well dressed, immaculate in appearance, would have passed his Grade XI without a doubt but unfortunately was taken down with pneumonia. He is still out of school, convalescing, but we hope will write on some of the subjects and possibly clear the rest by supplemental examinations. He is anxious to continue in school and we will be glad to have him have the opportunity.\n\nNo. 524\nElmer Anderson\nAge 16.\n\nIs in Grade IX, mental age 12.8/12, I.Q., 84. The teachers were all surprised that his mental age was not higher. He is a good student and is anxious to continue in school, and the parents are anxious to have both he and his brother Angus do so.\n\nI would like to add that we are very anxious next year to take up manual training. If the Department will supply a building or room in which this can be carried on, we will be able to employ a teacher, and we believe that we can give a number of these boys a training in this line that will be of great advantage to them as they go out into the world. I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/RS.\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, S.J.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 9, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn my letter today in regard to pupils who should, or in our opinion should not, graduate, the first name in the graduating list is that of Alma Cree, No. 0288. I appreciate exceedingly that you left this girl with us for this year. I think in addition to giving her extra training in household art, to which she has responded splendidly, she has developed in character and dependability.\n\nAlma is an exceedingly kindly, likeable, and responsive girl. She is quite small and slight, has a very gentle manner, but does her work with thoroughness and seems to enjoy real good health. This girl comes from Oka, Quebec, and according to Miss Daly, our Intermediate teacher, who taught at Caughnawaga for two years, Alma has not a suitable home to which she can go. She has a sister, I believe, at Sioux St. Marie who is married, but she states that she does not want to go to either her home or to her sister's. Last summer she visited with the Anderson family on the File Hills Reserve, Doris Anderson, a pupil here, being an intimate friend of hers. She met a young man, while there, Anderson by name and a cousin of her friend, whom I believe is employed at Punnichy Agency. They have been corresponding during the year and there would be some indication that he has matrimonial intentions. The Andersons have invited her again this year and I wrote the Agent, Mr. Dodds as to the advisability of letting her go, with a view of making her home there quite indefinitely. His reply is unfavourable to this propos-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6258, file 576-10, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.\n\nHe states that while the Andersons have a fairly good home, and their standard of living a little better than the average for Indian families, the parents are away from home a good deal, have hired help, and he deems it inadvisable that she should make her home there.\n\nAlma is working in our home at the present time and I think would rather work there, or somewhere else in this Community, than go back east; and I am writing to suggest this; then if the young man in question turns out to be desirable and means business, their marriage might take place when it can be arranged suitably. I am writing for your direction in this matter.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Deyler.\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., May 9, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nComplying with the regulation of your Department, and after giving serious consideration to your letter of February 26, I beg to make recommendations in regard to the pupils of this school who might be discharged this year. They are as follows:\n\nNo. 0238\nAlma Cree\nAge 19.\n\nPlease refer to my letter of this date.\n\nNo. 0324\nDorothy Sinclair,\nAge 16.\n\nDorothy's sister, Mary, was discharged two years ago. Her father then established a home for the girls. Mary is now ill, unable to do the housework and the father writes urging that Dorothy be discharged this year that she may help take care of Mary. We recommend it.\n\nNo. 0351\nOriel Flett,\nAge 18.\n\nOriel has the prospect of securing employment at the new Hospital on the Fisher River Agency. We are recommending her for the position and recommend that she be discharged.\n\nNo. 0354\nVera Mallett\nAge 16.\n\nThis girl, as you know, has been in the Ninette Sanatorium for a number of years. She is now moved to Dynesvor. She is not likely to be discharged for some time. I expect it will be your desire that she be discharged as a pupil of this school.\nNo. 0361  \nEthel Hall  \nAge 18.\n\nThis girl has improved remarkably during the past year. While not bright as far as intellect or studies are concerned, she has proven herself thoroughly reliable, careful in the details of her work, and we are arranging for work for her in one of the best families at the Experimental Farm across the road. Home conditions are very undesirable and she does not want to go back to the Reserve. We recommend that she be discharged.\n\nNo. 0372  \nChrissie Donkey  \nAge 18.\n\nChrissie also has made advancement this year. She comes from Nelson House. Her sister Sarah an ex-pupil from here, has been in Ninette for years, is now at Dynevor, has developed to be a very fine girl. Chrissie does not want to return to the Reserve, and we have arrangements made for her to work at XXX the home of one of the families at the Experimental Farm. We recommend her discharge.\n\nNo. 0381  \nFlorence Thaddeus  \nAge 18.\n\nFlorence's progress this year has been very satisfactory. She comes from Fisher River and will likely return to the Reserve when she graduates.\n\nNo. 0386  \nDoris Ironstar  \nAge 19.\n\nDoris has made arrangements to attend a Bible School at Three Hills, Alberta. An older sister has attended here and has brought about this arrangement. We recommend that she be discharged.\n\nNo. 0395  \nCharlotte Bear  \nAge 19.\n\nCharlotte's father from New Reserve, near Prince Albert would like to have Charlotte continue in school, but she is now 19, has attended Collegiate this year, but I feel her powers of application and concentration are not sufficiently pronounced to warrant the Department in continuing her. She would pass for a white girl anywhere, has an attractive personality, and we leave it to the Department to de-\ncide as to her being discharged this year. I think it is quite evident that she will not complete Grade XI.\n\nNo. 0397\nElizabeth Haywahe\nAge 19.\n\nA good strong healthy girl, has responded well to training in household science. Her twin sister is employed at the Dynevor Hospital, and we expect there will be an opening for her as soon as she graduates, there also. We recommend her discharge.\n\nNo. 0418\nKatie Ahenakew\nAge 20.\n\nKatie's health has not been good for some weeks past. This, I think, partly accounts for her losing interest in her studies; and after talking the matter over with her yesterday, she has decided to give up her work for this year. We recommend that she be discharged. She will spend the rest of the time in our household science classes.\n\nNo. 0429\nMatilda Hart\nAge 18.\n\nA splendid wholesome girl, good with young children. We can secure work for her during the summer at least with one of the Experimental Farm families and might employ her here next year in connection with our kindergarten class and younger children. We recommend her discharge.\n\nNo. 0439\nMaria Kirkness\nAge 16.\n\nThis girl was taken to Dynevor late last fall. At first her case seemed quite difficult but she is now improving, have a letter from the Dr. this morning in regard to her. It will be some time before she is able to return to school and as she is 16 the Department may wish to have her discharged. I am therefore submitting her name with the others.\n\nNo. 0442\nMargaret Strang\nAge 18.\n\nThis girl was exceedingly backward and crude when she came to us, has improved consistently during the years. I have written Mr. Schuetze of Berens River in regard to her and he states that they have secured employment for her with a Hudson's Bay family.\nat Berens River.

If she were clear, I am confident she would ask to attend Normal. It is no doubt better that she should be discharged, and then if she clears her subjects and decides that she wants to attend Normal, we can make application in her case when the time comes to do so.\n\nNo. 0462\nLouise Ramsay\nAge 17.\n\nHer people wanted her home and we have given her leave of absence. We recommend that she be discharged.\n\nNo. 0467\nRuby Asham\nAge 16.\n\nThis girl was operated on during holidays last year, was unable to return, and when her health improved they did not send her. We recommend her discharge.\n\nNo. 0468\nChristina Bouchey\nAge 18.\n\nHer father claims she is now eighteen and wants her discharged. We recommend it.\n\nNo. 0470\nGladys Bear\nAge 20.\n\nGladys comes from Broadview, parents exceedingly anxious for both she and her sister to go on to school and get all the education they can, but she is now 20, I am afraid will not pass on all of Grade XI, and it can hardly be expected that the Department will carry her any longer.\nNo. 0471  \nAlice Bear  \nAge 17.\n\nThis girl has the handicap of poor health. Has been on rest routine ever since coming to this school. Attended Collegiate for the full day during the fall but had to put her on a half time basis. While the parents very much desire that she should continue in school, we do not feel that we can recommend it.\n\nNo. 0474  \nAgnes Kaysaywaysemat  \nAge 19.\n\nAgnes is taking Grade XI, a nice kindly girl, would like to be a nurse, but I think cannot clear her year by midsummer. Would therefore require another year in Collegiate before she could enter a Hospital. I am doubtful if the Department should continue her.\n\nNo. 0475  \nMary Ann Owen\n\nThis girl is backward, undeveloped, but her father wants her home, and we recommend her discharge.\n\nNo. 0492  \nDoris Anderson  \nAge 17.\n\nDoris came here two years ago from File Hills, is a fairly good student, could do better if she applied herself more diligently. Expresses her desire to go on to school but has no definite objective as far as education is concerned. We do not think the Department would be justified in continuing her at school.\n\nNo. 0497  \nMary Crowe  \nAge 13.\n\nWas kept home last year on account of the condition of her health. She had very bad eyes, almost blind, has venereal trouble, has been incorrigible at home. We do not think the school can do much for her and would recommend that she be discharged.\n\nNo. 372  \nFraleigh Shanks  \nAge 17.\n\nComes from Muncey, Ontario; the father expects him back this year, and we recommend that he graduate and be returned to his home early in July.\n\nNo. 417  \nLawrence Spence  \nAge 18.\n\nA very backward boy, but school will not give him a great deal of help. His grandmother needs him and we recommend he be discharged.\nJoseph has attended Technical School for two years. Was doing exceedingly well and negotiating for work in a southern Manitoba town, but unfortunately he, with Edwin Ryder of the next paragraph, helped to organize an attempt at serious indiscretion about three weeks ago. Fortunately this attempt was intercepted, the whole thing ferreted out, and the guilty ones punished. A week ago Saturday Joseph and Edwin left the school. We have traced them beyond Broadview but have no word of them since. We are greatly disappointed but hope that Joseph will find work and settle down and behave himself. He became quite proficient, especially at body work and can now command good wages in a garage where there is much of this kind of work to do. We recommend his discharge.\n\nThis boy was an exceptionally good worker, both at the Technical School and on the farm. He, however, had an objectionable streak of insubordination, and a strong sex urge, and had to be kept under close observation. We recommend his discharge.\n\nAllan took Technical training a year ago, passed very satisfactorily in this work, has become proficient in handling a tractor, can go on to a farm or any position where a tractor is used and command good wages. We recommend his discharge.\n\nThis boy's parents are asking that he be sent home; they claim to need his help. The Agent has given his approval. He is a backward boy as far as intellect goes, we had him tested for mental age and I.Q with a number of others. His M.A. is 96/12 his I.Q. 63% on the basis of 15 years of age. We are willing that he should be discharged.\nIn a separate letter we will deal with those who are sixteen years and over whom we feel should be continued in school.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

I consider him in many ways a very promising boy. He is somewhat easily led and was induced to go with the others, and rode the freight train as far as Broadview but fully decided to return. He came straight to the Office, confessed everything, asked to be reinstated in the life of the school, stating that he was willing to take any punishment that we might give him, and wants to stay here for another year; at the end of that time he states that he does not intend to return to the Reserve, which is Nelson House, but wants to work out and make good at farming in a white community. I feel quite confident that this boy is so sincere in his intentions, that he will make good, and that this next year in school will do him a great deal of benefit. I would appreciate very much if you will give this request of mine favourable consideration. I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nP.S.

Two days before I received word from the R.C.M.P. Office saying that Donald was at Wolseley, Saskatchewan, and that they were sending a man down to pick him up; but the man did not return until yesterday afternoon. It seems that Donald was apprehended and in care of the detachment at Wolseley, but before the Officer from here arrived he had slipped away from them. On receiving your letter I immediately had them cancel any further effort in regard to securing this boy.\n\nA few days ago I received word from Mr. Hillhouse, Farm Instructor on the Reserve at Sintaluta, stating that Edwin Ryder had been located over the Montana border, in the Sweetgrass country. I called the Mounted Police Office and asked them to take no further action in regard to him; then yesterday I received word from them stating that he also was detained at Wolseley. I expect he was caught entering the United States without passport or identification card and sent back; but in view of the contents of your letter I felt that I should not have Edwin return to the school, even from Wolseley. I have also advised them that no further action should be taken in regard to Joe Mason. Trusting that these matters meet with your approval, I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJAD/RS.\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In connection with Bigknife, on Saturday Sept., Doyle communicated with me to the effect that he had received word from Ottawa, that as Bigknife's time expired next month, it was not necessary to continue any further enquiries for him. This A.M. I contacted the Principal again and have now been authorized by him to have circulars cancelled, regarding these run-a-way boys. Joe Mason's time has expired, and as previously reported, hence returned to the School of his own accord. Therefore, might the circular in connection with these boys be cancelled?

The R.C.M.P. Officer here informed me that Donald had already been apprehended, was brought to Wolseley for transfer to Brandon, but that he had slipped away from them and at that time they were out looking for him. On Wednesday the Inspector of the Force stationed at Brandon called me up stating that Donald had been secured in the vicinity of Balcarres and the Officer evidently had been in touch with Mr. Dodds and I think also Mr. Rhodes, and stated that there was a very strong feeling that this boy should not be allowed to get away with this escapade without being brought back and punished. They felt it was very bad for the boy and also bad for the schools concerned. Donald had been a chronic deserter at File Hills, he claims that he ran away twenty-seven times, and he was brought here on that account. I found myself absolutely in harmony with their judgment in this matter and felt that under the circumstances the only right thing to do was to have him brought back. He arrived early yesterday morning and I am sure that his return is having and will have a wholesome affect on our school. I am also quite satisfied that he will remain without giving us any trouble until the end of June, at which time we will discharge him in the regular way.

However, in the meantime, Big Knife had been apprehended and whilst being conveyed back to Brandon, he made his escape. He was located by a family who notified our Detachment but before our Constable could arrive to take him into custody, he again escaped.\n\n2. It appeared at this time that it might act as a bad influence on the minds of other Indian boys inclined to leave the school without permission, if Big Knife was allowed his freedom.\n\n3.

We will certainly find it difficult to finance on this reduction, but will face up to it and do the best we possibly can. We realize, I think, very keenly the strenuous and difficult times through which we are passing and will have to pass before our difficulties are cleared away.\n\nOur chief concern now will be to secure pupils up to the 92.24% of our allotment.\n\nIn the supplementary list of 17 which you submit, there are two about which we are deeply concerned: No. 0494, Irene Gaddie, is one of the most promising girls we have in the school. There is a unanimous feeling with the teachers and the entire staff that Irene has it in her to make a real success. She is ambitious to be a nurse, her mother is a widow. This girl has applied herself diligently to her work, her average standing on the last examination was 87%, her conduct is always without fault, and we would like very much if the Department can see fit to permit her to return and take Grade XI next year. When I received your letter I called her in and told her the situation and she stated how very much she would appreciate it if she just had the chance to go on. The other girl is No. 0510, Edna McKay. This girl is only sixteen years of age, is also anxious to be a nurse, is white in appearance.\nas Irene is also, is a good student--her average on the recent examination was 76%, and while she is less mature than Irene, she seems to be potentially the makings of an exceedingly fine person and would make an excellent nurse. If she also can be added to the list, we would appreciate it; but if only one can be added we would like to see the preference given to Irene, but we trust that you will see fit to allow both of them to remain with us.\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Murdoch, of the Fisher River Reserve, and copy of my reply to the Agent. The subject matter of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend J. A. Dyle, D.D.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nOttawa, August 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by the Department from Mr. S. J. Murdoch, of the Fisher River Indian Reserve.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Murdoch that the Department cannot accept his suggestion and approve of his keeping at home his two sons, William and Reginald, now enrolled as pupils at the Brandon Residential School.\n\nThe Brandon School is, as you know, one of the best equipped and one of the best conducted schools in the Dominion. A large number of the graduates of this school are now occupying positions of trust and responsibility throughout the country. Murdoch's references to the food supplied at the institution are wholly inaccurate. It is, in my judgment, very unfortunate that these erroneous opinions with respect to the work of our residential schools should be so widespread amongst our Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

A. Doyle,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., September 11, 1940\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some years past you have been good enough to pay $350.00 each year towards transportation of graduating new pupils, and pupils going to and returning from holidays. On May 13th, 1940, your letter No. 133-1-10, stated that this amount would be reduced to $150.00. On August 29, I made out as voucher No. 26, a partial list of pupils returning home, the railway transportation of which at Indian rates amounted to a little over $150.00. This list of thirty one, was not a quarter of the pupils given transportation, and it was only for the going trip.\n\nI now have your cheque, No. 91698, for $128.60 and I cannot understand why this amount has been sent instead of the $150.00 which you promised.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 21, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAs you state in your letter of the 11th instant an amount of $150.00 was authorized for travelling expenses of pupils to and from the Brandon School this year. An amount of $21.40 was paid as requested by your voucher No. 23 and consequently when your voucher No. 26 was received we could only allow $128.60. The two amounts total $150.00 which was the amount provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A. Doyle,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nPlease note that S.J. Murdoch of Fisher River Reserve has kept his two boys, who came home for holidays only from going back to Brandon School, they are 16 and 15 years old. There is no reason why these boys are needed at home.\n\nMiles Cochrane of the Peguis reserve has kept back two of his children. There is also no reason for this.\n\nWill you please do me the favor of ordering what these four children have taken by the R.C.M.P. police at Hodgson and returned to Brandon School and please insist that your orders be executed with promptness.\n\nIt is not good for these people to do as they please and then get away with it.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\nJ.H. Stevens\nOttawa,\nSeptember 23, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the Murdoch children. On reviewing our files I find that on August 27 I wrote to Mr. F. J. Clarke, Indian Agent, Hodgson, Manitoba, advising him that these boys must be returned to the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. F. G. Stevens,\nFisher River Indian Mission,\nKoostatak, Man.\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn further reference to our conversation, may I again remind you that this seems to us to be a simple matter of contract between your Department and the Brandon School and that the payment is requested only until the end of the school year.\n\nYou will remember that these pupils were sent to Brandon by the Agent - presumably on the authority of your Department. No intimation was given to Dr. Doyle until some time in May that there was any possibility that they would not be paid for. In any case, I think you will agree that the Department, having made a contract with the School to provide for these children, should pay for them until the end of this school year. Whatever ruling you may put in force for next year is quite another matter. These children were not sought by Dr. Doyle, but were placed in the Brandon School by your Department. I feel sure that, on reflection, you will agree that payment for them should be made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6258, file 576-10, part 10)\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with reference to our conversation regarding supernumerary grant for certain pupils who attended the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Brandon School was promised supernumerary grant for the pupils mentioned in your letter but unfortunately the funds placed at our disposal do not permit our paying the amount. However, it is quite possible that an adjustment can be made at the end of the year and I can assure you that this matter will not be forgotten and if at all possible the amount promised will be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., September 26, 1940\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of September 2, st., No. 133-0-10 concerning the $150.00 grant toward travelling expenses, and will review the situation.\n\nAbout thirteen years ago this School was very short of pupils and the Department arranged to have over forty sent from Ontario and Quebec. When I took over the School eleven years ago most of these eastern pupils were still here. A number were discharged that year, prior to the School being emptied for a new building. The Department at that time was paying all holiday and other transportation expenses. When agreement was entered into with the Department that a definite sum would be allowed to this School toward transportation expenses, the expenses of graduates going east were paid over and above this allotted amount. Not only was there definite agreement between the School and the Department to this fact but during the eleven years this practice has been followed and all expenses of pupils going to eastern Canada were paid over and above this allotted amount. Therefore when the Department's letter arrived stating that the allotment of $350.00 would be reduced to $150.00 I naturally took it that the old arrangement would hold good. I feel therefore that we should receive the full $150.00 apart from the amount paid for the transportation of Fraleigh Shanks who was sent east.\n\nI am Yours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the amount allowed for travelling expenses at the Brandon Residential School this summer.\n\nNo doubt you have paid other accounts for travelling expenses which you have not submitted to the Department. If you submit one of these accounts amounting to approximately $25.00 payment will be made and by so doing you will be allowed the total amount of $150.00 which was promised to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. A.

On November 5th, 1938 this young lad was placed in this school with some pressure from the agent, but with the father's approval. The father came to the school quite frequently, and created as much discontent with the boy as he seemed able to do.\n\nThen during the following holiday, he took the boy into the United States stating that he was not returning. We therefore on August 29th, 1939 applied for his discharge. For some time past Williams has been on the reserve with his boy but refused to send him to any school. Mr. Young has taken the matter up and has insisted that he be sent to school. He arrived today.\n\nThis situation accounts for the Application not being signed by the father. He however did sign the application two years ago.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A.

Her payment should include, of course, the tuition fees and other expenses and I am advising Mr. Kerley that the total amount will be $100.00 or more for each academic year.

With reference to the above I have to report that Mr. R.T. CHAPLIN, Principal of the Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man., called at this detachment in the P.M. of 19-12-41 and reported that Stephen BIGSTONE, one of the students at the Indian School had run away. He requested that inquiries be made by this force with a view to locating this boy and advising Mr. CHAPLIN of his whereabouts.\n\n2. Stephen BIGSTONE is described as being 15 years of age, 5ft. 5ins., about 120 lbs., black hair, dark eyes, dark complexion, and having Indian features. He was dressed in overalls and a smock, colour not known. He ran away from the school about 3 weeks ago.\n\n3. Mr. CHAPLIN stated that this boy's home is on a reserve near Carlyle, Sask., but that inquiries at that point by Mr. CHAPLIN have failed to show any trace of him, and he is not believed to be there. He also has relatives on the Indian Reserve near Maple Creek, and it is possible that he has gone to that point. It is believed that this relative's name is Gordon CAMERON.\n\n4. This boy ran away in the latter part of September of this year and was apprehended on the reserve near Maple Creek.\n\n5. Mr. CHAPLIN does not wish to have him apprehended this time, if he is located, but wishes to be advised of his whereabouts.\n\n6.

Before payment of this grant can be allowed it will be necessary for you to supply further information with the voucher. You should attach receipts from the railway company for the expenditure of $115.50 for railway tickets. You should also show on the voucher the number of miles your van travelled in transporting children and enter a charge of 6\u00a2 a mile. This will bring the total considerably over $150.00 and that is the only amount that can be allowed, but it will give the information that we require to permit us to pay the account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Re the railway tickets - We secured no vouchers from the Railway Company at the time these were purchased, so all I can do now is put in the amounts. Another summer I will bear this in mind and secure the receipts when the tickets are purchased. Hoping this will be satisfactory,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. T. Chapin\n\nRTC/TS\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that at the beginning of last December I received an application for the admission to Brandon Residential School of Robert Chubb, aged 13, son of Flora Chubb No; 18 God's Lake Band. There was no covering letter with the application.\n\nI wrote to Rev: H.E.Young, the United Church Missionary at God's Lake Reserve, asking him for some further information regarding this boy, and for reasons why the application was for admission to 'Brandon' Residential School, instead of Norway House Residential School, and I enclose herewith for your information, a copy of Rev: Mr Young's reply.\n\nThe boy's mother is a widow. The boy himself has according to the application, attended the God's Lake U.C. Seasonal School for five summers, and he is now 13 years of age. According to the teacher's report for the 1941 season of this day school, the boy is in grade 5, and out of 60 days the school was open, he attended for 17 days, being absent 43 days.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department will approve of this boy's admission to Brandon School, and assume the expense of his transportation from Norway House to Winnipeg by boat, and from Winnipeg to Brandon by train this coming summer. If so, I will forward the application. I may say that the Physical Examination of this boy turned out good excepting that at the time he was examined, on October 2nd last, he had a cold. He was examined By Dr Moir of God's Lake.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent\nGod's Lake, Man.,\nFeb. 11, 1942.\n\nDear Mr Lazenby\n\nRe.: Robert Chubb, File 22-B\n\nIn reply to yours of Dec. 8th, I have this to report. Flora Chubb states that she wants her boy to go to Brandon School instead of Norway House because she wants him to learn to speak English properly, and to learn to do something. She says that the boys that have come back from Norway House do not appear to know very much. She would like her boy to be able to speak English well enough to interpret for the Missionary in Church. She also states that it was the wish of the boy's father, John Chubb #18, before he died, that Robert should go to Brandon.\n\nShe was hoping the boy would be able to go out last fall before freeze-up. I imagine she would be glad to have him go as soon as possible. Perhaps he could go to Norway House with the freighters next spring and go out by boat if this is passed by the Government.\n\nThe boy has shown some marked ability in the musical line, and, I believe the teacher last year reported that he seemed to be bright in school. The only school he has attended has been the school held here in the summer time.\n\nI sincerely hope that something can be done soon to encourage them. The boy seems to be anxious to go, and the mother is anxious that he amount to something.\n\nI was going to suggest to them that he go to Norway House first, and if he showed promise there he could be sent to Brandon later. However, I decided to await your opinion on the matter. The above are all the reasons she has given me for wanting him to go to Brandon, and she is aware of the fact that it will be a long time before he would be able to come home again.\n\nHoping to hear from you again soon regarding this application, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned:- H.Egerton Young\nOttawa,\nMarch 26, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to Robert Chubb.\n\nThe Department does not see any reason for sending this boy to the Brandon Residential School. He should be placed in the Norway House Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. P.G.

Connie is now attending the Brandon Collegiate taking her grade 11. She has proved herself a steady, studious girl, anxious to go on with her course. She is aiming at Normal training so that she may take a teaching position. With her steady record of the past years, I have no doubt that she will make good if she has the opportunity; and strongly recommend that she be allowed to come back next year to take her grade 12 at the Brandon Collegiate.\n\n0553 Edith Starr - 16 years of age. Edith is taking her grade 9 with us. She is one of our outstanding pupils. She has a bright, quick, willing disposition. She is studious in the classroom and energetic in her work. She is anxious to go on with her studies, and I would recommend that she be allowed to come back next year and take her grade 10 with us.\n\n0458 Myrtle Spence - 16 years of age. Myrtle is a girl small of stature, but quick and bright disposition. She is taking her grade 7 this year. A little while ago her mother who is working in Winnipeg, was here on a visit, and asked me if it would be possible for Myrtle to continue in School for another year and get her grade 8. As the mother is working out there is no home for Myrtle to go to, and it would be decidedly to her advantage to remain here another year until she is a little fuller developed both mentally and physically.\nPage 2.\n\n0384 Muriel Cline - 17 years of age. The father of this girl is in Norway House; and the mother in Selkirk, with none too good a name. The mother wanted Muriel home this year so that she might marry her to a man in Selkirk, and thus have a home for her own self. Muriel is mentally backward and somewhat childish. She is in grade 6. This past year she has developed considerably. I wrote the Agent at Selkirk about her case, and he strongly recommended that if possible Muriel be kept in School for another year.\n\n0337 Juliette Wesley - 16 years of age. Juliette is a very pleasant and happy girl, and is doing well in her school grades. She herself is not anxious to leave School just yet. Last week Inspector Hamilton was here enquiring about this girl. Her mother had seen him with the request that she remain in School, and Inspector Hamilton recommended that she might stay.\n\n495 Edwin Smith - 16 years of age. Edwin stands as the most responsible boy we have in School. He is a boy of good physique, enters well into sports, carries his work diligently, and is the best student that we have. He is taking grade 10 and is anxious to go on to Collegiate this following year and take his grade 11. He has no home to which to go though his father is living and working in Hodgson. Edwin is anxious to make of himself something else than a farmer, and we feel if he has the opportunity he will do so; and I am making a strong plea that he be allowed to return next year and attend Collegiate.\n\n509 Victor Stevenson - 16 years of age. Victor is taking his grade 8 this year, and while he has done well with his studies, he is more for mechanical work. I had a letter from his parents asking if he could come back next year and take a course at the Brandon Technical School. This is a 2-years course. His parents agree to pay his Technical School tuition fees, and any expenses thereto. I would recommend that he be allowed to do this.\n\n450 Orton Plett - 16 years of age. Orton has done well in the classroom, taking his grade 8 this year, and is recommended by the teacher as a good student. He takes his place well in the other activities and work of the School. I have received a letter from his parents asking if he might be able to stay next year and take his grade 9 with us. I recommend that he be allowed to do so.\n\nTrusting that the above will meet with your full approval,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRTC/TS\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reviewing this list we have kept in mind the demand for female labour, both for farm work and domestic work, throughout the country. At the present time the demand for this far exceeds the supply. Besides, certain conditions which have arisen recently have made it necessary to transfer three, and possibly four, residential schools for purposes other than education of Indian children. As a result, our residential school accommodation will be limited next year and we will likely require all the space we can obtain for orphan and neglected children.\n\nWith the above in mind, the following decision has been made:\n\n1. Pupils numbered 0509 and 0553 should be discharged at the end of June;\n2. Pupils numbered 0337, 0384 and 0458 may remain for another year only;\n3. Pupils numbered 450 and 495 may remain for another year only;\n4. Pupil No. 509 may remain for another year only, on the distinct understanding that his parents will pay all his expenses at the technical school. In other words, all that the Department will be required to pay is the annual per capita allowance. If the parents are not prepared to do this, the boy should be discharged at the end of June.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. R.T. Chapin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\n\nR.A.

If any of them are Catholics they can likely be placed at one of the Catholic residential schools. In any case, you should investigate these families and, if you consider institutional care is necessary, you should arrange for completion of the necessary forms and also have them medically examined. These forms should then be forwarded for our consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

This girl has made a good record this past year, has completed her exams for her grade eleven, and feels satisfied that she has done well in them. She and her people are anxious for her to go on and get her grade 12 and take her Normal course, and her qualifications for teaching. She has done so well with her studies thus far, and shows the qualities for making good in her work, that we feel now that she has got this far, she ought to have the opportunity to complete her course. May we ask for a re-consideration of her case, with our recommendation that she be allowed to return this coming fall and take her grade 12.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.T. Chapin\n\nRTC/TS\nOttawa, July 11, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to Connie Gaddie, No. 0509. It has been decided to allow her to remain in the Brandon School for another year, in order that she may complete her Grade 12. However, at the present time I am unable to give any definite assurance that we will be able to assist her in attending normal school. The amount of funds at our disposal next year is uncertain, and, besides, we doubt very much the advisability of encouraging Indian girls to study for the teaching profession. Our experience in this particular regard has been unsatisfactory.\n\nWith reference to this girl attending high school next year, we will allow the usual advanced educational grant of $50.00 over and above the regular per capita grant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend R.

These children are now being kept by a brother, No. 125 Lake St. Martin Reserve.

In view of this decision, no additional grant will be allowed in the case of Elsie Anderson.

CHAPIN, Principal of the above school called at this office at 3:45 p.m. the 29th ult; reporting that six boys had run away from the above school, they being:\n\n- Lawrence BOOTA, 14 yrs.,\n- Reginald BOOTA, 11 yrs.,\n- Willie HUNTER, 11 yrs.,\n- Willis ROYAL, 11 yrs.,\n- Bonnie THOMAS, 12 yrs.,\n- Solomon HALL, 11 yrs.\n\n2. On the a.m. of the 30th ult; as the result of a complaint received from Mr. William Alexander McLAUGHLIN of Alexander to the effect that he had certain articles of merchandise stolen from his store and subsequent investigation into said complaint and complaint of a similar nature from the proprietor of BLAIR'S general store at the same point, the four last named boys mentioned in para; one thereof, were located and found to be responsible for these offenses, same being referred to in Brandon Det., repts., dated the 1st inst., \"Re; Bonnie THOMAS et al; Juveniles; Brandon Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man.; Theft of Merchandise (385) GCC., from McLAUGHLIN Hardware Store, Alexander, Man.,\" and \"Re; Bonnie THOMAS et al; Juveniles; Brandon Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man.; Theft of Merchandise (385) GCC., from BLAIR'S General Store, Alexander, Man.,\" respectively.\n\n3. The two BOOTA boys, still missing are described as follows:\n   - Lawrence BOOTA, 14 yrs., Height 5'0\", Weight, 92 lbs\n   - Reginald BOOTA, 11 yrs., Height 4'6\", Weight, 75 lbs\n   Both wearing Blue denim (bib) overalls, black ankle boots, grey socks, fawn jacket, blue shirt, no cap.\n\n4. The BOOTA boys' home is at the Pipestone Reserve. They left the Indian School at Brandon on the p.m. of the 25th ult; and it is believed that on account of their age they would not go very far and may have returned to their home or have gone to the Oak River (Grindfield) Indian Reserve. In view of this it is respectfully suggested that enquiries be made re these boys by Virden and Nanton Detachments, extra copies of report being attached for this purpose.\n\nSUB.\nR.R.M. 10-42\n\nDiary Date\nSet For...........\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to the above I have to report that a telephone call was received from the Brandon Indian Residential School to the effect that three Indian boys had run away from the school on the P.M. of the 30th ult. Names and description of the boys in question were given as follows:\n\nAMOS WILLIAMS - 14 yrs., 5' 4\u00bd\", 55 lbs., his home is at the Oak River Indian Reserve, Grimsby, Man.\n\nJIMMY ELK - 12 yrs., 4' 8\", 75 lbs., his home is at Pipestone, Man.\n\nJOHN PAUL HASKIE - 10 yrs., 4' 4\", 70 lbs., his home is at Pipestone, Man.\n\nThese boys were all dressed in blue bib overalls, grey shirts and black ankle boots.\n\n2. Authorities of the Indian School believed that the Indian boys would be going to Pipestone, Man., or possibly the Oak River Indian Reserve, Grimsby, Man. In view of this fact, DOWLING, I/c Virden Detachment was notified of the runaway boys by telephone, and he latter was requested to notify Reston Det. Brandon City Police were also notified.\n\n3.

Shortly after the admission of the three children to the Brandon School, the mother commenced to bother the Principal by insisting on the children being allowed home for holidays and in other ways. As a result, the Department took advantage of her interference to discharge the children from the school in September, 1932. Consequently, the children were only in the school for a period of two or three months and at no time did we make a definite ruling that they were actually our wards.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOctober 23rd 1942.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Saito family\n\nThe above mentioned family is as follows.\n\nFather - John Saito, born 1887 at Yokohama, Japan.\n\nMother - Ruby Saito, maiden name Harris, 9-6-1897, born at Brandon, a treaty Indian. This couple were married in Brandon by the Rev. J. Magrath of the Church of England on 24-3-24.\n\nChildren - Charles, 5-9-1916\n          Thomas, 22-5-1919\n          Dolly, 19-12-1923\n          Patrick, 2-6-25\n          Chester, 2-10-27\n          James, 11-2-29\n          Elsie, 15-6-31\n          John, 3-2-33\n          Buna, age 7\n          Jerry, age 5\n          Norma, age 3.\n\nThe first three of these children, Charles, Thomas and Dolly were illegitimate. Charles is now in the Armed Services, Thomas died about a year ago and Dolly is married and away from home. In July or August of 1932, these three children were placed...\nMr. R. A. Hoey  \nOctober 23rd 1942.\n\nIn the Indian Residential School in Brandon through the agency of the Brandon Juvenile Court and the Children's Aid Society, Mrs. Saito evidently retained her treaty Indian rights at this time as the children were admitted upon the authority of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nSometime about the middle of September 1932 the Department of Indian Affairs withdrew from their agreement to keep these children at the Brandon Indian Residential School. As there had been considerable friction between the school and the mother and as she had been urging the children to run away, they were allowed to return to the home under the supervision of the Children's Aid Society.\n\nAs you can see the family has increased steadily since that time and the remainder of the children listed above are legitimate. It is very doubtful however whether Mr. Saito is the father of all, most, or any of these children.\n\nDuring the past ten years the Children's Aid Society has received continual complaints from various sources regarding the welfare of these children. School teachers, public health nurses, neighbors, the Medical Health Officer, have all repeatedly complained about the conduct of these children, and inattention at school and the neglect of them by their mother. Mrs. Saito, although it evidently cannot be proven in Court, is known as a prostitute. It is impossible to get any cooperation from her in any manner whatsoever which would lead to the betterment of conditions of the children. The Children's Aid Society is prepared to apprehend these children as neglected children and to take legal custody of them. This is difficult however as these children must then be removed from their home. Because of the nationality of these children we find it impossible to make any arrangements for foster home care for them in private homes. The Children's Shelter in Brandon is only used as a clearing house for children with a maximum stay of three months being provided by law.\nMr. R. A. Hoey  \nOctober 23rd 1942.\n\nWe are therefore in the dilemma of being anxious to assist these children but of being without resources to solve the problem.\n\nI have spoken to the Superintendents of the Indian Residential Schools at Brandon and at Birtle regarding the admission of the Salto children to those institutions. Both these men have expressed concern for the welfare of these children but informed me that they could not make an admission of children such as these to their schools without the advice and consent of your Department.\n\nWe are therefore anxious to secure your permission for the admission of these children to one or other of these Indian Residential Schools. If the information which we have provided for you is insufficient, I wish you would write to me and I shall endeavour to get whatever extra you may deem necessary.\n\nAwaiting a reply at your earliest convenience,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY OF WESTERN MANITOBA.\n\nPer\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCM/M\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs Mr. Hoey is absent from the Department on official business, your letter of the 23rd instant has been brought to my attention.\n\nIt is noted that the parents of these children were legally married on March 24, 1924, and the eight children who now constitute the family were born subsequent to that date. Their father is of Japanese descent and consequently the children cannot be considered wards of this Department. Under the circumstances I regret that approval cannot be given to their admission to any Indian residential school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. K.O.

OF INDIAN AFFAIRS)\n\n1. With reference to the above, I have to report that at 10:05 A.M. of the 4th inst., R. T. CHARLTON, Principal, Brandon Indian Residential School, called at this detachment requesting the assistance of this force in escorting the exceptionally noted Indian Boy, who had been located at Broadview, Sask., back to the Brandon Indian Residential School. At 11:30 A.M. of the same date, R. T. CHARLTON further advised that he had phoned W. J. KIRKLEY, Broadview, Sask., who had stated that he would keep Cecil REDSTAR in his care until an escort arrived from Brandon. Arrangements were also made by R. T. CHARLTON with the R.C.M.P., Detachment Broadview, Sask., in regard to the Indian agent at that point keeping the runaway Indian Boy in his care until the escort would arrive.\n\n2. In compliance with instructions received the writer left Brandon, Man., per C.P.R. train No. 7 at 2:15 P.M. on the 4th inst., arriving in Broadview, Sask., at 5:50 P.M. that same day. Gpl. R. S. MILLER, I/c Broadview R.C.M.P., Detachment met me at the C.P.R. Station advising that he was enroute to Regina, Sask., on escort duty and that he left the necessary particulars at his detachment with regards to locating W. J. KIRKLEY, Indian agent, as he had Cecil REDSTAR in his custody.\n\n3. W. J. KIRKLEY was accordingly contacted and he advised that he would bring REDSTAR to the R.C.M.P. detachment in Broadview, Sask., that evening. This was duly done, the runaway Indian Boy, Cecil REDSTAR, being placed in care of the writer at 9:00 P.M.\n\n4.

T. CHAPIN, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School advising that four Indian boys were on a C.P.R. freight heading west and that it was believed that they would get off some in Oak Lake, Man., he wished to know if I could check the freight on its arrival in Oak Lake, he further informed me that the freight in question was passing through Griswold, Man., at the time he was phoning. I informed him that I could not get to Oak Lake in time but that I would contact some person there with the view of having them watch for the Indian Boys and that I would check the freight on its arrival in Virden.\n\nI immediately got in touch with E. D. ALDER, Esq., Oak Lake, and he informed me that he would have someone watch the freight on its arrival, later while I was at the C.P.R. station in Virden I received a phone call from Mr. E. D. ALDER advising that the four Indian Boys had gotten off the freight, that one had been caught and that the other three had run away. I requested that the boy be held and advised that we would leave for Oak Lake immediately.\n\nPatrol per P.C. 8037 accompanied by Sgt. H. B. Luross left Virden immediately for Oak Lake, on arrival it was learned that R. T. CHAPIN, Principal of Brandon Indian Residential School together with an assistant had been in Oak Lake, previous to our arrival, that they had picked up the indian boy being held there and that they had then proceeded east to Griswold via their own transport, as they anticipated that the three Indian boys still at large were being held east with a view of getting onto the Oak River Indian Reserve north of that point. Enquiries were made for various persons in Oak Lake and a patrol of the town failed to reveal any trace of the run away boys, in view of this patrol returned to Virden.\n\nOn our arrival in Virden it was learned that Mr. E. D. ALDER, had endeavoured to contact us by phone several times since leaving Oak Lake. At 9:45 P.M. phone call was received at this detachment from Mr. ALDER to the effect that the three Indian Boys were located and that they\n\n(continued on page two)\n\nIndian Affairs.

I advised Mr. ALDER that we would immediately return to Oak Lake and attend to this matter. Before leaving Virden I also phoned W. WHITCOMBE and advised him that we were returning to Oak Lake and requested that he keep the boys in question in his care pending our arrival.\n\n6. Patrol per P.C. 6057 accompanied by Cst. H.B. JONES was again made to Oak Lake. W. WHITCOMBE was contacted and the Indian boys taken into our care. Names, addresses and ages of the boys being as stated in paragraph one of this report. As stated in para. 4 of this report it was learned that Mr. CHAPIN and an assistant were in Oak Lake, Man., previously by car and that they had returned to Griswold. In view of this fact patrol was made with the Indian boys to Griswold however all enquiries failed to reveal the whereabouts of the members of the staff at the Brandon Indian School.\n\n7. Previous to leaving Oak Lake, the matron of Brandon Indian School was contacted by phone and advised of the present whereabouts of the boys in question. Arrangements were also made with her to have some one from the school meet the C.P.R. local that same night as it was decided to place the boys on said train and have them returned to Brandon in that manner.\n\n8. When the officials of the Brandon Indian Residential School were not located in Griswold the aforementioned arrangements were carried out. The three Indian boys in question being placed on the Main Line C.P.R. local train at Griswold at 11.00 P.M., their train fares were paid by the writer and the conductor of the train was informed that the Indian boys would be sent in Brandon. Patrol then returned to Virden.\n\n9.

It was ascertained the mother of Noah WILLIAMS, Mrs. Radio PALKERT was working with her husband at the farm of Orlando SCHREIBER of the Margaret Dist., Mrs. PALKERT was interviewed and stated her son Noah, accompanied by SPENCE, called at her house at approx. 9 p.m. on the night of the 9th inst., having come to Minto by bus from Brandon the same night. Mrs. PALKERT then stated her son had no money she gave him a five dollar bill and he then left saying SPENCE and himself were going to Beloeuvain to look for jobs.

The children are not as well kept as they would be in school, and the Principal of Brandon has no objection to their admission as he has two or three children of approximately the same age.

Griswold Agency has one day school and the boarding school children are divided between the Lehret, Elkhorn and Brandon Schools.\n\nOn the Birtle Agency the children attend the Birtle School, Sandy Bay or Pine Creek.\n\nSwan Lake Reserve has a day school and a few attend Portage. Long Plain children practically all go to Portage. Roseau River is divided between Portage and the Fort Alexander School. The Lake Reserves have day schools and a few pupils are recruited for Elkhorn and Pine Creek. The Brokenhead Reserve has a day school, but a few pupils attend the Brandon School.\n\nIn the past Brandon secured some pupils from the reserve at Carlyle, Sintaluta, the Crooked Lakes Agency, Wood Mountain south of Saskatoon, and a few from around Prince Albert.\n\nThe Fisher River Agency send a few pupils to Brandon; but we have five good teachers on this Agency and naturally the parents prefer to have the children home.\n\nI am writing the Agents concerned in Manitoba requesting that they give this matter their special attention, and if they can find any neglected child or children not attending school to arrange for their physical examination and have them admitted to Brandon. I, however, am of the opinion that the best and most satisfying recruiting can be done by the Principals themselves. A trip in the summer to the various reserves establishes a real connection with the home life and the Indians naturally like to meet the one who supervises the care of their children. Mr. Chapin speaks the Indian language well and I am sure a little time spent by him in recruiting would bear good returns.\n\nA.G.

In my letter accompanying the March Quarterly Returns, I made requests for permission for certain pupils to remain in School another year, with notes as to the circumstances. Edwin Smith was one of the boys for whom permission is asked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRTC/TS\ndiscussing with his wife Elsie's future. They were both agreed that if at all possible they would like her to remain at school and continue with her studies, and asked for that favor. We feel that Elsie will measure up to whatever opportunity she may have.\n\nI trust that all the above pupils will receive favorable consideration. We feel that these are the ones that should have the opportunity of another year. There is a large graduating class so there will be ample room for new pupils coming in next fall.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. The Missionaries working on reserves at present are as follows:\n\nPipestone - Rev. S. H. Brown, Pipestone, Man.\nFisher River and Peguis - C. D. Street, Koostatak, Man.\nCarry-the-Kettle, Rev. T. L. Parker, Sintaluta, Sask.\nWhite Bear - Miss G. Casse, Carlyle, Sask.\nNorway House - Rev. D. D. Martin, Norway House, Man.\nCrooked Lake - Rev. A. C. Huston, Whitewood, Sask.\nLong Plains - Rev. R. C. Matthews, Edwin, Man.\nPeepeseksis - Rev. C. Bewell, Balcarres, Sask.\nNelson House - Mrs. J. T. Blackford, Nelson House, Man.\n(Mr. Blackford just recently died.)\nI would ask that the following pupils be allowed to return to this school for another year.\n\n495 Edwin Smith - He has been attending Brandon Collegiate this year taking his grade 11. He is much interested in the Air Force, is an active member of the Air Force Cadets. If this war continues he would like to have his grade 12 by the time he is old enough to enlist. A grant of $50. and his collegiate fees was allowed the School this year and I would ask the same for next year providing he passes his grade 11.\n\n560 Harry Kay - Harry came from Round Lake School last year and has proved one of our most diligent students, backed up by a very fine disposition. Harry is anxious to go on with his studies and I had a letter from his mother expressing the wish for him to continue at school. He has been taking grade 9 and could continue with his grade 10 in our classroom.\n\n567 Billy Queskekapow - Billy was sent from Norway House last year where he had completed his grade 8 in the day school. Billy has been making good progress in his grade 9 this year. His parents are anxious for him to continue and I believe that if the boy has a chance he will make good use of his education. He would take grade 10 next year.\n\n0431 Frances Wesley - Frances is only in grade 5 though she is 16 years of age. She did not get started to school very early. Her parents are not living on the reserve and the Agent concurred in my opinion that it would be better for the girl to remain in school for another year.\n\n0443 Hilda Favel - Hilda is a very reliable girl and a splendid student. She is taking her grade 9 this year. Her father wrote that he would like her to stay another year and get her grade 10 if possible. We feel that the extra development Hilda would get with another year at school would be well worth it to her in her years to come and we are anxious for her to have the chance.\n\n0554 Emily Bird - Emily has been taking grade 10 this year. She is looking forward to the nursing profession and has good qualities both in physique and disposition for the work. If her people will bear the extra expense of collegiate course we would ask that she be allowed to remain here another year.\n\n0557 Elsie Anderson - Elsie has been taking grade 9 this year. She has proved one of our most reliable girls and has worked hard. She is anxious to go on with her studies and has proved so by her diligence. I had a letter from her father who is in the forces. He said that he was just home on leave and was\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the March quarter return of the Brandon School, the Department approves the following pupils remaining for another year:\n\nNo. 560\n\" 567\n\" 0431\n\" 0443\n\" 0557\n\nNo. 0554, Emily Bird, may also remain, provided her relatives will bear the extra expense of the collegiate course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

In both cases the parents are stated to be living and the application forms also show that they have been attending the day school on the reserve.

He is not well now and cannot support his family. Nelson Linklater's father is away from Nelson House practically all the time trapping, and the family goes with him. The boy has very little opportunity of attending the Day School. This applies to quite a number of the Nelson House Indians, and it would be better for the children if they were sent to a Residential School. However, the parents are not willing to let them go. You will remember that the Department sent me a letter during the past year, saying that the Brandon School could take more pupils and if there were not any children in this Agency who should be sent there. I informed the Indians of this but very few were willing to allow their children to go to a residential school that was so far away.\n\nThe above named children are already in Brandon School and the school have already incurred considerable expense in connection with them. I recommend that they be left in school and admitted as grant earning pupils.\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 28, 1943.\n\nMr. S.

School, Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return of the Brandon Indian Residential School, the Department approves the discharge of the pupil No. 575 Robert Stevenson from the Brandon School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMarch 4, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Elijah SINCLAIR, 24,\nFisher River Band,\nKOOSTATAK, Man.\n\nThis young man has been a patient here at Fisher River Hospital, since March 2, 1942, with tuberculous disease of the right hip-joint. This has reacted well to treatment, and Elijah is now gradually increasing walking and other exercise, with a view to ultimate discharge. His hip is quite firmly fixed, though in a position which permits a moderately normal gait.\n\nUnfortunately, it is unlikely that Elijah could trap, hunt, fish, or do bush work for his livelihood without a breakdown. He is fortunate in having a Grade X, (Manitoba) education, and would like to finish High School, and possibly Grade XII and teach.\n\nIf the Department could arrange for Elijah to attend Brandon Residential School, I am sure that the institution would find him a definite asset in these days when competent assistance is so hard to obtain. We have found him a great help in managing our younger patients and I am sure the School would find him a similar asset in assisting with supervision and the like.\n\nA small sum in the way of salary would help Elijah with his own educational expenses and would definitely be money well spent.\n\nMay I recommend that Elijah's case receive your special consideration. I should be very glad to hear the Department's decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Director,\nDivision of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Doctor J.M. Ridge of the Fisher River Hospital, Hodgson, Manitoba. You will note his suggestion regarding Elijah Sinclair. It would be appreciated if you would let me know if you could give this young man employment as the Doctor suggests.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.T. Chapin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1944.\n\nDr. J.M. Ridge, Fisher River Hospital, Hodgson, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to Elijah Sinclair. I am writing to the Principal of the Brandon Residential School with a view to ascertaining if he can find it possible to accept your suggestion.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Residential School\n\nBrandon, Man., March 25, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to letter of the 10th (133-0-10) in reference to Elijah Sinclair and the suggestion of his working in the School and at the same time taking his Grade XII.\n\nInspector Hamilton was to be in Brandon so I left the matter over to talk with him as I did not exactly agree with Dr. Ridge's suggestion as you have interpreted it. I am in hearty accord with Elijah coming here to finish his High School work and then taking his Normal. I believe that wherever there is ability and the will to work the opportunity ought to be given to make something of it. Grade XII is not necessary for Normal. Elijah could come here and take his Grade XI in the Brandon Collegiate. His progress in that grade could determine his ability to go on further. Being out of school for some time he might require two years to get his Grade XI. But I do not think the idea of taking employment in the School while studying is sound. There is very little time to do any work of account. The truck leaves the School at 8.30 in the morning taking the children in and it is about 4.45 when they get back in the afternoon. The Collegiate pupils have considerable home work to do, which they must attend to if they are to make progress. Saturday would be the only spare time he would have to speak of. Anyway, the pupils in the school are expected to do certain duties to be helpful.\n\nI would suggest that Elijah be sent to the School as a regular grant-earning pupil, with the usual extra grant for Collegiate pupils (Collegiate fees and $50.). Whatever spare time he has to be used remuneratively will be recognized.\n\nyours truly,\n\nR.T. Chapin\nOttawa,\nMarch 28, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to Elijah Sinclair. In view of the special circumstances in this case, it has been decided to agree to your suggestion and the Department will allow the regular per capita grant, plus the collegiate fees and $50 for him. We should receive reports from time to time regarding his progress.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.T. Chapin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa,\nMarch 28, 1944.\n\nDr. J.M. Ridge, Fisher River Hospital, Hodgson, Man.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 4th instant and my reply of the 10th instant, with reference to Elijah Sinclair. It has now been arranged to have him accepted at the Brandon Indian Residential School. I am not certain whether you wish to send him to the school at the present time or if he will wait until the opening of the new academic year on September 1. In any case you may now communicate with the Principal and complete the arrangements.\n\nThe Principal, after conferring with Inspector Hamilton, points out that it will not be feasible to accept your suggestion to employ Sinclair in some minor position for which he would be paid while attending high school.

Please let me know if authority will be forthcoming.\n\nApparently Mr. Chapin misunderstood my original suggestion, which was that Elijah might be of help to the school authorities in supervising the younger children rather than that he should actually work for his living.

He states she left him and the children last week and is gone with another man. His children are:\n\n- Frances 13\n- Russell 11\n- Billian 7\n- Robert 4\n- Ralph 2\n\nHe has arranged for the keep of Robert and Ralph but would like the three older children in School. Both McKenny and his wife attended the Brandon School.\n\nA letter giving the Department's decision would be appreciated.\n\nA.G.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant,\nwith reference to the request of Robert James\nMcKenny for the admission of his children to\nthe Brandon Residential School.\n\nPlease let me know exactly what you\nmean by the term \"Non-treaty children.\" It\nmight be inferred from the first paragraph of\nyour letter that McKenny was enfranchised at\nsome time in the past, although I have been\nunable to locate any definite information to\nthis effect on any of our files. Where is he\nresiding at the present time?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Ralph Maybank, K.C., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOnce again I am forced to call upon you for assistance in a very vital matter. The facts of the case have to do with some of my children which have been left with me to look after, my wife having left my bed and board.\n\nThe problem at present is how I am going to place the three eldest in a place which will do the most good to them. I had in mind trying to get them admitted into the Indian Residential School at Brandon, of which institution myself and wife are former pupils. The difficulty, however, seems to hinge around these children not being treaty Indians. Both myself and wife were treaty Indians at the time we were pupils there and there were then quite a number of children who were not in treaty. However, the restrictions must have been tightened up somewhat. I am of the opinion however that the thing could be swung around in my favour, with a helping from you. Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies is forwarding a request to Ottawa in regard to the case.\n\nI have five (5) children on my hands right now, and as I mentioned I would very much like to get the three (3) eldest, a girl of 13, boy of 11, girl of 7, off my hands. The two youngest ages 4 & 2 years, both boys (Robert & Ralph), I would put in care of a friend of mine.\n\nI am sure you can do a lot in this matter so will leave it to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"R.

One of these boys has no knowledge whatsoever of English although they have got along as well as can be expected in the Industrial School. They are definitely out of their element and I feel that if they can be transferred to the Indian School at Brandon or some similar institution that far greater progress could be made with them. They do not appear to be bad boys and I do not believe would give the authorities in any school to which they were admitted, undue trouble. I am wondering, therefore, if it would be possible for the Indian Department to arrange such a transfer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHILD WELFARE BRANCH,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nKSA:BD\nRegina, November 23rd, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am herewith forwarding a letter received from the Director of the Child Welfare Branch, Mr. K.S.

You will have the police reports in Ottawa where these two boys were sent to the Industrial School here for mistreating a horse in such a manner as to cause it unnecessary suffering contrary to Section 542 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\n\nYou will note what Mr. Armstrong has to say about these boys being transferred to the Brandon School or some other Indian institution of that kind. You will further note Mr. Armstrong states one of the boys has no knowledge of English whatsoever.\n\nI went over to see Mr. Armstrong a few days ago as there were several matters he wanted to discuss with me. It was he, however, who suggested sending the boys to the Brandon School. He is acquainted with the Indian schools having been at one time missionary amongst the Indians with the Methodist Church in northern Manitoba.\n\nI hope you will give this matter due consideration.\n\nM. Christiansen,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nReturn to Mr. Phelan\nOttawa,\nDecember 1, 1944.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to Amelek Roberts and Adam Bird. I note your suggestion that they be sent to the Brandon Residential School. In this regard I may say that we have had reports that during the past year the discipline at this school was not all that could be desired. Recently a new Principal has taken charge and we are hopeful that he will be able to control the discipline. However, at the present time we hesitate to send two other boys, who might prove to be problem cases. Is there no Protestant school in the province of Saskatchewan in which these boys could be placed? I should appreciate your giving the matter further thought and writing to me again. I may add that Reverend Mr. Ellis, Principal of the St. Alban's School at Prince Albert, was in the Department last week and it is evident from what he says that that particular school cannot accommodate additional pupils at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. S.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss Winnifred Goforth, who has been attending High School in Balcarres for the past two months, wishes to apply for a transfer to Brandon Indian School. During this time she has been rather unhappy in her association with white children and has not received proper supervision while there. Her parents feel that she needs the supervision provided by a residential school and are very much in favor of the change. I have been in communication with Principal Strapp of Brandon and he is quite willing that she be enrolled at his school, as he is short of pupils at the present time.\n\nI would be pleased, Mr. Simpson, if you would take this matter up with the Department with a view to having the necessary permission granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. L. Dobbin\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the File Hills Residential School pertaining to having Winnifred Goforth admitted into the Brandon Residential School.\n\nWinnifred will be nineteen years old next February. At present she is taking grade XI work and she is the daughter of Ernest Goforth #49 Peepeekisis Band. She is anxious to procure her Grade 12 standing.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1944.\n\nMr. S.H. Simpson, Indian Agent, Balcarres, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant, the Department approves the transfer of Winnifred Deforth from the File Hills Residential School to the Brandon Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 133-0-10 of the 1st instant in connection with Amelek Roberts and Adam Bird who are in the Industrial School here.\n\nIn reply I took up the matter of their admittance with the File Hills School at Balcarres and I also took up the matter with the Reverend Mr. Badham who is Secretary of the Synod of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle to try to have them admitted to the Gordon's School but both schools have refused to admit them. The St. Alban's School in Prince Albert, I believe, is crowded to the roof therefore it is out of the question to send them there. Furthermore the Round Lake School is overcrowded and the only other Protestant institution in this province is the Lac La Ronge School. The only way we could send the boys there would be by aeroplane and as you know, the discipline there is rather lax.\n\nI believe there is room for these boys in the Brandon School and I feel sure that the Reverend Mr. Strapp, the Principal there, could handle them because I became acquainted with him when he was in Ottawa. In view of this I would ask you to again consider sending these boys to the Brandon School, and I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible. I have informed Mr. Armstrong that I am unable to get the boys into any Protestant Boarding School in this province and that I have therefore referred the matter back to Ottawa.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 19, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nTwo Indian boys from the Montreal Lake Reserve were recently placed in the Industrial School at Regina for unlawfully and cruelly ill-treating a horse in such a manner as to cause it unnecessary suffering or injury, contrary to Section 542 of the Criminal Code of Canada. One of these boys has no knowledge of English and both of them are reported to be out of their element at the white industrial school and officials feel that they should be placed in an Indian residential school. We would be pleased if you would accept them at Brandon, as I believe they would make more progress with you than at the institution in which they have been placed. Their names and ages are:\n\nAmelek Roberts, age 16\nAdam Bird, age 13.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend O. B.

Police to the Brandon School on Tuesday, January 16th, and they were given transportation under Warrant P 18833.\n\nIt was necessary to purchase a mackinaw coat for each boy and I am attaching our voucher in favour of the Army and Navy Department Store here in the amount of $17.90.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThere is a matter regarding runaway children from Indian Residential Schools upon which I would like your advice.\n\nDuring the nearly eight years in which I have been here, I have cooperated in every possible way in returning the runaway children to their schools. This has been no small job at times either.\n\nThe principals of nearby schools sit in their office, telephone me that some children have run away, and ask me to round up these children and see that they return to school. I have always rounded them up, but personally I feel that when these Residential Schools take charge of the children, it is their duty to get out themselves and round up their absent pupils.\n\nWould you kindly advise just what my duties are in these cases, and what are the duties of the Principal?\n\nW. Young,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, February 19, 1945.\n\nMr. W. Young, Indian Agent, Griswold, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to returning truant children to Indian residential schools.\n\nFor your information, I enclose copies of circular letters of May 6, 1941, and June 21, 1942. A review of these two letters indicates the Department's wishes, and, in brief, it may be said that we expect full co-operation between all our officials in returning truant pupils. You will note, in the third paragraph of circular letter of May 6, 1941, that principals are expected to put forth every effort to return absentee pupils before calling on Indian agents and other officials to assist them. At the same time, as stated in the circular letter, and as mentioned above, we expect our officials to co-operate with one another.\n\nIt is realized that there are certain seasons of the year when Indian agents and farming instructors are particularly busy, especially in connection with farming activities, and at such periods of the year principals should only expect the minimum of help from agents and farming instructors.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name:\nAge:\nName of Band:\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.:\nMother's full name and No.:\nParents living or dead:\nState of child's health:\nReligion:\nDoes applicant speak English?:\nPreviously attended school for years:\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

It was hanging fire for a considerable period before I left Muncey. I am enclosing the copy of my letter dated July 2nd, in reply to your inquiry of June 29, 1945.\n\nOur registration is not by any means where I would like to see it as we only have 127 registered at September last. There is a number of children on the reserve at Carlyle, Sask., who should be in school. I went up to see what could be done about it last Monday but did not get any satisfaction, other than \"When a teacher is appointed we will see what can be done\" from Mr. J.R. Morrison, the Farm Instructor. There will be a surplus above the rating of the school there of about 20 children for whom no accommodation can be made. I felt that some effort should be made to get this group lined up for us as when the matter is allowed to drift we lose per capita grant that we need, as our overhead is running on all the while, and the children, when they do arrive, are so far behind in their work that they disrupt the classes seriously by their late entrance.\n\nMr. Kerley has promised to get in touch with me when he can make any arrangements to send the children down.\n\nA line to our Toronto office might speed things up a little, I think that Mrs. Loveys is the secretary concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I do not know if he has taken any action towards getting the girls back.\n\nMrs. McCallum, a relative of Kenneth's came in today and stated Kenneth had been expelled. I phoned Brandon to find out the particulars and was told Mr. Strapp had left. The Matron, Mrs. Cochrane, said Kenneth had been expelled and Mr. Strapp put him on the train yesterday. Kenneth's mother is dead and his Father is in the Army, at present stationed at MacDonald near Portage. Kenneth has no home to go to and I am at a loss to know what to do.\n\nI would like to know:\n\n1. Has Mr. Strapp permission to leave the School?\n2. Who has been left in charge?\n3.

Apparently the Principal at Brandon is willing to accept them.\n\nGrace Myran has been a bad influence, has been truant for a number of days and the Principal feels that the girl would do better in a new environment. Royce Myran has been babied by his parents, who make frequent visits to the school with candy, toys etc. Last Thursday the mother of the boy was especially abusive and assaulted one of the teachers. The transfer of this boy would be a disciplinary measure effecting both the boy and the parents.\n\nI understand that Brandon School is anxious to obtain pupils and there will be no difficulty here in replacing the children if transferred. I strongly recommend that approval be granted.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 29, 1946.\n\nMr. J.

They left Brandon, he believed on or about April 13th last. He asked that the boys be returned to the Residential School, stating that it would be useless to follow the procedure sometimes followed, i.e., place the boys on the train and have them return to the school themselves.\n\nBeing engaged on other important police duties this date re: John Michael MILDENBERGER & Alfred SHARPE - B.B. & Theft (460) Manor and Milestone, Sask., I was unable to take this matter in hand this date.

Consequently having other matters to attend to, I returned to Carlyle at 4:30 P.M.\n\nOn this date a further patrol was made per police auto to the Reserve, accompanied by Const. Mahoney, the juveniles were located and taken into our custody, under the provisions of section 10, sub-section 4 of the Indian Act - they were brought into Carlyle. I contacted the Farm Instructor, and advised him that I had located the four boys in question. The ages of the boys were as follows - Norman 15 years, Howard and David 11 years, and Clifford 13 years.\n\nThe farm instructor having advised me that the Principal, The Rev. O.B. Strupp, of the Residential school referred to had requested that the delinquents be returned under escort, due to the fact that he was of the opinion that they would not return themselves.\n6. Upon returning to Carlyle, I contacted the W.S.D. Office, Weyburn, Sask., by long distance telephone, reported the facts to the O.C., and it was suggested that the delinquents be returned under escort, and it was arranged that this procedure be followed.\n\n7. Patrol left Carlyle per police auto this date, at 4 P.M., accompanied by Const.

This request and examination being obtained at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThis matter has been taken up with Juvenile Judge Hamilton who advised the writer that providing the medical examinations have been completed on the 17-6-46 he will order that the girls be returned to the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nA member of the Winnipeg Detachment will attend Juvenile Court on the 17-6-46 in this connection.\n\nFORWARDED 19-6-46 for your information and file record.\n\nWhen bringing any prisoner to Winnipeg, or person being detained such as this file records, a short covering report should be drafted before leaving Winnipeg to show what has been done.\n\nThe original instructions were that these girls were to be returned to Brandon, and through some misunderstanding, they have been brought before the Juvenile Court and now they are being released for return to the Home at Brandon.\n\nIt is reasoned here that the difficulty arose over the name of Judge F.A.E. Hamilton and Inspector Hamilton of the Department of Indian Affairs, but this should have\n\n(Cont.

Elizabeth has completed grade VIII with a strong recommendation from her teacher for grade IX. However as she is now over 17 years of age and has been offered a position at our Indian hospital at Halfway near Hodgson I suggested to her that she take the position at least for the holiday period and then decide what she really wanted to do about coming back to school.\n\nI feel sure that Elizabeth will decide to stay out of school when September comes and therefore recommend that she be granted the Diploma.\n\nI would be glad to have your opinion as to the advisability or otherwise of confining the recipients of the diplomas to those attaining at least grade VIII.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 11, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant, the discharge of Elizabeth Cochrane No. 0430 is approved.

We are considerably under our normal pupilage and could very easily look after the senior pupils who, if they miss a year, will not go back to school at all.\n\nI shall be glad to have your reaction to this suggestion and will arrange to meet any that may be coming down at the boat in Winnipeg with our school bus.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\nOttawa, July 23, 1946.\n\nMr. E.B. Goodman, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nFrom recent correspondence you are aware that we intend to operate a day school at Norway House during the coming academic year. The operation of this school will provide for those children whose home conditions are suitable. However, it is quite possible that there are a number of Protestant Indian children whose home conditions are unsuitable and who will require institutional care for the coming academic year. Accommodation can be secured for these at the Brandon Indian Residential School which is operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible the names of any children who you consider should be sent to Brandon this fall. I might add that the Brandon School teaches High School work. It is possible that some of the Senior pupils who formerly attended the Norway House Residential School will profit by attending the Brandon School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nHerewith please find the returns for the quarter ending June 30, 1946.\n\nThe following pupils having passed an examination for promotion are recommended as follows for the year September 1st\u2014June 30th:\n\nGrade XI. 0589 Marion Bear; 0587 Margaret Hudson; 0588 Lorna Kirkness; 0436 Elsie Royal; 590 Bruce Gaddie.\n\nGrade X. 0605 Florence Beardy; 0423 Jean Flett; 0602 Harriet Fiddler; 0419 Gladys Hall; 0598 Doris Stevenson; 0604 Joyce Whitehawk; 597 Walter Stonechild.\n\nGrade IX. 0446 Virginia Hall; 0454 Margaret Moar; 0448 Muriel Smith; 0484 Clara Thomas.\n\nGrade XII. 0552 Winnie Goforth; 0557 Elsie Anderson; Both on condition that examination results when received are satisfactory.\n\nThe following pupils aged 16 are recommended for further study:\n\n0498 Norma Eastman, Grade VIII not completed. 0432 Elizabeth Williams, Home conditions unsatisfactory. 0579 Elsie Kakakeway, 0583 Margaret Crate, 0586 Gertie Mallett, 0592 Alma Thickfoot, 0597 Lena Crowe. These girls are behind in their work because of irregular attendance at day schools previous to their entering this school.\n\nThe usual grants are requested for the students, grades IX to XII.\nclusive. Grade IX and X $25.00 additional to per capita. Grade XI and XII $50.00 additional to per capita and Collegiate fees.\n\nThe following former pupils who were recommended for discharge September 1946 were picked up by R.C.M.P. because of unsatisfactory conduct and were remanded to the West Kildonan Detention Home for Medical Examination and on their discharge by agreement with Mr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg, were brought to this school under escort. They present quite a problem and I would respectfully recommend that they be placed on the roll of this school as of July 1st, but that in the event that they again absent themselves without permission that they be considered definitely discharged.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S.

He is very anxious to go on and as this is such a rare condition among Indian boys it seems to me that he should be given every encouragement to do so.

Police to return three boys, George Pewean, Howard and Norman Shepherd, to the school after they had run away.\n\nJohn Shepherd ran away from the Brandon School toward the end of the last school term and he and his sister were intentionally not available when the children were being gathered up for return to the Brandon School at the beginning of this term, therefore it seemed advisable to have the two of them returned at the same time as the truant boys.\n\nI am sure that the Honourable T.C. Douglas would agree that a small house with a Tubercular mother and several small children is not an ideal situation. This is one of the cases where I believe that the residential school gives its best service in relieving a sick mother or some of the work of the home and removing healthy children from daily contact with a tubercular person in a small house. If children from houses of this kind are not justifiably placed in residential schools, whether the father is willing or unwilling, then I believe we have little excuse for continuing to operate residential schools.\n\nJ.P.B.

With the exception of Clifford\nrunning away from the school, the two children have been good\nat school. They came home for the summer holidays and did not\nreturn with the other pupils. John Shepherd asked Rev. Fr.\nLaviolette if they could attend the St. Francis Day School, he\nwas told that they would have to be discharged first. However\nno application for transfer was requested.\n\nOne of the reasons for sending the children to\nBrandon in the first place was owing to the bad health of Mrs.\nShepherd, she has T.B. and was a patient at the Fort Qu'Appelle Hospital for nearly a year. There are seven children in\nthis family and they live in a small house, John is a fair\nprovider and his wife is a fairly good housekeeper, it is four\nmiles to the White Bear School and two miles to the St. Francis\nSchool. I believe that all the children of school age in this\nfamily should go to Residential School, unless John builds an\naddition to the house or a new and larger one, and hires a girl\nto assist his wife. John Shepherd was informed several times\nthat until the children were discharged they would have to re-\nturn to Brandon Residential School.\n\nThree boys, George Pewean, Howard and Norman Shep-\nherd ran away from Brandon School and I requested the R.C.M.P.\nto escort them back and at the same time to take Clifford and\nVerna Shepherd.\n\nW.

On this date, information having been received that the four boys mentioned in the memo referred to above, had returned to the White Bear Indian Reserve, near Carlyle, Sask., a patrol was made this date per police auto to that point, accompanied by Const. Mahoney.\n\n2. On arrival at the Reserve, only two of the boys could be located i.e., Cecil THOMPSON and Clifford SHEPPARD, referred to as SHIFORD - in the memo.\n\n3. Some four hours was spent in trying to locate the other two delinquents, without result, they were well aware that we were awaiting their return from the bush, it being impossible to follow them, due to the numerous trails in the bush, and having no idea in which direction they had travelled, and also to the exceptionally heavy condition of the roads over which we had to travel. I was forced to abandon the search for the two boys, and be content with the two I had located, for the time being.\n\n4. The farm instructor was notified of the locating of the two boys mentioned, and he will be on the lookout for the other two, who apparently took to the bush, as soon as our presence on the reserve was learned.\n\n5. Patrol returned to Carlyle at 4:30 P.M., this date, and left again at 5:30 P.M., enroute to Brandon, Man.; upon arrival the two boys were handed over to the matron at the Brandon Indian Residential school. Patrol left Brandon at 10:30 A.M. 29-11-46, intending to return to Carlyle, but due to the difficult driving conditions, upon arrival at Souris, Man., the patrol was abandoned, and remained at that point for the balance of the night.\n\n29-11-46.\n\n6. Patrol left Souris at 9:10 A.M., this date, attending to other police duties at Redvers, Sask., enroute, patrol eventually returned to Carlyle at 1 P.M.\n\n7.

T. C. Douglas, Premier of Saskatchewan, Regina, Sask., with further reference to the removal from day school of Clifford and Verna, children of John Shepherd, Moose Mountain Reserve, Carlyle, and suggesting that these children be returned to their parents on probation.\n\nPlease have a letter prepared for the Minister's signature to the Hon. Mr. Douglas.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nMr. Hoey:\nFor draft reply as requested.\nCOPY\n\nPREMIER'S OFFICE\n\nRegina, December 11, 1946.\n\nHonorable J. A. Glen,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nOn September 27th I telegraphed you with respect to the case of Clifford and Verma, children of John Shepherd of Moose Mountain Indian Reserve at Carlyle, who were removed from a day school which they had been attending at that reserve and sent, under police escort, to the Brandon Indian School.\n\nOn October 1st, your secretary, Mr. W.J.F. Pratt, wrote to me, setting out certain facts relating to the case of these children, and a further letter was sent on October 15th. It was there pointed out that in view of the home conditions of these children, it was in their best interests to be enrolled in a residential school.\n\nSince receiving this communication, I have heard further from representatives of this Reserve who have advised me that the boy, Clifford, has again run away from the Brandon Residential School and returned home by hitch hiking and on foot. I understand that he travelled through a severe blizzard and returned home ill-clothed and in a weakened condition. I understand, also, that two boys, being the sons of Jim Thompson of the Indian Reserve at Sintaluta, have also run away from the Brandon school, and these incidents have caused grave concern among the Indians of the district. The information which they receive is to the effect that the children in the Brandon Residential School are not properly cared for, that they do not receive sufficient supervision or training, and that the food is inadequate.\n\nWith particular regard to the case of the Shepherd children,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-10, part 16)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nchildren, I am advised that although the mother was ill for some time, at present she is in reasonably good health. Mr. Shepherd has a shack consisting of two rooms which, while it is certainly not adequate or proper, is yet better kept and larger than the majority of other dwellings on the same Reserve. The Indians of the Carlyle district have pointed out that the Shepherd children are as well behaved and can be as well cared for on the Reserve as at the Brandon School, and they have made strong representations that action be taken to return these two children to their home.\n\nI think it might be a good idea to review the possibility of returning these children to their parents on probation. If the situation is thereby improved, their training in the day school may be placed upon a permanent basis; otherwise they may be returned to the Residential School at Brandon. I do think, however, that it would be in the best interests of the Indians of this area to give the children a trial with their parents, since there exists real concern that, should these boys attempt another escape from the Brandon School during the winter months, they may be frozen and suffer severe injury.\n\nThanking you for looking into this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.)

Ostrander, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n413-414 Post Office Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nThe following is a copy of a letter received from O. B. Strapp,\nPrincipal of the Brandon Residential School:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Kerley:\n\nI beg to advise that I can no longer accept responsibility for Clifford Shepherd from the White Bear Reserve.\n\nAbout two weeks ago he ran away and took Kenneth Sammy and David Shepherd with him. I traced them for about 8 miles and then obtained that assistance of the R.C.M.P. to return them to the school. I had considerable trouble, after the constable left us, with Clifford and eventually had to use force to put him in the dormitory of the school.\n\nTwo days ago he again made a plan to run away and take David with him but I heard of it in time and so was able to prevent their getting away. I have been holding Clifford in confinement and shall do so until I hear from you as to what disposition should be made of his case.\n\nI am afraid that if given his freedom he will take one of these smaller boys away with him and that they might freeze in a straw stack during the night.\n\nI do not think that either George Pewan or David Littlechief should be returned to this school as they have always been a source of trouble from their first year in school. Some of the Albert schools are in need of pupils, especially Edmonton, and perhaps they might do better if transferred there.\n\nI have registration of 176 this year and cannot any longer have the rest of the school upset by these three boys. Something must be done with them at once for the sake of the rest of the pupils.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. Oliver B. Strapp, Principal.\"\nI have been in touch with the Matron at the school as Mr. Strapp was away. Clifford Shepherd is being kept in the dormitory and his meals are being taken up to him. The R.C.M.P. were there during the last week making an investigation at the request of the Saskatchewan Provincial Government.\n\nSgd. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Indian Agent Mr. W.J.D. Kerley, of the Crooked Lake Agency, regarding truancy of Clifford Shepherd, Kenneth Sammy, David Shepherd, George Pewean, and David Littlechief, of the White Bear Band.\n\nApparently Mr. Strapp is under the impression that Clifford Shepherd should be sent to some other residential school as he is unable to handle him. I do not know of any school which I would recommend for this purpose and I do not like to transfer a boy from one residential school to another by way of punishment as this may lead the parents to look upon residential schools as houses of correction.\n\nIt would also appear to me that Mr. Strapp wishes to be relieved of responsibility for these boys who have been troublesome, and either return them to the reserve for the Departmental officials to worry about or transfer them to another school principal for the same purpose. If boys of this kind cannot be handled in the Brandon School surely they cannot be handled any better if turned loose on the reserve. A residential school under good management does not usually have a great deal of trouble with the boys. Teaching the boys to like the school and the school staff by making their spare time a little more pleasant seems to be the only answer.\n\nI have not visited the Brandon School and I have not met Mr. Strapp, but I believe there are better ways of correcting the trouble than as suggested by Mr. Strapp. I wrote the Department on the 2nd instant enclosing affidavits of two parents of the White Bear Reserve who were complaining about the Brandon School. I have not had an answer to this letter and therefore do not know what action the Department has taken about it, if any.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of the letter of Mr. Kerley, copy of which is enclosed, it seems to me that it is rather extraordinary for the R.C.M. Police to make an investigation at the Brandon School at the request of the Saskatchewan Government and I am wondering if the Department knows anything about this.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, January 2, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Douglas:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 11, 1946.\n\nAn R.C.M.P. report has been received concerning the truancy of Clifford Shepherd on October 15, 1946. In this report, no mention was made of the severe weather conditions at the time. A further report has been requested from the Principal of the Brandon School about this incident.\n\nYour comments concerning the care, training, supervision and food at this school are not in agreement with reports we have received.\n\nIn April, 1946, the Manitoba Provincial School Inspector reported satisfactorily on this school. Of the senior teacher he reports: \"a conscientious and earnest teacher with good discipline\". Of the intermediate teacher he reports: \"she has a pleasant and sympathetic manner and as a result appeared to have the goodwill of the pupils. Her discipline was good and quietly obtained. I consider the progress of the pupils to be reasonably good\". Of the junior teacher he reports: \"This teacher appears to be doing good work. She exhibits sympathy and understanding and has the right type of approach to children of this type and particularly at the grade level with which she is working. Her discipline is good and correctly obtained. Her methods are good and are modified to meet the needs of individual pupils.\n\nHonourable T. C.

The girls receive training in food preparation and cookery, under the direction of the cook. The dietitian reported as follows concerning the interest of the staff in the feeding arrangements for the children: \"The Principal and the remainder of the staff expressed keen interest in obtaining assistance of the food service and nutrition education. The consideration of the native tendencies of the Indians and their reserve influences in relation to a nutrition education approach were discussed\".\n\nA copy of this report has been sent to the Principal so that he can take advantage of the dietary service being offered to our schools by the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nI will write to you further upon receiving a copy of the report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A search of the September quarter returns for the White Bear Indian Day School and the St. Francis Indian Day School does not show that either of these children was registered at either of these day schools. It is quite possible of course that the teacher, realizing the children's status, may have permitted attendance without registration.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\n\nDecember 31, 1946.\n\nFile 209-11B-Dec.28, 1946.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am in receipt of your communication of the above noted date and file number, with the enclosures.\n\nI beg to report as follows:\n\nI am informed by reliable Indians from the Moose Mountain Reserve, Sask., that the trouble with the John Shepherd family has originated from the activities of the teacher and other interested parties connected with the recently instituted R.C. Day School on that reserve.\n\nI am informed that a number of the people were persuaded to move from their usual place of abode to the vicinity of the new school during the past summer. When school opened in September, without consulting either the Indian Agent or the resident Farm Instructor, pupils from certain Residential Schools were registered and attended classes. As the method of the registration was irregular these pupils were returned to their respective schools under escort.\n\nNo. 585 Clifford Shepherd and his sister No. 0578 were returned to Brandon on September 24th.\n\nClifford has been absent without leave as follows:\n\nOctober 9th, about 8.00 A.M. taking with him a new pupil Victor Bruce. They were returned by R.C.M.P. escort on October 11th.\nNovember 4th, in company with George Pewan and David Little-Chief. Returned November 28th by R.C.M.P.\n\nDecember 3rd, Miss. Cochrane, the Matron, reported that Clifford and two other boys, Kenneth Sammey and Davis Shepherd, were missing. I immediately got out the car and drove out #1 highway, west from Brandon for about 10 miles, making inquiry at various farm houses along the way. I did not get any trace of the boys and returned to the school. About 2:30 P.M. I received a telephone call to the effect that three boys were walking along the Canadian Pacific Railway about 1 mile from Kennay. I called the R.C.M.P. and the officer in charge sent a constable out with me. We located the boys and after some time were able to get down the line to them. On the return trip I left the constable at his headquarters and returned with the boys to the school. Just as we entered the school Clifford made an attempt to run away again and put up quite a fight. I was compelled to use considerable force to remove him to the dormitory. About a week later Clifford told Davis Shepherd to get ready to run away with him again. Davis confided in Kenneth Sammey and tried to persuade him to go with them. Kenneth did not want to go and so came to my office and made a report of the matter.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter I addressed to Mr. Agent Kerley, of Broadview, Sask.\n\nWith reference to the charges of lack of supervision, poor instruction, and inadequate food; the boys are given about 4 hours a day of free time during which they are permitted to attend their trap lines, go sleighing and skating, or play games and read periodicals in their reading room. On Saturday afternoons they are permitted to visit Brandon to sell their pelts, do shopping, or attend the theatres.\n\nThe complaint is made and has been made since residential schools were first instituted that the food is inadequate. My reply to this complaint is \"look at the children\". In this connection I have prepared a list, from our card index of all the pupils, of the weights of the pupils from the Moose Mountain Reserve giving the weights when they returned from summer holidays and their present weights.\n\nI am free to admit that they do not get the type of food they are used to having on the reservations, I am concerned with providing, as adequately as finances will permit, the type of food that will build good strong bodies and am satisfied that in this we are getting results.\n| Name                  | Normal weight for age & height | Weight on reg. after holidays | Weight at present |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Verna Belanger        | 112 lbs.                      | 106 lbs.                      | 109 lbs.         |\n| Virginia Bigstone     | 118                           | 125                           | 130              |\n| Lorraine Standing-    | 108                           | 109                           | 108              |\n| Ready                 |                               |                               |                  |\n| Phyllis               | 80                            | 77                            | 85               |\n| Peggy Paul            | 95                            | 78                            | 84               |\n| Esther Metanspe       | 100                           | 95                            | 102              |\n| Thelma Samney         | 89                            | 72                            | 79               |\n| Viola Thompson        | 78                            | 79\u00bd                           | 83               |\n| Verna Shepherd        | 67                            | 60                            | 66               |\n| Norman Shepherd       | 129                           | 128                           | 130              |\n| Cecil Thompson        | 125                           | 105                           | 115              |\n| Nelson Thompson       | 98                            | 91                            | 105              |\n| Clifford Shepherd     | 98                            | 97                            | 96               |\n| David Little Chief    | 99                            | 95                            | (Nov) 95         |\n| Howard Shepherd       | 108                           | 108                           | 116\u00bd             |\n| Davis Shepherd        | 81                            | 71                            | 85               |\n| Kenneth Samney        | 85                            | 79                            | 85               |\n| Kenneth Standing-     | 54                            | 49                            | 54               |\n| Ready                 |                               |                               |                  |\nWith reference to the training. All the pupils from grade IV to grade VIII inclusive receive training which is fitted as nearly as circumstances will permit to the strength and the ability of the individual child. I have endeavoured as much as possible to cut down the amount of work to be done in order that time may be given to instruction, but as the per capita grant is based upon the presumption that the pupils will do productive work, instruction is frequently crowded out entirely or is reduced to the minimum necessary to get the work done.\n\nI think that perhaps the chief cause of complaint is the fact that I have discontinued the practice of feeding all the folk who come for a visit, three meals a day, for anything from one day to ten days. I was compelled to do this about a year and a half ago when representations were made to me by certain of the parents of our pupils, to the effect that we were expected to use the funds provided to feed the pupils and not visitors. Since that time I have had several inquiries from some of the folk who had been in the habit of paying extended visits and they are always complaining that it used to be done and therefore should be continued.\n\nIn closing, may I say that this school is always open to visitors. Parents and relatives are made welcome and facilities are provided for them to visit with their children, entirely free from any supervision or intrusion from any member of our school staff. Either the Matron, Miss Cochrane, or myself make a point of greeting the visitors and arranging for the pupils to meet with them at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI trust that this will give you the information required.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. O.B. STRAPP.\n\nPrincipal.\nDecember 17, 1946.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview,\nSask.\n\nDear Mr. Kerley:\n\nI beg to advise that I can no longer accept responsibility for Clifford Shepherd from the White Bear Reserve.\n\nAbout two weeks ago he ran away and took Kenneth Sammy and Davis Shepherd with him. I traced them for about 8 miles and then obtained the assistance of the R.C.M.P. to return them to the school. I had considerable trouble after the constable left us with Clifford and eventually had to use force to put him in the dormitory at the school.\n\nTwo days ago he again made a plan to run away and take Davis with him but I heard of it in time and so was able to prevent their getting away. I have been holding Clifford in confinement and shall do so until I hear from you as to what disposition should be made of his case.\n\nI am afraid that if given his freedom he will take one of these away with him and that they might freeze in a straw stack during the night.\n\nI do not think that either George Pewson or David Little Chief should be returned to this school as they have always been a source of trouble from their first year in school. Some of the Alberta schools are in need of pupils, especially Edmonton, and perhaps they might do better if transferred there.\n\nI have a registration of 176 this year and cannot any longer have the rest of the school upset by these three boys. Something must be done with them at once for the sake of the rest of the pupils.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. O.B. STRAPP.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Your file 133-0-10 (W.T.)\ndated December 24th, 1945.\n\nI enclose a copy of the report submitted by the Reverend Mr. Strapp dealing with the matter referred to by the Honourable T.G. Douglas, Premier of Saskatchewan. You will note that on December 17th Mr. Strapp wrote Agent Kerley at Broadview, stating something must be done with the boys as he did not wish them in the school. I would suggest Mr. Kerley be advised by Ottawa what action to take.\n\nALG. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnclos.\nOttawa, January 2, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Douglas:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 11, 1946.\n\nAn R.C.M.P. report has been received concerning the truancy of Clifford Shepherd on October 15, 1946. In this report, no mention was made of the severe weather conditions at the time. A further report has been requested from the Principal of the Brandon School about this incident.\n\nYour comments concerning the care, training, supervision and food at this school are not in agreement with reports we have received.\n\nIn April, 1946, the Manitoba Provincial School Inspector reported satisfactorily on this school. Of the senior teacher he reports: \"A conscientious and earnest teacher with good discipline\". Of the intermediate teacher he reports: \"She has a pleasant and sympathetic manner and as a result appeared to have the goodwill of the pupils. Her discipline was good and quietly obtained. I consider the progress of the pupils to be reasonably good\". Of the junior teacher he reports: \"This teacher appears to be doing good work. She exhibits sympathy and understanding and has the right type of approach to children of this type and particularly at the grade level with which she is working. Her discipline is good and correctly obtained. Her methods are good and are modified to meet the needs of individual pupils.\"\n\nHonourable T. C. Douglas,\nPremier of Saskatchewan,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\n........... where\nwhere this becomes necessary. I consider her classroom work to be very satisfactory.\n\nThis school has students from Grades I to X and we have Indian pupils in Grade XI going daily to the Brandon High School.\n\nA dietitian from the Department of National Health and Welfare visited this school from October 19 to 22, 1946. Her report on the feeding arrangements and the nutritional standard is very complete and on the whole is satisfactory.\n\nRecently there have been sent to this school menu patterns, based on Canada's food rules, food purchasing lists, work schedules based on daily menus, and other nutrition education material. The girls receive training in food preparation and cookery, under the direction of the cook. The dietitian reported as follows concerning the interest of the staff in the feeding arrangements for the children: \"The Principal and the remainder of the staff expressed keen interest in obtaining assistance of the food service and nutrition education. The consideration of the native tendencies of the Indians and their reserve influences in relation to a nutrition education approach were discussed\".\n\nA copy of this report has been sent to the Principal so that he can take advantage of the dietary service being offered to our schools by the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nI will write to you further upon receiving a copy of the report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Oatrender,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nComplaint against Reverend Mr. Strapp,\nBrandon Residential School.\n\nReference your letter 1946-304-11B of December 2.\n\nI enclose herewith copies of letters received from\n\n(a) Inspector Hamilton, and\n(b) Reverend Mr. Strapp,\n\nconcerning a complaint made by sworn statements of John Shepherd and D. Fowen of the White Bear Reserve. Before a decision can be made in this case, we will have to have the information requested in paragraph 1 of our letter on file 133-0-10 of January 7.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letters of the 7th and 18th instants,\nFile No. 133-0-10 (W T) and File No. 133-0-1 (W T), respectively, in connection\nwith truancy of Indian children at the Brandon Residential School, and complaint\nagainst Reverend Mr. Strapp, the Principal. I have today been advised by\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley, in answer to request for the information following receipt\nof Department letter of the 7th instant, to the effect that Clifford and Verna\nShepherd did attend the St. Francis Day School on the White Bear's Reserve for\nabout two weeks in September, 1946, but their names were not shown on the school\nregister.\n\nI have read with interest copy of the report of Mr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, following his visit to the Brandon\nSchool to investigate the complaint.\n\nApparently there is no way to avoid having Clifford Shepherd return\nto the White Bear's Reserve, Mr. Strapp having admitted that he is totally unable\nto control the boy.\n\nMr. Hamilton has visited the school and seems to have been satisfied\nwith Mr. Strapp's action in this and other matters but I am not satisfied that\nClifford Shepherd is a hopeless reprobate.\n\nWe have to consider the danger of a boy running away from a residential\nschool in cold weather and freezing to death on his way to his reserve. This\nhas happened on more than one occasion, as the Department is aware. We have also\nto consider the effect upon some of the other children in the school when a boy can\nbe discharged from a school simply by giving some trouble to the Principal. Few\nchildren go completely through school without at some time becoming a little dis-\nsatisfied. Their futures can easily be ruined by giving them encouragement to\nendeavour to become discharged as soon as such a feeling arises.\n\nI notice that Mr. Strapp takes exception to the fact that Mr. Kerley took\ntwo affidavits from Indians about statements which they had received from their\nchildren attending the Brandon School. There is a suggestion in Mr. Strapp's letter\nthat Mr. Kerley went out of his way to have a complaint laid against the Brandon\nSchool. The reverse is more in accordance with facts. Mr. Kerley has had too\nmuch experience in dealing with Indian schools, both day and residential, to\nencourage the complaints of Indians against a school. However, he cannot refuse\nto listen to a complaint and the mere fact that the matter was taken up with the\nHonourable T.C. Douglas over Mr. Kerley's head would indicate that the Indians were\nnot under the impression that they had Mr. Kerley's support in their quarrel with\nthe school. I am sure Mr. Strapp could see this point of view if he would as\ncarefully consider the whole matter as he seems to have considered the matter of the\naffidavits. No attempt would have been made to keep the Shepherd children in a\nresidential school if their home conditions on the reserve were suitable but they\nare not. Please refer to the last paragraph of my letter of October 9, 1946,\nFile No. 1688-303-11B, in this connection. I note that an error was made in\nreferring to the boy in the third paragraph of the same letter as John Shepherd\nwhere he should have been referred to as Clifford. It now seems evident that\nbecause of the fact that Mr. Strapp is unable to keep Clifford in his school it will\nbe necessary for the boy to live in a small house in contact with a tubercular\n\nmother and we can only hope that......\nmother and we can only hope that he is fortunate enough that he does not contract the disease.\n\nJ.P.B.

Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nClifford Shepherd,\nReference your 209-11 of January 11.\n\nCopies of your letter and the Reverend Mr. Strapp's letter were sent to Inspector Ostrander. We have now received a reply from him in which he concurs in your recommendation that Mr. Strapp be instructed to return Clifford to his home.\n\nTherefore the Department authorizes the discharge of this pupil from the Brandon Residential School. You are to notify the Reverend Mr. Strapp of this decision and inform him that he is to carefully explain the following to Clifford Shepherd:\n\n(a) that he is being discharged on the understanding that he is to attend the day school on the White Bear Reserve,\n\n(b) that if his attendance there is not satisfactory, this fact will be reported to the Department for further action.\n\nThis information is being passed to Inspector Ostrander so that he can instruct Indian Agent Kerley to check carefully on this boy's day school attendance. It is our intention to send this boy to another Residential School if his attendance is unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Strapp seems to misunderstand\n\n........... the reasons\nthe reasons for sending Clifford to his school. Inspector Ostrander's comments are as follows:\n\n\"I notice that Mr. Strapp takes exception to the fact that Mr. Kerley took two affidavits from Indians about statements which they had received from their children attending the Brandon School. There is a suggestion in Mr. Strapp's letter that Mr. Kerley went out of his way to have a complaint laid against the Brandon School. The reverse is more in accordance with facts. Mr. Kerley has had too much experience in dealing with Indian schools, both day and residential, to encourage the complaints of Indians against a school. However, he cannot refuse to listen to a complaint and the mere fact that the matter was taken up with the Honourable T. C. Douglas over Mr. Kerley's head would indicate that the Indians were not under the impression that they had Mr. Kerley's support in their quarrel with the school. I am sure Mr. Strapp could see this point of view if he would as carefully consider the whole matter as he seems to have considered the matter of the affidavits. No attempt would have been made to keep the Shepherd children in a residential school if their home conditions on the reserve were suitable but they are not. Please refer to the last paragraph of my letter of October 9, 1946, File No. 1688-303-11B, in this connection.\n\nI note that an error was made in referring to the boy in the third paragraph of the same letter as John Shepherd where he should have been referred to as Clifford. It now seems evident that because of the fact that Mr. Strapp is unable to keep Clifford in his school it will be necessary for the boy to live in a small house in contact with a tubercular mother and we can only hope that he is fortunate enough that he does not contract the disease.\"\n\nInspector Ostrander's letter of October 9 to which he makes reference in the above quotation reads as follows:\n\n\"I am sure that the Honourable T. C. Douglas would agree that a small house with a Tubercular mother and several small children is not an ideal situation. This is one of the cases where I believe that the residential school gives its best service in relieving a sick mother of some of the work of the...\"\nhome and removing healthy children from daily contact with a tubercular person in a small house. If children from houses of this kind are not justifiably placed in residential schools whether the father is willing or unwilling, then I believe we have little excuse for continuing to operate residential schools\".\n\nIt is felt that the Reverend Mr. Strapp should be acquainted with the above circumstances regarding this boy's admission to his school.\n\nBernard F.

Upon receipt of reports from field officials, his discharge has since been authorized. It has been clearly pointed out to this boy that he is to attend the day school on his home reserve.\n\nOur concern with the welfare of this boy and the danger to which he will be exposed in a tubercular home is best illustrated by the following statistics on the Shepherd children from Moose Mountain Reserve:\n\n| Normal weight for age and height | Height on return after school holidays | Weight at present |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Clifford                        | 67                                    | 96               |\n| Vernon                          | 60                                    | 66               |\n| Norman                         | 122                                   | 130              |\n| Howard                          | 108                                   | 116              |\n| Davis                           | 71                                    | 85               |\n\nFrom the above figures, it would seem\n\nHonourable T.

This is a ruling of the Indian Affairs Branch. It was stated authoritatively by a member of Indian Affairs Branch before the Joint Parliamentary Committee investigating Indian Affairs that the Branch paid the initial and final transportation of a pupil to and from a Residential School. I suggest that you refer to the minutes of the said committee which are obtainable from Ottawa on request. As for the age of discharge, I understand that 16 years is the standard age of discharge for Indian Residential Schools in the Dominion. I know that the only Residential School now operating in this Agency is governed by that ruling and a boy or girl reaching 16 years of age is automatically discharged unless he or she is found worthy and recommended for higher education.\n\nIf there is any further doubt in your mind with regard to these matters and require advice I would be glad if you would take the matter up with Col B.F.

He was one of the ring leaders in the truancy epidemics and it was felt that it would be best for all concerned if he was removed to another school, such as Brandon, where he could not easily run away. This was done with the parents consent and the approval of the principal of the Sioux Lookout School. We also made previous arrangements with the principal at the Brandon School, but unfortunately neglected to inform you of our plans.\n\nGordon Bottle was sent to the Fort William Sanatorium in accordance with Dr. Bell's instructions and Mr. Eady was engaged to go as escort in both cases. He is not one of our employees.\n\nGS/VE\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has been arranged through Dr Wood's office in Winnipeg that these children can be examined on arrival at Brandon and if they are not fit for school they can be put in hospital there for treatment.\n\nRegarding the necessity for sending them to Brandon, I would point out that unless they go to Residential School they will not be able to attend school at all. The parents of ten of the children are going out on the trap lines and the children will have to go with them. It is not possible for them to stay on the reserve during the winter as they have no houses there while they do have cabins on the trap lines. The parents of three others are working at Lingman Lake mine site where there is no school and the father of another boy has T.B. and unable to work. The Priest is keeping the entire family at his Mission on the Reserve until other arrangements can be made for them.\n\nAfter considering the above, the Department can authorize the chartering of a plane as requested, I would suggest a telegram be sent to that effect so that these children can be removed to school before they leave for winter homes on the trap lines.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

His son, Charlie does not know whether his father paid for the trip or not.\n\nThe arrangement with these people at Nelson House was that the school would arrange to get the children to Wabowden and that the parents would pick them up at that point.\n\nWe have had difficulty this last two years because they have not timed their arrangements to meet the children over.\n\nVery Poor Copy\nand this has resulted in board bills which they have not paid but which have been forwarded to this school by the Indian Supt. at the Pas.\n\nI am refusing this year to send the children up unless the money for their passage is sent out to me before the holiday period.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nNovember 23, 1948.\n\nMr. Eric Law,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from the principal of the Brandon Residential School.\n\nWe note from its contents that Mr. Moodie has not kept faith with the principal with regard to the date on which Mr. Moodie's children should return to the residential school.\n\nI presume that Mr. Strapp has had a request to have the children go home for Christmas holidays.\n\nPlease let me have your comments on the contents of Mr. Strapp's letter and also let me know if you can take any action that will assist the principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: The Selkirk Navigation Co Limited.\n\nAddress: Redwood Dock, Winnipeg, Manitoba\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| September 28 | For Boat fares for children proceeding to attend Brandon Indian Residential School as per attached invoice - 5 full fares - 10 half fares. | 235.00 |\n\nAllots: 516 - 03 - 311\n\nTwo hundred and thirty five --- and 00/100 Dollars 235.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

F. Neary.\n\nI wish to refer to the five children on ticket No. 1116 Peguis Band. These children of the Cochrane family are in attendance at the Brandon Residential School.\n\nThe mother has recently re-married one Thomas, No. 796 of the said Band, and wishes the children to be returned from Residential School - as she feels that now she is re-married, she is quite capable of caring for the children and giving them a good home.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: P. Phelan - Education Division\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of 23rd inst., file 576-10 (EL) we are always having considerable trouble with pupils going to and coming home from Brandon Residential School. To our knowledge no definite arrangements are made in ample time before children are sent home.\n\nLast July when we were on our treaty payments, we found the five pupils from Brandon stranded, so had to make arrangements to get these children home.\n\nOn reading over Mr. Strapp's letter he states that he will not send the children home for the holiday period until money is received for the passage. This is probably the reason you presume that Mr. Strapp means the children are going home for Christmas. In his letter he refers to the two months, July and August, summer holiday. Due to the length of trip, children never go home for Christmas.\n\nThe following is a list of points that might help prevent a recurrence of delays:\n\n(1) The children have been put on wrong trains, from Brandon which requires a 2 day stop over at The Pas. There is only one train going to Wabowden which will make connections.\n\n(a) The children should take a Monday train from Brandon, arriving The Pas Tuesday morning, leaving The Pas for Wabowden Tuesday afternoon and arriving Wabowden late Tuesday evening. When returning to school they should take a Tuesday train at Wabowden, arrive The Pas Wednesday morning, and leave The Pas Wednesday evening for Brandon, arriving Brandon Thursday.\n\n(2) Notification to parents should be sent out about a month in advance, as the trip from Nelson House is long with 22 portages. Mail is flown into Nelson House only when weather permits.\n\n(3) Ample lunch should be given pupils, the trip is at least 3 days by train, and we have had to supplement lunches here.\n\nWe trust this is the information desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Law,\nSupt. Indian Agency.\n\nEL/DL\ncc: R.S.Davis, Winnipeg.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT THE SASKATCHEWAN SCHOOL DURING SEPTEMBER QUARTER, 1948\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Admission | Band |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------|\n| 0672 | Harold Brown          | 30-8-48           | 15   |\n| 0673 | Clara Miller          | 1-9-48            | 16   |\n| 0674 | John Johnson          | 1-9-48            | 16   |\n| 0675 | Ellen Andrews         | 1-9-48            | 16   |\n| 0676 | Edward Smith          | 1-9-48            | 16   |\n| 0677 | Harold Smith          | 1-9-48            | 16   |\n| 0678 | Harold Smith          | 1-9-48            | 16   |\n| 0679 | Harold Smith          | 1-9-48            | 16   |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name                  | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |\n|     |                       |                   |                       |                    |\n\n**Notes:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

School,\nBrandon, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Strapp:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo regarding the Moodie children, we wrote Indian Superintendent Law and he has drawn our attention to the following points that might help a recurrence of the delays about which you complain.\n\n(1) The children have been put on wrong trains from Brandon which requires a 2 day stop over at The Pas. There is only one train going to Wabowden which will make connections.\n\n(2) The children should take a Monday train from Brandon, arriving at The Pas Tuesday morning, leaving The Pas for Wabowden Tuesday afternoon and arriving Wabowden late Tuesday evening. When returning to school they should take a Tuesday train at Wabowden, arrive at The Pas Wednesday morning and leave The Pas Wednesday evening for Brandon, arriving Brandon Thursday.\n\n(3) Notification to parents should be sent out about a month in advance, as the trip from Nelson House is long with 22 portages. Mail is flown into Nelson House only when weather permits.\n\n.....2\n(4) Ample lunch should be given pupils, the trip is at least 3 days by train, and we have had to supplement lunches here.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Brandon Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ...............................................................\nEnglish name ...............................................................\nAge ...............................................................\nName of Band ...............................................................\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid ...............................................................\nFather's full name and No. ...............................................................\nMother's full name and No. ...............................................................\nParents living or dead ...............................................................\nState of child's health ...............................................................\nReligion ...............................................................\nDoes applicant speak English? ...............................................................\nPreviously attended ...............................................................\nschool for years ...............................................................\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official at the school must not sign as witness.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Is there any special reason why he should receive institutional care and if so why should he be admitted to the Brandon Residential School rather than the Sioux Lookout School?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI wish to acknowledge Mr. Phelan's letter of May 4 with respect to the admission of Roy Binguis, #154 Frenchman's Head Band, to the Brandon Indian Residential School.\n\nThis boy was admitted to the school at the request of his father who is a graduate of the same school. At the time of his admission the parents were separated and the Sioux Lookout School was already overcrowded. Even if there had been room in the Sioux Lookout School Binguis would not have consented to his admission there. There are already three other members from this family in the Brandon School which is, no doubt, another good reason why the father wished the child to be admitted to that particular school.\n\nG. Sharpe\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\nMEMORANDUM\n\nColonel Neary\nSupt. of Education\n\nPlease note attached report from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police concerning the accidental death of Roderick Beardy at the Indian Residential School, Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nYour consideration of this case is invited with a view to any preventive action that might be taken against a repetition of occurrences of this kind at this or other schools.\n\nThere is no actual legal question involved, but it seems to me that great care should be taken by the residential school authorities to see that young boys are not exposed to accidents through operating machinery of this kind.\n\nI assume that the Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School is the same Mr. O. B. Strapp, whom I met on several occasions at the Mount Elgin School.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n17th May, 1949.\n\nMr. G.

O.B. Strapp, Principal of the Residential School at Brandon informing me that Reta Baywahe, a pupil from the Assiniboine reserve has passed her grade 9 examinations and wishes to continue her studies at that school, therefore I would recommend that her request be granted, please inform me as soon as possible so that I may let Reta and the Principal before the holidays are over.\n\nFrank Booth,\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 11th, 1949.\n\nMr. F.

If she wishes to remain after June 30th, 1950, you should write to us later.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nDear Mr. Bewell,\n\nI was speaking with you on Friday and realized that some type of application would be necessary to obtain admittance for Kitty Stranger and Bonnie Olson into the Brandon Residential School.

Until they make a statutory declaration of any change in their denominational affiliations, they are for the purposes of the Indian Act, considered to be of the religious denomination previously indicated, and transfer of their children to a school conducted under different auspices cannot be considered.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

It is desired to know why their admission to a residential school is sought.\n\nMoreover, in the case of the McKay girl no explanation is given for the mother's signature to Form I.A. 406.\n\nIt is further noted that while the religious denomination of the McKay child is given as \"United Church\", the other children are described as merely \"Protestant\". The Principal of a school conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada is sometimes asked to make special arrangements for children whose parents are of the Anglican Communion.\n\nBernard F.

The grants and fees applicable to such students are authorized and may be claimed in respect of these girls.\n\nIt is noted that Betty Stranger is of the Anglican Communion and would have preferred to be domiciled in a residential school conducted under the auspices of the Church of England. It is assumed that at Brandon the Principal will ensure that she is afforded the opportunity to maintain her religious affiliations. It should be explained to her that transfer to another Province might handicap her adjustment to the senior high school curriculum.\n\nIt is noted that both girls look forward to training as teachers.\n\nBernard F.

Morrison, Agency Assistant, White Bear Indian Reserve, Carlyle District, Sask., to the effect that the parents of the above named pupils of the Brandon Indian Residential School, Brandon, Man., Allie and Mrs. Nokohoot of the White Bear Indian Reserve, Carlyle District, Sask., had refused to let their above named children return to the Brandon School. They were then residing with their parents at their home on this Reserve and have been since school terminated last June.\n\n2. Mr. Morrison stated that he had taken this matter up with the Indian Agent, Kerle, Broadview, Sask., and that he had received instructions to the effect that if the parents of these two girls refused to allow their children to proceed to the Brandon School, assistance of this Force was to be asked to see that they proceeded to the Brandon School.\n\n3. This same a.m., whilst on other police duties on this Reserve, I called on the Nokohoot family with Mr. Morrison. It was ascertained that the school van was coming to this Reserve to pick up the children for the Brandon School about noon on the following day. Both Mr. Morrison and myself attempted to persuade Allie and Mrs. Nokohoot to allow the girls to proceed to the school by this van, but they refused to do so, stating that they wished to keep the girls at home and allow them to go to school in this Reserve. They were advised by Mr. Morrison that they could make application for this later and if they could show that they could properly look after the children at home, it was quite possible that the children may be allowed to return to their home on the Reserve and attend school here, but at present it was compulsory for the two girls to attend the school at Brandon.\n\n4. These children first went to the Brandon School last winter when it was established that they were not being properly looked after at home. Mrs. Nokohoot periodically leaves her husband, taking her children with her and moving in with other Indians. It was ascertained that she had again only just returned home after leaving her husband, but she denied this, stating that she had been home for some time. On the children being admitted to the Brandon School last winter it was found on their arrival there that they were both diseased, V.D., but they were cured at the school. I received this information from Mrs. Morrison.\n\n5. This a.m., accompanied by Cst. Mahoney, I again patrolled per Pol. car Code 2829 to the W.B.I.R., where I (P.T.O.)\nWHERE I.........\n\nagain called at the Nokohoot home. Parents of the girls were advised that it was necessary for the girls to proceed to the school at Brandon and they were to get the children ready. This they did, but Allie NOKOHOOT stated that he was going to protest this matter. He was advised that the police were acting on the instructions of the Indian Agent.\n\n6. On the children being prepared for school, they were taken to the Agency on this Reserve, to await the arrival of the school bus. Allie Nokohoot accompanied the patrol from their home to the Agency where he stayed, the patrol continuing on other police duties. I have since been advised by Mrs. Morrison that the children proceeded to Brandon via the school van.\n\n7. Mrs. Morrison further advised that the necessary papers committing these children to the Brandon Residential School were prepared and signed by Allie Nokohoot last winter before Mr. Kerle, the Indian Agent at Broadview, Sask.\n\n3-9-49\n\n8. This date the following letter was received from W.G.E. Campbell, Barrister, of Arcola, Sask. and dated the 2-9-49:\n\nWe have been consulted by Allie Nokohoot with reference to his children; Grace and Merle aged 9 and 14 years, respectively. Nokohoot informs us that despite the fact that he has proper Indian home for his children on the reserve, in which his wife is capable and prepared to look after these children, that they were by an officer of the R.C.M.P., Carlyle Detachment, removed from his custody today.\n\nIt seems rather unusual to us that parents would be deprived of their children without order of the court or other authority. Nokohoot says that there has been no proceedings to his knowledge in this connection, and in order that we may be in position to well advise Nokohoot we would very much appreciate receiving from you full report in regard to this matter.\n\nWe might mention that both Nokohoot and his wife appear to be seriously perturbed and we would appreciate a speedy reply.\n\nThanking you for your attention we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCAMPBELL & CAMPBELL\n\nper (SGD) W.G.E. Campbell.\n\n9. Mr. Campbell has since been contacted and advised that action taken in this regard was under the instructions of the Indian Agent, via the Agency Assistant, J.R. Morrison of the White Bear Indian Reserve, Carlyle Dist., Sask. It was suggested that he contact the Indian Agent at Broadview in regards to this matter. It was also politely drawn to his attention that members of this Force are not allowed to provide copies of reports without permission of our Officer Commanding. He stated that he understood this and consequently no written acknowledgement of his letter has been made. Mr. Campbell inferred that he would take the matter up with the...\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Brandon Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Anna Smith\nEnglish name: Anna Smith\nAge: 7 years\nName of Band: Peguis Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: #1083\nFather's full name and No.: deceased\nMother's full name and No.: Mrs Millie Fiddler\nParents living or dead: father deceased\nState of child's health:\nReligion: Anglican\nDoes applicant speak English?: yes\nPreviously attended: nil\n\nschool for years\n\n(Signature of Miss Millie Fiddler)\nfather deceased.\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\nAgent\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Neary;\n\nI have had considerable trouble with about a dozen boys this fall who are persistent truants. Nothing seems to satisfy them in school and unfortunately they keep the other boys always in a turmoil with their coming and going.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis seems to have the idea that the boys are not to blame but that the principal and staff are at fault. He refuses to even try to see the point that these boys do not like to be in school simply because the organization of school life is so different from the care free life of the reservation during the summer months.\n\nWe have over 150 children who do not run away and it seems a pity to have them continually upset by the trouble makers.\n\nI have informed Mr. Davis that I will not make any more long trips to bring these repeaters back to school and I do not want #615 Victor Bruce, Cross Lake and 648 Job White, God's Lake returned to school as their promises not to run away are not of any value. At present they are in the Detention Home at Winnipeg after being picked up by the Winnipeg City Police.\n\nThis is not a matter of attempting to please a few boys who are determined not to go to school but is definitely now a matter of protecting the other children against their influence.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your consideration four Applications for Admission to Residential School (preferably Brandon) from #1128 Alex George Sinclair Councillor of Peguis Band.\n\nMr. Sinclair is concerned about the health and welfare of his large family of 11 children, lost his wife in March of this year, and it is recommended that if it is at all possible these four girls be admitted to a Residential School.\n\nThis family is highly respected in the Peguis Community and it is appreciated that upon the death of Mrs. Sinclair the children would be handicapped by lack of parental care.\n\nD.A.H.

If he cannot take these children, you might let us know as the Gordons Residential School will re-open early in January if not sooner and we could place the children in this particular school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/HH\nIn the above connection I have to report that at 8.00 P.M. of the 5-11-49 Maurice GANACHE of Laurier, Man., contacted this detachment via phone and advised that he was holding two Indian boys at his place who had run away from the Brandon Indian school.\n\nA patrol was made to GANACHE'S farm and it was ascertained that the captionally noted Indian boys had run away from the Brandon Indian School on the 2-11-49 and were attempting to get to The Pas, Man.\n\nThe boys Fred ROSS & John SPENCE were taken into custody and Sgt.

(RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-10, part 16)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nMy dear Mr. Hamilton,\n\nWhen I was at Long Plain School last week I was surprised to observe the presence of four older children in Grades Five and Seven. The excuse for their presence in this junior-grade school is that by the time they were ready to return to Portage La Prairie Residential School, that school was full up and could not receive them.\n\nI later inquired whether Principal McLean could take them in after Christmas but he will not have room.\n\nThen I asked Rev. Principal Strapp whether he can accommodate them after Christmas, and he said that very likely he might be able to.\n\nI have discussed these pupils with Mr. Russell in your office and he assures me that they are not the girls (one is a boy) who caused all that commotion at Portage last year.\n\nYou will appreciate my apprehension that they will just be wasting their time in a school where all the other pupils are in the first three grades, with the school being conducted by an uncertificated teacher who is unused to the upper grades, and who ought to be concentrating on the juniors. A proper start in school is so important.\n\nMay I request you, therefore, to follow up this matter with the Rev. Mr. Strapp, as Brandon has become \"the nearest available school\" for these children. Their parents have contributed to bringing this situation into being through their failure, accidental or deliberate, to return their children to the school that they should have been attending. There is, of course, a responsibility imposed on us as Departmental officials to co-operate in securing the prompt return of residential school pupils, a subject that was dealt with in a circular last year, but I have met people who either openly announced that they were \"not in favour of residential schools\" or whose attitude was obvious from their indifference to the Principal's problem. It is not just a matter of getting the full quota of \"grant-earning pupils\". It is more important that the same pupils return year after year to receive the proper conditioning.\n\nSome of our workers and associates seem to overlook this factor. Maybe you have an assistant or two whose other duties are so onerous that they leave him little energy to \"chase after\" pupils who are avoiding school. Unless these men are required to be more energetic in regard to their functions as attendance-enforcers, the good teachers and schools cannot function at anything like full potential or efficiency, and after each vacation the situation will worsen.\n\nThere is a Christmas vacation to be faced soon. I trust that there will be more pressure exerted in certain areas to endure the prompt return of pupils to Portage and Brandon. At this time there will not be the excuse that they were picking potatoes in the U.S.A.\nThis matter of children working for wages when they ought to be in school is one that even the provincial schools find troublesome, but they are overcoming it, and, no doubt, so shall we with the aid of well-considered adjustments and compromises. But in the case of the four pupils who prompted this letter (before \"four\" becomes \"fourteen\" and maybe \"forty\") I think that further compromises ought not to be made. They have been going through the motions of attending school and qualifying their parents for family allowances. The books which they should be using have not been ordered until recently because their attendance was not anticipated, and quite properly not. My opinion (my superiors at Ottawa may order otherwise) is that these four pupils should be directed to report to Brandon after the vacation on the day appointed. Their movement should be assisted and expedited by all those concerned to the fullest extent proper and possible. Any resulting truancy should entail the suspension of allowances.\n\nWhen the books that were ordered for them are received, they might with advantage be sent (if such action is authorized) to the school which receives these pupils, i.e., Brandon.\n\nThe net result of our efforts in this case will be, I hope, a demonstration that we intend not to let the caprice of a few people interfere with the progress of the majority of the pupils.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.

This is in addition to the 10 applications which were forwarded in the summer & fall of 1949 and for which we have received no word.\n\nThe parents and guardians would appreciate having these children attend Residential School. Due to local geographical conditions most of the children receive only a smattering of education and thus grow up illiterate. This is a very large lake and, apart from several summer months, the Indians are scattered at fishing camps along its 75 mile length or are even farther afield at trapping camps. In addition, many of these children are illegitimate or have one parent dead; some are living with foster parents, and thus are not receiving adequate parental care.\n\nThis is the list of applicants with ages, etc.:\n\n| Name          | Age | Status       | Living Situation                  | Schooling |\n|---------------|-----|--------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|\n| Leslie James  | 7   | illegitimate | living with grandparents          | no school |\n| Louis Ross    | 10  | father dead  |                                   | a few weeks schooling |\n| Azola McKay   | 10  | father dead  |                                   | 2 years school |\n| Clara Dee     | 6   | mother in San with T.R. | No school. | |\n| Abe Saul Masson | 10 | parents living | about 2 years school. | |\n| James Anderson| 9   | father deserted family | 1 yr. school. | |\n| Kathleen Trout| 8   | mother dead, living with foster parents | 2 mo. school. | |\n| Mary Ross     | 8   | parents living | 2 months school. | |\n| Sarah Spencer | 12  | parents living | about 1 yr. school. | |\n| Marion Ross   | 8   | parents living | 1 month school. | |\n| Adelaide Kirkness | 6  | parents living | no school. | |\n| Stanley Ogemow| 10  | parents living | 3 years school. | |\n| Barnabas Ogemow | 7  | parents living | several months school. | |\n\nI am writing you because Mr. Davis has said that all applications must be passed by your office.

It appears that the applications must have been held back either by the Superintendent or the Regional Supervisor.\n\nIf the parents are anxious to send their children to school at such a distance I do not see any reason why we should oppose their admission as long as accommodation can be found. You have seen a report of the social worker to the effect that the God's Lake Mine School now has few Indians in attendance because of the change in location of fishing camps. I scarcely expect that the Reverend Mr. Gibson would recommend the admission of children who can attend the new school at God's Lake to residential school.\n\nEconomics may compel a drastic revision of the way of life and a redistribution of population in the Norway House, Island Lake, God's Lake and Oxford Lake bands. The rising generation may have to follow occupations different from those of their predecessors.\n\nI suggest that inquiry be directed to the local Superintendent as to his reasons for not forwarding the applications to Ottawa.

Gibson,\nUnited Church Mission,\nGod's Lake, Man.\n\nMy dear Mr. Gibson:\n\nYou may already have heard from the Reverend Dr. Dorsey of your Church that he is going to explore the possibility of getting a contingent of residential school pupils from Manitoba to complete the enrolment at Edmonton Residential School.\n\nI do not wish to seem to anticipate action by the proper Church authorities in this matter. You will understand that my official interest is to get adequate schooling for the maximum number of Indian children with the minimum of expense to the tax-payers and the least possible difficulty to the religious denominations involved. Another reason for writing you in this matter is that I had marked the file containing your letter of April 19, 1950 for further attention today after returning from places west of Manitoba.\n\nReference to your copy of that letter will show you that therein you nominated 23 children for admission to a residential school. At that time you had in mind the school at Brandon. It may turn out now that you will be among those whom Dr. Dorsey will request to find pupils for Edmonton.\n\nIt seems to me that in finding these pupils we ought to try to give the Principal who will receive them as early notice as possible all the information possible regarding the educational condition of the child. In regard to the\n23 pupils mentioned in your letter I note that you have given information concerning the number of years (or months) that the child has been in school. May I suggest that if possible you add one more item - an indication of the child's competency in English. This may help the Reverend Principal at Edmonton to plan the organization of his classes and may serve to indicate the need for different teaching methods and supplies.\n\nSubject always to Dr. Dorey's instructions, it seems to me that it would be helpful for those concerned to receive a compilation of prospective pupils showing the name, age, sex, treaty number, previous schooling and competency in English. The Departmental officials, through whose offices the formal applications for admission should pass, will probably wish to review such compilations so as to ensure that we are not robbing any Day schools of pupils who can and ought to attend them.\n\nAs I do not know what mail service you are getting now, nor the date when a doctor might be available this summer to examine any prospective pupils, I am enclosing a number of application blanks which have to be completed (in duplicate) on both sides before the form is submitted to the concerned Agent for his recommendation. I gather from your letter that you have assisted in the preparation of these forms on previous occasions. As these children have a long journey in prospect, any irregularities in the admission procedure would be a cause of regret.\n\nIf it is any comfort to you in attempting the task of persuading parents to permit their children to travel so far, may I say that we have pupils who make the journey from Churchill and York Factory to Prince Albert; likewise from points in the Yukon to Lesser Slave Lake in Alberta; and again from Northern British Columbia by rail and steamer to schools on Vancouver Island. In your area, I suppose, the\nmost difficulty would arise in getting the children to the railway. I assume that this would be a matter of planned plans-loads and I understand that your missionaries have had plenty of practice in coping with such arrangements.\n\nMay I extend my wishes for success in this venture. I regret that I can give it only momentary attention as there are situations elsewhere that are equally demanding.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nAttention: Colonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Emigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Attendance of Children at Residential Schools\n\nFollowing my telephone conversation, I am now writing at greater length concerning the whole problem of education on Northern Manitoba Reserves.\n\nMay I say that we subscribe fully to the Department policy of establishing day schools and desire to co-operate to the fullest extent. Nevertheless, it is recognized by everyone that especially in Northern Manitoba there are many children who will never get an adequate education unless there is a residential school to which they may be sent.\n\nOne of the points which requires immediate attention is a report from our Missionary at God's Lake that pressure is being brought to bear on the Indians who have children at Brandon to have these brought back so that they may attend the day schools. My conviction is that if there were good reasons last year why the children should have gone to Brandon, the same reasons should operate to keep them there now. I am sure we may expect the support of the Department.\n\nIn a further letter the Missionary says that there is some difficulty in regard to the proper examination of the pupils. He quotes a letter from Mr. Clark, giving certain instructions about filling in forms, etc. He then goes on to say that most of these applications have been in the hands of the Indian Agent for a year and none for less than four months. In the letter our Missionary says that as he was typing the letter Mr. Gowans brought thirteen applications which had been sent to Mr. Staunton at the first of April. Nothing seems to have been done to complete these applications.\n\nWhy do these applications lie in an office for four months and then when we want these children to go to a residential school, we are faced with a lot of requirements -- all of which are necessary -- which will take time and may preclude the possibility of these children being admitted to a residential school?\n\nThe Missionary says:\n\n\"I had forgotten just exactly what applications had been sent in April but upon examination we found that there was not a single family represented which would send children to the schools on the Reserve. Each family, with the exception of a widow, Effie McKay, headed out to trapping and fishing camps at the East end of God's Lake (one long...\"\nday's journey from the nearest school at the Mine) and to Kakepehigatic and Grassy Narrows (trapping grounds beyond God's Lake in the bush and two long days' journey from the nearest school at the Mine). Effie McKay leads a precarious existence parking in the homes of her several brothers at times in different locations at the East End or Grassy Narrows and the rest of the time operating a bawdy house at the Mine.\n\nMr. Gowans, who formerly was with the Hudson's Bay Co. and a manager here at God's Lake Narrows, understood the situation and agreed that these children had no other means than residential school of obtaining their schooling. Mr. Waite was noncommittal and no promises of help were made. They say that they will see us before they leave on Saturday, so possibly we can get something definite from them re what will be done with these applications and what action they will take re sending out the children. Mr. Waite felt that the Indian Dept. would not pay the return fare of the children from Edmonton next summer, but I assured him that you had information to the contrary.\"\n\nWith regard to paying the return fare of these children at the end of the year, it is obvious that Mr. Waite is simply giving the official's version. The Department has promised differently.\n\nHere is a quotation from the Missionary at Oxford House:\n\n\"We have four promising children that parents desire to send to boarding school. Mr. Staunton told parents he would rather they would attend school here. So I don't know if they will be permitted to go or not. The parents are of necessity out trapping a good part of the winter and children are away from school. I intend to see Dr. Best when I go to the city next week and see if arrangements can be made for them.\"\n\nI have a further letter from Dr. Best re children at Gross Lake, from which I quote as follows:\n\n\"Mr. T.A. Pollock in a recent letter writes that the parents of the children whose names follow, would like to have them attend Residential School in Edmonton:\n\nGeorge Gilbert Paupanakis, born Feb. 8/43.\nWm. Paupanakis - 9 years old, now attending R.C. School\nAllan Paupanakis - 11 years old now attending R.C. School.\n(The father is George Paupanakis - a Protestant, but wife is Catholic and evidently Wm. and Allan were baptized by Catholic priest.)\nMorris McKay - age 13 - now attending R.C. School\nLillian McKay - age 16 -\nChristie Ann McKay - age 19 - attended Norway House Res. School now wants to get full education.\n\nThere are two other younger children attending R.C. School though both parents Samuel McKay and wife are Protestant.\n\nIla Monias - age 15 - attended Norway House - now attending R.C.School.\nJean Monias - age 21 - attended Norway House, was in Grade 8; wishes to get further education.\"\nDr. Best has pointed out that there is not much chance of Christie Ann McKay or Jean Monias being allowed to go to a residential school.\n\nI have also a list of applications from Island Lake, as follows:\n\n| No   | Name                  | Age | Parents               | Remarks                                                                 |\n|------|-----------------------|-----|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 381  | Stanley Simpson Monias| 7   | Cornelius & Margaret  | Away From Island Lake all winter on trapline.                          |\n| 255  | Murdock McDougall     | 12  | Alfred and Eva        | Away to trapline during winter.                                        |\n| 224  | Kittle Jean Manias    | 11  | Albert & Betsy        |                                                                         |\n| 365  | Isabel Eileen Monias  | 8   | Michael & Jessie      |                                                                         |\n| 363  | Zakarius Harper       | 11  | James & Eva, both dead.| Cared for by Michael Monias #363                                       |\n| 236  | Tommy Harper          | 14  | Jacob & Jessie        |                                                                         |\n| 236  | Angus Harper          | 11  | \"                     |                                                                         |\n| 228  | Arthur Dan            | 11  | Jonah; mother dead    | Child cared for by father, should be sent to boarding school.          |\n| 231  | Charlotte Jane Flett  | 7   | Edward & Eva          | Away to trapline during winter.                                        |\n| 211  | Jack Ernest Flett     | 14  | John & Charlotte      |                                                                         |\n| 205  | Ellen Jane Monias     | 10  | Elijah & Charlotte    |                                                                         |\n| 369  | Peter Allan McKay     | 9   | Allan & Elizabeth     |                                                                         |\n| 369  | John Angus            | 7   | \"                     |                                                                         |\n| 321  | Georgina Fiddler      | 7   | Lazarus & Priscilla   |                                                                         |\n| 201  | Hubert Flett          | 10  | Jimmy & Myra          |                                                                         |\n| 364  | Percy Little          | 7   | Edward & Lucy         |                                                                         |\n| 187  | Jessie Mancakeesik    | 13  | Thos. & Mary          |                                                                         |\n| 244  | Victoria Harper       | 11  | Joseph & Agnes        |                                                                         |\n| 276  | Nathaniel Monias      | 8   | Moses & Margaret      |                                                                         |\n| 276  | Job Monias            | 14  | \"                     |                                                                         |\n| 275  | Louis Harper          | 10  | Kenneth & Rebecca     |                                                                         |\n| 335  | Jean Knott            | 7   | Jimmie & Irene        |                                                                         |\n| 335  | Mary Knott            | 6   | \"                     |                                                                         |\n| 335  | Absalom Knott         | 12  | \"                     |                                                                         |\n| 218  | Dorothy Flett         | 14  | Sandy & Jane Ellen    | Sandy works at Nursing Station.

I am very much surprised to read in Hansard that a new school has been built at Seven Islands where none existed prior to schools destroyed being replaced. That, however, is a matter of policy at a higher level.\nIndian Affairs Branch-\n\n(2) There are many children who cannot get the proper kind of education in day schools in Northern Manitoba, and, in any case, if my information is correct, there is no vacant accommodation in day schools.\n\n(3) We expect the Field Officials of the Department to implement decisions reached at Ottawa.

I feel that the Minister's office should be informed that the building of the Norway House Residential School should receive priority over the building of Amos, Thunderchild and any other previously mentioned schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nAttendance of Children at Residential Schools\n\nI have passed to the Director your letter of August 21 concerning the attendance of children at residential schools.\n\nI particularly wanted him to note the remarks with regard to the need for an immediate replacement of the residential school at Norway House. Our Chief Engineer has been requested to start his architects on this design and I hope that the plans will be ready to show you in January or February.\n\nI believe that Mr. Davis is now taking action to send some of these children to your residential schools. I wired him yesterday authorizing the sending of ten children to the Portage la Prairie school and hope that Mr. Strapp has been able to accept other children at Brandon.\n\nI concur with your conclusion that this difficulty will recur every summer until a residential school is again erected at Norway House.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

They went back last week doing the same and I don't want that to happen to my boy. The complaint is that Mr. Struppe Principal of the school isn't looking after things so all the children are complaining. The children are very mean to the little ones and the reason is the staff aren't with...\nthem enough to see to these things, and they are not getting enough to eat. Why is that in food scarce? I want to send him here to our day school so I would like your reply right away. I did not ask you to sign the forms for my boy to stay at Board School so I want to keep him home and have him attend the day school.\n\nThanking you sincerely,\n\nJohn Lawson\nClark River Ind.

Minnis,\nSupt., Norway House Agency.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the above,\n\nThis letter was not received by the Norway House Agency until June 10th, due to lack of mailing facilities during the Spring break-up. It was then forwarded to this Agency arriving today's date.\n\nOn my recent visit to God's Lake I was informed by the Chief of the band that the Rev. Gibson had been putting considerable pressure on the parents of the children concerned to get their consent to the children going to Residential School; in fact he threatened them with suspension of Family Allowance according to the Chief's Statement.\n\nUnfortunately, the Rev. Gibson was away during my visit and I was unable to take the matter up with him.\n\nPersonally, I can see no reason for the majority of these children attending Residential School when there is a total of three day schools in the Band area. Two of the schools, one U.C. and one R.C. are right on the reserve, the other one is 18 miles away at the God's Lake Mine site where a few of the band reside.\n\nGod's Lake is a large reserve and it is true some of the families may be some distance from a school, however, I am sure some arrangement can be made if necessary to enable the children to stay with relations in the vicinity of the school.\n\nI will be at God's Lake on July 3rd, for Treaty payments and I intend to go into this matter very thoroughly at that time.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6259, file 576-10, part 17)\nAs regards the applications that were submitted by the Rev. Gibson for 1949, you will perhaps remember he did not have the children examined by the doctor and consequently it was of no use submitting the application forms to Ottawa without the doctor's signature.\n\nThe Dept. has spent thousands of dollars on a new U.C. School on the reserve and is at present spending a few more thousands on a new R.C. School, also on the reserve.\n\nIt appears to me that every effort should be made to have the children attend the local Indian Day School.\n\nYou can rest assured this will be done, a report will be submitted to your office immediately after I have investigated the whole matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. Staunton,\nSupt., Indian Agency.\n\nJHS/JMN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttn. Mr. B. F. Neary, Superintendent of Indian Education\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of a letter addressed to Rev. H. B. Gibson, Missionary, God's Lake Reserve, dated July 5, 1950, file No. 753 (E3) and signed by Mr. C. A. F. Clark regarding the admission of children from God's Lake to residential school. I am attaching, hereto, a copy of a letter received from Mr. Staunton regarding children also from God's Lake.\n\nIn my opinion these children should not be encouraged to go to Boarding Schools when we are supplying day schools in the vicinity. I feel that Mr. Gibson should not have been written to direct as this man is more or less of a trouble-maker and by writing him only makes him worse. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. Staunton advising him to be very careful before he recommends any of these children to boarding school.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nOctober 2, 1950.\n\nDear Col. Neary;\n\nRe the above mentioned children; I have questioned Mr. Haggerty who was the driver of our school bus which brought these children down from Hodgson, and he informs me that he visited the office of the Indian Supt. on the morning of Sept. 26th. and made inquiries as to what children were coming to Brandon. The Supt. had just left and the clerk in charge was not able to give any information. As the father assured Mr. Haggerty that he had made application through the office they were brought down to school.\n\nA physical examination has been carried out by our Medical Supt. The Wasserman test is NEGATIVE. The two girls have a vaginal discharge the nature of which could not at the time be determined and so they were admitted to hospital. I am informed by Dr. Duggan by whom they have been treated that the tests made are all negative. Because of the fact that there may have been an infection they have been held in hospital and given routine treatment and will be discharged October 5th. from hospital.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast summer & fall we experienced great difficulty in sending out a number of children to the Brandon Residential School. Most of the applications had been forwarded to the Supt. of Nelson River Agency by April in the hope that with this advance information he would be sure to make all necessary arrangements for the children. As this was not done, I have made enquiries of Mr. Gowans in an endeavour to discover the reason why there was delay. Mr. Gowans mentioned that one possible reason was that there are several letters on record stating that force was being applied on the parents to have the children sent to school. I may be able to receive further details re this from Mr. Staunton whom I am writing but in the meantime I would like you to know that there was never any type of compulsion used to obtain pupils for residential school. The actual situation was this that the parents were inconvenienced a great deal in waiting the fall of 1949 for the children to go out to school. Two of these applicants were sent then to Cross Lake Residential School in 1950 because we were held up in the forwarding of the children to the school. We never have & never will send out children to the residential school against the wishes of the parents.\n\nThere will be a number of additional applications for residential school and I will see that these are in the hands of the Indian Superintendent in April at the latest. We still have quite a number of children who receive no education due to being located at trapping camps several days journey away from here. These will be the ones who apply for Residential School. As each year there are more permanent homes being built on the Reserve our day school population has ever reason to increase. At the moment there are a large number of beginners due to start here.\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a letter written to Mr. R.S. Davis, Regional Supervisor in Winnipeg. Mrs. Gosbee, teacher of the United Church Indian Day School, has informed us that she has sent in her resignation and therefore I am applying for the position of teacher of the school for the unfinished portion of the school term. I trust that you will look upon this application with favor. I am arranging my church work so that my undivided attention can be given to the work of the school. Formerly I had gone out to Winnipeg in June but I will forgo that this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHoward B. Gibson.\nJanuary 24, 1951.\n\nRev. Howard B. Gibson,\nUnited Church Mission,\nGod's Lake Narrows, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of January 13th with reference to placing children in the Brandon Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you are communicating with Superintendent Gowans, and that you are only recommending admission to the residential school for those children who are unable to attend a day school. You will be written under separate cover regarding the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJanuary 24, 1951.\n\nMr. Wm.

Gibson, God's Lake Narrows, with reference to placing children in the Brandon Residential School. Mr. Gibson states that he is communicating with you, and that he will only recommend children who are unable to attend a day school.\n\nAs soon as you hear from him, you should communicate with us so that the management of the Brandon School may be advised at an early date regarding the children from God's Lake who will be placed in that school this fall.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Bell informed me that he had had some trouble with Clarence and that he was suspending him from all classes, and it would be necessary for Clarence to present an apology and signify his desire to resume classes before he would lift the suspension.\n\nUpon his return from Collegiate this afternoon, Clarence informed me that he had decided that as he was only causing trouble at school he had decided to leave.

I feel it is time the Rev. Strapp was put in his place.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nThe City High School Principal had suspended this boy and so the boy would not obey the high school principal and was not entitled to eat all day.
