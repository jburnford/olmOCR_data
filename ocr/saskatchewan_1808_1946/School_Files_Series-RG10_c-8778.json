You will note that these refer to the lighting plant at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. The present lighting plant was installed in the year 1926-27. The cost of the Lister plant, wiring and installation was approximately $10,000. In addition, new batteries were supplied at a cost of $575.00 in the year 1930.\n\nOur Estimates for the coming fiscal year have already been submitted to Parliament, and no provision was made for a new lighting system at the Kuper Island School. Our Appropriation is so limited that it is practically impossible to provide funds for an expenditure as heavy as the estimate given by Messrs. Hoffars Limited.\n\nThe Department would appreciate your visiting the Kuper Island School at your convenience, and inspecting the lighting plant and reporting as to the minimum expenditure required to place this plant in working condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

On May 13th Mr. Vivian examined our plant at Kuper Island and discussed the question of replacement with the Rev. Principal and has outlined in the attached letter what he would recommend for the school and the cost of the new unit installed.\n\nThe Vivian engine is made in the city of Vancouver and is a product of high quality. Those who have this make of engine speak very well of its service. It has an advantage over the outside product in that parts can be obtained readily and also that the manufacturer is in a position to personally look into any troubles that may develop in the machinery installed by his firm.\n\nThe cost of the necessary repair to recondition the present units is placed at approximately $1100. It is considered this would be an unwarranted expense as these units, being of the gasoline type, are now obsolete.\n\nAfter looking into this matter very carefully, and as a result of interviews with persons in a position to give reliable information and advice, I strongly recommend the purchase of a Vivian 2 cylinder 20 H.P. 600 r.p.m., Stationary Diesel Engine with direct connection to a 12 K.W. Generator, to replace the present plant at the Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nThe price quoted by Mr. Vivian is approximately $1200 less than that submitted by Hoffars Ltd., when the value of the 6 H.P. gas engine, which Hoffars Ltd. want as part of the trade in equipment, and the cost of the concrete foundation and the necessary labour which is to be borne by the school are considered.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nLast January, Mr. H. Graham, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C., advised the Department that the lighting system at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School was worn out and required either extensive repair or replacement.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay was instructed to visit the school and carefully examine the lighting system. He reports that the replacement of the present system is absolutely necessary, and suggests the installation of the following:\n\nOne 2 cylinder 20 H.P., 600 r.p.m. Stationary VIVIAN Diesel engine, direct connected to a 12 KW Generator, delivered and completely installed at Kuper Island, including necessary electrical work, taking in trade the present 2 cylinder gasoline set with generator, for the net price of ........... $2,450.00.\n\nCommissioner MacKay has received from the Vivian Engine Works Limited, 1090 West Sixth Avenue, Vancouver, B.C., a quotation of $2,450.00, plus sales tax, for the installation, and strongly recommends the purchase of the Vivian 2 cylinder 20 H.P. Diesel engine.\n\n- Funds\nFunds for this purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nThe Kuper Island Residential School is in the Cowichan Agency, Vancouver Island, Electoral District of Namaste, B.C.\n\nI would appreciate receiving your approval to place the order with the Vivian Engine Works Limited, Vancouver.\n\nT.R.M\nActing Director.\nOttawa, June 21, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nRe: Kuper Island lighting system.\n\nThe purchase of this equipment was discussed very fully and in detail with Mr. MacKay, when he attended the Inspectors' Conference at Ottawa a few weeks ago. Mr. MacKay was instructed, at that time, to visit the school, inspect the plant, seek professional advice and obtain competitive prices.\n\nIn his report to the Department, dated May 27th, he states:\n\n\"After looking into this matter very carefully and as a result of interviews with persons in a position to give reliable information and advice, I strongly recommend the purchase of a Vivian 2 cylinder 20 H.P. 600 R.p.m. Stationary Diesel Engine with direct connection to a 12 K.W.

I would, therefore, appreciate it if you would have the Vivian Engine Works supply complete details and specifications of the following:\n\nOil engine - including cuts or catalogue;\nGenerator - manufacturer's name, voltage and capacity;\nSwitchboard - if any, including automatic starting equipment, if any;\nStorage batteries - if any;\nFoundations;\nFuel tank;\nCooling system;\nExhaust system;\nElectrical wiring;\n\nIs the plant to be connected and left ready for service?\nDetails of equipment to be taken in trade;\nPrice of new equipment, including sales tax;\nAllowance on old equipment.\n\nIt is understood that a proposed expenditure of $2,450.00, plus sales tax, is the total amount necessary to place the lighting plant in working condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your 152-0/5 of the 30th ultimo regarding the replacement of the power plant at Kuper Island School, I am forwarding herewith Mr. Vivian's letter covering the information asked for.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Vivian is submitting an alternative proposal, the details of which are embodied in a separate letter enclosed, because of the length of time required to obtain a 600 r.p.m. generator. The costs in the alternative plan are the same, i.e., $2450.00 plus sales tax, nor is there any change in the equipment with the exception of the generator, which is of larger capacity and, as Mr. Vivian states, more costly to his company.\n\nAs the school re-opens on September 1st it would be well to have the new engine and equipment installed by that date if possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDMM/LT\n\nENGL.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Deputy Minister.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 26th, 1937, in connection with the purchase of a Diesel engine and generator for the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, I enclose correspondence just received from the Vivian Engine Works Limited, giving the information requested in Mr. Pratt's memorandum.\n\nMight I point out that the Kuper Island Indian Residential School re-opens on September 1st, 1937, and it is necessary that the new engine and equipment should be installed by that date.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Jackson,\n\nRe: Purchase of Diesel-Generator Set for Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nOn June 17th last the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch advised the Deputy Minister the lighting plant at the above school was worn out and required either extensive repairs or replacement; that Indian Commissioner McKay had been instructed to examine and report on the situation; that the Commissioner had recommended the purchase of a new engine and generator to be supplied and installed by the Vivian Engine Works of Vancouver, at a cost of $2,450.00 plus sales tax.\n\nOn June 21st the Director wrote further, strongly recommending that this equipment be purchased from the Vivian Company as their engine was made in Vancouver, hence any service and repair parts needed could be quickly obtained. He also stated that a price obtained from Hoffars Limited was $1200 higher than that of the Vivian Company.\n\nAn Officer of the Purchasing Division consulted with Mr. Hickey, Electrical Engineer, Public Works Department, on the suitability of the equipment offered by the Vivian Company and on the price quoted by them. Mr. Hickey required further details and specifications before giving any definite opinion. These details and specifications have been received and are, briefly, as follow:\n\nEngine One Vivian two cylinder 35 H. P. Diesel Engine, with electric starter and standard built-in equipment $2,000.00 Plus 8% sales tax. 160.00\n\nGenerator One Canadian General Electric 15 K. W., 125 volts, complete with base, rheostat and drive pulleys including sales tax. 450.00\n\nSub-Base To accommodate engine and generator 100.00 Plus 8% sales tax. 8.00\n\nSwitchboard Present equipment to be used\n\nStorage Batteries\nFuel Tank\nCooling System\nExhaust System To be supplied by the Vivian Engine Works, and to include silencer.\nElectric Wiring To be installed by representative of the Canadian General Electric Company.\nFoundations To be supplied by the School\n\n$2,718.00\n\n(cont'd)\nCarried Forward. $2,718.00\n\nInstallation Complete installation, including delivery to School\u2014all ready to operate\u2014to include familiarizing of operator with all details $200.00 $2,918.00\n\nTrade-in Allowance on old engine and generator $300.00\n\nTOTAL COST. $2,618.00\n\nMr. Hickey states that the engine offered is of ample power; that the generator is satisfactory for the work and of reputable make; and that in view of the fact that it is desirable that the equipment be installed before school opens on September 1st it is his recommendation that the tender of the Vivian Company be accepted.\n\nThe Director of the Indian Affairs Branch has written, July 19th, pointing out that school opens on September 1st \"and it is necessary that the new engine and equipment should be installed by that date.\"\n\nI have, therefore, to recommend that an order be placed with the Vivian Engine Works of Vancouver for the above equipment and work, without calling for competitive bids, other than the one of Hoffars Limited, mentioned by the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, and would quote Section 36, Chapter 166 re Statutes, which provides that \"A work of pressing emergency, in which delay would be dangerous to the public interest\" may be proceeded with, without calling for tenders.\n\nFH/EB.\n\nW.

Box 666,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nATTENTION MAJOR D.M. MCKAY\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe thank you for your letter of July 6, with a copy of your recommendation of May 27 and the reply from Ottawa of June 30.\n\nWe are pleased to outline the following particulars.\n\nOil Engine\nThe engine which we propose is our standard 2 cylinder 35 H.P. at 800 r.p.m. four cycle, full Diesel stationary machine. In our quotation of May 14, we were figuring on direct-connecting the engine to a 600 r.p.m. generator. We quoted this machine as 20 H.P., which is the horse power developed at 600 r.p.m. This will give a good reserve of power. Also, at this speed ordinary wear and tear will be greatly reduced.\n\nGenerator\nSince quoting on May 14, deliveries of generators have become very critical. Upon making inquiries with the firm who were supplying the 600 r.p.m. generator, we find that they could not let us have this until about 4 to 5 months after ordering.\n\nAs we understand there is some hurry about getting this equipment together for the Kuper Island School, we wish to submit an alternative proposal which you will find attached herewith.\n\nSwitchboard\nPresent board is quite satisfactory for all requirements. We will mount starting switch on same.\n\nStorage Batteries\nPropose using present batteries.\n\nFoundations\nThe reverend Principal arranged that he would look after the foundations.\nJuly 10, 1937.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.\n\nFuel Tank\nOriginal tank to be kept\n\nCooling System\nOriginal cooling system to be retained.\n\nExhaust System\nTo be supplied by ourselves and to include a silencer.\n\nElectrical Wiring\nTo be installed by a representative of the Canadian General Electric Company.\n\nWe will supply a man to install the engine and generator, see that everything is working satisfactorily, and to familiarize the operator with all details.\n\nTrade In\nThe School at present has a 2 cylinder gasoline engine and generator and a single cylinder gasoline engine and generator. We propose to take in trade the first-mentioned, leaving the latter as a stand-by for emergency purposes. We will make an allowance of $300.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVIVIAN ENGINE WORKS LIMITED,\n\nPer\n\nWV/CC\nVIVIAN ENGINE WORKS LIMITED\nMANUFACTURERS OF MARINE AND STATIONARY ENGINES\n(GASOLINE AND DIESEL)\n\n1090 WEST SIXTH AVENUE\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nJuly 10, 1937.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nATTENTION MAJOR D.M. MCKAY\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nFurthering our letter of even date, we now submit our alternative proposal on a generating unit for the Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nONE 2 cylinder, 5\u00bd\" bore x 8\" stroke, 35 H.P. at 800 r.p.m. VIVIAN four cycle, cold starting, full Diesel stationary engine, operating at 700 r.p.m., complete with ring gear and electric starter, and all standard built in equipment, for the sum of $2,000.00\nPlus 8% Sales Tax $160.00\n$2,160.00\n\nONE Canadian General Electric type DY-2825, 15 KW, 1750 r.p.m., 125 volt, DC generator, complete with slide base, field rheostat, and tex-rope drive; also sales tax, for the sum of $450.00\n\nSub base to accommodate engine and generator and to provide for tightening belts $100.00\nPlus 8% Sales Tax $8.00\n$2,918.00\n\nComplete installation, all ready to operate $2,918.00\n\nAllowance for 2 cylinder gasoline engine and generator $300.00\n\nLeaving a net sum of $2,618.00\n\nThis price includes delivery to Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nYou will notice that the difference between $2,450.00 as quoted previously and $2,618.00 quoted now is taken up by Sales Tax.\n\nDelivery on the above unit to Kuper Island will be approximately five weeks after receipt of order.\nJuly 10, 1937.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources.\n\nThe generator quoted now is considerably larger in capacity than that submitted on May 14. It will cost us considerably more, also, but we are willing to absorb this. Further expansions at the School will be handled quite readily with this generating unit. There is sufficient power in the engine and we propose, in this case, to run it at 700 r.p.m. instead of 600 r.p.m.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVIVIAN ENGINE WORKS LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPer [Signature]\nVIVIAN DIESELS\n\n5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" Bore X 8\" Stroke\n800 R.P.M. Series\n\nSTATIONARY\n\nBritish Empire Engines\nMade in Canada\n\nVIVIAN ENGINE WORKS LTD.\n1090 West Sixth Avenue\nCABLE ADDRESS:\n\"ENGINES\" VANCOUVER\nVANCOUVER, Canada\nTHE VIVIAN DIESEL, a product of years of practical experience, was designed with careful consideration given to many desirable features, among which are:\n\nDependability: This is one of the chief requisites of any prime mover. Our policy of using only the highest grade materials; the special alloys which we have developed, and the well-supported, balanced base castings, of sufficient thickness without producing ponderous weight, have played their important part in contributing toward that dependability which is so characteristic of the VIVIAN Diesel.\n\nEconomy: The well known economy of the Diesel engine is due to the high compression ratio and ability to burn low cost fuels. A special combustion chamber was developed for the VIVIAN Diesel to give the greatest efficiency and immediate starting in any weather. Because of the ideal cooling and lubricating systems, and the large bearing surfaces, lubricating oil is also used in very small amounts.\n\nSimplicity: The VIVIAN Diesel has been very carefully engineered to meet the requirements of the average operator, so that equally satisfactory results may be obtained whether the man be skilled or not, as long as reasonable limits of maintenance and operation are observed. Starting is effected by compressed air which is recognized as the most simple system available.\n\nCompact Design: The compact construction of the VIVIAN Diesel allows a neat installation in a very small space. Large hand holes in each side of the base casting make it possible to reach internal parts easily.\n\nIn this line of engines there are six models, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8-cylinder sizes, each being 5\u00bd\" bore by 8\" stroke, and rated at 800 r.p.m. They are four stroke, solid injection, full Diesels and are of the single acting, vertical trunk piston, multi-cylinder design. This type of engine has the ability to effect perfect combustion at all speeds with ideal combustion cylinder walls, and excellent piston lubrication. VIVIAN Diesels have remarkably little liner wear and are free from bearing metal deterioration and overheated valves.\n\nThe engines are pleasing and neat in appearance, are completely sealed against dust, oil and fumes. They deliver continuous, dependable power, smoothly, flexibly, and with low operating and maintenance costs.\n\nBase: In one piece, made of special cast iron, of substantial design with rigid transverse members.\n\nCylinder Block: Made of high test cast iron and is designed to provide great strength and rigidity without excessive weight. Large cover plates provide complete access to the main bearings and running gear. The upper part of the block is bored to receive the cylinder liners, the space between the frame and the liners forming the water jacket. The inlet water manifold and air manifold are formed integral in the block and large openings are provided for cleaning the water jacket space. The cylinder block also carries the camshaft which rotates in cast iron, bronze lined bearings. The camshaft assembly can be removed in one piece.\n\nCylinder Liners: Made of hard nickel alloy cast iron of special mixture developed for wearing quality. They are pressed into the block with a shoulder at the top. The lower end of the liner is guided in the block but the liner is free to expand, and water leakage is prevented by an adjustable packing gland and rubber packing. This construction prevents the possibility of distortion and greatly increases the life of pistons and rings.\n\nCylinder Heads: Nickel cast iron, cast singly, and carefully designed to give symmetrical arrangement of the valve openings and equal distribution of metal. Vertical overhead valves are employed and are operated through rocker arms, push rods, and tappets. The heads are easily removable without disturbing the exhaust manifold or other accessories.\n\nCylinder Head Covers: Made of cast aluminum and are readily removed for valve clearance adjustments. Removal of the cylinder head cover makes accessible the rocker arm assembly, valves and nozzle.\n\nCrankshafts: Made of forged steel, annealed and heat treated. The bearings are large in diameter, and total area, with a main bearing on either side of each crankpin. This construction together with full proportioned webs provides rigidity to insure long life and freedom from frequent bearing adjustments.\n\nMain Bearings: Consist of babbitted nickel cast iron bottom halves carefully fitted in a seat in the base and a cap of nickel cast iron lined with babbit. An extra bearing is fitted on each end of the engine, which adequately...\nDiesels\n\nBritish Empire Engines\nMade in Canada\n\ntakes care of additional loads. These are the same as the others. Therefore, all main bearings are interchangeable.\n\nCamshaft: Driven by spur gears at the front of the engine.\n\nConnecting Rods: High grade steel forgings of ample length to insure low cylinder wall pressures and with marine type crank pin boxes of bronze lined with babbit. The wrist pin ends are forged solid, accurately bored, and fitted with oversize bronze bushings.\n\nPistons: Made of nickel cast iron suitable to withstand the high temperature and use of ample length. There is provision made to prevent lubricating oil from contacting the undersurface of the piston crown. A special VIVIAN feature is the shape of the top of the piston which forms the combustion volume. This is a highly developed and simplified design providing efficient combustion and immediate starting in any weather.\n\nPiston Pins: High grade steel, hardened and ground, of liberal proportions and carefully fitted in the pistons.\n\nPiston Rings: Six in number, five above the wrist pin and one below. The two bottom rings are of the oil scraper type.\n\nValves: The valves seat directly on the cylinder head, no cages or inserts being used. This arrangement is preferable as it gives maximum cooling of the valve heads and seats, and is permissible, as the complete head is not heavy and can easily be removed.\n\nThe exhaust and inlet valves are made of alloy steel stems with special high test nickel chrome alloy cast iron heads suitable to withstand the high temperatures. They are operated from the camshaft and are totally enclosed, but easily accessible.\n\nFlywheels: Two flywheels are employed of sufficient weight to give the degree of uniformity of rotation required for the service for which the engine is used. Barring holes are provided in the rim of the front flywheel for turning the engine.\n\nValve Stem Guides: Made of cast iron and are renewable.\n\nExhaust and Inlet Valve Cams: Made of hardened steel.\n\nFuel Injection System: The fuel pump is a self-contained unit and individual cylinders and plungers for each cylinder are correctly timed, accurately meter the fuel, the amount being varied by the control rod. All plungers are operated from a common camshaft, and all adjustments are set and locked. The possibility of pump trouble of any kind is extremely remote. The pump is of the highest proven and interchangeability of the pump itself or its component parts has been fully provided for. The injectors are mounted on the cylinder heads and are well water-jacketed. They are of the automatic spring loaded plunger type with multi-hole nozzles which insure correct distribution of the fuel oil and efficient combustion. No adjustment on the fuel system is necessary or advisable.\n\nGovernor: A rugged but sensitive vertical type centrifugal governor maintains speed fluctuations within close limits. The governor is enclosed in a dust-proof, oil-tight housing and is gear driven from the camshaft. Linked to the governor is a horizontal rod which actuates the bypass mechanism of the pump, thereby metering the amount of fuel injected to suit the load, and controlling the speed within the closest limits.\n\nFuel Oil Filter: Designed to retain any abrasives which might be harmful to the fuel injection system.\n\nLubricating Oil Filter: Of simple and conventional design, is readily cleaned and easily accessible.\n\nWater Pump: Bronze, gear type of ample size insuring positive volume.\n\nStarting System: The engine is started by means of compressed air, the starting air being applied to all cylinders through a distributor. This distributor is of the rotary type, the rotating valve coming in contact with the seat only when the starting air is being applied, delivering air to the spring loaded poppet air valves located in the cylinder heads. The engine is fitted with a water-cooled air compressor driven from the crankshaft for charging the starting tank.\n\nExhaust Manifold: Made of cast iron and is water-jacketed when required. Connection is made to the cylinder head exhaust ports through an elbow.\n\nLubricating System: The lubricating system is of full pressure type to all principal bearing surfaces. The lubricating oil pump, which is a special gear driven rotary pressure pump, draws oil from the base through the lubricating oil filter to a main header, a branch from the header leading to each main bearing. The oil then passes through oil lines fixed in the crankshaft to each crankpin. It then passes upward through holes drilled in the connecting rods to the wrist pins. Other branches and headers supply oil under pressure to the camshaft bearings, governor bearings, rocker arms, push rod yokes and gear shafts. The pump is of more than adequate size supplying more oil than is necessary for all bearings and a relief valve is fitted which provides a flow of oil over the timing gears.\n\nThere are no separate oil cups or grease cups which need attention to take care of the main operating parts of the engine.\n\nThe air distributor and water pump assembly are provided with grease cups.\n\nCooling System: Full circulating pump system with distribution arranged to provide even temperature throughout the engine. From the discharge side of the pump, water passes through a main pipe cast in the cylinder block into the water jackets, and up through the cylinder heads, thence into the water-jacketed exhaust manifold from which it is piped to discharge.\n5\u00bd\" x 8\" Vivian Stationary Diesel Series\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 CYLINDERS . . . 17\u00bd H.P.

Vivian Stationary Diesel.\nWHY\nYou Should Buy a VIVIAN\n\nFor over a quarter of a century the Vivian Engine Works has been manufacturing internal combustion engines. From the beginning the Company set a high standard of quality.\n\nLong operating life, made possible by sound basic design and high grade materials is a recognized characteristic of the Vivian Diesel. All parts are of oversize dimensions but engineering skill has eliminated unnecessary weight. The Vivian engine, therefore, has high output of power and the capacity for continuing to deliver such power for many years.\n\nA Vivian engine is a complete unit with every accessory built in; compact and symmetrical, it is as pleasing in appearance as in performance.\n\nThe Vivian Engine Works maintains its own designing department, laboratory, pattern shop, foundry, machine shop, assembly shop, and testing department. Men of years of experience with the Company are in charge of the various departments. Rigid and constant inspection follows each part from the raw state to the finished product.\n\nStarted primarily as a Company to manufacture engines for the basic industries of British Columbia, the Vivian Engine Works soon found its product in demand in wider fields. As far north as the Arctic Circle, Vivian engines have played a leading role; and in Chinese waters and the South Seas Vivian engines have proved equally satisfactory.\n\nFor long, trouble-free service, select a Vivian, the engine of excess strength and stamina.\n\nVIVIAN ENGINE WORKS LTD.\n1090 West Sixth Ave. VANCOUVER, Canada\n\nCABLE ADDRESS:\n\"ENGINES\" VANCOUVER\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H.W.

The quotation is from the Victoria Machinery Depot, Victoria, B.C., who supplied the boiler. In view of the prevailing conditions there may be an increase in the price of tubes, and if there is any great delay in placing the order allowances should be made for this.\n\nShould funds be available I would suggest that purchase be authorized as soon as possible and delivery made to the school.

The amount specified covers materials only, as you state the school is prepared to supply labour free of charge.\n\nIn view of the amount involved, it will be necessary for you to forward detailed information regarding the materials required in order that the purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nIn view of the lack of funds, it will not be possible to consider the erection of the manual training building this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nJuly 23/40\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing our conversation over telephone when I was informed that a grant for a Manual Training building would not be provided by the Department, but that a sum to the amount of a suggested estimate would be provided for plumbing and improvements in a lavatory, I beg to acknowledge that without the Manual Training building the plans for the projected lavatory cannot be carried out, as the present Manual Training room was to be converted to a Lavatory.\n\nI am however happy to say that the money which would have been affected to this purpose, would sufficiently defray the expenses for a series of Storage Batteries to replace the Power Batteries we have now which in a few months will have become quite useless.\n\nEarly in Spring I was able to realize that our present equipment was already inefficient and soon would have to be changed, but with difficult conditions prevailing together with fact that two estimates for this school had been sent to the Department, I thought it would be advisable to wait and let circumstances pave the way to a solution.\n\nThe cost of a new set of batteries as suggested by Marshall Wells, Vancouver would be $695.00 with discount from this price being 20%.\n\nHoping that the Department will not object to this request,\n\nI am,\nyours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDuncan, B.

He requests that the $600.00 which is now available for the alterations to the plumbing system be made available for batteries and that the plumbing and manual training building improvements be postponed until funds are available.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[R.

It will be observed that in view of this, the Reverend Principal requested the $600 available be used for repairs of the batteries for the school lighting plant.\n\nYour instructions in the matter would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M.

Arnall, Engineer of the Dominion Department of Public Works, reported as follows on Boiler No. 2020:\n\n\"Boiler in good condition although some of the tubes are getting thin and may start leaking. They are 25 years old.\"\n\nIn view of the condition and age of these tubes, it was considered advisable to secure prices on new tubes for this boiler and place this information before you in case funds were available to make replacement at this time.

Ward, electrician for the Dominion Department of Public Works, for services in inspecting the lighting unit at Kuper Island Indian Residential School. This was necessitated by the fact that the new batteries installed recently in this institution were found to be rapidly discharging. Mr. Ward found the cause to be a faulty cut-out on the old generating plant which is now used as an auxiliary.\n\nI made enquiries as to the cost of the cut-out plant recommended by Mr. Ward, a \"110 volt D.C. 27.5 Amp.\" cut-out, which is quoted at \u00a318.75 plus postage and handling charges which would probably not exceed \u00a31, or a total of \u00a319.75.\n\nI would request authority to purchase this cut-out and if it is beyond the skill of the school engineer, to have Mr. Ward go there and give the necessary instructions for its installation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

If possible, as this order has already been placed, I would like to have authority for the payment from the 1941-42 funds.

Principal of the Kuper Island School this morning in which is contained the following paragraph:\n\n\"Lately I have noticed that the middle part of the house has been sagging considerably. This condition I was told has existed for some time, but in the past year the sinking has been quite pronounced judging by the wainscoting in the upper dormitory which has been out of line some three inches. May I suggest that Mr Cole, I think that is the name, the man living next to you come over and look it over. I think I remember you saying he had something to do with the building.\"\n\n(In this regard I might say that this is the first intimation I have had that there has been any sagging of the building which it would appear has existed for some years, although more noticeable this spring.)\n\nThe man, Mr Cole, which Father Camirand mentions in his letter is Mr E.W. Lee, Contractor, and present Mayor of Duncan, was one of the Contractors who built the School; hence Father Camirand's request that he be asked to go over and have a look at the building.\n\nI would recommend that I be authorised to have Mr Lee visit the School and give a report on just what is causing the sinking. (If the matter is attended to as soon as possible it might stop further sinking and serious damage to the whole building.)\n\nYours obediently,\n\nD. M.

This condition I was told has existed for some time, but in the past year the sinking has been quite pronounced judging by the wainscoting in the upper dormitory which has been out of line some three inches.\n\n\"In this regard I might say that this is the first intimation I have had that there has been any sagging of the building which it would appear has existed for some years, although more noticeable this spring.\n\n\"If the matter is attended to as soon as possible it might stop further sinking and serious damage to the whole building.\"\nIt would be appreciated if you could arrange to have one of your officials in Vancouver inspect this school at the earliest possible date and submit a report regarding its present condition and what action can be taken to remedy the condition reported by the Agent.\n\nDirector.\n**MARSHALL-WELLS B.C.

C. WARREN\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJune 19, 1941.\nVancouver, B.C.\nJune 19, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested I made an inspection on May 24th of Kuper Island School building. Following is a report on conditions observed.\n\nComplaints have recently been received by the Indian Affairs Branch from the School Principal, Rev. Father Camirand, that extraordinary settlement has taken place and an inspection and report was requested.\n\nKuper Island school was built in 1915, replacing a number of frame structures. The building is a two-storey brick-veneered frame structure on a concrete foundation. It appears to be substantially constructed except in a few details which will be reported on at length. It has been very well maintained. A photograph of the building is attached.\n\nFOUNDATIONS\n\nThe concrete foundations extend to the first floor level, 10\u00bd feet above the ground, and more than three feet below ground level (actual depth undetermined). There are said to be extended footings. The wall is 18\" at the top and battered on the outside about 1 in 6 in the top six feet, being about 24 inches thick at ground level.\n\nClose examination shows no sign of settlement. A few hairline cracks 3 or 4 feet in length appear in the plaster coating on the outside near the side entrances of the wings and at the front but\nthere is no marked separation at these points. Interior basement walls are of concrete, furred, lathed and plastered.\n\nGROUND FLOOR\n\nThe ground floor level is well supported by wood-covered steel columns in the wings and front half of centre section. The rear half is supported by partitions. There is no evidence of settlement on the ground floor except in chapel ceiling where hanging rear wall has sagged about 1/4 inches. Separation along baseboards and wainscoating, ordinarily noticeable in frame buildings, is absent.\n\nFIRST FLOOR\n\nOnly very slight unevenness at baseboards and wainscoating except at rear of centre section, above the chapel, where floor sag amounts to about 3/8 of an inch at rear wall. The building is divided by a partition at the centre, the left half being occupied by boys and the right half by girls. First floor is supported by partitions in centre section, by columns and partitions in wings. Only two floors in wings.\n\nSECOND FLOOR\n\nUnevenness in floors noticeable commencing at stair wells, both ends of centre section. Considerable sag immediately above chapel, separation of partition walls from rear wall and roof slope ceiling at several points. This is due to walls being pushed out of vertical by roof.\nATTIC\n\nThe sag noted on lower floors of the central section has accumulated in the attic ceiling and roof slopes. The apparent sag in second floor ceiling is about 2 to 3 inches; in the rear roof slope about 3 inches; in front roof slope about 1\u00bd inches. Actual sag probably is considerably more if measured from the true apex line to eaves. A sag in the roof ridge is also noticeable from outside. The ceilings in both boys and girls dormitories on the second floor are carried on rafters and rafter ties supported by two trusses of 23\u00bd feet span and 4\u00bd\" rise.\n\nThe heavy cupola at the centre of the building is carried on the centre corridor walls. The roof, ceiling and floors directly beneath appear normal.\n\nFRONT WALL\n\nThe front wall of the centre section is out of vertical about 1 inch inward along the front projection and out of vertical outward about the same amount at each side of the centre section from eaves to second floor level.\n\nREAR WALL\n\nThe rear wall of the centre section is out of vertical outward about 2 inches from eaves to first floor level all along except at the chimney where it appears plumb, the chimney being apparently unaffected. A number of cracks appear in the brickwork above the line of the chapel roof. The separation along the mortar lines is about 1/4-inch. Several of these cracks have been filled. One, possibly of more recent occurrence, remains open. So far as could be deter-\nmined there is no corresponding sag in the framework backing and the brick ties appear unaffected except possibly where the brick has sagged.\n\nThe Principal informs me that the sag in the top floor has been evident for many years but more recently there appears to have been an increase.\n\n**CHAPEL**\n\nThere is a sag in the chapel ceiling directly under the hanging rear wall of the central section, amounting to about 1/4 inches. The sag no doubt accounts for the cracks in the brickwork above. There is also a noticeable sag in the slopes of the chapel roof. This is probably due to the fact that the ceiling is in part carried on the rafters. It was not possible to secure entrance to the space between the ceiling and roof of the chapel for examination. Indications of a slight leak in the corner of the chapel ceiling next the chimney were noted.\n\n**WINGS**\n\nThe wings appear to be in very good condition. Unlike the central section there are columns and beams supporting the ground floor and first floor but none supporting the first floor ceiling. There is a slight sag in the ceiling.\n\nBrickwork needs pointing in a few places, probably not exceeding 100 square feet altogether.\n\n**CAUSE OF SAG**\n\nThe cause of sag in the ceiling and roof of the central section is insufficient support. This lack of support has in turn caused the outward thrust of roof components which forced the outside walls out of vertical.\nRECOMMENDED STRENGTHENING\n\nThe accompanying sketches show suggested installations for adding support to roof and ceiling and to strengthen the outside walls.\n\nIn the case of the roof and ceiling support is to be provided by means of steel pipe columns based on the central corridor walls which are continuous to the basement floors. Beams supported on the columns are to be transverse to ceiling joist and carried through the dormitories to posts at partition walls. Ties are to be added between ceiling joist and rafters as shown in accompanying sketch.\n\nIt would be desirable to have an unimpeded floor surface in the dormitories but this could not be obtained except by the use of trusses. These would not be satisfactory even if suitably constructed as stable bearing points cannot be secured except by continuous columns carried up from the basement floor which would cause obstruction on other floors.\n\nIn order to strengthen the walls against the outward thrust of the roof, it is recommended that ties be placed at four points indicated on the sketches where lateral support can be provided against vibration so likely to be caused in the dormitories. Present ties seem to be inadequate in the top floor.\n\nTwo steel pipe columns are suggested for support of the beam in the chapel. These are to be carried on the basement walls. It will be necessary to shorten two pews about six inches in order to leave an unobstructed aisle.\n\nThe cost of the suggested repairs is estimated at $934.00. All wood columns in the dormitories\ninstead of steel would reduce the cost by about $100. While it is very likely the building will stand for many years without the suggested strengthening, I am of the opinion the designated supports should be installed. It will be evident in comparing the floor plans submitted (minor details omitted) of the building as found with those of the original design, that many changes were made which seriously impaired the strength of the structure. The probability of snow load, which is always a possibility on this coast and sometimes of very serious proportions for short durations, evidently was not contemplated when the upper floor and roof was built.\n\nI do not believe there is any necessity to install beams and posts to support the ceiling of the first floor in the wings which have only a slight sag. Nor is there any urgency about strengthening the roof of the chapel which shows a noticeable sag. To do so would require a large expenditure. Such work could probably be more cheaply undertaken when the chapel requires a new roof.\n\nWORK\n\nIt is very improbable that the walls and rafters can be brought back to their original positions. Whatever work of this nature is undertaken will need to be carefully done so as not to weaken the existing ties. Most of these are inaccessible for refastening without removal of much of the plaster on walls and ceiling.\n\nThe estimate for labour includes provision for some repairs to plaster, repointing of brick and painting, as well as the necessary carpentry work.\nMATERIAL FOR REPAIRS TO\nTimber can be obtained at the sawmill at Chemainus,\nfive miles from Kuper Island. Work can best be under-\ntaken in the latter part of July or in August when\npupils have all gone home.\n\n$53.40\n\nSince making the inspection of May 24th plans\nof the school have been received. In checking my notes\nwith the plans it was evident that the building differed\nmaterially from the plans. I accordingly paid another\nvisit to the school on June 14th. As a result of this\nvisit I have come to the conclusion that most, if not\nall, of the changes were made during erection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C.Warren\nAsst.

They are for the greater part confined to the central portion of the building.\n\nIn this connection, I may say that Mr. Warren has submitted prints of the existing layout of the various floors, and comparison with the original working drawings indicates many departures from the original design. The location of partitions has been changed, and a number of steel columns and beams designed as part of the structural frame have been added. No data is available regarding substitute measures adopted; but in view of Mr. Warren's report, it is considered likely that the central portion of the building has not been sufficiently braced, and the load imposed by the roof has spread the top of the front and rear back tensioned frame walls. This has caused separation of second floor partitions and floor construction, from the exterior walls, as well as having caused a spread in the roof members. This movement has resulted in sagging at the points mentioned in the report.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Warren considers repairs to the central portion of the building to be sufficient for the present. These repairs consist of providing additional support and stiffening for the roof construction, and by means of timber and turnbuckles securing the top of the exterior walls against further spread.

Wooden columns were substituted for steel pipe columns and laminated wood beams were employed as dry timber of the dimensions proposed could not be obtained. Also, the material substituted was dry and was of equal strength to the original proposal. The attached sketch shows the strengthening added to the building.\n\nThe 3\" steel tie rods used were anchored along the wall plate inside the cornice as shown in detail. The anchorage was carried through the brickwork only on the front projection. The space between the brick (about 1-5/8\") and sheeting was packed to provide solid support. The rods were taken up to maximum tension but an attempt was made to bring the walls to a vertical position.\n\nPlaster removed was replaced and a considerable amount of patching was done where painting at corners had occurred. All of the new woodwork was oiled and varnished.\n\nA small amount of painting remains to be done on the new plaster, but this should be deferred for about six months. It is probable the school authorities will undertake this if the paint is supplied.\n\nSome pointing of brickwork was done where cracks had occurred above the chapel roof and at several other points where spalling had occurred.\n\nThe cost of the work has not been determined yet, but will be given at a later date.\n\nAttached hereto is a memorandum of inspection made at Kuper Island School of the water, electric lighting and sewage system during August and a sketch plan of the water system.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs(RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 5)\nVancouver, B.C.\nAugust 25, 1941.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nWhile at Kuper Island School during August, I inspected the electric lighting system, water system and sewage disposal system. In this connection I wish to report as follows:\n\n**ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM:** Electric lighting system consists of a direct current generating set housed in a frame building 12 x 14 feet detached from the school buildings.\n\nEquipment consists of one Lister gas engine generator set 3 K.W., 110 volt, 550 R.P.M. This is part of what was originally a 2 unit Lister-Bruston automatic outfit installed about 1926. The larger of the two units has been replaced by a 35 H.P. Vivian Diesel engine with electric starter, belt connected to a 125 V., 15 K.W. C.G.E. generator installed in 1938. Both units are now manually controlled. Generator speed is 1,750 R.P.M., and the V-belt drive has 9\" generator pulley and 25\" engine pulley at 33\u00bd\" o.s.\n\nLister plant has thermo-syphon cooling and the Vivian engine a circulating pump. A 56 cell Coyle storage battery of 180 amp. hrs. is also used, this was installed in 1940.\n\nThe plant appears to function satisfactorily. The Vivian engine which incidentally is much too large for requirements, was being overhauled at the time of my visit. The school Principal and the school mechanic appear satisfied with the operation of the plant. Cooling tanks appear to have a short life; it is possible that with a better grade of sheet metal longer life would be obtained.\n\nOutside wooden cooling tanks would probably be preferable, on account of the longer life, but a larger capacity would be necessary than with metal tanks.\n\n**WATER SYSTEM:** Domestic water is obtained from an underground spring about \u00bc mile from the School. Water from the spring collects in a concrete lined pond, which in turn feeds a hydraulic ram. The ram pumps to an elevated tank which supplies water to the school by gravity. A further supply is derived from the pond by means of a gravity pipe line passing through a filter and thence to a concrete cistern of about 9,000 gallon capacity, at the rear of the power house. This supply is surplus to the requirements of the ram. From the cistern water is pumped to two pneumatic tanks in the boiler room of the school by means of an electrically driven displacement pump also in the boiler room, or alternatively to the high level tank to supplement the supply from the ram. The supply from the pneumatic tanks is primarily for fire protection service. The water system is shown on attached sketch.\n\n**RAM:** A Columbia Hydraulic Ram #2 manufactured by Associated Engineering Corp., Portland, Ore., appears to be in good operating condition. Has 2\" drive pipe about 125 feet long, and 1\" discharge pipe about 1,150 feet long. Pumps about 2 gallons per minute, when operating efficiently. Pumping head about 70 feet, drive head about 11 feet.\nFONDS: The spring is said to be 20 to 25 feet from the pond and connected by a 4\" pipe, and stone filled drain. The pond is saucer-shaped about 50' x 80' with a maximum depth of about 5 feet. It is surrounded by a fence. There appears to be considerable loss from the spring and pond as evidenced by the wet ground immediately to the east. Many cracks are noticeable in the concrete pond lining. The loss would not appear to be important as a sufficient supply is said to be obtained by present means. Estimated flow of spring 15 to 20 g.p.m. The pond would appear to be unnecessary and a possible source of trouble. I have been told that at the time the school was built the flow of the spring was 60 to 70 g.p.m.\n\nELEVATED TANK: The elevated tank is located on a wooden tower 27 feet above ground level and about 350 feet from the school. Height of the tank above the basement floor level is about 50 feet. The wooden tank, 8 feet diameter and 6 feet high, has a capacity of about 2000 gallons. The roof is supported on the tower platform which is about 12' x 12'. The 1\" feed pipe and 1\" supply pipe to school are enclosed in a 12' x 12' wooden box filled with sawdust from tank to ground. There is also a 2\" overflow pipe. The tower is built on concrete pedestals based on rock outcrop. The pedestals are on 12\" crs. and 6\" x 6\" tower posts have 1 in 8 batter.\n\nThe tank and tower appear to be in good condition. Elevated tank is hardly high enough to give good service to upper floor of school when demand is heavy.\n\nPNEUMATIC WATER SYSTEM: Pneumatic water system comprises two 4' x 20' steel tanks with an operating capacity of 1600 to 2000 gals. and a Meyers Bros., 913 M, 3\" x 4\" single cylinder pump with 13\" suction and discharge, belt connected to a 1 H.P., 3 C. Motor. The rated capacity of this pump is about 15 U.S. gals. per minute against 100 lbs. pressure. This pumping system is intended primarily for fire protection purposes, but is used daily when the school is in session to supplement the ram supply to the elevated tank, by-passes being provided for that purpose.\n\nAt the time of my visit the pneumatic tanks appeared to be water-logged. This fact was called to the attention of the school Principal.\n\nIt should be noted that the pump capacity is only about 15 g.p.m.; this is insufficient for fire protection supply. Minimum pump capacity for this purpose should be 50 g.p.m. I was informed by the school Principal that it is intended to move the pump to the power house and have it belt-connected to one of the engines there. (This has since been done August 30.)\n\nFIRE EQUIPMENT: Fire equipment consists of 2 hydrant outlets and 50' lengths of hose with nozzle on each of the four floors in the central part of the building. A fire axe in a case on each floor, and hand chemical fire extinguishers.\n\nThe building is equipped with outside fire escape stairways at the centre of each wing and slide poles at each rear angle of the building immediately adjoining the inside stair well. Access to all these escapes is through window openings.\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb re\nKuper Island School.\n\nAugust 25, 1941.\n\nSEWAGE SYSTEM: The sewage system appears to be operating satisfactorily and there have been no complaints.\n\nThe system as first installed included a septic tank with an effluent pipe discharging into the sea. In 1931 a new sea outlet pipe was constructed to low tide and a by-pass of the septic tank provided. Since that time all of the sewage goes directly to the sea. The septic tank although still serviceable, is no longer used.\n\nW. C.

Please interview the Principal immediately and forward detailed information regarding the best manner in which to expend the amount mentioned. You understand, of course, that explicit information must be given regarding all supplies and materials, as this is required by our Purchasing Branch and if furnished in the first place will avoid the necessity of extra correspondence. Your recommendations should be forwarded through the office of Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nDue to present conditions it is most important that we hear from you at the earliest possible date. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to obtain deliveries on many items and, therefore, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It is being explained that the amount of material quoted on will not be sufficient to complete the building, but it is felt that if a start can be made this year when the basement, frame, floor etc. can be completed, then it may be possible to get the rest of the materials next year to complete the job.\n\nRegarding a quotation on the materials required for the repairs to the plumbing system at the School, I beg to advise that so far the Rev. Principal has been unable to get a list and prices of these but expects to be able to do so this coming week, when the information will be forwarded under separate covering letter.\n\nYou will please note that the amount quoted is approximately $5.00 over the amount allotted by the Department and if the extra amount cannot be provided, then it will have to be cut out and the amount of materials cut accordingly.\n\nAs instructed, this letter is being sent forward through the Office of the Indian Commissioner, in duplicate.\n\nTrusting that this will receive your early attention and approval,\n\nYours obediently;\n\n(R.H.

Father J. Camirand which he received from two firms, McLennan, McFeely and Prior, Ltd., and Crane Ltd., of Victoria, B.C., for equipment necessary in making alterations to the plumbing system at the Kuper Island School.\n\nYou will please note that it is rather difficult to follow these quotations as Mac & Mac give very little information and sometimes it is hard to discover that the two firms are quoting on the same article. At any rate, Crane has given us the best price and has been more definite in their quotations.\n\nPrices quoted are all F.O.B. Victoria, B.C., and it has been pointed out by Crane Ltd., that material and fixtures of this nature are getting scarcer all the time and it is urged that the order be placed as soon as possible. I should also mention that in Crane's quotation the present Sales Tax is included, and that the prices are subject to immediate acceptance. Apparently this firm gave much better service to the Principal and he feels that their equipment and service is the better of the two firms quoting.\n\nI would ask that this matter be given early consideration, and eventual approval.

Arnall in connection with Boiler No.22020....\"Main Stop Valve and Main Valves on return were leaking so badly I could not get the required Hydrostatic pressure. They must be ground and made tight. Two joints on Main Steam line were showing moisture. Should be tightened up or remade.\"\n\nThis work will have to be put off till the Summer, as it would take quite some time to have it done. The two joints on Main Steam line showing moisture when cold do not show same when heated.\n\nAs regards remarks made in connection with boiler No.22563....\"Nipple on Main Steam pipe between Boiler and Main Stop Valve to be renewed. Also nipple between Blow Down Valve and Boiler and between Injector and Boiler to be renewed. Blow Down Valve to be overhauled and made tight.\"\n\nNipples may be obtained in Chemainus or some we already have may do. New Blow Down Valve has been already purchased. This latter repair work of Boiler No.22563, the school Mechanic is equal to make.\n\nI beg to have you notice that I have already purchased repair equipment as you may see by invoice here enclosed. The Mechanic suggested these and I thought they were immediately needed, that is why I have been rather forward in ordering these having in mind that there may be some delay in obtaining due to present conditions. They will however be here with the next Barge.\n\nFrom what I gather the Inspector was not in a position to advise the purchase of these repair parts due to a condition of leaking in the Valves. The Blow Down Valve was needed, and the two other items on invoice of Mo & Mo & P. are \"injectors,\" and these it appears should be renewed.\n\nYours very Truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 5)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your above noted letter, with enclosures, and in reply beg to attach hereto a letter which I received from the Rev. Principal of Kuper Island Residential School which I trust will explain the question of repairs necessary for the boilers.\n\nYou will please note that the Principal explains that it will not be possible to make the repairs to Boiler No. 22020 until next summer as it would mean tying up of the heating plant while the repairs are being done for at least a week. He points out that the leaky joints in the main steam line show moisture when cold but not when they are hot.\n\nRegarding the necessary repairs to the other boiler, these will be attended to right away, parts can be procured locally, the new blow down valve has already been purchased, and included in the attached account going forward attached to Voucher No. 450.\n\nApparently the necessary parts had already been ordered by the Principal immediately following the visit of the Engineer as he felt there might be considerable delay in delivery but it appears that they will arrive by next Barge. The Principal explains his reason for ordering these articles without definite authority, but I feel that he acted as he thought best, and I would recommend that the account be paid. In the accounts mentioned you will notice a charge for delivery of 25\u00a2; this would appear to be delivery charges to the wharf at the school and of course will have to be covered by receipted freight bill which it is not possible to get until the goods have been shipped. Probably if you would be good enough to telephone this firm in Vancouver they would let you have the freight bill which will save sending it over to the school, then here and back to Vancouver again.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith voucher No. 450 received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore, for $43.67 in favour of Messrs. McLennan, McFeely & Prior, Ltd., covering material required for the repair of the boilers at Kuper Island Residential School which were made in conformity with the recommendations of the Boiler Inspector.\n\nIt will be observed from the letter dated the 26th ultimo of the Reverend Principal, Father J. Camirand, that the materials were purchased by him without first securing Departmental authority for the reason that metal articles of this nature are extremely hard to obtain and he considered it was necessary to take advantage of their being available at the time. While this procedure is somewhat irregular, I would recommend approval of the voucher under the circumstances as the work was necessary and the charges fair and just.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M.

Moore\nIndian Agent\nDuncan B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to lumber for the construction of the Manual Training building, I have found out lately that Lumber concerns in Victoria are selling lumber in small quantities, occasionally.\n\nIt would be possible for me to take advantage of these opportunities, if I could put in an order as soon as I have been advised that lumber is for sale, without having to go through the usual procedure, which takes time and which consequently makes that the opportunity has to be passed up, as buyers are many and suppliers will not wait.\n\nMay I also suggest that if this appears to be in order I be permitted to make payment immediately out of current account and forward receipts to the Department, so that reimbursement be made to school account afterwards.\n\nI trust I am not hereby imposing in any way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. Camirand\n\nIndian Affairs(RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDuncan, B. C.\nApril 20th, 1943.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., P. O. Box 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nrat Dept. Letter 152-0-5, June 17/42.\n\nI beg to submit herewith a letter in duplicate from the Principal of the Kuper Island Residential School regarding the authority granted in the above noted letter for the purchase of building material to be used in the construction of a new manual training building at his school.\n\nAs you know the amount of $700.00 authorised for this purpose was not expended owing to the fact that we could not get the materials. The suggestion offered by Father Camirand is, to my mind, reasonable; the only catch being of course that the authority granted during the past fiscal year has expired and whether or not the Department will be able to provide an equal amount this year out of funds available, is, of course problematical.\n\nShould such a thing be possible I would recommend that the Principal be given the authority to purchase the materials necessary, where, when and as he can find them, pay for them himself and then submit receipted accounts to me and I could attach same to regular vouchers. Your comments on the above suggestion will be appreciated.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI would refer to your letter of August 4, 1942, file 152-0-5, authorizing an expenditure of $703.85, under Purchase Order No. 13968, for the erection of a manual training building at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, in connection with which the Departmental Purchasing Agent was unable to secure delivery of material from Messrs. Clarke and Son of Chemainus, and local firms were canvassed by this office without success, other than the purchase of some nails at a cost of $22.50, the reason being that war demands made it impossible to secure any quantity of lumber.\n\nI now enclose Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of the 20th instant, together with that of the Reverend Principal of the same date, asking if the Department would set up the amount again for the current fiscal year, leaving it open to the Reverend Principal to purchase the material as it becomes available and having the Department reimburse him for any expenditure made.\n\nWhile this would appear to be a most unusual procedure, I would point out that great difficulty has been found in securing building supplies and it is possible that he may be able to secure the material by the manner suggested.\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of correspondence relating to the erection of a manual training building at the Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nI should like to direct your attention particularly to the proposal submitted to the Indian Agent by the Principal of the school in his letter of April 20. There are no facilities at this school for the promotion of manual training and it is the intention of the Principal to encourage instruction in boat building and in the dismantling and repair of engines. The actual work of construction could easily be undertaken by the members of the staff during the vacation period of July and August. The request, while somewhat unusual, is, in my judgment, worthy of sympathetic consideration in view of existing conditions. Funds for this work might be secured from the B.C. Special Vote.\n\nR.A.

MacKay that the purchases be made by the Principal on the basis outlined in the second paragraph of Mr. MacKay's letter of the 24th ultimo, I suggest that authority be granted only on the understanding that:\n\n(a) The total cost of the material to be bought should not exceed a stated amount. (approximately $700.00)\n\n(b) That the bill of material should not include items other than those included in the original requisition of July 25th, 1942.\n\n(c) That all accounts for same be submitted to this office prior to March 1st, 1946.\n\nI may add that this proposed purchase should be classed as capital expenditure, not repairs.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. R.A.Hoey\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of the 1st instant, File #152-0-5 regarding building material for erection of a Manual Training building for the Kuper Island R.C.

This of course accounts for much delay and will explain why the Department was not informed of this condition sooner.\n\nI am here enclosing copy of letter received from Hubbard Oven Co., together with price quotation on a new one and also particulars of oven needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your above letter with further reference to the removal of a partition in the kitchen of the Kuper Is. Res. School, along with a copy of a letter from Mr C.E. Webb.\n\nIn reply I wish to advise this partition was not originally built at the time of the erection of the school, but at a later date with the idea of providing a kind of pantry for dishes etc., in other words the cooks and Principal at that time thought they would like to have this pantry affair cut off from the kitchen proper. There is no corresponding partition on the floor above and from all appearances\u2014as well as the advice of the school carpenter\u2014the removal of the wall in question will have no effect whatever on the building.\n\nA qualified carpenter is hard to get around here nowadays who will take the time to go anywhere as they are all so busy, and I think that the school carpenter is well enough qualified to advise on a matter of this kind. I was not aware when I first referred the matter to you that the wall had been built after the school had been in use for some years, just for convenience. So it would seem that it can be removed without any fear of weakening the structure in any way.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nMay 30/44\n\nMr. R.H. Moore\nIndian Agent\nDuncan B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to make the request that a partition in the kitchen be taken down as this would give more room and also would help to get better ventilation. The space for the kitchen proper is much too small for the number of people who have to work therein.\n\nA sketch herewith, showing partition to be taken out, together with the supporting columns will help to show that this partition was not meant to be a supporting wall.\n\nI would not venture however to make any alteration without the consent of the Department, and this would necessitate I presume, that the structure be examined by somebody who is qualified to do so. Mr Warren, who put in columns in the dormitories, two years ago would know just what could be done, as he had at that time the blue prints for this building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. Camirand\n\nsmm\nDuncan, B. C.\nMay 31st. 1944.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nI beg to submit herewith in duplicate a letter, with accompanying sketch, received from Rev. Father J. Camirand relative to certain proposed alterations to the kitchen of the Kuper Island Residential School, and which I hope you will find self-explanatory.\n\nIn this regard I might say that during my last visit to this school, and on previous visits as well, this question was discussed and the Rev. Principal and I tried to determine just what effect\u2014if any\u2014the removing of this partition would have on the main structure and so far as we could find out there would be none from a weakening point of view.\n\nAs the present kitchen is most inconvenient and too small for the staff usually employed there, and the floor space much too crowded we felt that the removal of this partition would give the needed space and which is not being used at present. I would recommend that Mr Warren be asked to inspect this proposed alteration and which I believe could be carried out with very little expense to the Department, not more than $50.00 as the labor can be done by the school carpenter.\n\n(R.H. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of May 31st, 1944, together with that of the Rev. Principal of Kuper Island Residential School of May 30th, requesting authority to remove a partition in the kitchen of the school in order to enlarge it, the present space being too small for the purposes of the institution. A copy of a plan submitted by the Rev. Principal is enclosed showing the present layout and the partition to be removed.\n\nAs the above letters did not give sufficient information, I referred the matter back to Mr. Moore and I enclose his reply of the 21st ultimo from which it would appear that the partition in question is not supporting any structure above the room. This information was submitted to Mr. Engineer Webb whose letter of the 3rd instant is enclosed advising that the removal of the partition is not likely to effect the structure. I would recommend approval of the application at a cost not exceeding $50.00.\n\nD.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nJuly 19, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M.

Residential school.\n\nOut of the $700.00 authorized last year by the Dept. for this purpose the sum of $24.00 only was used for nails and cement and the balance could not be used for we could not get the materials.\n\nThe Rev. Principal would like to be informed if the unexpended amount of approximately $675.00 could be made available this year for the same purpose as he thinks that it may be possible to get at least some of the necessary materials which would enable him to make a start on the building at least.\n\nThere is an old building on the school grounds which has quite good lumber in it and which is not being used and the Principal plans on pulling it down and using the lumber in it to help construct the new proposed manual training shop should it not be possible for him to get new lumber. If this course is adopted it will mean that the cost of the materials will be substantially less than estimated for new material. At all events I would like to be informed if it would be possible to have funds allotted for this purpose this year. There was $500.00 included in the current years estimates for this purpose and if we cannot get more than that amount I believe that we can manage by using the suitable lumber out of the old building which it is proposed to tear down.\n\n(R.H.

Mr. Moore states that this matter was the subject of previous correspondence but I am unable at the moment to supply further particulars. It will be appreciated if you would advise, however, if the amount entered in the Estimates will be available.\n\nD. M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the purchase of a new engine for the boat operated by the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. In our appropriation for the fiscal year 1945-46 we made provision for an amount of $1,000.00 for the purpose mentioned.\n\nIs it possible to secure a suitable engine in Vancouver? We have found it difficult to secure a boat engine in Eastern Canada. If you can obtain any quotations, please forward same for our consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, November 28th, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nOn June 19th last, I wrote you in reply to your letter of June 13th, with reference to the purchase of a new engine for the boat operated by the Kuper Island Residential School. At that time I advised you that in the Current Year's Appropriation there was an amount of $1000.00 available.\n\nAs yet we have not heard anything further from you. I presume that you have been unable to secure the engine. If you consider it unlikely that you can purchase it before the end of March I thought there might be some other equipment required at the school which could be purchased from the amount available. Under these circumstances I would appreciate hearing further from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 152-0-5\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of June 19th, 1945, in connection with the proposed purchase of a new engine for the boat operated by the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. It was found impossible to obtain quotations for delivery of an engine within the current fiscal year and as an alternative, enquiries were made of the War Assets Corporation with a view to securing a new launch. Father Camirand, Principal of the school, located a suitable boat, approximately 26' long, good engine of Canadian make, at the Navy Yard in Esquimalt, which he considered would be very useful for the time being.\n\nSubsequent correspondence with the War Assets Corporation indicates, however, that the launch in question has not been declared surplus and consequently is not yet available for disposal through the Corporation. It is thought, however, that the Department might be able to arrange for transfer of the launch direct from the Navy Yard to the Kuper Island Residential School, and it would be appreciated if enquiries could be made. I may say that the launch is identified by No. 243 B47 and is at present located at the Navy Yard in Esquimalt.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 152-0-5\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of November 28th regarding the purchase of a new engine for the boat operated by the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, by now you will have received my letter of the same date.\n\nNo further action will be taken in this matter pending receipt of information with respect to the proposed negotiations for the transfer of the launch from the Navy.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 6th December, 1945.\n\nWar Assets Corporation,\nP.O. Box 6099,\nMontreal, Quebec.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe management of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School located on an island near the east coast of Vancouver Island, require a new launch. The Principal of the school located a suitable boat approximately 26 ft. long at the Navy yards in Esquimalt. This launch is identified as No. 243 E47.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay made some enquiries from your Branch Office in Vancouver and was informed that this particular launch has not yet been declared surplus. I am, therefore, communicating with you in hope that you may have more complete information so that we can make arrangements to secure it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 152-0-5\n\nFurther to my letter of December 3rd in connection with the proposed purchase of a new engine for the boat operated by the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, I have been in communication with the Reverend Principal who advises that the Mission boat now used by the school is to be sold in fifteen days and will no longer be available. As the school is situated on an Island, the only communication with the mainland is by boat and consequently the question of securing a new boat, or engine for the present school boat, is urgent.\n\nFather Camirand has advised that he can secure a Kermath, 61 H.P., 4 cylinder, high speed engine in Seattle at a cost of $480.00 plus duty amounting to $48.00 if applicable, and if negotiations cannot be completed within a reasonable time for the transfer of a launch from the Navy, I would recommend that authority be granted to purchase the Kermath engine.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 8th January, 1946.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the engine required for the launch for Kuper Island Indian Residential School. Authority is granted for the purchase of the engine mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nFollowing receipt of your letter of December 3rd, I communicated with the War Assets Corporation, Montreal, but as yet have received no reply. It is extremely doubtful when, if ever, we will be able to secure the launch mentioned in the letter of the 3rd instant and consequently it has been decided to authorize the purchase of the engine as mentioned above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWAR ASSETS CORPORATION\nP.

It might be possible to secure the information they require but the price of the launch may be more than we desire to pay. Under the circumstances I still feel that it would be more satisfactory to purchase the engine mentioned in your letter of January 5th.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 152-0-5\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of January 15th in connection with the supply of a launch for the Kuper Island Residential School through the War Assets Corporation, I would advise that on January 12th I authorized Father Camirand to purchase the 61 H.P. Kermath engine for use in the present launch. It was suggested to the Principal that as he had been corresponding with the firm making the Kermath engine it might be best for him to make the necessary arrangements for the purchase himself from school funds and the Department would reimburse the school following receipt of the usual accounts.\n\nD.

H. Moore  \nIndian Agent  \nBuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWe are having a considerable amount of trouble with the sewage system, due to the fact that there is no outlet where various branches take on to the main, and that there is no possibility of forcing steam through with quick result, having to perform this operation at one or the other branch end, with the consequence that the contents are pushed back into lavatories and sinks.\n\nThere is no diagram or plan of the layout here available, and therefore no means of knowing where to break through the cement floor to get at the right location so as to make some kind of an outlet. I have asked for the prints but have not heard whether they are available.\n\nAs this happens most often on the boys side and also with the laundry sewage, it would seem that a separate sewage for these two would be required, and as the new lavatory for boys is about to be installed, this could be done before long. However this will require much labor and therefore expense as there would be need to dig through some six feet of hard clay, all the way from the building down to the water.\n\nAs Mr. Warren some years back supervised work anent a new lay out near water front, and probably has some idea of the general plan, may I suggest that if it appears in order, he be asked to come and examine possibilities of a separate sewage for laundry and boys lavatory.\n\nMay I state that in the last four months, this trouble has happened at least once every three weeks.\n\nYours very truly;\n\n(Signed) Rev. J. Camirand.\nDuncan, B.C.\nJuly 15th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M.

We unfortunately have no plans showing the sewage system insofar as the building is concerned, and Mr. Warren is unable to assist in this connection as he did not investigate that phase of the system.\n\n\"We will not be able to assign an engineer to make this investigation for some time, due to other commitments, and it occurs to me that if the matter is of some urgency it might be desirable to have a local plumber look at the system and make proposals. We have contacted the Indian Agent and he advises that R.H. Ornmont Company of Nanaimo are a reliable firm.\"\n\nIf Indian Affairs can supply the Indian Agent or the School Principal with details of the sewage system supplied by this office on September 7th, 1943 to Mr. Phalen, it might be that a plumber could be engaged to make the necessary repairs.\n\nT.

The purpose of this inspection was to determine the most advantageous connection of the proposed lavatory to the present sewage system. In this connection the following are my findings.\n\nDescription of the present system\n\nThe system, as originally constructed, consisted of a septic tank with a 6 inch drain from the school and a 4 inch pipe outlet into the sea. The main branches from various washrooms and lavatories in the school consist of 4 inch pipe. In 1931 the 4 inch outlet from the septic tank was abandoned and a new 8 inch outlet pipe was constructed. This new outlet by-passed the septic tank. The septic tank, although still serviceable, is no longer used.\n\nThis system worked satisfactorily until approximately a year ago when various branches, especially the one leading from the boys lavatory, began to clog up periodically.\n\nSince the 4 inch branches leading from the various lavatories are of sufficient size for the population in the school, it appears that clogging is the result of the accumulation of sand, gravel, and other material in depressions caused by possible settling of various branches. The principal also reported that children, especially those starting school, were found on several occasions dropping fruit peels and rags into the drains.\n\nRecommended connection of the proposed washroom or lavatory\n\nSince the sewer branch, to which the showers, basins, and other equipment in the old lavatory are connected, passes by the room to be used for the new washroom, it appears that this new washroom or lavatory could be connected to the same sewer without any danger of exceeding the carrying capacity of the pipe. There will be approximately the same number of showers, wash basins, etc., in the proposed lavatory as in the present one.\n\nIt is recommended that some provision be made to facilitate cleaning of the sewer in case of future clogging in the proposed lavatory. This could be done in one of two ways:\n\nIndian Affairs(RG 10 Volume 6456, file 835-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(1) Installation of a check-valve and a tee in the branch leading from the lavatory. A hose could then be connected to the tee for flushing the sewer. The check-valve will prevent the water from backing up during flushing.\n\n(2) Installation of a clean out chamber. This clean out chamber will then catch all the material such as large rags which otherwise would clog the sewer.\n\nP.W.

Whyte this morning, I am enclosing copies of letters dated June 10th and 21st from Vivian Engine Works Ltd., in connection with the proposed repair or replacement of the above mentioned lighting plant. In addition to the repair or replacement of the present plant we are confronted with an expenditure of from $700 to $800 for replacement of the batteries, a total of approximately $3300. It has occurred to me that before expending this amount for replacement of a D.C. unit we should consider whether or not it might be advisable to convert to A.C.\n\nIt is understood that you will have an engineer available shortly in which case it would be appreciated if you would have him investigate and report on the electrical power requirements at the Kuper Island School and the type of plant which would best meet these requirements.\n\n- EW\n\nEncl.\n\nW.

Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\n7th July, 1948.\nVancouver, B.C.,\n7th July, 1946.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Electrical System - Kuper Island Residential School, Cowichan Agency\n\nPursuant to your instructions, I made an inspection of the Kuper Island School electrical system. The following is a report of my observations.\n\nDescription\n\nThe school is a brick structure built in 1915. It houses approximately 112 persons during the school session. It is the only populated part of Kuper Island except for one farm on the southern end and an Indian Village on the northern end which is occupied spasmodically between fishing, lumbering, hop-picking, and berry-picking seasons.\n\nPower House\n\nElectrical power for the school is generated in a power house, separate from the main school, by a two cylinder 30 B.H.P. Vivian Stationary Diesel Engine driving a 15 KW 125 Volt C.G.E. direct current generator. Other installations included in the power house are (See Plan 1):\n\n(1) Standby equipment 6 H.P. Lister engine driving a 3 KW Lister-Bruston 110 volt direct current generator.\n\n(2) Myers water pump and reduction gear connected to the standby Lister engine.\n\n(3) Battery of 55 Coyle cells - 120 volts.\n\n(4) Switchboard panel.\nDistribution System\n\nThe School is connected to the power house switchboard by an overhead line which runs into the building to fuse and distribution boxes. All lines inside are in conduit.\n\nServed as well as the school are a woodwork shop, a barn, a recreation hall, and a house.\n\nAdditional to the lighting of the above mentioned buildings, there are several appliances served, namely:\n\n1) 1/3 H.P. motor in the refrigerator fed by a direct line from the power house.\n\n2) 1/2 H.P. motor in the Bakery fed off the school system.\n\n3) 1 H.P. motor on a circular saw in woodwork shop.\n\n4) Three hand irons in the laundry.\n\nCapability of Present System\n\nAccording to the engineer at the school, the maximum current generated at the switchboard when the diesel is running to capacity is 50 amperes. This is almost sufficient for the operation of the present system. However, the diesel vibrates considerably when running to capacity and its speed fluctuates enough to cause the lights to flicker. It should be noted that the 30 H.P. diesel engine should be able to drive the generator with almost twice the above mentioned load.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe diesel engine was badly damaged in June of this year and requires repairs estimated by the maker to cost $1,700. Also, a new battery is needed.\nwhich will cost $600. As this is a total expenditure of approximately $2,500., it has been suggested by the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia that consideration be given to converting the system to A.C.\n\nAdvantages of an A.C. System\n\n(1) A.C. appliances and motors can be purchased easier and cheaper than similar D.C. This is not a great saving as the only additional appliances planned by the school staff are:\n\n(a) Milking machine (probably requiring \u00bd H.P. driving motor).\n\n(b) Additional equipment in woodwork shop (probably requiring two motors \u00bd to 1 H.P. and one of about 2 H.P.).\n\n(c) One or two small appliances in the kitchen such as a potato peeler.\n\n(2) If power is made available from the B.C. Power Commission at some future date, the conversion would be inexpensive. There seems little possibility of this change being made in the future because Kuper Island is at least four miles distant from the nearest point of land having electrical power.\n\nAdvantages of a D.C. System\n\n(1) By using batteries in conjunction with the D.C. generator, lights can be used at any time during the day or night without the main engine being required. If batteries are not used, the engine will have to be run all the time or else be equipped with an automatic starter. During the night, lights are required periodically and often are left on by the Indian children, even though many attempts have been made to\nstop this practice. This would result in the engine running almost continually even with an automatic starter.\n\n(2) Light and some power are available from the batteries for some time after a temporary breakdown in the main engine.\n\n(3) The cost of repairing the D.C. system although large is considerably less than the cost of a new A.C. system which would require new generators and motors in addition to the repairs to the diesel engine minus the $800. for new batteries.\n\nRecommendation\n\nIt is the opinion of the undersigned that the D.C. system should be retained. Also it would seem advisable, if a new diesel engine is purchased, to have some guarantee beforehand from the maker that the engine will be capable of driving the 15 KW generator to full capacity.\n\nThe 15 KW generator can carry the present load in the school and as well could assume the future loads planned and already mentioned in this report.\n\nD. Gordon.\nJuly 24, 1948.\n\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEarly in June the Principal of the Kuper Island Residential School contacted the Vivian Engine Works Ltd., advising that the diesel engine operating the generator at the school had broken down. Vivians dispatched a mechanic by plane to view the damage and subsequently reported to this office, reference their letter of June 10th attached. Copies of subsequent correspondence, namely Superintendent Moore's letters of June 14th and 21st, a quotation from Vivian Engine Works dated June 21st on a new engine and a copy of a report dated July 7th by Mr. D. Gordon of the Mines, Forests and Scientific Services Branch, together with Mr. C.E. Webb's covering letter are enclosed.\n\nAlso attached is a letter dated July 21st from Vivian Engine Works wherein they guarantee that the new engine quoted upon has more than ample power to drive the 15 K.W. generator at the school. You will note from the enclosures that we are faced with an expenditure of $2500. for a new engine and approximately $750.00 for new batteries for alternatively an expenditure of \u00a31700. for repairs to the present engine, plus the cost of new batteries. The present engine is an obsolete model and according to Mr. Gordon's report does not develop its full rated power. This engine has been in operation at the school for over ten years with only minor expenditures for repairs. Its condition now is such that it has little, if any, trade-in\nvalue and if repaired would likely be a source of continued trouble.\n\nI would recommend that the Department approve the purchase of a two cylinder Vivian Stationary Diesel engine complete with all ancillary equipment and developing 30 B.H.P. continuous and 35 B.H.P. maximum in accordance with the Company's tender; and also purchase of a new VA-13 110 volt Glass Cell Battery as quoted on by Coyle Batteries Limited.\n\nW.S.

S.

Gordon, dated July 8th and attached sketch plan, the construction of this portion of the building differs from that shown in the original plans, the wall in question being utilized as a bearing wall, and columns supporting upper storeys being spaced at variance, with those plans.\n\nBefore permission can be granted to remove the wall, the following information should be provided in addition to that supplied by the memorandum and sketch plan:\n\nExact location of column above basement storey designated as \"H\" and whether of timber, cast iron or steel. It might be possible to leave a portion of the concrete wall to act as a pier.\n\nThe memorandum states the wall acts as a beam supporting ceiling between walls \"A\" and \"C\". This should be cleared up by showing the direction the joists run on the first floor. The type of beams supporting the floors should be given. The original plan shows 8\" x 12\" beams, on 6\" steel pipe columns. We would like to be clear on this point.\n\nUpon receipt of the foregoing data, we are prepared to recommend the removal of the wall and provide a solution for supporting the floors above.\n\nEncl.\n\nG.E.B.

Today, diesel powered, dependable source of power is \"established\" hard at work in factories, mines, quarries, ships, oil fields, fisheries, on farms and in many other industries.\n\nThough the Diesel Engine was invented in Europe, Americans played the major part in introducing it. An American Diesel manufacturing company was organized only a year after the first diesel was built abroad. Within a few years, other American companies began to manufacture Diesel Engines. Today there are 15 companies building all types and sizes. Recognition came slowly, but demand rose during World War I when over 150,000 Diesel horsepower was in operation\u2014chiefly aboard submarines.\n\nSince then, Diesel power has gained worldwide acceptance. Up until end of 1943, 61,000,000 of Diesel horse-power had been built by the American industry. During World War II, the Diesel industry built over 50,000,000 horsepower for the armed forces.\n\nWhat is a Diesel engine...and how does it operate?\n\nOPERATING PRINCIPLE\n\nThere is nothing complicated or baffling about the operating principle of a Diesel Engine. It's simple enough to represent the highest achievement in thermal efficiency.\n\nA cycle Diesel\u2014such as the Shepard\u2014is simpler in its operation than the engine in your car. The piston cycle is similar to that of the car's engine, but the complexities of an electrical ignition system and a carburetor are completely eliminated.\n\nHere are the 4 simple cycles of the usual Diesel operation: (1) First piston downstroke. Clean air is \"sucked\" into the cylinder. (2) First upstroke. The air in the cylinder is compressed to 1/15th space it normally occupies. This great compression raises air temperature to about 1,000\u00b0 F. At the peak of this upstroke, fuel oil is sprayed into the heated air. The heat of the air instantly ignites the oil. (3) Second downstroke. Combustion of the fuel increases pressure and temperature in the cylinder forcing piston upward. This is the stroke that provides power and is known as the \"power stroke.\" (4) Second upstroke. Exhaust is forced out. And because a Sheephead Diesel is equipped with an exhaust muffler, relatively harmless. In the completion of this stroke, cylinder is ready to repeat combustion cycle.\n\nSIMPLICITY OF OPERATION\n\nThe absence of an electrical ignition system and a carburetor makes a Diesel engine easy to operate and maintain. To start a Diesel simply open throttle for desired engine speed and press the starter button. There's no distributor or spark plug points to be kept clean...no carburetor to be properly adjusted. Damp weather and rain has little effect on the starting and operation of a Diesel. Most of the smaller engines can be serviced by anyone familiar with a gasoline engine. With a minimum of attention a Diesel will give a maximum of dependable day-after-day operation.\n\nECONOMY OF OPERATION\n\nThe chart at left compares the fuel consumption of a conventional Diesel with that of the gasoline engine which it replaced. The Diesel uses only about 1/3 the amount of fuel at approximately 1/3 the cost per gal. We will gladly furnish complete details and location of this installation upon request.\nThe R. H. Sheppard Company conceived and produced the Sheppard All American Diesel to meet the widespread need for a small, self-contained power plant that could be put into service without the addition of a single accessory.\n\nThe Sheppard Diesel employs no foreign patents in its design. It has been developed and built as an integral unit with coordinated design of all parts. This policy insures efficient operation and low maintenance costs. The few parts used in the engine not manufactured in the Sheppard plant are custom made to Sheppard specifications. Most parts are interchangeable among Sheppard models.\n\nHorsepower ratings for Sheppard Diesels are for continuous operation...and are the actual power output of the engine while operating with all equipment. These ratings should not be confused or compared with the horsepower type of rating which is based on the calculated performance of a bare engine. The manufacturers of the Sheppard Diesel do not use intermittent horsepower ratings.\n\nFuel pumps, combustion chambers, injectors and governors were designed by Sheppard...patented by Sheppard.\n\nAll American Diesel\n\n...and are manufactured by Sheppard. Most structural parts are cast in the Sheppard foundry. Crankshafts, connecting rods, cam shafts and other moving parts which contribute to long life are precision fitted in the Sheppard foundry. All Sheppard parts are standardized and close tolerances. Filters, air cleaners, starters, generators, batteries, radiators, fans and other accessories were selected only after exhaustive tests and are the best obtainable. In every case, they succeed rather than meet requirements.\n\nThroughout, the Sheppard Diesel is designed and engineered with the greatest degree of simplicity consistent with the greatest degree of dependability, economy and efficiency. Sheppard has reduced the complexity of the earlier Diesels to a simplicity that ABC instructions will make clear to any operator.\n\nENGINEERING SERVICE\n\nBecause the Sheppard organization is compact and highly specialized, it can profitably take an interest in the individual problems of the smaller buyer.\n\nThe R. H. Sheppard Company will build around the Sheppard Diesel Engine various complete units for out-of-the-ordinary requirements. Custom-built Sheppard Diesel Pumping Sets, Generating Sets, Diesel Powered Compressors and Marine Auxiliaries are providing outstanding service over a broad range of applications all over the world.\n\nDISTRIBUTION AND PARTS SERVICE\n\nSheppard distribution is worldwide. The map at the left shows the locations of Sheppard distributors in the United States. These distributors and their dealers offer complete \"parts and service\" facilities in many places where you're located. In addition, Sheppard factory personnel are available in every area of the country. For detailed information about distribution outside of the United States, write the Sheppard factory.\nREADY POWER... WITHIN THE HOUR!\n\nBefore the first Sheppard Diesel was manufactured, its builders decided that a power plant should be delivered as a power plant ready to run, rather than as a \"foundation\" to be completed by the buyer. Sheppard has firmly adhered to this policy of \"complete units only.\"\n\nA Sheppard Diesel comes to you fully equipped for immediate operation. It isn't necessary to sketch that you must \"build up\" before it can perform its rated work. A Sheppard set of complete is a Sheppard ready for service\u2014simply add fuel, lubricating oil and water\u2014press the starter button and the power's on.\n\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT ON SHEPPARD DIESEL POWER UNITS\n\n- Power take-off with clutch\n- Fan\n- Generator\n- Water pump\n- Oil filter with strainer\n- Fuel filter\n- Lubricating oil\n- Instrument panel\n- Breather cap filter\n- Governor\n- Electric starting motor\n- Generator regulator with overcharge control\n- Thermostat By-pass\n- Generator for batteries\n- Hollow head screw wrenches\n- Batteries\n\nLower Power Costs FOR SMALL PLANT OPERATORS\n\nTiny important fuel savings made possible by Diesel power are no longer within the reach of \"big business\" only. Sheppard specialists in small Diesel plants have specialized in making Diesel power available to businesses where power costs must be kept to a minimum.\n\nSheppard Diesels provide dependable power while operating on low cost fuel (domestic furnace oil). A 5 K.W. Sheppard Generating Set requires from 1/2 to 1 gallon of fuel for 8 hours' operation\u2014depending on the amount of power being generated. Using an average fuel price of $6 per gallon, fuel costs for an 8-hour day will be only $3\u00a2 to $6\u00a2.\n\nIn locations where power costs have not yet been figured, and in many hundreds of installations where purchased power is available . . . Sheppard Diesels provide dependable power at low cost for many who operate only on a limited scale. A few of these installations are shown on the opposite page.\nTHE HEART OF EVERY DIESEL\n\nA Diesel Engine cannot perform better than its fuel injection system. It is the heart of every Diesel. After all, Diesel power is simply the result of burning oil under special conditions. How the oil is delivered to the combustion chamber...and what the combustion chamber does with it...determines the answer to the question, \"How efficiently and economically will my Diesel Engine utilize fuel?\" If your Diesel is a Sheppard, you'll get the answer you like. No part of a Sheppard Diesel is here more painstakingly designed, engineered and constructed than the fuel injection and combustion system.\n\nThe simplified Sheppard fuel injection system\n\nThe Sheppard Diesel is a solid fuel injection type engine. The fuel is ignited entirely by the heat of compression.\n\nIn the Sheppard Diesel, an individual fuel pump serves each cylinder connecting directly to the injector nozzle. If specified at time of purchase, provision can be made for changing pumps without shutting down operation. The fuel enters the pump and the injection timing is controlled by the pump. The 3 valves employed in the system are simple check valves...no pressure valves are necessary.\n\nLike the combustion chamber, the Sheppard Diesel Fuel Injection System is an engineered integral unit. The entire system\u2014including fuel injection pump, injector, combustion chamber and governor\u2014was designed and engineered by Sheppard and is manufactured in the Sheppard factory.\n\nThe Fuel Pump. The fuel pump is of the variable stroke type and is entirely a Sheppard product\u2014both in design and manufacture. It is not necessary to run new pumps in order to calibrate it...in fact, it can be done with the engine running.\n\nThe Injector Nozzle. To eliminate the faults of complicated foreign systems, Sheppard designed their own injection equipment and combustion chambers. And because they were designed simultaneously...to work together...Sheppard is able to use an injector nozzle with a very large orifice\u2014thus eliminating nozzle stoppage.\n\nIn the Sheppard Diesel, fuel is discharged into the combustion chamber in a very coarse spray or stream. In this chamber, the fuel is broken into minute particles of the proper size for combustion. Efficient lubrication is provided throughout the combustion chamber walls. As a result, there is no carbon deposit and excess smoke is eliminated at all loads.\n\nThe Combustion Chamber. With the Sheppard fuel system, the fuel is injected directly into a special pre-combustion or turbulence chamber. From this chamber, the gases, during expansion, pass into the cylinder. Chamber walls are designed to be three passages of different diameters and divergent angles.\n\nA layer of air, entering the chamber at high velocity from these passages, at time of injection, provides immediate ignition of the fuel against the wall of the combustion chamber. This creates an optimum of turbulence which produces thorough, rapid, highly efficient combustion without smoke. Detonation is eliminated...Diesel knock is absent.\n\nGOVERNOR. Of simple, rugged construction, the Sheppard governor provides extremely close regulation to within 1/2% and maintains speed regulations within minute limits over long periods of time. Engine RPM's under load are maintained to within 1% tolerance. The ability of the Sheppard governor to maintain a constant speed at either constant or varying loads is outstanding. Because Sheppard precisely controls travel well, diesel engines are ideal for electrical applications. When used as power units, 2 or more engines can be belted to one shaft with equal distribution of load on each engine.\nRemovable Wet Type Cylinder Liners. These removable liners are made of special close-grained hardenable iron with a BHN of 500. They are honed to cross-hatch finish on the inside. Scaffolding rings never occur. The head holds the liner in place and the head gasket seats it at the top. Bottom is sealed by a special Sheppard-designed rubber gasket that absorbs shock from loadings into the crank case. Liners are designed to allow for expansion without creating stress or distortion in either the block or the liners themselves.\n\nCompletely Automatic LOAD-CONTROL Developed by Sheppard engineers and available on any Sheppard Diesel Generating Set. LOAD-CONTROL provides automatic starting and stopping of the Diesel by load demand on the power circuit. No special wiring is required. Operating time of Diesel is controlled by the load during normal operation. Normally required fuel consumption is reduced...engine life is lengthened. Power is turned on instantly...at instant of shut off...by the flick of any switch on the power circuit. Load control is available on any single or 3-phase Sheppard generating set if specified at time of purchase.\n\nSheppard Diesels can also be equipped for starting and stopping from remote stations by manual, thermostatic, or relay type switch as required for the type of semi-automatic control. In addition, line failure starting and stopping is available on Sheppard generating sets used as standby or emergency power plants.\n\nBuilt-in Heat Exchanger and Expansion Tank. On Sheppard marine units, the expansion tank and heat exchanger are located in the engine itself as one unit. This eliminates the maze of external piping and tubing required on most Diesel heat exchanger installations. By using the expansion tank below the heat exchanger tubes, corrosion and any necessary cleaning can be done without losing the fresh water. Tube nest can be removed for replacement or repair by loosening 2 additional bolts on any forward body while the pump is running. The water pump will also pass through the exchanger because openings in the tubes are of the same diameter as those in the pump and piping.\n\nOil Bath Air Cleaner has been designed and developed after years of research and development. Air enters the unit clean through a patented metal-side vent. Vent openings are large enough to permit free air passage\u2014but small enough to exclude leaves or other foreign matter. Air then passes through a series of oil-washed screens which remove any particles that may have survived the oil bath. When air enters intake manifold, it is virtually 100% free of dust and grit.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6456, file 885-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA Diesel is like a watch... it's no better than the parts inside\n\nAll parts in Sheppard Diesels are the finest obtainable. And every part is designed to work harmoniously with every other part. Like a fine watch, your Sheppard Diesel is engineered throughout for precision.\n\nThe Connecting Rods are heat-treated steel forgings with precision-ground journals to assure long life. It is also drilled for full pressure lubrication. To insure smooth running engine, it is counter-balanced to a small fraction of an inch.\n\nThe Pistons are cast iron of the Sheppard oil-pan cooled type. Precision-formed gudgeon pin located in relation to pattern of heat prevents distortion in piston crown. This allows Sheppard pistons to be close fitting with the result that stock rings are unknown to a Sheppard Diesel. Piston pin bore is a cross-hatch honed for a tolerance of .0002 of an inch.\n\nThe Piston Pins are of glass-hard steel ground with extreme precision to a total tolerance of .0002 of an inch. They are of the full-floating type. With this type of pin, the bearing area occurs both in the piston and in the connecting rod, providing twice as much bearing surface to absorb wear.\n\nThe Connecting Rods are heat-treated steel forgings made to the highest degree of accuracy. They are matched in sets, both for weight and length. Big end is machined by a Special Sheppard process to receive steel-backed columbium silver bearings. Bearing cap is dovetail fitted place to assure perfect alignment of the two halves.\n\nBearings. Replaceable columbium silver lined steel shells are used on main and connecting rod bearings.\n\nBlocks are cast in the Sheppard foundry from high tensile, close-grained, nonporous iron.

Neary\n\nRe: Lighting Plant at Kuper Island School,\nCowichan Agency, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of a report prepared by Mr. D. Gordon covering the inspection of the lighting plant at the above Agency requested by the Indian Commissioner and forwarded to this Division by District Chief Engineer, C.E. Webb, from Vancouver. We make the following comments in connection with the report submitted.\n\nThe electrical output of the main generating set, a Vivian Diesel Electric Unit rated at 15 KW 125 Volt, D.C., and powered by a 30 H.P. engine, is reported to be of sufficient capacity to handle the needs of the Agency buildings.\n\nThe engineer, however, can only get a maximum of approximately 45 per cent of the generator capacity from the unit when the diesel engine is running to capacity, and, in running to capacity, considerable operating difficulties are encountered. The diesel engine, if in good condition and installed properly, should develop the full rating of the generator without undue vibration.\n\nMr. Gordon does not make a definite recommendation in his report regarding the diesel engine, and as we do not have any further information in this connection we cannot make a recommendation in this matter.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the present storage battery type of system should be retained, and suggest that the matter be further investigated to determine if the present engine can be put into good condition to deliver the rated 15 KW output under favourable operating conditions. Mr. Gordon states that repairs are necessary in the amount of $1,700.00, but does not suggest that this expenditure would provide trouble free operation.\n\nWe recommend that the matter be further investigated and that a definite recommendation be made as to the feasibility of repairing the present engine before further action is taken.\n\nWe note that a new battery is required and it is suggested that close attention be given to the proper selection of the battery required to suit the installed equipment and the electrical load demands of the Agency buildings before the new battery is purchased.\n\nWe are forwarding herewith a copy of Mr. Gordon's report and covering letter from Mr. C.E. Webb for your information.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncls.\n744 W.

Gordon look over the situation at the above mentioned Indian school.\n\nIt appears that the present power unit which is D.C., requires some repairs and before authorizing these the Indian Commissioner desired us to advise him as to whether we should continue with D.C. current or transfer to A.C. current. It would appear that continuation of the D.C. current is advisable in this case and we have so recommended.\n\nTriplicate copies of the report prepared by Mr. Gordon, duplicate copies of which have been forwarded to the Indian Commissioner, dated 7th July, are enclosed for your information.\n\nEnc.

GORDON\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\n7th July, 1948.\nVancouver, B.C.,\n7th July, 1948.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Electrical System - Kuper Island Residential School, Cowichan Agency\n\nPursuant to your instructions, I made an inspection of the Kuper Island School electrical system. The following is a report of my observations.\n\nDescription\n\nThe school is a brick structure built in 1915. It houses approximately 112 persons during the school session. It is the only populated part of Kuper Island except for one farm on the southern end and an Indian Village on the northern end which is occupied spasmodically between fishing, lumbering, hop-picking, and berry-picking seasons.\n\nPower House\n\nElectrical power for the school is generated in a power house, separate from the main school, by a two cylinder 30 B.H.P. Vivian Stationary Diesel Engine driving a 15 KW 125 Volt C.G.E. direct current generator. Other installations included in the power house are (See Plan 1):\n\n(1) Standby equipment 6 H.P. Lister engine driving a 3 KW Lister-Bruston 110 volt direct current generator.\n\n(2) Myers water pump and reduction gear connected to the standby Lister engine.\n\n(3) Battery of 55 Coyle cells - 120 volts.\n\n(4) Switchboard panel.\nDistribution System\n\nThe School is connected to the power house switchboard by an overhead line which runs into the building to fuse and distribution boxes. All lines inside are in conduit.\n\nServed as well as the school are a woodwork shop, a barn, a recreation hall, and a house.\n\nAdditional to the lighting of the above mentioned buildings, there are several appliances served, namely:\n\n(1) 1/3 H.P. motor in the refrigerator fed by a direct line from the power house.\n\n(2) 1\u00bd H.P. motor in the Bakery fed off the school system.\n\n(3) 1 H.P. motor on a circular saw in woodwork shop.\n\n(4) Three hand irons in the laundry.\n\nCapability of Present System\n\nAccording to the engineer at the school, the maximum current generated at the switchboard when the diesel is running to capacity is 50 amperes. This is almost sufficient for the operation of the present system. However, the diesel vibrates considerably when running to capacity and its speed fluctuates enough to cause the lights to flicker. It should be noted that the 50 H.P. diesel engine should be able to drive the generator with almost twice the above mentioned load.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe diesel engine was badly damaged in June of this year and requires repairs estimated by the maker to cost \u00a31,700. Also, a new battery is needed.\nwhich will cost $800. As this is a total expenditure of approximately $2,500., it has been suggested by the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia that consideration be given to converting the system to A.C.\n\nAdvantages of an A.C. System\n\n(1) A.C. appliances and motors can be purchased easier and cheaper than similar D.C. This is not a great saving as the only additional appliances planned by the school staff are:\n\n(a) Milking machine (probably requiring \u00bd H.P. driving motor).\n\n(b) Additional equipment in woodwork shop (probably requiring two motors \u00bd to 1 H.P. and one of about 2 H.P.).\n\n(c) One or two small appliances in the kitchen such as a potato peeler.\n\n(2) If power is made available from the B.C. Power Commission at some future date, the conversion would be inexpensive. There seems little possibility of this change being made in the future because Kuper Island is at least four miles distant from the nearest point of land having electrical power.\n\nAdvantages of a D.C. System\n\n(1) By using batteries in conjunction with the D.C. generator, lights can be used at any time during the day or night without the main engine being required. If batteries are not used, the engine will have to be run all the time or else be equipped with an automatic starter. During the night, lights are required periodically and often are left on by the Indian children, even though many attempts have been made to\nstop this practice. This would result in the engine running almost continually even with an automatic starter.\n\n(2) Light and some power are available from the batteries for some time after a temporary breakdown in the main engine.\n\n(3) The cost of repairing the D.C. system although large is considerably less than the cost of a new A.C. system which would require new generators and motors in addition to the repairs to the diesel engine minus the $800. for new batteries.\n\nRecommendation\n\nIt is the opinion of the undersigned that the D.C. system should be retained. Also it would seem advisable, if a new diesel engine is purchased, to have some guarantee beforehand from the maker that the engine will be capable of driving the 15 KW generator to full capacity.\n\nThe 15 KW generator can carry the present load in the school and as well could assume the future loads planned and already mentioned in this report.\n\nD.

The present Launch which is owned by the school is certainly not a suitable craft in which to transport Indian children to and from the school. In my opinion the launch is unsafe except in fine weather and calm seas. My opinion of what is required is something like this:\n\n28' to 32' in length with a minimum beam of 8'; 3\u00bd' draft and powered with a 70 to 90 H.P. Gray or Kermath Marine Motor. The cabin should extend the full length of the boat with a partition a little forward of midships with the upper part of the partition in glass so that the operator of the boat could supervise the back cabin which would be for passengers - front of the partition to be engine room and pilot house.\n\nThe Present Launch is 26' long with a 6' beam and I would not advise spending any money on it.\n\nThe Principal is away low on his estimate of the cost of a Launch of this kind and what is required. Personally I think it should be closer to seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00) and would ask that you raise the price on the estimate forms to that amount.\n\nThe only alternative to the above, as I see it, is for the Department to pay the transportation to and from Chemainus Hospital when pupils are taken over there for medical attention and X-Rays, and also the transportation of all children going to and coming from the school throughout the school year.\n\n2) The necessity for a barn at this school is obvious and urgent to anyone who has seen the present one which is so old that it is not a fit building to house cows that are supplying milk to an institution of this kind.\n\nAt the present time this barn houses fourteen to sixteen milch cows, three or four head of young stock, three horses and one bull. The swine are kept in a separate building which is also on its last legs.\n\nThe actual farm connected with the school has an acreage of 72. This is all under cultivation or in pasture with the exception of twelve or fourteen acres in playground and building site. The actual division this year is as follows: 3 acres potatoes; 1 acre in roots; 4 acres in corn; 2 acres in garden; 7 acres in oats; 22 acres in hay; 20 acres in pasture.\n\nThe old barn is 80' x 41' x 18' high, with hay loft. About twelve feet are taken off the length by a driveway through the middle for unloading hay, etc., into the loft.\n\nI believe that a new barn, 70' x 35' x 40' would be satisfactory but even that would cost a minimum of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000.00). I am not\nMr. W. S. Arneil.\n\nOctober 23/48.\n\n... I am not\n\nso sure that the farming operations carried on at this school are economically sound as it seems to me that it is costing them far more to operate than the returns received. However, the Auditor's report should show that but as this office is not supplied with a copy I am not sure but simply surmise from my own observations and from asking questions. I should like to say that if the school was not in its present location I would recommend doing away with the cattle and buying milk for use at the school rather than try to operate a farm of this kind which, I doubt, can ever be done economically.\n\nR. H. Moore\nSuperintendent\nCowichan Agency\n\nRHM: EL\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nWith reference to Supt. Moore's letter of October 23rd attached, provision was made in the Cowichan Agency estimates for 1949-50 for an expenditure of $4000 for a new launch for the Kuper Island school and $7500 for the erection of a new barn. Mr. Moore's letter is in response to my letter for further information with regard to the necessity for these expenditures. This communication and enclosure are for your information only, it being intended to have the requirements of the school fully investigated, following which a report will be submitted.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Appropriation - Kuper Island Residential School\n\nPrior to Mr. Neary's letter of July 28th (file 152-0-5 E.1), regarding painting the buildings at the above mentioned school, the Rev. Principal had been advised of the funds appropriated for his school for this year and apparently on the assumption that these funds would be available made arrangements to have the painting proceeded with, reference his letter of October 20th attached.\n\nDue to the necessity of replacing the lighting plant and batteries, however, the appropriation for the school was fully expended leaving the school responsible for payment of the cost of the painting. You will note that Father Camirand asks if funds can be made available to reimburse the school. The amount involved is $681.62. Will you please advise if there is any possibility of the school funds being reimbursed.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nOctober 20/48\n\nMr. R.H. Moore\nSuperintendent\nCowichan Agency\nDuncan B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall that July last, I was advised that the sum of $2000.00 would be available for maintenance and repairs at this school, and also that previously, when going over Estimates, the need of having the school painted was considered urgent, as this had by force been neglected during the war years.\n\nWith money available I immediately took steps to have the roof, at least, stained, as it was leaking in several places, it being evident that without attention for another year, the shingles would no longer hold where most weather-beaten. A contractor was approached and estimate of cost submitted.\n\nContractors made all preparations to begin work, first week in August, and therefore paint was ordered and delivered, and another job was put off to meet obligation. Shortly before work was to begin, word was received that because the cost of a new engine and batteries for the school would exceed the amount actually provided in the year's appropriation, money would not be available for the painting.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Contractors were greatly put out, and more so because the painting was very urgent, I had the work done, with the hope that since the work had to be done some time or other, consideration would be given in regard to the amount expended and reimbursement made possible, and for this reason I beg to submit in triplicate the statement of the Contractors which are here-with.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

The method of descent, in many cases, is by an iron pole from a structural steel landing at each floor. Obviously this method of descent is impracticable for small children. In addition, our experience in investigating these exits has been that the windows of dormitories leading to emergency exits have been nailed up or padlocked to prevent the older children from making unauthorized departures. The use of steel stairs in lieu of poles does not seem to be any solution where small pupils must descend several stories under winter conditions.\n\nModern practice is to build a stair of noncombustible materials within a fireproof enclosure or tower, properly lit and having entrances from each floor. These towers can be used as ordinary stairs, and should be located at each end of the building by means of which the whole school pupilage and staff may leave the building with maximum speed and complete safety.\n\nWhere fire escape stair towers cannot be added to an existing school, an effective type of fire escape would be a steel chute for buildings not over three storeys in height. The exits to these chutes should be from a door or window which would not impede the exodus of pupils and be in a straight line to the ground. By no means should a circular chute be considered.\n\nThis type of fire escape would be costly and depending on the school would probably occupy more space than is usually considered desirable. Furthermore if any fire escape is to serve the purpose in an emergency, entrance thereto must be unobstructed at all times.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch will no doubt appreciate the reasons behind our recommendations. If they are prepared to undertake the construction of steel escape chutes for the above school, this Division will prepare a design and obtain estimates of cost from our field officers.\n\nChas. H.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Kuper Island Indian Residential School\n\nSuperintendent Moore was advised some time ago that $2,200.00 had been provided for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment for the above-mentioned school during the current fiscal year. His letter of June 15th and copies of the subsequent exchange of correspondence are attached from which you will note that he has instructed the Reverend Principal to proceed with repairs to Boiler No. 22020 and improvements to the heating and domestic hot water systems, at a cost of $2,415.50.\n\nMr. Moore was not authorized to issue any instructions with regard to this work but apparently it rates priority over other requirements at the school and under the circumstances, I would recommend that his action be approved. The work apparently is being carried out by R.H. Ormond Limited, Nanaimo, B.C., and it is anticipated that they will submit accounts for material and for labour on a daily or hourly rate.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nRe: Kuper Island Indian Residential School\n\nIn reply to yours of above date and file and further to previous correspondence on the same subject, I wish to report as follows:\n\n1) Furnace with Steam Boiler No. 22020 has been in use in this school. No major repairs have been made to it in that time other than new tubes. No repairs made to the fire-box. To put this boiler in a satisfactory condition (according to R. H. Ormond, Ltd., Nanaimo) the following new parts and repairs are required at the estimated costs shown:\n\na) Condensation pump ----------------------------- $675.00\nb) Storage water tank and relief valve for kitchen ---------------------------------------- 135.00\nc) Red Head side arm Heater and insulation of tank -------------------------------------- 498.50\nd) Steam traps and steam air vents -------------- 375.00\ne) Board for four men ---------------------------- 72.00\nf) Brick wall repairs ----------------------------- 600.00\n\n(Note: Price of \"f\" is not definite as condition of inside wall will not be known until work commences).\n\n2) This job, when completed, should be satisfactory for a considerable length of time. The condensation pump and storage water tank included is a must according to the medical survey as this school never had a supply of hot water -- considered necessary for a school of this kind.\n\n3) The cost of the foregoing is about two hundred dollars ($200.00) more than the amount provided and I hope will be approved. In the meantime I have instructed the Reverend Principal to proceed with the work so that it will be finished before the reopening of school in September.\n\nR. H.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nRe: Kuper Island Residential School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 15th drawing to my attention the necessity for extensive repairs at this Residential school. As I mentioned to you on the telephone this morning, I think it is imperative that we proceed at this time, and with the monies available, to properly correct the heating difficulties at the school. I shall take up the matter of the other repairs with you during my visit on the 14th and 15th when it is hoped we can make arrangements to secure additional funds for repairs which are obviously long overdue.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIn thanking you for your circular, date and file number marginally noted, re the amount of funds available for repairs, etc., to the above mentioned school, viz... $200.00, I should like to know if the Department intends to take any action with respect to the alterations recommended last year by Mr. E. Webb in his letter of July 14th, 1943, copies of which you received on June 20th, 1943, along with a copy of my letter to the Department (your file 3-11-1) also the report of Dr. T. S. Mills dated August 3rd, 1943, copy of which you may not have received but Dr. Tempest has a copy which you might read if you think necessary. Mr. Inspector Davey is conversant with the necessary alterations which should be carried out in dormitories and girls' recreation room.\n\nUnder date of August 4th, 1943, a letter was received from the Department, file number 152-0-5 (21), with copy of memo attached from Mr. T. S. Mills, Chief Engineer, Ottawa. However, so far as I know nothing further was done by the Engineering Branch in Vancouver who were obviously the people to supply the information requested by Mr. Mills.\n\nYou will, of course, recall the repairs and improvements recommended recently by the Boiler Inspector for boilers number 22620 and 22563 at this school as well as to the heating plant. (see your letter April 28th, 1943). If these repairs and renewals are to be made there will be nothing left from the amount authorized by the Department for anything else.\n\nI should like to say that the Kuper Island Indian Residential School has been financially \"starved\" insofar as annual appropriations are concerned for the past ten years and I am concerned as to what the outcome will be unless early action is taken to provide sufficient funds to do some of the most pressing work and do it right. Where we have to put a few dollars here and there each year to keep the place operating is, in my opinion, poor economy. As I see it at the moment all our grant this year - of $200.00 - will be used up in the boilers and heating system leaving nothing for any other necessary expenditures.\n\nPlease understand that I am not trying to be critical but rather to bring the situation to the attention of the Department so that embarrassment may be avoided should conditions get serious -- particularly in the health of the pupils. The suggestion of cutting down the enrollment is not desirable as the cost of operation of a small school (100 pupils) is much higher in proportion than one with twice that enrollment -- hence part of the difficulty, financial, would be further aggravated.\n\nI regret that I was unable to discuss this matter with Mr. Davey last week owing to his absence but wonder if he could take the time to run over to Kamloops some morning where I would meet him and go into the situation -- no need for us to go to the school unless the Inspector may think it advisable.\n\nR.

Do you feel justified in granting immediate authority to have the tank ordered immediately, pending approval from Ottawa? We will have to have it anyway and to assure the work being completed before September 5th next I believe we should order it as soon as possible.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nR. H.

Ormond Ltd., so that the order may be placed through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nIt is also pointed out by the Department that the expenditures referred to under Items \"E\" and \"F\" of Section I of your letter of July 25th total $672.00 and unless R.H. Ormond Ltd. are prepared to do the work on an hourly basis, it will be necessary to secure the Minister's approval. It would appear to me that you should be able to arrange with the Company to submit an account on an hourly basis and I would ask you to please confirm this by return mail.\n\nI am communicating with the Department with regard to the hot water storage tank.\n\nIt is apparent that the total expenditure necessary at this school for repairs to the boiler and the domestic hot water system in the boiler room, will amount to over $3,150.00 and as only $2,200.00 is provided in the Estimates, it may be difficult for the Department to secure the additional funds.\n\nW.S.

I am also enclosing a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Moore and would ask that I be advised by Army Signals at the earliest possible date if the additional funds required for repairs at this school can be made available.\n\nThe boiler repairs outlined in Mr. Moore's letter of July 25th are recommended by the Public Works Boiler Inspector and are essential and certainly if the condition of the hot water storage tank is as indicated in Mr. Ormond's letter, replacement should be made before the school opens. Mr. Ormond's estimate of the cost of repairs to the brickwork of the boiler is not a firm figure but it is thought that the total of $3,200.00 should meet the cost of all repairs and I would recommend that, if at all possible, this sum be made available.\n\nW.S.

Moore dated August 12th and enclosures, from which you will note that he now estimates that the total amount necessary for the work will be close to $3,500. It is hoped that there is sufficient detail in the enclosure to enable you to requisition the condensation pump.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDuncan, B.C.\nAugust 12th, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn reply to your letter above noted, I wish to report as follows:\n\n1. Expenditures given by me under \"E\" and \"F\" in my letter the 25th ultimo are now covered by a separate quotation from the brick layer as per letter in duplicate attached. No of hours are shown, or rather days at $44.00 per day, plus board amounting to $9.00 per day, and an estimated material cost of $160.00. The fact that this is only an estimate can be explained by the fact that new bricks required will not be known until the existing structure is pulled down.\n\n2. Attached is a long explanatory letter from R.H. Ormond which I hope may be found self-explanatory. However, I should like to point out that the amount of $365.00 is alternative to the $345.00 described in the previous paragraph, in other words one or the other should be installed.\n\n3. As it seems now, the total expenditures will be as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Amount   |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Brick work            | $690.00  |\n| Hot water storage tank| $746.00  |\n| Board                 | $72.00   |\n| Total                 | $1436.00 |\n\n$2100.50\n\nYou will see from the foregoing that the amount which, in my opinion, should be expended on the heating and water system in this school, is considerably higher than at first thought necessary. Actually I cannot see how we can get away with less as repairs and renewals of this nature generally occur without much warning. I would recommend favourable consideration and approval.\n\nR.H. Moore, Superintendent.\nMr. R. H. Moore  \nIndian Agent  \nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nHerewith find details of suggestions and quotations as made direct to the Rev. J. Cominard, at the Ender Island Indian School, in our letter of May 17th, 1949.\n\nAs requested we have made a general survey of the existing installations in connection with suggestions as pointed out by yourself and Mr. G. Hallsell, the Dominion Boiler Inspector, as to improvements.\n\nThe return system of the existing pipe installation on the heating boiler is very sluggish owing to the pipe hookup and limited head room between top of boiler and ceiling. For the installation of a condensate pump as recommended by handling existing net radiation load of approximately 5000 feet of 2\" 6-1/3 Pipes & Powers condensate pump or equal would be required. The cost of this particular section of alteration work in supplying and installing the piping, fittings and incidentals would be $675.00 (Six Hundred and Seventy-five Dollars).\n\nAt the present time the domestic hot water is heated through the medium of a coil in the heating boiler during the winter months and a jacket heater during the off heating season. This particular jacket heater is very impractical for your use as it was designed for burning coal while the main fuel supply for your school is wood. From the information we have the coil in the boiler is from fifteen to twenty years old and therefore may give out at any time. Neither the hot water storage tank or the circulating pipes are insulated which creates a great heat loss.\n\nTo obtain an adequate supply of hot water during the heating or winter season we would suggest installing a Head Side Arc Heater complete with motorized valve for automatically controlling the temperature of water in the storage tank, insulation for storage tank, sidearm heater and recirculating pipes to be fibreglass at a completed cost of $498.50 (Four Hundred Ninety-eight Dollars and Fifty Cents).\n\nFor spring, summer, and fall use we recommend a suitable hot water heater for burning wood which we could have made up in Nanaimo. This would be a steel drum type furnace with copper coils fitted horizontally in the upper part of the cylinder. Furnace would be fitted with firebox, ash door and wood burning grates and would be sufficiently long to handle 36\" wood.\n\nAs an alternative to this, steel jacketed boiler could be made up. This would be cylindrical in shape set on the horizontal which would eliminate the necessity for coils at approximately the same cost as the above. As this is a low pressure water system it could be operated quite satisfactorily equipped with the regulation relief valve which is non-existent on the present system. For a complete job as outlined above the cost would be $345.00 (Three Hundred and Forty-five Dollars).\n\nWe might also suggest that it would be possible to supply a vertical type oil burner unit using diesel oil with a H. G. Little oil burner using a 55 gallon drum on a gravity line at a cost of $365.00 (Three Hundred and Sixty-five Dollars).\nThe estimated cost of materials for necessary repairs and replacements would include 36-1/2\" steam traps with tail pieces suitable for the job, 12-1\" steam radiator valves with the proper packing glands, 3-3/4\" Steam Air vents. The whole system would have to be checked over if proposed alterations are carried out and all traps cleaned, repaired or replaced. An allowance of $75.00 (Three Hundred Seventy-five Dollars) should be allowed for this part of the work on time and material basis.\n\nIn regard to storage tank which supplies hot water to kitchen and two bathrooms, this has a very poor piping connection on recirculating lines besides the tank is not insulated resulting in a very poor supply of hot water. We would recommend rewiring the recirculating lines, insulate tank and pipe lines and supply and install suitable approved automatic relief valve. The cost of this work would be $135.00 (One Hundred Thirty-five Dollars).\n\nWe have based the above mentioned prices on the assumption that transportation would be provided to and from Kuper Island. Cost of boarding the men has not been included in quotations but would be based on the prevailing rate of $5.00 per day per man in this area, or a total cost of $72.00. If desirable board and room could be provided by the Department, otherwise it would be charged against the job and paid by us.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRv H.

Having in mind the Department's policy with regard to such grants, reference Mr. Neary's letter of January 29th, 1949 (file 884-5 E.1), which dealt specifically with a similar request from the Principal of the Kootenay School, we have endeavoured to determine how fire hazard conditions at Kuper Island compare with those at the Kootenay School and feel that there is little difference and if a grant is warranted at the Kootenay school a similar grant is warranted at Kuper Island.\n\nAccording to our file the Department previously paid $60.00 a month towards the salary of the night watchman at the Kootenay school and I would recommend a similar payment at Kuper Island during the period November 1st to April 30th of each year.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, October 5, 1949.\n\nRe: Fire Escapes,\nKupper Island Residential School,\nCowichan Agency, British Columbia.\n\nFurther detailed study has been given to the alteration or replacement of the pole fire escapes and we find that replacement by wooden stairs enclosed in fire resisting timber towers will be a somewhat costly undertaking, as well as defacing the appearance of the building. Furthermore, the existing structure is not constructed so as to make the erection of steel chutes a practical solution.\n\nIt is felt that the removal of poles and the erection of steel stairs and additional landings should provide an adequate and safe means of exit. The normal snowfall in the district in which the school is located, according to the meteorological service records, is between six and twelve inches in the month of January, with much less in the other winter months. Under these circumstances, it is felt that to undertake the construction of enclosed stairways is unnecessary.\n\nMr. C.E. Webb has been asked to obtain tenders for alterations and additions to the existing fire escapes based on details shown on the enclosed blueprint.\n\nWe have not shown any interior alterations but would point out that access to the two end wall fire escapes are through rooms designated on the original plans as \"Monitor\".\n\nThe National Building Code is quite clear that access to fire escapes shall be from hallways or corridors through doors at floor level, and to meet this requirement it is recommended that the corridor be extended to exit doors and the monitor rooms, if required, be re-located adjoining the corridor and extending into the existing dormitories.\n\nD.M.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Kuper Island Residential School\n\nDec. 6th, 1949\n\nAttached is a letter from the Reverend Principal of the above mentioned school in which he requests consideration for a grant towards the purchase of a tractor, along with a letter in support of this request from Superintendent Moore.\n\nThe need for such a machine is adequately covered in the above mentioned letters. It will be noted that this request arises from the necessity of replacing the team of horses used on the school farm. The school's share of the cost of the tractor will approximate $1,000, which is greatly in excess of the amount which would be required to replace the team, and it is felt that this will adequately meet the regulations outlined in the Department's circular letter of June 21, 1948 concerning the supply of farm equipment, and the considerable advantage of the tractor over the team of horses justifies the Department's approval of a grant of $750.00 towards the purchase of this new piece of equipment, as recommended in Mr. Moore's letter.\n\nI might add that we are aware of the Department's policy with regard to the supply of tractors to residential schools but feel that in British Columbia some exceptions should be made, particularly in those cases such as Kuper Island where the available agricultural land is insufficient to produce the garden produce required for the pupils, feed for the milk cows and feed for horses to work the land.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nIn reply to your above letter and further to mine of August 12th and 16th last, I wish to advise after all known commitments are taken care, insofar as a new heating and hot water system for the school is concerned as well as materials for the manual training building, an approximate amount of $900.00 will be available for other purposes at the school and previously listed, out of the total sum of $4100.00 approved for this school.\n\nIn discussing this with the Rev. Principal when we were trying to decide which would be the next item in order of priority that should be done, the question of the farm came up and the necessity for the purchase of three horses as the present ones are so old and crippled that they are no longer of any use. The principal is confronted with either buying a new team or a small tractor. The latter is certainly more economical than the horses, largely I think owing to small acreage available at the school as well as the high cost of feed and freight. The saving in feed for horses will more than provide enough for two extra cows which are badly needed so that more milk and butter may be available for the pupilage. The labor saving will also be considerable and all to the good of the children. During all the years that I have been here this school has been operating from hand to mouth and at an annual financial loss. This has resulted in less food and clothing for the children which has been severely criticized on many occasions, as well as insufficient staff.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Principal will provide funds to pay the major share of the tractor and plow, I would ask that the Department stretch a point in this instance and allow an amount of $750.00 to be made available to assist the Principal in making the purchase of the tractor which will cost about $1700.00.\nI know that supplying tractors to Residential schools may not receive favourable consideration by the Department owing to the fact that the School is supposed to provide this equipment from their own funds, which is reasonable providing the school was financially able to do so. However, Kuper Island school is not economically sound and never will be owing to its location, small area of land suitable for agriculture and costly to get supplies and pupils to and from the school.\n\nFor the above reasons I would recommend that we assist the Principal to an amount as mentioned in paragraph 3 of this letter.\n\nA letter in duplicate from the Principal is attached hereto and which will be found self-explanatory.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Residential School  \nKuper Island B.C.\n\nNovember 17/49\n\nMr. R.H. Moore  \nIndian Supt.  \nDuncan B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand there are some nine hundred dollars left for repairs and improvement at this school, the cost of repairs and work on the furnace and cost of material to complete Manual training shop having been deducted from the total appropriation for this fiscal year.\n\nIn view of the fact that I am now obliged to replace the team of horses, old and not matched, may I suggest that the Department consider investing the said nine hundred dollars in a tractor complete with double plow, as part payment of a total cost of seventeen hundred dollars, it being the responsibility of the school to pay off the balance and to pay for any equipment needed later.\n\nI am well aware that it is not the policy of the Department to purchase farm operating items, as indicated in a circular of June 21st 1946, but I feel that my request as stated may be justified by the following reasons:\n\nThe service of a tractor would lessen the cost of labor as the heavy work would be done in less time, and one farm help would be equal to doing all the extra chores besides, whereas with horses, the time factor being considered, there is need of extra help, as now the boys are no longer available, being in the classroom all day; and this cost of extra labor being less over a period of one year, the balance of the cost would be almost paid off. Subsequently there would still be a saving, and this could be utilized for the purchase of more food and clothes, two items which are the object of frequent criticism.\n\nThere would be a benefit in this also that two more cows could be fed with what it takes to feed two horses, and therefore more milk and byproducts made available for the children. It is to be noticed that the cost of feed presently is very high and made more so through the added cost of transportation due to the unusual location of the school. There will indeed be a cost for the transportation of gas, but a great deal less as the service station is nearby.\n\nA third reason is that the acreage is not large enough to supply hay and root crops in sufficient quantity for the year; as it is we grow more hay than root crops and therefore have to buy concentrates at exorbitant prices to make up for what is wanting, added to this again the price of transportation, which of course would be greater for hay, had we to buy same, than for feed. With two horses less to feed, the improvement in this respect is obvious.\n\nFinally as to the funds that will be made available to pay off balance of purchase, I feel that these will accrue from less expenditure for fire wood, due to the fact that there will be a power-take-off on the\ntractor; and with the saw we have already will be in a position to cut our own wood at a saving of three dollars per cord, two hundred cords being needed for the year.\n\nI trust the Department will view the purchase of a tractor as a very great help for this school and will consider my sincere request.\n\nYours truly\n\nJ. Camirand\nDecember 12th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR D.M. MACKAY\n\nRe: Kuper Island Indian Residential School\n\nPlease note the contents of Indian Commissioner Arneil's letter of December 6th, and also Superintendent Moore's letter of November 21st and Father Camirand's letter of November 17th with reference to purchasing a tractor for use at the above school.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me have your opinion on Father Camirand's recommendation.\n\nI might add that we can find the funds if you consider we should make the allowance of $700.00 to cover the cost of the tractor.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

C., dated\nJuly 29, 1936.\n\nNo Trace\n\nOriginal on 152-8-1.\n\nRe: admission of a child to Kuper School.\nGaspard Elliot, child of a half-breed father and an\nIndian mother, who were never legally married, was admitted\nto Kuper Island School, in April or May, 1935. The Principal,\nnot knowing the exact status of the child, referred the case\nto the Agent, who said the child would have to be dismissed.\nMeantime the child's father went to the school to claim the\nchild. The Principal told him that the child was his and that\nhe could take him at once. But the father refused to take him,\nsaying that he would be back soon to get him. He never came\nfor him and so the Principal sent the child to his mother.\nI was asked to take up the matter by the mother who since a\nfew years is the sole supporter of the child, being separated\nfrom her husband.\n\nI spoke to the Agent about it, who told me that\nthe child could not be admitted to any Indian School, being a\nhalf-breed, and could not go to Kuper specially as it was\nagainst the will of his father. As to be admitted to an\nIndian School, I know that some of his cousins, Elliots and\nhalf-breeds also are attending the Chilliwack School. The\nPrincipal at Kuper Island is willing to accept the child,\nas long as a decision would be given by the Department. As\nI was told that it was by special request that the Elliots\nwere admitted at Chilliwack, I made the same request for\nthis child, and a sister of his who never attended school.\n\nAs to go against the will of his father, may I\nask for a decision from the Department. The mother was\nallowed to have her children baptized as Catholic. She is\nthe only one looking after them now.\nOttawa, August 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter with reference to the admission of a child, named Gaspard Elliot, to the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nWe do not appear to have received any correspondence from you regarding this boy.\n\nWe are informed that the mother is the sole support of the child, and, under these circumstances, it is considered that the boy is eligible for admission to the school which she requests him to attend.\n\nThe Department would therefore appreciate if you would arrange to have an application form and certificate of health for his admission to the Kuper Island School submitted for our early consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to yours of the 13th, instant, I would say that Gaspard Elliot, is a son of Henry Elliot, half-breed and of Sophie, daughter of Joe Whullwhalatza of the Chemainus Band.\n\nHenry Elliott has deserted Sophie, who now has the child, and I understand is applying for admission to the Kuper Island School, as this child would have no ways or means of obtaining any education, unless allowed to attend the Kuper Island Residential School, I would like to have the Department's sanction covering the admittance of this child, and then have the admittance papers duly made out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 31, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, please forward, for the Department's file, application and certificate of health for the admission of Gaspard Elliot to the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. If the boy is pronounced medically fit by the doctor, he may be placed in the school at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nOttawa, October 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI desire to refer you to official letters of August 13th and 31st and your letter of August 24th, with reference to the admission of Gaspard Elliott to the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. No application form or certificate of health has yet been received for this boy. Please let me know, at once, whether or not he has been placed in the Kuper Island School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

School of Arnold Recalma, the son of Martha Recalma and Indian girl of the Qualicum Band of Indians. It would appear as if there is a full brother of this boy already in the school, having been admitted under date of August 17th, 1935 and shown on the role of that School as #443. His admission was approved in Official letter #152-0-10 dated October 19th, 1935.\n\nIt would appear as if both these boys are illegitimate sons of the same white man, name unknown and Martha does not want to divulge it, although she says he is a married man.\n\nThe children have lived with the mother ever since they were born and apparently the father has done nothing towards their support, so to all intents and purposes they are living the life of Indians and will probably continue to do so.\n\nHowever, I quite appreciate the fact that later in their life one or the other of them may wish to be cut off the Indian list, and then explanations would have to be made to the Department, so I deem it advisable to inform you now.\n\nAs the mother (Martha) is very anxious that these boys should go to school-Kuper Island-I am of the opinion that it might be well to advise her that they can go, but I don't feel inclined to include them on the Census of this Agency, I would therefore like to have a ruling on the matter from the Department at your early convenience. In the meantime I have signed the application for the admission of Arnold, which is attached hereto.\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\nThe Secretary;\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\n\n(R.M. Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 26, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant you may inform the Principal of the Kuper Island residential school that the admission of the following children is approved:\n\nArnold Recalma    Flora Jim\nSandy Victor      Josephine Bartleman\nRichard Charles   Lawrence Bob\nPhyllis George    Wilfred Aleck\nElsie George      Cassel Aleck\nElsie Jim\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter it is not necessary for you to include the name of Arnold Recalma in the census of your Agency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

Moore\nIndian Agent\nDuncan B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your letter stating that Norman Elliot and Matilda Harris were legally married and therefore their child Laura would have to be discharged immediately from school, you mention that it is doubtful if the Department would even consider an application on her behalf at this particular time, and regret to inform that you have no alternative but to deplete her name from the Quarterly Returns.\n\nI beg to state however that I acted in good faith when I accepted Norman Elliot's child during the first term. It was difficult for me to know the status of this man, and since there are other Elliots on the Reserves, I thought this one would have the status of an Indian as well.\n\nHad I known that he was a White, I surely would have not accepted his child, certain that I would get no per capita grant for her.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6457, file 885-10, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDuncan, B.

I now beg to enclose herewith a letter just received from the Rev. Principal J. Camirand, which I trust you will find self-explanatory.

Moore)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 6, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the application for the admission of Laura Elliott to the Kuper Island Residential School. In view of the fact that her father is a white man she is not eligible for admission as a grant-earning pupil to any Indian residential school.

Due to the manner in which the return has been prepared, the school will lose a considerable amount of grant.\n\nIt appears from the information contained in the return that the summer holiday period started about June 15. In that event the school should re-open on August 15.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department allows 62 days' holidays with grant each year. Consequently, in preparing the June quarter return, 91 days' grant should have been requested for all pupils who were in residence at the time the holiday period commenced. This would mean that 15 days of the holiday grant would be paid in the June quarter.\n\nIn preparing the September quarter return, grant should be asked for each pupil who was in the school at the commencement of the holiday period for the exact number of days they are in residence during the September quarter plus 47 days (62 days holiday grant less 15 days holiday grant already allowed on the June quarter).\n\nPlease amend the return accordingly and forward it to the Department.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that in the case of pupils in hospital, grant should not be requested\n\nRev. John Camirand,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKuper Island, via Chemainus B.C.\nfor that period. For instance, in the case of pupil No. 443, grant should be requested for only 86 days.\n\nIn order to assist you in your financing, a part payment of $2,500 is being forwarded, and the balance will be paid when the amended return is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDuncan, B.C., August 26th, 1941\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Kuper Island Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name Veronica Margaret\nAge 8 years - born March 15th, 1933\nName of Band Lyackson Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid -\nFather's full name and No Phillip Thomas -\nMother's full name and No Esther Thomas -\nParents living or dead Both living\nState of child's health Apparently good\nReligion Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

In the case of the Residential School the pupils were slow in returning but this can be explained by the lateness of the return of the Indians from the U.S.A.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received an Application for Admission to the Kuper Island Residential School, in favour of two children called Percy and Cecelia Thomas who have been living on the Saanich Indian Reserve #2 since the time of birth. In view of certain complications in this matter, I am doubtful about signing the application forms as their Indian Agent.\n\nIt would appear that the parents of these children are not married although they have been living together for the past 18 years. Unfortunately however, the mother of the children was legally married 24 years ago to a man called Henry Louis of the Point Grey Indian Reserve and they separated after six years, Henry going to live with another woman of the same Band and she, his legal wife, coming to live with Adam Thomas.\n\nThe two children referred to should really belong to the Point Grey Band as they are illegitimate and consequently take the status of the mother. However, as they have been shown on the rolls of this Agency for many years, I would like to be informed if I have the necessary authority to sign the Application for Admission Forms or should send them to Mr. Indian Agent Hall in Vancouver.\n\nObediently yours,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nIndian Agent\n\nc. c. to Father Cyr s.m.m.\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the lst instant you may submit, for our consideration, applications for the admission of Percy and Cecelia Thomas to the Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.H.

M. MacKay, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your above noted letter of the 17th ultimo with reference to the discharge of certain pupils from Residential Schools who might be employed in useful occupations, particularly in the fishing industry, I beg to attach hereto in duplicate a letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Kuper Island Residential School which gives the names of three boys and their particulars whose discharge might be considered for this purpose. My comments on each boy is given below:\n\nDavie Etienne Pierre: The parents of this boy are not engaged in fishing and have not been to my personal knowledge for at least three years. The father works in sawmills and at odd jobs of Longshoring when these are available. If he was to go to his Grandmother at Cowichan Gap it is very doubtful if he would be of any particular use other than to attend to odd jobs around the camp. As he is only 15 yrs. he could not get employment on work outside his own immediate relatives owing to the fact that he has not got a Registration card and can not get one for another year.\n\nPercy Adam Thomas: If this boy was discharged he would simply go with his guardians to the berry fields as that is where they go every summer. The same general conditions apply to this case as the above and in my opinion it would be unwise to allow this boy to go to any fishing camp \"on speck\" as he would likely be used by the Indians for their own particular benefit, especially as both his parents are dead. The lack of a registration card would also apply in this case.\n\nSandy Victor Semo: This boy can be of definite use fishing, his parents go fishing every year and are fully equipped. I would recommend the discharge of this boy.\n\nAs I understand present regulations, no one is given employment unless he or she is the holder of a National Registration card and such card cannot be issued until the applicant reaches the full age of 16 years, consequently no one under that age can get employment of any kind except with his immediate family;\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your letter of March 13, 1942,\nYour file 156-0-10\n\nI beg to advise that there has been correspondence between this office and Mr. Indian Agent Moore in respect to discharging from Kuper Island Residential School boys who it was felt would contribute to the fishing industry, and I enclose herewith copy of Mr. Moore's letter of the 16th ultimo together with that of the Reverend Principal of the School, recommending that one boy, Sandy Victor Semo, be discharged at the end of the present school term as it is considered that he could make considerable contribution to the industry during the present emergency.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise if this is authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

(Quamichan) Pupil of St. Catherine's School shown as No. 12 on report of Sister Mary Eugenia, dated for the term ended May 1942.\n\nI am writing you regarding the above noted boy who I sent to the Kuper Is. Residential school yesterday for the following reasons:\n\n(1) This lad is an orphan being deserted by his mother some five years ago about two years after her husband\u2014the boy's father died\u2014died. The mother left her two children, Roy and his sister Agnes age 8, with their grandmother (who is a widow) and has not come near them since. For the past two years the boy and girl have attended the St. Catherine's school, somewhat irregularly, and during the last two months Roy got completely out of hand and his grandmother was totally unable to control him. She was also having trouble with Agnes and asked me to send them to Kuper Island as she was afraid that they would get into some serious trouble. I agreed to send Roy, but said that if she would keep Agnes for a little longer (in the hope that she might improve) after Roy left it might not be necessary to send the girl to the Residential School for at least a year or so. That is where the matter stands at present and I would ask that the Department be good enough to approve of this arrangement.\n\nI understand that there have been some definite instructions issued regarding the transfer of children from Day to Residential Schools, such transfer not to be made without first reporting the case to the Department and getting the necessary approval. As I do not appear to have received such regulations, I would respectfully request that I be supplied with same.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6457, file 885-10, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 16, 1942.\n\nRe: Rev George, Cowichan Band.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant and to state that your action in sending the above-noted Indian pupil to the Kuper Island Residential School is approved by the Department.

However, from time to time we have sent out letters in which we instructed our agents not to encourage such transfers where accommodation at Indian day schools was available.

Moore, requesting explanation as to IOS days grant requested for 17 pupils during September Quarter.\n\nThe Holiday period began June 15th to end on August 15th, the school year therefore opening on latter date. 17 pupils returned for the opening, so these children were entitled to\n\nHoliday Grant for 62 days\nPeriod Aug. 15 to Sept. 1st 62 days\nPeriod Sept. 1st to Oct. 30 days\n\n108 days\n\nFor each quarter 92 days were recorded on Report, though children were in school 76 days only, since Holiday period began June 15th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. Camirand SMN\nOttawa,\nOctober 26, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the September quarter return of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School. As stated in my letter of the 14th instant, we only allow grant for 92 days for the September quarter. Your school closed for holidays on the 15th of June and consequently the children were only in residence for 76 days during the June quarter. However, the Department had allowed grant for the full quarter, or, in other words, grant for 16 days, or a portion of the holiday grant. Consequently we could only allow the balance; namely, 46 days in the September quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. Camirand,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\nIndian Residential School\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nNovember 6/43\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to state I have received your letter of 26th instant, and gather therefrom that the holiday period grant of 62 days covers normally the period extending from July 1st. to September 1st., irrespective of the fact that the pupils leave June 15th, 26th, or any other day in June; and that if part of those 62 days grant is taken in June quarter, that much has to be deducted from the September quarter.\n\nBy this I see that I lose out in a great way by wanting to have the pupils leave for the holiday period on June 15th to return on August 15th, so that they may be in school before the general migration to the Hop fields, a reason for absence from school in the beginning of the year. In fact I am out of some five hundred dollars here also, besides the decrease of that much also in the September grant due to a delayed return, as explained in another letter.\n\nBy force of this and for a better financial condition, I beg to request that the holiday period be maintained as before, namely July 1st. to September 1st., hoping that with the organization now available, the truant officer or police will be equal to bring about a more timely and regular return of pupils for the opening date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn Camirand\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6457, file 885-10, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 11, 1943.\n\nDear Father Camirand:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in further reference to the per capita allowance of the Kuper Island Residential School. A review of your quarterly returns and the correspondence that we have received from you indicates two things:\n\n1. That your enrolment is not sufficiently large;\n2. That a number of the pupils do not return promptly upon the expiry of their leave.\n\nIf you had your full enrolment and all pupils returned promptly at the end of the holiday period, you would not suffer any loss in grant. Changing the dates of the holiday period will not make any improvement in your grant, unless the two factors mentioned above are remedied. I realize that it is no reflection on you that the conditions mentioned above exist and, in the hope that it may be of some help to you, I am writing to the Indian Agent urging him to recruit all possible cases for your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Camirand,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nNovember 11, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nAs you are probably aware, the Department allows grant for 92 days' summer holidays for each pupil at a residential school. Usually schools commence the holiday period on the first of July, which means that all pupils should be returned on the first of September. In the case of those pupils who were in the school on June 30 and allowed home on holidays at that time and returned to the school promptly at the end of the holiday period on September 1, grant is allowed for the September quarter for the full quarter. However, if any pupils do not return on September 1 the school loses grant for the period from the end of the holidays until the date on which the pupils return to the school. In the case of the Kuper Island School, they have been in the habit of taking holidays from June 15 to August 15 and consequently part of the holiday leave is allowed during the June quarter and the balance, or 47 days, is allowed during the September quarter. In other words, for a pupil allowed home on holidays on June 15, who does not return on August 15, the school loses the grant for the period from August 15 to the date of the return of the pupil. I have been in communication with the Reverend Principal of the Kuper Island School with reference to his grant and he seems to be under the impression that, due to our regulations, he is losing grant.\n\nAs a matter of fact the reason his grant is not as large as it might be is owing to two conditions:\n\n(a) The enrolment is not sufficiently large;\n\n(b) Some of the children did not return promptly upon the expiry of their leave.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\nAs an illustration of (a) I might say that the authorized pupilage at the Kuper Island School is 100. We only allow grant for $2.24. In the December quarter, 1942, the average attendance at the Kuper Island School was 72.44, in March, 1943, 85.6, in June 84.65 and in September 74.92. You will consequently see that the grant earned by the school would have been much larger if the attendance for each quarter had been 92.24. Of course, the September average is slightly lower than the others, due to the fact that a number of the children did not return upon the expiry of their leave on August 15. My purpose in writing to you at this time is to bring this matter to your attention with the hope that, if there are any children who should receive institutional care in your agency, you will give the matter your personal attention and arrange to have them placed in the Kuper Island School at the earliest possible date. It is understood, of course, that they would be eligible for admission to that school upon all religious and medical grounds. I should appreciate hearing from you within a month or so regarding your efforts in this particular regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSeptember 1st 1934\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Kuper Island B.C.

H. Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B. C.\n\nRe: Children of Pte. Frank A. George\n\nYour letter of the 18th ultimo has been brought to my attention today. I discussed it with Mr. Hoey and we feel that it would be in the best interests of the two children to have them placed in a residential school. I presume, from the third paragraph of your letter, that these children are Catholic, and consequently we believe that immediate arrangements should be made for placing them in the Kuper Island School. You should inform the Principal that the Department will allow supernumerary grant for them, if they are in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is authorized. In making this decision we feel that we are acting in the best interests of the children, and it is hoped that the Principal of the Kuper Island School will accept them at once.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health for these children should be forwarded for our files.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDuncan, B.C., November 24th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Kuper Island Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Roy CHARLIE\nAge: 11 years (born January 25, 1933)\nName of Band: \"Quamichan\" Cowichan Band - Roll No. 59\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Harry David CHARLIE (Deceased)\nMother's full name and No.: (Mrs.) Julia CHARLIE Roll No. 59 \"Quamichan\" Cowichan Band.\nParents living or dead: Father dead - Mother living\nState of child's health: Apparently good\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, British Columbia,\n\nI am in receipt of the June Quarterly Return of the Kuper Island Residential School. The name of Cecelia Jack No. 0520 was shown on the March return but does not appear on the June Quarterly Return although no application has been received for her discharge. We approved her admission in official letter to you April 17th, 1945. Possibly this girl has left the school but on the other hand the Principal may have neglected to include her name. If she was in school for the June Quarter grant should be requested for that quarter when preparing the September Quarterly Return and a note attached opposite her name giving the file number and date of this letter.\n\nIt is noted that pupils No. 546 and No. 0483 were sent to the Sardis Hospital on April 15th. The Principal only requested fifteen days grant. They were entitled to receive forty-five days grant, namely, fifteen days in April and thirty days sick leave grant. In connection with the latter I would refer you to paragraph five of circular letter of December 29th, 1944., a copy of which I enclose. We are allowing forty-five days grants.\n\nIn the last paragraph of my letter of April 17th I requested that the dates of entrance should be shown for six pupils.\n\nThe corrections have been made with the exception of the date of entrance of pupil No. 2497. This was shown on the June Quarterly Return as August 16th, 1945 and should have read August 15th, 1943. The correct date of entrance for this girl should be shown on future returns.\nCOPY\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nKUPER ISLAND, B.C.\n\nAug. 10th, 1945.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nIn answer to your letter of Aug. 6th, I wish to state that the omission of the name of Cecilia Jac., No. 0520 is clearly an oversight on the part of Father Camirand in his last quarterly report. Cecilia still is a pupil at the school; at present she is on her holidays, but she is due to return when school opens again. This is the statement I got from Sister Superior, who is in charge of the girls.\n\nAll the other remarks made in Mr. Phelan's letter have been noted and will be acted on in the next report.\n\nThe approval of the discharge of pupils No. 556 and No. 0489 is filed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Lemmens, S.M.M.\nActing Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReplying to yours of the 30th July regarding the June Quarterly Return of the Kuper Island Residential School, attached is a copy of a letter I have just received from Father W. Lemmens, Acting Principal, which I trust will be self-explanatory.\n\nUpon the return of Father Camirand, Principal, I shall probably be hearing from him on the matter and will advise you further when I hear from him.\n\nJ.

Caldwell, Acting Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nYou may inform the Principal of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School the Department approves the re-admission of Francis Daniels, Wilson Daniels and Annie Daniels. The admission of the following children is also approved:\n\nDonald Seymour    Adele Celestine\nJasper Jimmy      Ruth Joe\nPercy Jimmy       Josephine Modeste\nLarry J. Gibson   Evelyn Jimmy\nRonald C George   Josephine Jimmy\nSeraphine Norris  Muriel James\nDoreen Norris     Agnes Jim\nVirginia Joe\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the pupils numbered as follows:\n\n510    0449\n516    0511\n521\n525\n562\n563\n565\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDuring a visit to the senior room of the Tsartlip Indian Day School yesterday I received the following information:\n\n\"Christopher PAUL, Roll No. 11. of the Tsartlip Band age 51 years, and a widower, who is employed as a fireman at the Patricia Air Fort, has three children attending the Tsartlip schools, Dorothy, 17 years, Philip, 12 years and Anna, 8 years.\n\nIt appears that Christopher (or Chris, as he is commonly called) is doing considerable drinking and neglecting his children to the point where he takes them into Victoria about once a week and leaves them in his car while he goes off by himself hunting his favourite bootlegger. The outcome being that Philip, gets tired waiting and he too goes off and occasionally gets drunk himself and stays away for a day or sometimes longer hanging around Chinatown only returning home when he runs out of money or friends. Chris, apparently can do little or anything with this boy\u2014which is to be expected in view of the example he himself sets\u2014and now the lad goes off by himself into town even during the week. All of which adds up to the boy being on the fair road to getting himself into serious trouble.\n\nI also understand that while Chris does nothing to correct the boy, he occasionally gives his daughter Dorothy the occasional beating although she is a good girl and is a very good student at school and anxious to improve her education. It appears that a short time ago the girl went to school with her nose broken and her eyes blackened as the result of a beating from her father, who apparently takes out all his pent-up spite on her.\n\nThe Rev. Sister Maureen Regan, Teacher of the school in discussing the matter with me suggested that we take Philip and Anna away from their father and send them to Kuper Is. Res. school, but when the matter was suggested to Chris by the Missionary, he definitely refused to allow them to go.\n\nI am therefore referring the matter to the Department with the recommendation that the Mounted Police be asked to pick up both of these children at their home, without even getting the permission of the father\u2014if necessary, and take them straight up to Kuper Island Res. school and they be made to remain there even during the summer holidays if considered advisable. I know this is more punishment to the children than to the father\u2014who is really responsible\u2014but owing to the fact that the children will not lay a charge against him for neglect there is little that can be done through the Courts without evidence, and even if we did have the evidence, the children should still be sent to the Residential school. I would like to have a reply by Air Mail. Major D.M. MacKay is getting a copy of this letter.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nc.c. to Major D.M.

The principal exception was at Kuper Island Residential School where the Principal seemed slow in getting back some of the pupils that were with their parents at Steveston and in fact on the Reserves. This was brought to their attention several times during the month by me but what the results were during the last week or ten days of September I don't know yet, although up to that time they were disappointing. My own opinion is that the Reverend Principal waits for the children to return rather than taking definite steps himself to bring them back. This has been suggested to him by the writer and also to His Excellency the Bishop of Victoria. It is hoped that we will get better results from now on.\n\nR.H.

It was after this that he went to U.S. and has not been back since, from what I hear.\n\nI believe the boy is mentally deficient, and there is little that can be done to correct him; and his presence here would be conducive to more trouble.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Ottawa.\n\nYour File: 152-9-10. (W.T.I.)\n\nThank you very much indeed for your letter of the 24th inst. instructing me to take Sammy Jack, age 12 years, to the Kamloops Residential School. I think this is an excellent idea and one which should work out very well indeed for the boy.\n\nI should now like to report on a similar case which has to do\u2014this time\u2014with a girl of the Cowichan Band called Agnes Charlie, whose father died about 10 years ago and was deserted by her mother in 1938 when she went to the U.S.A., leaving her two children, aged 5 & 4 years at that time, in the care of their grandmother, Mrs Mary Kate Mechel of the Cowichan Band. This arrangement worked out satisfactorily until about two years ago when we started having trouble with Roy and Agnes about not attending school. Charges of Truancy were laid but owing to the fact that their Grandmother admitted lack of control, they were sent to the Residential school at Kuper Is., but refused to stay there and kept running away. Sometimes weeks elapsed before they could be rounded up and returned, only to again run away. This condition of affairs kept up until last Spring when Roy, aged 13 years then, was charged with tampering with a Railway right of way switch, admitted his guilt and committed to the Boy's Industrial school in Vancouver and where he still is. After this Agnes would attend the local Day School off and on\u2014just enough to make it hard to get anywhere with a charge under the Truancy sections of the Act. However, she was again sent to Kuper Is., but stayed only a matter of two or three weeks and ran away again, taken back again by the R.C.M.P. but ran away again in a matter of hours. She is not going to school now but rather running hither and yon not paying any attention to the warnings given by the writer or to the instructions of her Guardian. As this girl needs discipline and plenty of it, I should like to request that you make the necessary arrangements to have her admitted to the Kamloops Res. school too.\n\nThe question of getting her there will not be a problem as I can take Sammy Jack and her up by car at the same time and Mrs Moore can accompany me as Matron. We will be able to get the two children up in one day from Vancouver at much less expense, and with a fraction of the trouble than by train. Kindly reply by Air Mail and immediate action will be taken to take both children there early next month.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRes File: 152-0-10. (W.T.I).\n\nRe: Leonard James, Kuper Is. Res. School Roll No. 576.\n\nFurther to my letter of yesterday's date which was in reply to yours of the 24th. ult. file number mentioned above, I should now like to submit a report on the above noted boy.\n\nThis lad of 10 years, is an orphan with very poor home conditions, was admitted to the Kuper Is. Res. school on Jan. 5th. last. He ran away several times and was rounded up and brought back to the school by the Police, the final episode taking place in April when he ran away at the same time as Sammy Jack, as indicated in the June Quarterly report from the school, and eventually got to the U.S. with his mother and older sister where he has remained until a few days ago when he returned to his home reserve. He is not in attendance at any school and on account of poor home conditions he should be at a Res. School, but unfortunately there is no use in sending him to Kuper Is. even if the Principal would accept him as he would just stay there long enough to get clothed properly and then run away again.\n\nMay I have your permission to take this lad with me to Kamloops Residential school at the same time that I take his pal, Sammy Jack and Agnes Charlie if you approve of her going there? Kindly advise by Air Mail.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 5 November 1946.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDUNCAN, B.C.\n\nWe have your letters of the 31st ultimo and 1st instant with reference to Agnes Charlie and Leonard James. It is presumed from your letters that both these children are in good health and that the only difficulty with them is that they truant when placed in the Kuper Island School.\n\nWhen authorizing you to place Sammy Jack in the Kamloops School, we thought that this was an exceptional case and that it would not be used as precedent to place other children from your Agency in that school. There is always someone to object when we place children in residential schools situated at a considerable distance from their own home. However, the two children mentioned in the first part of this letter seem to be exceptional cases and we will approve their admission to the Kamloops School providing the Principal is willing to accept them.\n\nWe suggest that you communicate with Father O'Grady giving him the facts of the two cases. You might tell him in your letter that we approve of them going to Kamloops but as we are not aware of how many children are enrolled at the present time, we did not feel free to send these two without first consulting him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 5 November 1946.\n\nMr. H.E. Taylor, Indian Agent,\n416 Federal Bldg., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 16th and 17th ultimo, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Kuper Island Residential School:-\n\nMolly George\nWalter George\nGertrude George\nDonald Joe.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Kuper Island, B.C.\n\n**School During September Quarter, 1946**\n\n| No. | Name          | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | Band       | Name of Parents and Living or Dead (Insert L for living; D for dead after name) | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Places and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 9547| S.

J. Camirand\n\nN.B. Marina Joe, child of Moody Joe and Emily Joe, now over 16 years of age, has returned to school late, at which time she had been already discharged. Since her father is dead, and was sent here in because the mother did not look after her, it was understood she should remain here till old enough to look after herself. Not returning in due time, I presumed she would stay with her mother now in U.S. and made application for her discharge. I have included her again on the school roll, and kindly request she be admitted.\nOttawa, January 14, 1947.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return of the Kuper Island Indian Residential School, it is noted that pupil No. 0498 was discharged and pupil No. 0499 remained on the Return.

Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of the 21st instant, the Department approves the discharge of pupils numbered 0498 and 0499.\n\nIf these children desire to return to the school at a later date they may be re-admitted.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nKuper Island, B.C.\n\nJanuary 28/47\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDuncan, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nVirginia Bob, daughter of Modeste Bob of Westholme, of whom I have spoken to you already as having completed her sixteenth year, and being ready to be discharged, but whom you requested to be kept here, as there was a possibility that she would not be properly cared for at home, is causing a great deal of trouble, and a very bad influence for the others in school, inciting many to insubordination.\n\nI have spoken to this girl at three different times for the purpose of having her understand the predicament she would be in, if she was to return home now, and prevailed upon her to behave as she should, but in spite of promises, I see no improvement. She is doing all she can possible do to have herself expelled, all the while being a serious cause of annoyance for everyone.\n\nIn view of this I would kindly request that she be discharged and returned to her father, and thus avoid further trouble.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Camirand\nRev. J. Camirand Smm\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nO T T A W A, Ontario.\n\nI beg to attach herewith a copy of a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Kuper Island Residential School relative to Virginia Bob, number 0477, and which I trust may be found self-explanatory.\n\nFor your information I should like to report that I had the father of this girl in the office yesterday and tried to impress on him the importance of keeping a watchful eye on his daughter, Virginia, and which he agreed to do. Taking into consideration all the circumstances connected with this case, I deemed it advisable to allow Virginia to return home yesterday to her father, as there was ample evidence submitted by the father and the Principal to indicate that the School Authorities were unable to handle the girl and I was fearful that she might run away from school and take some of the other children with her. For your information I should like to say that the Kuper Island School seems to have a great deal of trouble lately with the older pupils - boys and girls alike - and I cannot help but feel that the discipline and care of the teachers or supervisors are to blame. Sometimes I feel that the discipline is too strict while at others I am of the opinion that it is not strict enough and at times there is evidence of definite lack of respect on the part of the pupils. This was indicated recently when three or four girls ran away and on being rounded up by the Missionary one of the pupils told the other runaways to slap his face if he tried to make her go back to the school.\n\nVirginia Bob was born on October 17th, 1930 which makes her over 16 years of age now but it was hoped that we might be able to keep her peacefully in school until the end of the current year. In view of the circumstances connected with this case I trust that my actions may be approved in allowing this girl to leave the school without being officially discharged. This letter is going forward in duplicate through the office of the Indian Commissioner.\n\nR. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nM:K\nJanuary 30, 1947\n\nMemorandum:\nTo Major D. M. MacKay - Indian Commissioner\nFrom R.F. Davey - District Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nThe attached letter addressed to the Department from Mr. Indian Agent Moore indicates that the problem of Virginia Bob is a result of poor discipline at the Kuper Island School.\n\nIn view of the age of the girl and in the interests of the school I recommend that Mr. Moore's action be approved.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRFD/mh\nenc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter of January 29th and enclosure referred to therein, together with School Inspector Davey's memorandum in connection with Virginia Bob, a pupil at the Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nI concur in the views expressed by Inspector Davey in this case and recommend that Mr. Moore's action in allowing the girl to leave the school be approved.\n\nD.

Leighton, Agency Nurse, Duncan, B.C., dated July 2nd, 1947.\n\nSaanich I.R. #4\n\nFour children of Sulamina Jack, aged 12, 10, 8 and 5, have been causing a good deal of concern. They are nominally in charge of their grandmother who is at present working on a local berry farm. She leaves the children alone all day and they spend their time wandering the highways for a radius of several miles. The oldest, a boy, David, made friends with a white land, and between them, did a little house-breaking and stealing from the empty houses of David's Reserve - also a store in near-by Sidney. David was taken up to the Kuper Island Residential School but this was far from satisfactory as the School is not organized to care for children during the holiday months. The younger children of this family are still wandering around.\n\nThere is a great need for a Home which would give year-round care and guidance to the neglected children of all ages, both school age AND pre-school-age. Good care and discipline during their growing years might reduce the number of irresponsible teenagers who, as at present, are fast giving birth to a new crop of neglected children.\nOttawa, July 19th, 1947.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, In Charge,\nIndian Agency, Duncan, B.C.\n\nWe have a report from the agency nurse at\nDuncan, M.E. Leighton, in which she refers to four\nchildren of Sulamina Jack, Saanich Indian Reserve\nNo. 4.\n\nShe states that David Jack has been placed\nin the Kuper Island School but that the other three\nchildren are receiving little or no supervision.\n\nWould it not be possible to have the other\nthree children placed in the Kuper Island School?\nPlease discuss this suggestion with the principal\nas we feel that it would be in the best interests\nof the children.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MDG\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Kuper Island B.C.\n\n**School During June Quarter, 1947**\n\n| No. | Name       | Date of Admission | Age in Months | Band   | Name of Parents and Living or Dead (Insert L. for living, D for dead after name) | Religion of Parents | State of Education when entering the School | Place and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|------------|-------------------|---------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 599 | George JACK | I-4-47            | 14 .59        | Tsawout| Clara Jack D                                                                    | R.C.                | 3rd gr                                      | East Saanich                           |\n| 0554| Elizabeth JACK | I-4-47           | 7 .59         | Tsawout| Clara Jack D                                                                    | R.C.                | None                                        |                                        |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name             | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge Reasons for Same |\n|-----|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 0515| Bernadine WILSON | June/47 II        | 6                      | 2nd gr             | In Sardis hospital for 2 years         |\n| 543 | Francis Seymour  | June/47 I2        | 2                      | None               | 543 in Sardis since Sept/46            |\n| 514 | Stanley Paul     | June/47 I3        | 1                      | Ist Gr             | 514 in Sardis Since Nov/46 died recently. |\n\n**Note:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nMarch 1st 1947\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Kuper Island B.O.

On April 20th, 1947, both were Baptized into the United Church of Canada and attend the Koksilah Indian Day School. The youngest child was Baptized into the United Church of Canada on April 6, 1947.\n\nNow it turns out that the mother of these girls has developed Tuberculosis and we are anxious to get her into the Nanaimo Indian Hospital. She and her husband are quite agreeable but what to do with the two girls of school age? We would like to send them to a Residential School -- but which one? Catholic or Protestant? The father wants them to go to the latter but, before I make any arrangements, I want to get a ruling from the Department as I know that, years ago, the original Baptism was recognized by Ottawa as the one to go by -- why, I do not know.\n\nAs there is considerable urgency in this matter I should like you to please give me an early reply.\n\nR.

Moore,\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSebastin JACK, child of Cecelia JACK (86) is cause for much worry as he has been breaking in Indian homes, and away most of the time, to the extent that we cannot keep up with him, and there seems to be no way of correcting him as he appears to be mental.\n\nOf late he has been picking up all the matches he can get to, and was found smoking in one of the school rooms. He often goes up to the hay loft in the dead of night, and my worry is that he may set the place a fire.\n\nThese last two days he has been hiding in the woods, and feeding most likely on what he has taken from Indian homes. This has been going on most of the time during these holidays, and in view of the fact that the child has no decent home, I felt we would just have to put up with it, but as he is getting to be a menace and the Indians are all much annoyed over it all, I thought I better mention this and see if something could be done.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Rev. J. Camirand) smm\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Kuper Island Residential School\n\nAttached is a letter from Mr. Superintendent Moore concerning a request from the Principal of the above-mentioned school for the discharge of a pupil. This letter is being forwarded to the Department for your information and I shall await a report on the medical examination which I have asked Mr. Moore to secure.\n\nThis is the last of a number of requests over the last two years which have been received from the Principal in which the mental condition of the pupil has been questioned. The particulars outlined in Father Camirand's letter and also those given in that of Mr. Moore would definitely indicate that the supervision at the school leaves much to be desired.\n\nInspector Davey has also been concerned about this phase of the operation of the Kuper Island School and has endeavoured to impress upon Father Camirand the necessity of securing a competent staff.\n\nOn receipt of the medical report from Mr. Moore I shall communicate with you further.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT KUPER ISLAND B.C.

Jack.\n\nOn Sept.3/49 and on Sept.7/49, I examined this boy at Kuper Island School and find that he is mentally deficient. He has been breaking into houses - and stealing considerable number of items from different houses. He stole a gun and shot off shells. He is a very bad example to other children and I am sure he should be taken from Kuper Island school.\n\nProblem was discussed with Rev. Camirand.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) \"J. Goodbrand\".\n\n(LS)\nW.S. Arneil, Esq. Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Sebastian Jack. Roll No. 625. Kuper Is. Residential School.\n\nWith further reference to your above noted letter and previous communication from Rev. Father Camirand which was sent you attached to mine of the 16th ultimo regarding the marginally noted pupil, I wish to advise as follows:\n\n(1) I asked Dr. J. Goodbrand to visit the school and give me a written report on this boy, particularly his mental condition.\n\n(2) Report received and attached hereto in duplicate.\n\n(3) Application for discharge of the boy received from the Rev. Principal and attached herewith.\n\n(4) An effort is being made by the writer to try and get this lad cared for by a relative at one of the reserves on Discovery Island where he may not have the same opportunity to damage other peoples property. However, this is only a temporary solution for in my opinion if the lad is mentally unbalanced he should not be running at large but committed to the mental hospital in the usual way.\n\n(5) I am not assuming responsibility for such action at the moment, but feel that it might be well to have the lad examined by two doctors, and then action taken, if warranted.\n\nR.H. Moore\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Kuper Island Residential school\n\nFurther to my letter of August 24th in connection with a request from the Rev. Principal of the above-mentioned school for permission to discharge Sebastian Jack, I am forwarding a letter dated Sept. 8th from Supt. Moore with enclosures referred to.\n\nDr. Goodbrand's report with regard to the mental condition of this boy is rather indefinite and it is felt that arrangements should be made for his examination by two doctors with a view to his admission to a mental hospital if his condition is as stated.\n\n-W.S.

A blood test was done today.\n\nI talked with the boy for a long while and think that he would be better off at home for the next few months.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6457, file 885-10, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nCowichan Indian Agency\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration\nOTTAWA ONTARIO.\n\nRe: Sebastian JACK, 12 years,\nRoll No.86 Penelakut Band\n\nI examined this boy at Chemainus Hospital on October 10th, 1950, at your request. The reason for examination involved the boy's conduct at Kuper Island Residential School, where he has been mixed up in several episodes. Physically, he is well developed, is well nourished and has a tidy appearance.\n\nThe only abnormal physical finding was a heart murmur, which does not impair his routine daily activities. He is alert, makes friends easily -- but immediately breaks into tears when questioned regarding his conduct.\n\nHe is in grade III -- which is not advanced enough for a twelve year old boy, but he has been away from school a great part of the time.\n\nHe claims he does not like Kuper Island School, but possibly most children would say they did not like school. He definitely denies stealing money in the last episode, where several boys tried to escape from Kuper Island Residential School.\n\nSebastian's several attempts at escaping and staying in barns overnight, would seem to me to be an endeavour on his part to make himself as big a nuisance as possible so that he would be suspended. However, his grand-mother says this boy would often hide away and they would have to search for him. However, this boy is not an imbecile. He may have a lower I.Q., than average and is easily led by other boys into trouble.\n\nI would recommend that Sebastian be taken from Kuper Island Residential School, to see how he gets along, in a different atmosphere.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. S. GOODBRAND,\nMedical Officer.\n\nJSG:LS\nRe: Sebastion JACK, Pupil of Kuper Island Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will recall the case of the above noted, who was accused by the Reverend Principal of the School mentioned, as being an imbecile.\n\nNo evidence was submitted at that time, other than a note from Dr. Goodbrand, stating almost verbatim the sentiments of Father Camirand. These he changed, later.\n\nRecently, this lad and two others ran away from school and spent two days in the bush. They stole some money from the school, before leaving, and later some from an unattended store on Thetis Island. Most of the latter \"take\" was recovered.\n\nCharges of theft were laid against the boys and they were adjudged to be \"Juvenile Delinquents\". The parents of the three boys paid back the money to the Store keeper, and two of them were placed in charge of the Principal of the school. Sebastion, was blamed as being the ring leader by the Principal -- although he stated almost immediately, that he was easily led.\n\nThis statement by the Principal left little for me to do, except ask the Court to order Sebastion Jack's discharge to the care of his guardian, on condition that he be ordered to report monthly, to the Magistrate. I also suggested that the parents of the three lads be ordered to repay the amount stolen, plus Court Costs. These suggestions were agreed to by the Court, and each parent paid his one third share of the missing funds -- amounting to approximately ten dollars ($10.00), each.\n\nSebastion is now at home with his grand-parents. I have assigned him to St. Catherine's Indian Day School, and, in all probability, will get along alright. After attending Court, I am more convinced than ever, that poor supervision generally, was the cause.\n\nEnclosed, please find two letters, from Drs. Goodbrand, and Dick, dealing with Sebastion's mental condition.\nUntil I hear from you or the Department, I have not asked the Principal of St. Catherine's Indian Day School to enroll him. However, I consider that he should attend some school in the interval, if -- for no other reason -- \"school discipline\".\n\nR. H.

On reviewing our correspondence, we feel that the boy should be discharged from the Kuper Island Residential School and arrangements made to have him attend St. Catherine's Day School for a trial period.\n\nBernard F.
