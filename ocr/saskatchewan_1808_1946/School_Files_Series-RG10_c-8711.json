Box 1012, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nNovember 4, 1938\n\nREPORT ON A SURVEY OF THE SANITARY CONDITIONS AT THE ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSION AT FORT CHIPPEWYAN, ALTA.\n\nDate - July 7 and 8, 1938\n\nFort Chipewyan is an old trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company situated at the western end of Lake Athabasca near the mouth of the Athabasca River. The white population totals about 100 people and several resident Indian families. From 500 to 600 Indians live in the vicinity and occasionally come to camp at the Fort when Treaty is being paid and also to trade and obtain supplies.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Mission is located just west of the settlement at the head of a shallow bay encircled by isolated rocky ledges. It consists of a residential school for Indian children, the oldest part of which was constructed in 1874, a church, priest's residence, stable and barn and numerous other outbuildings in addition. During the winter months the school is occupied by about 100 children and more stay on during the summer so that provision has to be made for adequate quantities of water for domestic purposes throughout the year.\n\nWith the assistance of one of the brothers examination was made of the sources of water supply and methods of sewage and garbage disposal.\n\nWater Supply\n\nThe main source of supply is from Lake Athabasca, being pumped during the summer and hauled on sleighs from holes through the ice during the winter. The water intake is situated in front of the school at the end of a wooden wharf, the intake line consisting of 1-inch galvanized iron pipe with a foot valve. A small gasoline driven plunger pump discharges the water through a pipe line to 5 or 6 covered steel barrels in the kitchen. This water is used for all purposes including drinking and culinary in the new state.\n\nDuring the winter, holes must be cut through the ice further out in the lake and the water hauled to the school on sleighs in the barrels. The summer consumption is estimated to vary from 400 to 600 gallons per day and the winter consumption 200 gallons daily.\n\nThe level of Lake Athabasca is controlled to a great extent by the levels of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers and shows quite a wide fluctuation. This frequently results in the\npresent water intake becoming stranded and to overcome this, 2,000 feet of 1\u00bd-inch galvanized iron pipe have been obtained and will be extended along the base of the west side of the bay out to deeper water (Photo No. 4). This pipe has to be taken up before winter sets in to avoid destruction or loss by drifting ice.\n\nSources of possible sewage pollution are all of local origin. The Athabasca River is highly turbid during the summer months carrying in suspension considerable quantities of clay and sand. Though practically all the residents in the settlement use the outdoor pit privy, none of which is closer than 100 feet to the lake and consequently all the surface drainage which may contain human sewage as well as dog droppings and other matter, is toward the lake with the drift towards the mission intake. The outer end of the boat dock is popular for bathing by children and consequently casual pollution may be expected from this source (Photo No. 1).\n\nAnother possible source of sewage pollution is the Indian camps perched on the bare rocks adjacent to the water intake area (Photo No. 4).\n\nIn my opinion the lake at this point is quite unsatisfactory as a source of drinking water supply during the summer.\n\nA second source of supply is a shallow well in the rear of the mission which is at the present only being used by the stables. The well is about 600 feet from the main kitchen and about 250 feet from the stable and at a lower elevation. It adjoins the gardens and fields used for hay and clover crops and is about the only available site for a well in the vicinity because of the light overburden on the underlying rocks. The well is about 4 feet square and 24 feet deep, being lined with rock. The lower 18 feet is filled with impervious 3 feet thick overlying a waterbearing stratum of mixed clay and gravel. The top of the well is protected from surface drainage and a ditch between it and the stable carries off the drainage around it. There is both a small gasoline driven plunger pump and a hand pump which may be used to pump the water to the kitchen or stable. These are housed in a small wooden structure (Photo No. 5).\n\nThis well is exclusively used by the mission during the breaking up or freezing over of the lake when the pumped supply is not available. It is reported to produce an ample quantity although its use for drinking and culinary purposes has been objected to because of the taste which is somewhat mineral although not entirely disagreeable. The laboratory report on one specimen obtained was favourable (Table No. 1).\n\nA third source of water supply frequently used is a slough several hundred yards back of the mission which is removed from sources of human sewage pollution (Photo No. 6). This source of supply appears to be quite suitable for all domestic purposes but unfortunately the quantity available\nvaries considerably from year to year so that it can only be used as an auxiliary supply. It might be feasible to develop this supply by building a low earthen dam at the lower end and laying down a temporary pipe line and pump, to the mission property.\n\nA number of water specimens were collected for bacteriological analysis, the results of which were reported as follows:\n\n**TABLE NO. 1**\n\nDate of collection - July 8, 1939\n\n1. **From Lake Athabasca at outer end of Fort Chipewyan dock**\n   \n   Number of organisms per c.c. - too numerous to count.\n   Presence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination - Positive\n   Laboratory comment - plate count gives more than 3,000 bacteria per c.c.

Unsuitable for drinking purposes in raw state.\n\n**Sewage Disposal**\n\nDuring the summer months outside toilet buildings are used, one for each sex (Photos Nos. 7 and 8). These are frame structures erected over dug pits and have a number of rows of stalls in each with seats having no covers. The\nbuildings are poorly lighted and maintained, and no effort has been made to use screens and prevent the entrance of flies.\n\nThe location of these toilets is such as not to endanger any source of water supply and the light sandy soil in their vicinity appears to be suitable for their functioning although chlorinated lime could be used to good effect to reduce odors and partially disinfect the contents.\n\nFor night use and during the winter months pail type toilets are located at convenient points on each floor of the school, the contents being disposed of by emptying into the boy's outdoor toilet during the winter and being buried in a hole in the ground near the girl's toilet in the summer.\n\nGarbage Disposal\n\nAll garbage is suitably disposed of by being fed to the animals, much of it being boiled in a stock pot and given to the chickens. Other refuse and rubbish is destroyed by burning and there were no nuisances or menace to health observed in this connection.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n(a) Water Supply\n\nIt is recommended that Lake Athabasca be discontinued as a source of drinking water for the school during the summer months as the amount of local pollution to which it is subjected renders it unsafe for this purpose unless it is either boiled or chlorinated and filtered as well.\n\nIt would appear that the slough behind the mission could be further developed as a source of water supply by installing a summer pumping system.\n\nThe water of the shallow well also appears to be of good sanitary quality although possibly exposed at times to drainage from the stables and should be further developed for use during the winter months.\n\nFilling both of these supplies it would also be possible to put up ice and store it for use as drinking and culinary water during the summer time.\n\nAfter freeze up has occurred the water in the outlet channel of the lake is probably of safe sanitary quality so that it could be used as at present in being hauled from water holes. The provision of a pumping system for this purpose would hardly be practicable as it would require a heated pumping house to protect the pump and the heating of at least 3,000 feet of pipe line to prevent freezing up. It would also be necessary to remove this installation every spring to prevent loss or damage from drifting ice.\nSince Fort Chipewyan is situated within the Province of Alberta, it is suggested that the Mission make arrangements with the Department of Public Health for frequent analysis of all water supplies used by them for drinking and culinary purposes.\n\n(b) Sewage Disposal\n\nThe present use of the outdoor pit privy appears to be functioning quite well in principle.\n\nIt is recommended that window openings should be provided for the toilet buildings to lighten the interiors and that the walls and floors should be frequently whitewashed or painted white and always maintained in a clean condition. All ventilators, windows, and other openings should be fully screened to prevent the entrance of flies native to the vicinity and thus prevent the possible transmission of infection by this means.\n\nChloride of lime should be made available in ample quantities for dusting into the toilet pits in order to prevent local malaria conditions and also to disinfect the contents. Chloride of lime or other equally efficient disinfectant should also be used in all the pit type toilets located in the school.\n\n(SGD) A.H.

From 500 to 600 Indians live in the vicinity and occasionally come to camp at the Fort when Treaty is being paid and also to trade and obtain supplies.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Mission is located just west of the settlement at the head of a shallow bay encircled by glaciated rock ledges. It consists of a residential school for Indian children, the oldest part of which was constructed in 1874, a church, priest's residence, stable and barn and numerous other outbuildings in connection. During the winter months the school is occupied by about 100 children who may stay on during the summer so that provision has to be made for adequate quantities of water for domestic purposes throughout the year.\n\nWith the assistance of one of the brothers examination was made of the sources of water supply and methods of sewage and garbage disposal.\n\nWater Supply\n\nThe main source of supply is from Lake Athabasca, being pumped during the summer and hauled on sleighs from holes through the ice during the winter. The water intake is situated in front of the school at the end of a wooden wharf; the intake line consisting of 1\u00bd-inch galvanized iron pipe with a foot valve. A small gasoline engine is used to pump discharges the water through a 1-inch line to 5 or 6 covered steel barrels in the kitchen. This water is used for all purposes including drinking and culinary in the raw state.\n\nDuring the winter, holes must be cut through the ice further out on the lake and the water hauled to the school on sleighs in the barrows. The summer consumption is estimated to vary from 400 to 600 gallons per day and the winter consumption 200 gallons daily.\n\nThe level of Lake Athabasca is controlled to a great extent by the levels of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers and shows quite a wide fluctuation.

Though practically all the residents in the settlement use the common outdoor privy type of privy, none of which is closer than 100 feet to the lake shore, nevertheless all the septic drainage which may contain human sewage as well as dog droppings and other matter, is toward the lake with the drift towards the mission intake. The outer end of the boat dock is popular for bathing by children and consequently casual pollution may be expected from this source. (Photo No. 1).\n\nAnother possible source of sewage pollution is the Indian camps perched on the bare rocks adjacent to the water intake area (Photo No. 4).\n\nIn my opinion the lake at this point is quite unsatisfactory as a source of drinking water supply during the summer.\n\nA second source of supply is a shallow well in the rear of the mission which is at the present only being used for the stables.

It might be feasible to develop this supply by building a low earthen dam at the lowest point in laying down a temporary pipe line and pump, to the mission property.\n\nA number of water specimens were collected for bacteriological analysis, the results of which were reported as follows:\n\n**TABLE NO. 1**\n\nDate of collection - July 8, 1936\n\n1. **From Lake Athabasca at outer end of Fort Chipewyan dock**\n   \n   Number of organisms per c.c. - too numerous to count.\n   Presence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination - Positive\n   Laboratory comment - plate count gives more than 3,000 bacteria per c.c.

Unsuitable for drinking purposes in raw state.\n\n**Sewage Disposal**\n\nDuring the summer months outside toilet buildings are used, one for each sex (Photos Nos. 7 and 8).

The\nbuildings are poorly lighted and maintained, and no effort has been made to use screens and prevent the entrance of flies.\n\nThe location of these toilets is such as not to endanger any source of water supply and the light sandy soil in their vicinity appears to be suitable for their functioning although chloride of lime could be used to good effect to reduce odors and partially disinfect the contents.\n\nFor night use and during the winter months pail type toilets are located at convenient points on each floor of the school, the contents being disposed of by emptying into the boy's outdoor toilet during the winter and being buried in a hole in the ground near the girl's toilet in the summer.\n\nGarbage Disposal\n\nAll garbage is suitably disposed of by being fed to the animals, much of it being boiled in a stock pot and given to the chickens. Other refuse and rubbish is destroyed by burning and there were no nuisances or menace to health observed in this connection.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n(a) Water Supply\n\nIt is recommended that Lake Athabasca be discontinued as a source of drinking water for the school during the summer months as the amount of local pollution to which it is subjected renders it unsafe for this purpose unless it is either boiled or chlorinated and filtered as well.\n\nIt would appear that the slough behind the mission could be further developed as a source of water supply by installing a summer pumping system.\n\nThe water of the shallow well also appears to be of good sanitary quality although possibly exposed at times to drainage from the stables and should be further developed for use during the winter months.\n\nFilling both of these supplies it would also be possible to put up ice and store it for use as drinking and culinary water during the summer time.\n\nAfter freeze up has occurred the water in the outlet channel of the lake is probably of safe sanitary quality so that it could be used as at present in being hauled from water holes. The provision of a pumping system for this purpose would hardly be practicable as it would require a heated pumphouse to protect the incoming ice and the heating of perhaps 3,000 feet of pipe line to prevent freezing up. It would also be necessary to remove this installation every spring to prevent loss or damage from drifting ice.\nSince Fort Chipewyan is situated within the Province of Alberta it is suggested that the Mission make arrangements with the Department of Public Health for frequent analysis of all water supplies used by them for drinking and culinary purposes.\n\n(b) Sewage Disposal\n\nThe present use of the outdoor pit privy appears to be functioning quite well in principle.\n\nIt is recommended that window openings should be provided for the toilet buildings to lighten the interiors and that the walls and floors should be frequently washed or painted white and always maintained in a clean condition. All ventilators, windows, and other openings should be fully screened to prevent the entrance of flies native to the vicinity and thus prevent the possible transmission of infection by this means.\n\nChloride of lime should be made available in ample quantities for dusting into the toilet pits in order to prevent foul nuisance conditions and also to disinfect the contents. Chloride of lime or other equally efficient disinfectant should also be used in all the pail type toilets located in the school.\n\n(SGD) A.H. Perry\nDistrict Engineer.\nPENSIONS AND NATIONAL HEALTH\n\nPublic Health Engineering Branch\nP.O. Box 1015, Vancouver, B.C.\nNovember 4, 1938\n\nREPORT ON A SURVEY OF THE SANITARY CONDITIONS AT\nTHE ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSION AT FORT CHIPPEWAN, ALTA.\n\nDate - July 7 and 8, 1938\n\nFort Chipewyan is an old trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company, situated at the western end of Lake Athabasca near the mouth of the Athabasca River. The white population totals about 100, together with several resident Indian families. From 200 to 300 Indians live in the vicinity and occasionally come to camp at the Fort when Treaty is being paid and also to trade and obtain supplies.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Mission is located just west of the settlement at the head of a shallow bay encircled by glaciated rocky ledges. It consists of a residential school for Indian children, the oldest part of which was constructed in 1874, a church, priest's residence, stable and barn and numerous other outbuildings in connection. During the winter months the school is occupied by about 100 children who remain there on during the summer months provision has to be made for adequate quantities of water for domestic purposes throughout the year.\n\nWith the assistance of one of the brothers examination was made of the sources of water supply and methods of sewage and garbage disposal.\n\nWater Supply\n\nThe main source of supply is from Lake Athabasca, being pumped during the summer and hauled on sleighs from holes through the ice during the winter. The water intake is situated in front of the school at the end of a wooden wharf, the intake line consisting of 1\u00bd-inch galvanized iron pipe with a foot valve. A small gasoline driven hand pump discharges the water through a 1-inch pipe into 5 or 6 concrete steel barrels in the kitchen. This water is used for all purposes including drinking and culinary in the raw state.\n\nDuring the winter, holes must be cut through the ice further out on the lake and the water hauled to the school on sleighs in the barges. The summer consumption is estimated to vary from 400 to 600 gallons per day and the winter consumption 200 gallons daily.\n\nThe level of Lake Athabasca is controlled to a great extent by the levels of the Peace and Athabasca Rivers and shows quite a wide fluctuation. This frequently results in the\npresent water intake becoming stranded and to overcome this, 2,000 feet of 1\u00bd-inch galvanized iron pipe have been obtained and will be extended along the base of the west side of the bay out to deeper water (Photo No. 4). This pipe has to be taken up before winter sets in to avoid destruction or loss by drifting ice.\n\nSources of possible sewage pollution are all of local origin. The Athabasca River is highly turbid during the summer months carrying in suspension considerable quantities of clay and sand. Though practically all the residents of the settlement use the common outdoor privy to the north of the lake shore, nevertheless which is near the surface drainage which may contain human sewage as well as dog droppings and other matter, is toward the lake with the drift towards the mission intake. The outer end of the boat dock is popular for bathing by children and consequently casual pollution may be expected from this source. (Photo No. 1).\n\nAnother possible source of sewage pollution is the Indian camps pitched on the bare rocks adjacent to the water intake area (Photo No. 4).\n\nIn my opinion the lake at this point is quite unsatisfactory as a source of drinking water supply during the summer.\n\nA second source of supply is a shallow well in the rear of the mission which is at the present only being used for the stables. This well is about 500 feet from the school kitchen and about 30 feet from the stables and at a lower elevation. It adjoins the gardens and fields used for hay and clover crops and is about the only available site for a well in the vicinity because of the light overburden on the underlying rocks. The well is about 4 feet square with the walls and ditch being lined with rocks. The low-lying stratum of impervious clay 10 feet thick overlies a waterbearing stratum of mixed clay and gravel. The top of the well is protected from surface drainage and a ditch between it and the stables carries off the drainage around it. There is both a small gasoline driven plunge pump and a hand pump which may be used to pump the water to the kitchen or stable. These are housed in a small wooden structure. (Photo No. 5).\n\nThis well is exclusively used by the mission during the breaking up or freezing over of the lake when the pumped supply is not sufficient. It is reported to produce an ample quantity although its use for drinking and culinary purposes has been objected to because of the taste which is somewhat mineral although not entirely disagreeable. The laboratory report on one specimen obtained was favourable. (Photo No. 1).\n\nA third source of water supply frequently used is a slough several hundred yards back of the mission which is removed from sources of human sewage pollution (Photo No. 6). This source of supply appears to be quite suitable for all domestic purposes but unfortunately the quantity available\nvaries considerably from year to year so that it can only be used as an auxiliary supply. It might be feasible to develop this supply by building a low earthen dam at the lower end and laying down a temporary pipe line and pump, to the mission property.\n\nA number of water specimens were collected for bacteriological analysis, the results of which were reported as follows:\n\n**TABLE NO. 1**\n\nDate of collection - July 6, 1938\n\n1. **From Lake Athabasca at cut or end of Fort Chipewyan dock**\n   \n   Number of organisms per c.c. - too numerous to count.\n   Presence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination - Positive\n   Laboratory comment - plate count gives more than 3,000 bacteria per c.c. All five 10 c.c. portions and one of five 1.0 c.c. portions show E. coli of intestinal type.\n\n2. **Shallow well at Roman Catholic Mission**\n   \n   Number of organisms per c.c. - 20\n   Presence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination - Negative\n   Laboratory comment - this water appears to be of good quality and shows no evidence of unfavourable contamination in standard samples tested.\n\n3. **Slough in rear of Roman Catholic Mission**\n   \n   No. of organisms per c.c. - 400\n   Presence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination - Negative\n   Laboratory comment - this water appears to be of good quality and shows no evidence of unfavourable contamination in standard samples tested.\n\n4. **Water Intake, Lake Athabasca, at Roman Catholic Mission**\n   \n   Number of organisms per c.c. - 500\n   Presence of organisms indicating unfavourable contamination - Positive\n   Laboratory comment - E. coli of intestinal type in all tubes of standard samples. Unsuitable for drinking purposes in raw state.\n\n**Sewage Disposal**\n\nDuring the summer months outside toilet buildings are used, one for each sex (Photos Nos. 7 and 8). These are frame structures erected over dug pits and have a number of rows of stalls in each with seats having no covers. The\nbuildings are poorly lighted and maintained, and no effort has been made to use screens and prevent the entrance of flies.\n\nThe location of these toilets is such as not to endanger any source of water supply and the light sandy soil in their vicinity appears to be suitable for their functioning although chloride of lime could be used to good effect to reduce odors and partially disinfect the contents.\n\nFor night use and during the winter months pail type toilets are located at convenient points on each floor of the school, the contents being disposed of by emptying into the boy's outdoor toilet during the winter and being buried in a hole in the ground near the girl's toilet in the summer.\n\nGarbage Disposal\n\nAll garbage is suitably disposed of by being fed to the animals, much of it being boiled in a stock pot and given to the chickens.

The provision of a pumping system for this purpose would hardly be practicable as it would require a heated pump house set up over the channel ice and the heating of at least 3,000 feet of pipe line to prevent freezing up. It would also be necessary to remove this installation every spring to prevent loss or damage from drifting ice.\nSince Fort Chipewyan is situated within the Province of Alberta it is suggested that the Mission make arrangements with the Department of Public Health for frequent analysis of all water supplies used by them for drinking and culinary purposes.\n\n(b) Sewage Disposal\n\nThe present use of the outdoor pit privy appears to be functioning quite well in principle.\n\nIt is recommended that window openings should be provided for the toilet buildings to lighten the interiors and that the walls and floors should be frequently whitewashed or painted white and always maintained in a clean condition.

Chloride of lime or other equally efficient disinfectant should also be used in all the pail type toilets located in the school.\n\n(SGD) A.H.

Residential school, which reached me in good condition.\n\nThe actual building of our school of Fort Chipewyan, being in a condition of continual deterioration, I decided to begin the construction of a new one, trusting on the help of some friends, to help us covering the expenses it will involve. We fully realize that in the present conditions it is rather difficult for the Department to contribute the amount referred to in our previous correspondence.\n\nThe new building will be built in interlocking tiles which will make it practically fireproof; and we hope that it will be completed in two years, unless unforeseen difficulties would arise.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

This is a Church-owned school. Fort Chipewyan is in the Athabasca Agency. This Agency has an Indian population, according to the last census, of 1363, all of whom are listed as Catholics, and 294 Indians between the ages of 7 and 16 inclusive. The Holy Angels School is the only Indian school in this Agency with the exception of a small Indian day school at Fort Smith. This school has at this date an enrolment of 8 pupils.\n\nIn view of the decision reached about a year ago that the pupil enrolment at residential schools would not be increased at any time in the immediate future, I feel prompted to bring Archbishop Breynat's letter to your personal attention in order that no misunderstanding may arise in respect to the construction of this school. In this connection may I refer to my memorandum to you dated October 30, 1939.\n\nRAH Director.\nMission Saint-Isidore\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\n\nJune 10 1941\n\nR.A.

This is what we have at our schools of Fort Resolution and Aklavik, and so far the Department have seen no inconvenience.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to give this matter your favorable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nArchbishop of Garella,  \nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie.\nOttawa,\nAugust 19, 1941.\n\nDear Archbishop Breynat:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the height of the ceilings in the children's wings of the plan recently forwarded to you in connection with the work being undertaken at the Holy Angels Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware the Department has always endeavoured to provide 500 cubic feet of air space for each pupil in a dormitory. In lowering the height of the walls the cubic air space will be reduced and the number of pupils who can be accommodated will be lessened.\n\nIn view of the climatic conditions in the locality, however, the Department is not prepared to raise any objections to your suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

J. Serrurot, O.M.I., Bursar of the R.C. Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie, visited the Department this summer and on behalf of Archbishop Breynat pointed out that the animals mentioned on the account were extremely necessary. Father Serrurot stated that the Archbishop was having considerable difficulty in financing the school, due to the cut in the per capita allowance, and pointed out that the purchase of the horses would enable them to procure wood more easily and that the purchase of the bull was necessary in order to increase the herd and thereby have milk available in larger quantities for the pupils. Reports that have been received indicate that good work is being done at the Holy Angels School and in view of the strong representations made by Father Serrurot on behalf of Archbishop Breynat he was authorized to purchase the animals. It is hoped that you will find it possible to approve the issue of a purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nWill you please refer to your memoranda of the 26th September and October 8th in reference to the approval of the purchase of two horses and one bull for the Holy Angels Residential School at Fort Chipewyan, Alberta.\n\nIn view of the fact that Father Serrurot was authorized to purchase the animals, the minister approved of the account being paid. He inquired, however, the reason why authority was given to the church authorities to make the purchase before the principle was discussed with this office. He does not think that as a general rule purchases of this kind should be borne by the Department.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, October 14, 1941.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO R.C.

It is unnecessary to add that before these invoices can be accepted for payment by the Treasury they must be accompanied by the purchase order.\n\nThe Director is in receipt of a memorandum from Mr. C. W. Jackson, Chief Executive Assistant, dated September 12, 1942, in which Mr. Jackson states:\n\n\"Will you please note the attached memorandum I have received from the Purchasing Agent, in reference to the purchase of certain electric lighting equipment for the Holy Angels School at Fort Chipewyan at a cost of $2,065.68. I have had an opportunity of going over your file and it would seem quite clear that the church authorities needed to purchase this equipment without requiring any authority from your branch to do so. It is noted in Father Serrurot's letter of the 20th July that the purchase was made at least prior to May 21st, for he stated in this letter that he had invoices of this date in his possession. While it is true that Father Serrurot advised you in his letter of the 25th April that some of these funds were set aside for purchasing an electric power plant for Fort Chipewyan, he was never advised that the Department would approve of the purchase being made. If the requisition had been forwarded to this office, as is the usual procedure, I am sure the Minister would not have approved of it without first assessing the reason why this substantial purchase was being made in war-time. There is no information on file to show why the existing equipment could not have been repaired and used until the war was over.\n\nUnder the circumstances, therefore, in view of the fact that no authority was given to the Church to make the purchase, the Minister suggests they should be advised that they will have to look after the account themselves.\n\nThe Minister approves of the expenditures that are made for the school at Aklavik amounting to $675.88.\n\nIn view of the above decision, I am returning herewith the Bruce Robinson Electric accounts amounting to $2,065.68.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar, R.C. Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie,\nFort Chipewyan, Alberta.\nOctober 12, 1942.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt., of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRef.: Your file 154-1-6\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 21st ultimo addressed to the undersigned at Fort Chipewyan has been forwarded to Edmonton but unfortunately, owing to very slow mail connections at that point, has not reached Edmonton until today. It is this morning only that your letter and its enclosures were delivered here.\n\nTwo days ago, I wrote you in connection with the account to be paid to the Bruce-Robinson Electric Co., Ltd. At the time I was unaware that you had written me on the 21st of September concerning this account. In view of the abovementioned letter, I would request you to ignore my letter of the 10th instant, since you give me all desired information in your letter received today.\n\nWhile we thank you for having approved of the expenditures that have been made for the school at Aklavitik amounting to $678.88, at the same time we are quite surprised to learn that Mr. C.W. Jackson does not approve of the expenditures made for lighting equipment at Fort Chipewyan. It seems that Mr. Jackson is not aware that we have built a new school at Fort Chipewyan during the summer and consequently that there was and there is no lighting equipment of any kind in that new school. How then could we have repaired and used the existing equipment until the war would be over?\n\nIt must be pointed out also that we are not asking for special and supplementary funds for that purpose but that we only asked for having funds allotted for other schools located within the Mackenzie Diocese to be transferred to the two schools at Aklavitik and Fort Chipewyan. The Honourable Mr. Crozier had authorized this transfer of funds on June last. Truly, we bought this electric power plant and lighting equipment before submitting our list to the Purchasing Branch, for the same reason that we bought the material necessary for the school at Aklavitik all of which expenditure has been approved by the Minister. We explained in our letter of June 20th last why we had to take this unusual step. We are absolutely certain that, even with permission from the Purchasing Branch, we could not have secured that material in July or later. We had every reason also to think that the Purchasing Branch would have authorized the purchase in the light of the very exceptional circumstances actually existing; not to mention the necessity of having the material delivered at the end of the season that is Waterways, before September 15th. We only can express our keen disappointment that a negative answer has been made in the case of the Fort Chipewyan School and we believe that, under such circumstances, we were...\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\n\nnot treated in the way that we had reasons to expect to be. We feel that our case should be submitted anew to Mr. Jackson who has probably not been entirely aware of the various circumstances concerning our request in connection with the new school at Fort Chipewyan and we anticipate an affirmative answer to our claim.\n\nThe writer is forwarding today to His Excellency Archbishop G. Breynat who shall be in Ottawa in the course of next week the whole file regarding this matter so as to enable him to discuss things more fully with your good self or with Mr. Jackson should it be necessary for him to do so.\n\nI take pleasure in enclosing herewith a snapshot of the new school at Fort Chipewyan which shows how the building looked from the exterior on August 28th last.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar, R.C. Missions of Mackenzie.\n\nENCL.\nOttawa, October 14, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend J. Serrurot, O.M.I., Bursar, R.C. Missions of Mackenzie, and also photos of the new Indian residential school at Fort Chipewyan, attached thereto.\n\nIn this connection may I refer to my memorandum to you dated June 17, 1941, and your reply thereto dated June 21, 1941? It would appear, from the evidence now submitted by Father Serrurot, that the new Diesel electric lighting equipment referred to in Mr. Jackson's memorandum of September 17, 1942, was not a replacement but was new equipment purchased for the recently constructed school. The old school was constructed in 1889 and has been for several years in a state of dilapidation. The new school is of fireproof construction throughout. It is 114 ft. long and 59 ft. wide. This memorandum is being submitted in response to the suggestion contained in Father Serrurot's letter. It is noted that Archbishop Breynat will discuss this matter with you at the time of his next visit to Ottawa.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, October 17, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. JACKSON.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated June 28, 1941, addressed to Bishop Breynat, and the Bishop's reply thereto dated July 16, 1941. These letters, you will note, are self-explanatory.\n\nEnc.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nNovember 6, 1942\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey:\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt this morning of a letter from His Excellency Bishop Breynat concerning the purchase of the electrical lighting plant for the Chipewyan Residential School and he desires that I should again approach the Department with a view to have the account for this purchase approved.\n\nI do not think it is necessary for me to again refer to the circumstances that made it imperative for the Bursar of Reverend Bishop Breynat's Vicariate to place the order at the time that he did and without obtaining previously the authority of the Department to do so.\n\nNevertheless, I might say that the Bursar was advised by the manufacturers that, unless the order was placed immediately, delivery could not be guaranteed. The remark that the old equipment might have been repaired and used until the war was over, has no bearing on the case as Chipewyan is a new school built with missionary funds and replaces a very old building which did not possess an electrical plant.\n\nFurthermore, as the Church authorities have expended $35,000.00 on the erection of this school and have received no grant from the Department, it would seem only reasonable that the electrical equipment should be authorized and paid for, even though it was found impossible to secure authority for its purchase before it was actually made.\n\nHoping that you will grant His Excellency's request, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nEDUCATION:\n\nI have no comments to make regarding the local school other than to note that the winter session is well under way. The Principal of the School, Sister Deslauriers is one of those particularly efficient teachers that one so often finds in the Sisters' Orders. I find that she handles the pupils with no small amount of discipline and that she conducts her classes and also those of her assistant with a definite course and a definite schedule in mind. I have had four years experience as a high school teacher and principal myself and I feel that I have some basis for making the statement, that on the whole the Department is being well served by the present staff of teachers at Chipewyan.\n\nThe outside construction of the new residential school is completed. The inside construction is being continued. It is expected that the building will be ready for occupancy in the fall of 1943. The building, of brick and tile construction, is a very radical departure from that usually found in the north. It will be completely modern in all respects. There is to be an infirmary of six rather large rooms; sufficiently large to hold four beds a piece.\n\nJ.

Rev. J. Trocellier, O.M.I., is now handling the work of the Diocese. He visited the Department last week. We carefully reviewed with him Departmental purchasing regulations and he agreed to comply with these in future. However, he made another appeal for the payment of the account mentioned in the first paragraph of this memorandum. He stated that the Church authorities have erected a substantial building and expressed the hope that the Department could see its way clear to reverse its previous decision.\n\nAt the present time the following amounts provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the schools in the Diocese of Mackenzie are unexpended:\n\nProvidence Mission ........$ 1121.00\nHoly Angels .................. 500.00\nFort Resolution ............. 900.00\nIn the event of the Minister deciding to allow payment of the account, it will be necessary to transfer funds from Providence Mission and Fort Resolution to Holy Angels and I enclose necessary submission to Council for this purpose. Transfer of funds to the Holy Angels Residential School was approved in the Minister's letter of June 2, 1942, but, of course, was contingent on the Minister's authority being granted for any expenditures made.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n\nNote: The correspondence mentioned above will be found on file 139-3-5 (Providence Mission Residential School).\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of McKenzie,\n\nADDRESS c/o Banque Canadienne Nationale,\nEdmonton,\nAlberta.\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\nMarch 31 | For allowance towards the salary of a night watchman at the Holy Angel's Residential School Fort Chipewyan. | $40.00\n\nThe arrangements with this school is that the Department allows $40.00 per month towards the salary of a night watchman from October 1st to April 30th.\n\nFort Chipewyan, March 31/43\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\nVoucher No. 224\n\nFort Chipewyan, March 31/43\nExtract from the minutes of a meeting of the Honourable the Treasury Board, held at Ottawa, on the EIGHTH day of APRIL, 1943.\n\nThe Board direct that treasury Board Minute T. 224602 B. of August 3, 1942, which authorized release of grants to church-owned Indian residential schools as provided for in Vote 167, Main Estimates 1942-43, be amended as follows:\n\n| SCHOOL                        | INCREASE IN GRANT | DECREASE IN GRANT |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Holy Angels Residential School| $1,565.68        |                  |\n| Providence Mission Residential School | $1,121.00       |                  |\n| Fort Resolution Residential School | $444.68         |                  |\n\nFor Secretary.\nExtract from letter of September 21, 1942, addressed to Rev.

May I thank you in the name of His Lordship Bishop J.Trocellier to look over again that question.\n\nAccording to our files in Edmonton, we don't see any request for the Aklavik Residential School for desks. We note that this item had been asked for the Holy Angel School, at Chipewayan, with the beds and blackboards. Perhaps a list had been sent directly from Aklavik and signed by the Principal of this institution. I may send a wire to ask if such thing had been done.\n\nWe would be please if the department is able to supply Beds and Matresses for the new Holy Angel School. The Parkill Bedding of Edmonton is able to supply such beds. The reference is #51. It can be supplied in 2,6 and in 5 foot size.\n\nMay I ask you if you did receive a letter from Edmonton in the last days of October, last year; this letter was signed by His Lordship Bishop Joseph Trocellier. It refers to these requests. In this same letter also was mentioned the item Lighting Batteries for Fort Resolution, Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease excuse me, Sir, if I refer to all this. It may help you to study these questions.\n\nWe must thank you for what you are doing for the welfare\nof these Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour very truly\n\nLouis Roger Laflamme\nO.M.I.\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC, LTD.\nFRIGIDAIRE, DELCO LIGHT, IRONCLAD BATTERIES, WINCHARGER\nLISTER-DIESEL, ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES, WASHERS\n\nCHARGE TO: R.C.

W. T. Most of the beds and desks were made here in the North out of rough wood over fifty years ago. Hence you can judge their present condition. Really they are worn out and unfit for further use in the new building.\n\nWe would appreciate it very much if the Government could supply us with the following:\n\n44 & 60 beds of standard size six feet by three feet complete with mattresses.\n\n10 school desks No.1 for pupils 16 to 20 years of age\n10 \" No.2 \" 12 to 16 \"\n10 \" No.3 \" 10 to 12 \"\n10 \" No.4 \" 8 to 10 \"\n10 \" No.5 \" 5 to 8 \"\n\nKnowing that you fully realize our urgent need of these furnishings I feel confident that you will lend this problem your kind consideration.\n\nWith cordial good wishes I remain\n\nYours very truly\n\nJ.

Rev. J. Trocellier, O.M.I., is now handling the work of the Diocese. He visited the Department last week. We carefully reviewed with him Departmental purchasing regulations and he agreed to comply with these in future. However, he made another appeal for the payment of the account mentioned in the first paragraph of this memorandum. He stated that the Church authorities have erected a substantial building and expressed the hope that the Department could see its way clear to reverse its previous decision.\n\nAt the present time the following amounts provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the schools in the Diocese of Mackenzie are unexpended:\n\nProvidence Mission ........$ 1121.00\nHoly Angels .................. 500.00\nFort Resolution .............. 900.00\nIn the event of the Minister deciding to allow payment of the account, it will be necessary to transfer funds from Providence Mission and Fort Resolution to Holy Angels and I enclose necessary submission to Council for this purpose. Transfer of funds to the Holy Angels Residential School was approved in the Minister's letter of June 2, 1948, but, of course, was contingent on the Minister's authority being granted for any expenditures made.\n\nPP\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1943.\n\nDear Father Lafleur:\n\nWith reference to my letter of April 21, I hope that you will have signed and returned the voucher before you receive this letter.

Stewart,\nAgent, Athabasca Indian Agency,\nFORT CHIPEWYAN, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you please ask the Department of Indian Affairs if they would supply the Boys' Ward with a tent 13x24 ft.? It is intended for both winter and summer use. At all times the boys enjoy going out into the bush for their lunch - especially their Thursday \"pancake lunch\", but this can be possible only if they have a little shelter. The tent would serve that purpose. In summer, some twenty or more boys remain at the School for the holidays, and unless they can establish their \"day quarters in the bush, they are not entirely happy, no matter how comfortable the place. If they had a tent under which they could retire against a too hot sun or a shower, their natural taste for life in the wilderness could be, at least, partly satisfied.\n\nThe donation of two such tents was made to our School several years ago, at the request of our Agent, but after years of most appreciated service, they have gone to ruins. As they had been a cause of general enjoyment for our little Indian pupils, we thought of asking for one to replace them.\n\nBegging you to kindly lay our request before the Department, I remain,\n\nSir,\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSister Marie Anne Deslauriers,\nprincipal.\nFort Chipewyan, April 12th 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing a letter received from the Principal of the Holy Angel's Residential School, Fort Chipewyan, requesting that the Department supply a Tent 18 X 24 ft. for the boy's ward of the school. Their reason for making this request is explained in the letter.\n\nAlthough the item was not included in our estimates for 1945-46 I would suggest that the request be granted if at all possible.\n\nJ.

The first one is that of $10,000 for the Chipewyan School. This amount is to be used for the installation of a water system. At the present time, two men are employed every day of the year, hauling water for this school. The cost, especially in Chipewyan, is very high and the service relatively poor due to the small quantity of water that can be drawn with the equipment on hand. During the war, nothing was asked for this installation but now that peace has again come to us, it is to be hoped that the Government will willingly contribute this small amount to complete the erection of this school.\n\nThis building has cost the Church well $100,000 and it seems only reasonable and justifiable for the Government to contribute at least 1/10th of its cost.\n\nThe second item is that of $3,000 for the Aklavik School. The improvement which it is sought to put in with this money, is necessary and should have been done several years ago but again war conditions prevented us from doing it. We hope therefore that you will also grant this amount.\n\nI hope that you will take into account the various remarks that appear at the bottom of the requisition sheets as they are all very essential to the proper shipping of the goods asked for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, November 7, 1945.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to amounts requested by Bishop Trocellier for inclusion in the estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47.\n\nI discussed your letter with Mr. Hoey yesterday, and we intend to include the items requested in the estimates. Of course, you realize that we have not the last say in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. O.

What I wish to know particularly, is whether we may expect to receive all those we ordered through the Government.

The increase in the number of pupils necessitates a greater number of standard desks, suitable for children from 8 to 12 years of age.\n\nWith best personal wishes, I remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\nBishop J.

His principal reason for asking for this arrangement is the scarcity of material and the necessity of speed in these purchase. The building season in Chipewyan is very short. The question of transportation is particularly this year, rather difficult to solve and it is only by acting quickly that the material can be had in time for this work.\n\nWould you be good enough, therefore, to talk this matter over with your superiors and let me know at your earliest convenience, whether it is possible to grant the Bishop's request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.A.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, May 16, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Holy Angels Indian Residential School,\nAthabasca Indian Agency.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $10,000.00 is provided for the installation of a water system at this school. It is the intention to obtain the water from Lake Athabasca, which is approximately three quarters of a mile from the school.\n\nA considerable amount of expenditure will be necessary for labour and some materials will also be required.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Trocellier was in Ottawa recently and requested that authority be given to him to proceed with the installation of the water system. He is prepared to engage labour and buy the materials required, on the understanding that the Department will allow an amount of not more than $10,000.00. He would of course supply receipted invoices for materials purchased and receipted paylists for the labour employed.\n\nThe season for doing such work at the Holy Angels School is very short and the Bishop would appreciate it if the Minister would give him authority to proceed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to R.C.Episcopal Corporation of MacKenzie\nAddress C/O Canadian Bank Of Commerce\nEdmonton Alta.\n\nDATE: 946\nSERVICE\nAMOUNT\n\nApril 30 For allowance towards the salary of a Night-\nWatchman at Holy Angels Residential School 40.00\n\nThe arrangements with this school are\nthat the Dept. allows $40.00 per month towards\nthe salary of a Night-Watchman from Oct To April 30\n\n76-01-102\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and\nthat the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the\nsame is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Accounts as shown on the attached statement which is a copy of the one you forwarded. If these accounts have been paid they should be receipted and certified by yourself. If any of the accounts have not been paid they should also be certified by you and we will issue the cheque direct to the firm concerned.\n\nb. Receipted Labour Return forms - it will be necessary to have labour returns prepared in duplicate and receipted by those employed. The names of the persons engaged in the work and also the dates during which they were employed should be shown. Under separate cover we are sending you a supply of Labour Return forms.\nThe total of the accounts and Labour Return forms should be $11,169.36 and as soon as these are received in the manner indicated above, we will be able to refund the amount of $10,000.00 which was provided in the current year's appropriation.\n\nIt is most important that the information requested in this letter should reach us at an early date as our fiscal year ends at the end of March and if payment is not made before that time the funds will lapse.\n\nIt will not be necessary to forward either accounts or pay-lists for the items mentioned on your second statement amounting to $4,171.75 as the Department can not consider payment of this particular account.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nWe are forwarding today the information we received from our personnel at Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, with regard to the installation of the water system at the Indian Residential School there.\n\nThe number of hours of work (last item on the list) were found to be calculated incorrectly, as regards the wages per hour, some being only $1.00. This brings the total to $3,156.00 instead of $4,791.00 as previously shown.\n\nOn the Labour Return Sheets, it will be noted that two signatures are missing, and the explanation is given as follows: Louis Jureczyk is at present recovering from temporary paralysis and could not sign. Duncan Flett is at present hunting and trapping far away from Chipewyan, and is not expected certainly before the 31st of March.\n\nAs regards the accounts, we received the following explanations:\n\n1700 lin. ft. spruce @ $37.00 M.: Invoice reads @ $26.00 M\n3% tax.. 2.08\nfreight from Waterways.. 5.00\nhauling from boat to school.. 4.92\n$37.00\n\nFrom other lumber listed on this same invoice (McInnes), we are told that 1,656 feet common spruce was used for work in connection with the septic tank. This item was forgotten in the drawing up of the original list, and at $37.00 M., this would come to $61.26 which should be added to the list already sent in.\n\n300 cedar shingles - these were already on hand at the time of construction, and the price has been figured from current costs at the time the work was in progress. There is consequently no invoice.\n\nThe same remark was made for the lumber listed as \"40 pieces, 2 x 4 - 12', 9 pieces, 3 x 6 - 8' and 2 pieces, 8 x 8 - 16'.\"\nThe 400 feet of insulation - no invoice could be found. The cost was calculated according to current prices in Ashdown's catalogue at the time of construction.\n\n2 rolls roofing - $7.50, plus freight from Waterways and hauling from wharf to school.\n\n1500 feet vitrified sewer pipe - no invoice found. Here again the cost was calculated from current prices in Ashdown's catalogue at time of work. (Likewise for the 6 elbows).\n\nThe box-stove was purchased locally for cash, and no record of the transaction exists in writing.\n\n50 sacks of cement - the cost listed includes freight from Waterways and hauling from wharf to mission-school.\n\nThe fittings included for the drawing up of this list are marked off on the invoice from Mould and Son. The total of the fittings amounts to $3,346.21. The freight charges on these fittings is figured as $224.21, leaving the total already given, as $3,570.42.\n\nFrom this invoice from Mould and Son, it is evident that if our personnel at Chipewyan had restricted their calculations simply to this single invoice, the total of which surpasses $10,000.00, they would have quickly reached the full amount of the grant.\n\nIt was our purpose, however, to give you a comprehensive view of the labor and various materials required in this installation, and we trust that the information we are forwarding you, will answer your requirements in this connection.\n\nAll the material mentioned in this letter and on the previous list has been paid. There are no outstanding debts of any kind with regard to any of this work.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChamberlain\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 4th, 1947.\n\nRev.

It is the intention to obtain the water from Lake Athabasca, which is approximately three quarters of a mile from the school.\n\nA considerable amount of expenditure will be necessary for labour and some materials will also be required.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Trocellier was in Ottawa recently and requested that authority be given to him to proceed with the installation of the water system. He is prepared to engage labour and buy the materials required, on the understanding that the Department will allow an amount of not more than $10,000.00. He would of course supply receipted invoices for materials purchased and receipted paylists for the labour employed.\n\nThe season for doing such work at the Holy Angels School is very short and the Bishop would appreciate it if the Minister would give him authority to proceed.\n\n(Sgd.)

It has been the desire of Bishop Trocellier, just as it was of his predecessors, to provide these Brothers with all the mechanical devices to facilitate and expedite their work.\n\nIn this connection, they are anxious to purchase precision light weight portable power chain saws for each of these four schools as the claims made for these machines are well substantiated by the testimonies of those who have purchased and used them.\n\nI am enclosing for your information several pieces of advertisement which you will find interesting to read and which will give you as well the information that your purchasing agent may require.\n\nThe price of these saws complete is $435.20 for the 18\" type model. This includes 1 extra chain at $19.00 1 filing tool \" 11.95 3 spark plugs \" 2.25\nThe Secretary,\nRe: Mech. devices, cont'd. October 11, 1947.\n\nThese prices are subject to a 10% discount if the order is placed by the Department.\n\nTo be of value these machines must be purchased immediately and shipped with the least delay possible so that they may be used for this winter's fuel supply. You will understand how necessary this is when I mention the fact that each of these institutions requires 400 cords of wood for its winter supply. A saving of one dollar per cord would easily pay for this machine, but the information which I have, and which our own Brothers are substantiating, leads me to believe that a saving of five dollars per cord will more truly result.\n\nI leave this whole affair in your hands and hope that you will see to it that as much speed as possible is used in placing the orders.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

I took occasion of my visit to go over their needs with the Principals. Whilst it is my intention to write a letter for each of them, there are three points which apply to all of them and to which I would like to call your attention:\n\n1. The electric plants consist, for each school, of only one 12 H.P. Lister Diesel Engine and four-kilowatt generator. These are very old and whilst they were thought, at the time of their purchase, to be sufficient in size they have been found in practice to be too small. It is not the purpose of the Church authorities to do away with them completely but they should be kept only as an emergency service and be replaced with 16 H.P. diesels and six-kilowatt generators. This applies of course to the four schools.\n\n2. These schools have no frigidaires of any kind outside of ice boxes. This makes the keeping of their meat, which is the principal element of food the year round, a very difficult affair. Moreover, such items as milk, butter and eggs are kept in cupboards which are not intended for that purpose.\n\n3. The laundry equipment in all these institutions is of the most elementary nature. There is no steam boiler, no wringer, no dryer, no flat ironers, and the four buildings all need substantial repairs. In fact I am wondering how the Reverend Sisters do so much laundering the year round.\nunder such conditions. Their washing machines are also too small and should be supplemented with either a large Domestic or a small type of commercial machine.\n\nThe purchase of the above equipment could be made by the Department itself or can be left to the procurator of Bishop Trocellier, who could render accounts for everything purchased after receiving authorization from you to do so.\n\nFrom information which I have been able to gather, the power plants would cost around $2,600 each, the fridgidares about $1,500 and the laundry equipment in the neighbourhood of $4,500. There would still be repairs to be made to the laundry buildings but I believe that this would not be very expensive as the buildings are now in use and only require such items as flooring and repairs to walls and ceilings.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your immediate attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, October 28, 1947.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 18th instant with reference to electric plants and laundry equipment for Holy Angels, Fort Resolution, Providence Mission and Aklavit Residential schools.\n\nIn our conversation this morning you stated that you would let us have the information regarding the laundry equipment so that we can arrange with the Purchasing Branch to secure this equipment in the current fiscal year.\n\nWhen preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49, careful consideration will be given to your representations regarding the supplying of the electric plants.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

As our three classrooms are filled to capacity, we have been forced to refuse children who were not 7 before Christmas; and we foresee a still increasing number for next year. Consequently we have decided to open a fourth classroom in September for the Primary Class.\n\nMay we ask the help of the Department of Indian Affairs to furnish that new classroom with desks - as far as it will accommodate Treaty Indian children?\n\nPresently, we have only 76 \"Government\" school desks: 36 received in 1934 and 40 received in 1944. Still the pupilage allowed Holy Angels Indian Residential School is 80. Moreover we must accommodate 25 Treaty Indian Day Scholars from the Fort.\n\nConsequently I have taken the liberty of putting in a requisition for 30 desks more. Although the chair desks of which we have supplied 20 for the third classroom are most satisfactory, we shall appreciate any kind that the Department deems suitable.\n\nWe would be much obliged if you would let us know at your earliest convenience what help we may expect from the Department in furnishing this new classroom.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Anne Deslauriers,\nSister M. Anne Deslauriers, principal.\nFebruary 11, 1948.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nWe have your letter of January 29th with reference to additional desks that you state are required at the Holy Angels Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, this is a church-owned school and we are allotted a specific sum each year for repairs and improvements and purchase of new equipment. The amount allotted for the current fiscal year has been totally assigned and consequently we have no funds on hand at the present time to purchase additional desks. However, we will give the matter further consideration after April 1st when our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 is available.\n\nWe were not previously aware that you were accepting some pupils as day scholars. We would appreciate it if you would let us have the following information:\n\n(a) Number of Treaty Indian children attending as day scholars.\n\n(b) Number of Treaty Indian children enrolled as residential school pupils.\n\n(c) Number of non-Treaty or white children enrolled as day school pupils.\n\n(d) Number of non-Treaty or white children enrolled as residential school pupils.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

To give you an exact idea of how our classrooms are constituted, I willingly submit the following analysis made at the close of the December term 1947:\n\n| TREATY INDIAN PUPILS | RESIDENTS ...... 74 | DAY SCHOLARS ... 22 | 96 |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----|\n| NON-TREATY PUPILS     | RESIDENTS ...... 20 | DAY SCHOLARS ... 34 | 54 |\n\nTOTAL NUMBER OF RESIDENTS .......... 94\nTOTAL NUMBER OF DAY SCHOLARS ....... 56\nTOTAL NUMBER OF PUPILS ATTENDING CLASSES ....... 150\n\nAll the Non-Treaty Pupils are of Indian descent. They are all Roman Catholics and wish to attend the Holy Angels School which is the only Catholic School of the region.\n\nIn this connection another trouble arises: I noticed in the Indian School Bulletin of November 1, the following statement: \"These (school) supplies are for Indian children only.\" It follows that, of our 150 pupils, 54 should not have received books and supplies from the School Store. I must say here that Non-Treaty Half-Breed children are, for the great majority, without resource - the few able to buy themselves scribblers, pencils, pens and ink, have been encouraged to do it; but they are the few. Another point is that these pupils are scattered in all the grades, and should they get their own text books, or should we get them for them from the Alberta School Book Branch of the Department of Education, these books would not be of the kind which the Department of Indian Affairs supplies and there would result two different kind of readers, etc., in each grade, a situation in no way advantageous to any class.\n\nWould you kindly direct me as to where and how to obtain the required books and supplies for these 54 Non-Treaty Pupils?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Anne Deslauriers, principal.\n\nN.B.

I am in receipt of a telegram stating that they are \"unable to locate any shipment of chair desks in May or June.\"\n\nThe error in the Purchase Order is probably the cause of this prolonged delay in getting this school furniture. As time is pressing - the classrooms will open on the 7th of September, would you kindly make investigations into the matter and have these desks directed to the Holy Angels Indian Residential School at your earliest convenience.

Henry,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of your telegram under date of December 31st, and we cannot understand what has happened to the invoices covering purchase orders 33504, 33693, 33624, 33692. We sent all these invoices direct to Ottawa as per the purchase orders some two months ago. However, they have apparently become lost and so we are attaching hereto copies of these invoices.\n\nYou will note that we have not included any bills of lading because this material was quoted F.O.B. Waterways which is the end of steel and we deliver direct from our Yard at that point. If we were shipping from Edmonton we could of course then supply bills of lading.\n\nWe might mention that about two months ago Bishop Trocquillier of the Roman Catholic Mission in the North West Territories said that he was on his way to Ottawa and he would O.K. these invoices on his arrival which we presumed had been done. Apparently this was either overlooked by him or your department did not have the invoices to O.K.\n\nWe trust that these copies will now straighten this matter out and that payment will be forthcoming promptly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAYWARD LUMBER COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGENERAL MANAGER\nMissions Catholiques du Mackenzie\nR.C.

I sent to him your first telegram, but as he may not have with him the accounts quoted in your message and in order that you may be able to pay as soon as possible Hayward, you will find enclosed the purchase Order for our four Indian Residential Schools of Chipewyan, Resolution, Providence and Aklavik.\n\nThis material was delivered last Fall, but too late to be shipped down the river so it was stored in the warehouse of the McInnes Co of transport. As far as I know, all this material is there. So I have signed the Purchase orders enclosed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Trocellier OMI\nBishop of Athabasca\nVic.

Phelan.\nRe: Freight Accounts on Laundry Machinery\nFor His Excellency Bishop Trocellier.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have found the two freight accounts of the Northern Alberta Railways Company for freight on the laundry machinery purchase for the Fort Chipewyan, Resolution, Providence and Aklavik schools. These cover transportation from London Ontario to Waterways Alberta.\n\nBoth these accounts were paid by Bishop Trocellier and a refund would certainly be in order, if you can obtain it.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, o.m.i.,\nDecember 2, 1948.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing freight accounts in connection with the laundry machinery, I discussed the matter with Colonel Eary and we are prepared to favourably consider paying the account from the funds provided in the current year's appropriation for the schools to which the laundry machinery was supplied.\n\nHowever, we find that both accounts are made out in the name of St. Gabriel's Hospital. Would it not be possible to have these accounts made out in the names of the schools to which the laundry machinery was supplied? This will avoid all questioning on the part of the Treasury Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Education Division.\n| Packages | Description                  | Numbers | Feet | Weight | Rate | Amount |\n|----------|------------------------------|---------|------|--------|------|--------|\n|          | EX HAYWARD LUMBER CO.

Neary, Supt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nJuly 19th marks a great event in the life history of the Holy Angels' Indian Residential School. It is the 75th Anniversary of the arrival of the first Sisters, who had come from Fort Providence, N.W.T., after three weeks on the water. We read in the annals of those days that after two weeks of scrubbing and general house cleaning, they converted an old shed into livable quarters where children could assemble for School. There were fifteen pupils for the first Teaching Day, August 1st, 1874. Some had come from the far off \"Caribou eating families\" of Pond du Lac, 200 miles west on Lake Athabasca.\n\nTo-day the School Register marks 1,300 names of children that have passed several years to our Residential Home during 75 years and the majority are Indians.\n\nI am pleased to send you and the Staff a snapshot of our new modern School, built in 1942. You will be interested to note the progress. There are four large, bright classrooms. It is supplied with electricity, running water, a steam heating system. The children enjoy spacious dormitories, recreation, and dining rooms.\n\nOn this great Memorial Day, the Teaching Staff feel confident that it would be a pleasure for the Department, through your courtesy, to offer something in behalf of the School, as an encouragement to the Sisters for their cooperation in the tedious work among the Natives for so many years.\n\nMay I suggest, for your donation, two Writing Desks with the Chairs for the Teachers. This would be a wonderful SUBSTITUTE for the actual primitive ones. Also, a typewriter, Remington, any size, or any kind you could dispose of, would be highly appreciated by the principal.\n\nThese useful gifts will be inscribed, to your credit, on the list of Benefactors, as a token of your satisfaction for the Education of the Indians in the far-off land of \"Kid Snow and Ice\".\n\nThanking you most heartily and the members of your Staff, for the powerful helping hand you have given us in the past, in order to promote civilization and education, and awaiting your further favours,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours gratefully,\n\nSister Olivia Lavoie,\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nJuly 12th 1949\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Holy Angels' Residential Sch. #755\n\n| VOTE | PRIMARY | OBJECT | DATE REQUIRED |\n|------|---------|--------|---------------|\n|      | Rev.

George Holmes, Superintendent, and the Rev. Charles Weaver, teacher. The Roman Catholic School is in charge of the Rev. J. Desmarais. The Department has no medical officer of its own at the settlement, but the required information might be obtained from the Church Society in Toronto, or at all events from His Lordship, the Bishop of Athabasca.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nE.F.Ward, Esq:\n\"Excalibur Life Insurance Co:\"\nof Ontario\nCorner of Adelaide & Victoria Sts.\nToronto, Ont.:\nSt Peter's Mission,\nLesser Slave Lake,\nPeace River District.\nDec 6th 1895.\n\nA.R. Forget Esq.\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith forward Returns for quarter ending September 30th '95. From them you will see how small the number of scholars were during the quarter. The chief reason for this is the great scarcity of fish at that season of the year. Even those on the Returns, few as they are, were to be had on bacon and flour, the latter we could afford, but the former is one of the most expensive of imported provisions.\n\n2nd, Some of the parents live far away on the lake and elsewhere and are unable to bring in their children at that season of the year, in fact while food is plentiful and the weather warm, it is very difficult to get them into the Home and quite as difficult to hold them once the snow has gone in the spring. All the power we have to influence them is, as Ministers and with that we cannot compel them to leave their children with us. With the exception of orphans\norphans or such as have only one parent, it is impossible to hold them through the summer, if we attempt it they would demand their children and we would plead in vain for them after that. Another thing they very strongly object to is the signing of any paper handing over their children for any length of time, the suggestion is enough to frighten them; they are very suspicious about paper and it is with very great difficulty they can be got to put their names thereon. In two cases only I have succeeded, one is Nancy and John Beaver Nos 027, and No 23 Nancy 027 is in for two years and No 23 for five. Will you kindly place these two on the support list instead of Nos. having left for good. No. is now too old and is being kept at home. The other case is that of a poor blind woman who gave me a writing as they call it, for her little daughter only two years old. Any new scholars that have been admitted tho have been promised for at least four years. We have now nearly the same number as last year, and in a few days we shall have 30.\n\nThe Indians make their fishing about 30 miles away and this year owing to the very mild weather, the lake has not been safe until a few days ago for either dogs or animals, consequently we could not support the full number of scholars.\nscholars.\n\nThe following is a list of the provisions required for the next 6 months, 6000 fish, averaging 3 lbs each, 200 bushels potatoes, 60 bus. turnips, 40 sks flour, 4 sks oatmeal, 1 chest Tea, besides about 300 lbs of beef.\n\nFlour costs $6.00 per sk here and every other article of provision in proportion, excepting vegetables, which are our own production.\n\nBesides all this there is Matron and Cooks salary, and the fuel and light. I can assure you we do all in our power to bring the children forward, and where we can keep them away from their heathen surroundings.\n\nWill you kindly forward to me the per cap-ita grant only and teachers grant to David Curry Esq., or as he may request you by letter.\n\nMr. Muller has never handed over a cent of the $100.00, you remitted him by mistake.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeo Holmes.\nSLAVE LAKE MISSIONS.\n\nRev. Mr. Holmes, Church of England missionary, arrived in town last Wednesday evening from Lesser Slave Lake, where he has been engaged over which Mr. Holmes presides are on Buffalo lake, a small branch off Slave Lake. The Roman Catholic mission is on the opposite side of the same lake.\n\nThe English church is a log building which is 24x30 feet in size. The school house is 24x30 with a kitchen attached. About 30 children board at the mission and attend the school there. The mission house is 18x26 and has two stories. There is also a wash house and stable. During the past eight years, in face of almost insurmountable difficulties on account of the hostility of the Indians who are Crees, 23 adults have become communicants. The work amongst the old Indians is very difficult of accomplish-\n\ning, but amongst the children the mis-\n\nsionaries find every encouragement.\n\nThey find them amiable and quick to learn. In addition to the usual educa-\n\ntion in the schools the boys are taught agriculture and the girls sewing and domestic duties. Many of the Indians have commenced raising potatoes which are well cultivated, while others plant their vegetables and there are con-\n\nsiderably to go hunting and fishing for a subsistence. Some of their gardens over-\n\ngrown with weeds on their return. The Hudson's Bay Company supplies the mission there. At Lesser Slave lake proper there are about 50 communi-\n\ncants. Mr. Holmes says Mr. Warner has baptized about 40 children. Mr. Curry is the teacher and Miss Durwell, matron. In the Indian village there are about 10 head of cattle and horses at the mission. Mr. Holmes brought with him an Indian, a thirty-three year old, who was taken into the mission house seven years ago and who attends to the stock. He was sent back to his tribe in Winnipeg and arrangements will be made for him to learn a trade there, probably shoemaking. Mr. Holmes re-\n\ngrets to have to complain that some traders take a liquid, in small bottles that they call \"ginger.\" This when drunk by the Indians intoxicates them and thus causes many ridiculous scenes. Most of these small bottles full will make a man steadily drunk who could be but little affected by a much larger amount of whiskey. A lot of it was given to the Indians near the lake on Sunday night, and the result was a most de-\n\nplorable scene of riot and drunk-\n\nenness. Also another matter requiring mention is the laying of poison and starting of fires. Many fur-\n\nbearing animals and several valuable dogs were poisoned last winter, and at the Landing a cow met the same fate. The Indians are very jealous of these things and look with the greatest suspi-\n\ncion on all strange white men, and they are very anxious not to be poisoned for fear they themselves will be poison-\n\ned. Mr. Holmes is very much afraid that there may be some serious trouble with the Indians. They are also getting discontented at so many white people coming in and thus depriving them of their means of subsistence. With the poison and fires laid by the whites and poisoning by the whites the Indians will soon be helpless. Fires were run last year all the way across the country to Lesser Slave river. Mr. Holmes left on Fri-\n\nday's train for the synod at Regina, although he had been called home in England on furlough for a year, the first in ten years. He sails on the Labrador on August 28th.\nOn the receipt of the Returns for the September and December 1896 quarters, it was found that the undermentioned pupils were in school:\n\nBoys.\n\nNo 1 Francois\nNo 3 Leo\nNo 4 James Wesley\nNo 5 Henry Wesley\nNo 6 James\nNo 7 William\nNo 13 Alfred\nNo 10 Mandese\nNo 16 Carlowitch\nNo 17 Joseph\nNo 21 Julien\nNo 23 Eugens\nNo 23 John.\n\nGirls.\n\nNo 02 Marie\nNo 09 Nancy\nNo 011 Mary\nNo 013 Eliza\nNo 020 Agatha\nNo 027 Nancy Beaver\nNo 032 Peggy.\n\nThe hope was then expressed to the Principal that he would retain these 20 pupils until they were discharged in accordance with the regulations with which he was already familiar.\n\nIt is found however in connection with the quarterly Returns sent herewith that during the September quarter 9 pupils were allowed to leave the school, and 11 new ones admitted during the December quarter. Department's letter of the 9th April 1896 is understood to imply that it accepts the statement of His Lordship the Bishop of Athabasca that \"the attendance must necessarily be fluctuating.\"\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir,\n\nI am forwarding the quarterly return of the Lesser Slave Lake C. of E. (St. Peter's) Boarding School for September quarter and beg to say that I agree with His Lordship the Bishop of the Diocese to recommend that this school be kept in operation for a while longer, when I hope he will have succeeded in obtaining support from the Provincial Government of Alberta; the attendance being composed entirely of non-treaty children.\n\nThe attendance during the quarter has been rather poor and the Department will have to decide what the remuneration shall be, keeping in view that the month of July is a holiday for all Boarding Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract:-\n\nTo the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\n\n239967\n\nOttawa.\n\nI also visited the Anglican Mission at Lesser Slave Lake and the Roman Catholic Mission.

Conroy,\nInspector, Treaty 8.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 26th February, 1903.\nEx'd.\n\nOTTAWA, 6th December, 1900.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 3rd September last, asking that you be allowed for an increased number of pupils at Lesser Slave Lake Boarding School, as well as assistance for further enlargement of the school buildings, I am directed to say that no change can be made for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. Geo. Holmes,\nSt Peter's Mission,\nLesser Slave Lake,\nPeace River District,\nN.F.T.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 3rd December, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRev. Mr Holmes of St Peter's Mission\n\nLesser Slave Lake, asks that the Church of England Boarding school there may be allowed the grant for 40 children instead of 20 as at present.\n\nPrevious to the 1st July last this school was receiving only $60.00 per capita, but since that date the grant has been increased to $72 a head, the uniform rate allowed boarding schools in Manitoba and the Territories. Mr Holmes says that he was advised by Mr Inspector Macrae to make this application as well as for assistance in the further enlargement of the buildings, especially the schoolroom, and a memorandum from Mr Macrae in connection with this application is turned out herewith.\n\nWith regard to Mr Holmes statement that there are a number of non-treaty children on the roll for whom he understands, the grant will not be paid, I beg to say that the attention of the Indian Commissioner was called to the ruling of the Superintendent General relative to the admission of non-treaty children to boarding and industrial schools, reply and Mr Laird's is hereunder. The Commissioner states that the difficulty complained of by Mr Holmes did not arise from the admission of non-treaty children but that he advised the Principal that the admission of\nof the children of half-breeds who had been granted scrip could not be authorized and that he should appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Territories for help towards these people if needed.\n\nThe requests for increased accommodation and grants to boarding schools already before the Department would provide for the placing in boarding schools of nearly all the treaty children in Treaty 8. The missionaries also wish to provide for non-treaty children in the neighborhood of the schools and well as the children of half-breeds who have taken scrip.\n\nAs stated in my memorandum of the 29th ultimo, boarding school requirements for Treaty 8, as submitted to the Department, would entail a heavy expenditure for very small practical results, at least for some years, and it seems to me that if the Department would make provision for orphans and children of that class, it would be doing as much as could reasonably be expected at present.\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant in regard to the grant for the Church of England Lesser Slave Lake Boarding School, and to say that in a letter dated the 11th instant, I advised the Principal that non-treaty Indian children, although not entitled absolutely to receive education in our schools, were on account of their difficult circumstances eligible for admission. That on the contrary, admission could not be granted to scrip half-breeds and that the Principal should look to the Lieutenant-Governor of the North West Territories for help towards these people, if needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 16th October, 1903.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd September last, asking that you may be allowed a per capita grant for an increased number of pupils for the Lesser Slave Lake Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that the same will be submitted to the Deputy Minister on his return to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. Geo. Holmes,\nSt. Peter's Mission,\nLesser Slave Lake,\nPeace River District, N.W.T.\nOttawa, 13th October, 1900.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Holmes, Principal of the Lesser Slave Lake Boarding School, has informed the Department that in a communication from you dated the 30th July last he was advised by you in connection with the grant for this School that it was to be understood that only children of Indians who had taken treaty are to appear on the roll. Mr. Holmes also states that he has a number of children from Whitefish Lake who have taken neither scrip nor treaty and that if the grant is withdrawn for that reason he is afraid the School would suffer as a boarding school.\n\nIn this connection I beg to call your attention to the ruling of the Superintendent General in reference to the admission of non-treaty children to boarding and industrial schools, the purport of which was communicated to you on the 12th November, 1896, under which ruling no deduction should be made for non-treaty children.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Oct. 12th, 1890\n\nSir,\n\nIn respect to the recent Mr. Holman's request for an increase of funds for his mission boarding school at Lower Slave Lake allow me to say that the Indian children of the district served by this school cannot be educated in day schools; that many seek education; and that it is necessary, as well as expedient, that a number of them, at least, should receive some education.\n\nThe intention of the treaty was\n\nThe acting Deputy Minister\nthat some measure of education should be provided.\n\nThe Dept. will not be tried for years to come to meet many of these treaty obligations that are (by treaty) made incident upon the Indians settling down on reserves and seeking a living by agriculture and it is their discrimination to settle which at once relieves the Dept. of the expense of meeting those obligations and makes any scheme of education by means of day schools (promised under treaty) impracticable.\n\nThe position created is that money which would be needed for expenses of settlement, and for maintaining day schools has not - and will not in the immediate future have been expended, and so education is needed and can only be given by boarding schools; it must be considered whether part of the money thus saved by the Indians discrimination to\nIt will not properly be extended upon the education of their children in boarding schools.\n\nIn my opinion it is best at least a part of it should be so extended and I am submitting a report of what it appears to me should be done throughout the treaty.\n\nPart of my proposal is to let the P.E. Church at Lower Slave Lake contract to educate 100 children and the Anglican Church there to do so that I would recommend that Mr. Holmes request be granted and that the next estimates prepared for Parliament should contain provision for that number.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nMemorandum for the Acting Deputy Minister.\n\nThe Revd. G. Holmes of Lesser Slave Lake under date September 16th, 1900, writes:\n\n\"The Whitefish Lake Indians have now got over their prejudice and are coming to offer their children again. We have already seven from there and are likely to have as many more. The Sturgeon Lakers too seem willing to give up their children.\"\n\nAnd under date September 12th., 1900.\n\n\"We have quite a number of the children from Whitefish Lake who have taken neither scrip nor Treaty. If the grant is withdrawn on the condition that we must have at least fifteen treaty children, I am afraid that we should soon have to close the school as a Boarding School.\"\n\nI may say by way of explanation that the Whitefish Lake Indians have not yet taken treaty.\n\nThe reason for this communication is that the Reverend writer has received a letter from the Honourable D. Laird bearing date July the 30th. last, in which occurs this passage. \"It must be understood that only children of Indians who have taken treaty are to appear on the roll etc. etc.\"\n\nI beg to have Mr. Holmes written to immediately, that he will be permitted to enjoy the grant for children of non-treaty Indian parentage, that the Honourable Mr. Laird be given the sense of the letter to Mr. Holmes.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo the Ministry of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nYou are doubtless acquainted, through Native School Reports, with St. Peter's Protestant Boarding School, Lower Slave Lake, which was established ten years ago, supported, for some time, by voluntary contributions from friends in Eng. Canada.\n\nThe building, which has been used for that purpose, up till the present, is only 24 x 30 ft., which, with from twenty-eight to thirty-four children, has been dangerously overcrowded.\n\nDuring my furlough in England, two years ago, I was able to collect amongst friends, sufficient money to enable us to erect an additional wing 22 x 34 ft., which will be completed in a day or two. This building is intended for the accommodation of boys, while the old part will be used for girls.\n\nThe ground floor of the new building will have to serve as school room, as well as boys' day-room, until the means are forthcoming to enable us to build a separate schoolroom, which is very desirable.\n\nOur only reliable means of support, at present, is the grant of $60 per capita for lonely scholars, kindly allowed us by the Indian Dept. This will barely supply the necessary amount of flour alone, for forty children (total number we hope to admit).\nincluding freight, which is $3.50 per 100 lbs from Edmonton.\n\nMr. Isaac Cass, who paid the last treaty dues to the school, advised me to apply to your Honour for an increase in the support grant, as well as for assistance for\u6dfb\u6dfb enlargement especially a schoolroom. The Little Fish Lake Indians, who are nearly all members of our Church, are actively dependent upon our Boarding School. The Sturgeon Lake Indians too are now willing to give up their children, but they are 100 miles from the nearest school. I think we have the first child from Sturgeon Lake in our school now.\n\nThere is, in this district, a sufficient number of children to fill half a dozen schools such as ours. The Roman Catholics, the Indians are so widely scattered that they schools are out of the question. Lesser Slave Lake is certainly the best centre for a Boarding School, especially, as the lake supplies an abundance of fine whitefish.\n\nI humbly trust that your Honour will be able to increase our support grant to forty scholars instead of twenty, to make us some allowance for a separate school-room privilege.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.S. Holmes,\nIncumbent of St. Peter's Mission,\nLesser Slave Lake.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith the Returns of the Lesser Slave Lake Church of England Boarding School for the September and December quarters of 1896.\n\nOn each will be found a note inserted relative to the blank forms inserted in the preparation of these Returns.\n\nWhen the grant for boarders at this school first became available the Principal was asked to select 20 whom he wished to be regarded as earners of that grant, this being the number provided for. He was also informed of the regulations governing boarding schools at other points respecting changes in the enrolment and was requested to conform thereto.\n\nIn July 1895 a dispersion of the pupils was caused by inability of the Hudson's Bay Co., through the non-arrival of its steamer, to furnish the school with the necessaries of life.\n\nThe Deputy,\nof the Sup't General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 6, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st inst., and in reply I beg to say that a cheque for the full earnings of the Lesser Slave Lake (C.E.) Boarding School for the September quarter has been forwarded to the Principal.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n(Copy)\n\nChapleau, Ontario\n\nTo The Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nDuring the interview you kindly granted me on my way through the city, you stated that the per capita grant of $72.00 would at the end of this fiscal year be withdrawn owing to the difficulty of securing the requisite number of treaty children. I therefore beg to apply for a transfer of the above grant from the Lesser Slave Lake C. of England Boarding School to our School at Whitefish Lake, now in charge of the Rev. W. G. White, where we have over 15 treaty children in school.\n\nWe have accommodation for from 25 to 30 scholars (boarders) at Whitefish Lake.\n\nShould be thankful to hear if this meets with Your Honor's approval and when granted.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, with kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(signed) Geo. Holmes,\nActing Bishop of Athabasca.\nSir,\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter just received from Rev. Geo. Holmes, Acting Bishop (C. E.) of the Diocese of Athabasca. The letter speaks for itself and I am well prepared to recommend the change which is suggested. The Church of England has a good foothold at Whitefish Lake, while the position of this church at Lesser Slave Lake is changed so far as Treaty Indians are concerned.\n\nThe change would not involve any extra expenditure, as a matter of fact, there would be some saving, since the Whitefish Lake is already provided for as a Day School.\n\nThis case is much similar to that of the R. C. School at Smoky River, which was transferred to Sturgeon Lake under the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 27, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., enclosing a copy of a letter addressed to you by the Right Rev. George Holmes, Acting Bishop of the Diocese of Athabasca, in which he asks for a transfer of the grant now paid the Lesser Slave Lake boarding school to the school at Whitefish Lake, where they have accommodation for from 35 to 30 pupils.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation that His Lordship's request be granted and you may have the arrangements carried out, and the Department will pay for fifteen pupils at Whitefish Lake at $73.00 per capita.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. MOLEMM\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nwaiting for admittance.\n\nA grant for aid children here would be adequate. With respect to these schools at Lower Slave Lake and Peace River, we desire to say that owing to financial difficulties, we cannot possibly maintain them unless grants are made.\n\nIt would be most regrettable, even lamentable, in the interests of the neighbourhoods concerned, if, in spite of all the unremitting efforts that have been maintained, we must after all abandon the schools.\n\nThe Matrons are supported by the Women's Auxiliary.\n\nI am, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Rev.) E.J. Robins.\nDiocesan Treasurer.\n\nThe Hon. Frank Oliver\nMinister of Education, the Interior.\nOttawa.\nHon. Sir,\n\nAt Lesser Slave Lake School:\n\nI enclose returns showing the number of Treaty Children attending the above school for the year ending June 30th last.\n\nNo provision has been made for these by reason of the transfer of the per capita grant to White Rock Lake, which of course does not affect Lesser Slave Lake.\n\nSince the transfer both place the number of Treaty Children at Lesser Slave Lake has increased. The number represented on the registers, as per enclosed returns, have been received in School, clothed, supported, and educated.\n\nWe therefore beg respectfully to make application for payment of the grant for the whole of a year to June 30th last.\n\nFurther we earnestly trust that the Department will kindly make us a grant for 10 children at least, in order that we may be enabled to admit that number. There are more Treaty Children waiting for admittance, but we cannot receive them without the assurance of the grant.\n\nAt Peace River:\n\nThe same conditions prevail at Peace River where four of the Treaty Children have been supported in our School for a period of one year ending June 30th last. These are the children of Protestant parents. Here also others are\nOttawa, September 30th, 1908.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn Mr. Oliver's absence I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant concerning the Lesser Slave Lake School and enclosing returns showing the number of Treaty children attending the School for the year ending June 30th last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your letter and enclosure will be brought to Mr. Oliver's attention on his return.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nRev. E.F. Robins,\nAthabasca Landing,\nAlta.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nSometime ago the grant to the Church of England Boarding School at Lesser Slave Lake was transferred to Whitefish Lake. The Very Rev. Archdeacon Scott still conducts in the old building at Lesser Slave Lake a school for half-breeds, for which he receives a grant from the Provincial Government. There have been, during the past two or three years, however, several Indians in attendance. Last year there were five in residence during the year and some others attended as day pupils. There are within two or three miles several Indian families.\n\nThe five Indians above referred to came a distance of twenty-five or thirty miles and Mr. Scott could not refuse their parents to admit them. He has, therefore, been at the expense of their maintenance during the year without any recompense whatever; he has even supplied the books, etc., that they use.\n\nMr. Scott is doing good work with these Indian\npupils and could get more to attend if he could afford to accommodate them. I was pleased to see that they were able to talk English quite well, and I think the Department should try to do something to help him. If it were possible to give him a liberal day school grant I am sure he would be quite satisfied, and I would beg to recommend that the Department do this, if possible.\n\nInspector of Treaty No. 8.\n\nP. S. A somewhat similar condition exists at Peace River, but there are not so many Indian children in residence. A grant as above recommended would be some recognition of the work done, provided the Department is not disposed to allow a boarding school per capita grant.\nOttawa, November 23rd, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 21st of September, last, in which you asked for a per capita grant for the maintenance of a number of Indian children, who have been in residence in the school conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church at Lesser Slave Lake, I beg to say that as the boarding school grant formerly allowed at this point was transferred to White Fish Lake the Department is not prepared to renew a similar grant at Lesser Slave Lake. However, in view of the work which is being done for the Indians in the neighborhood, the Department is prepared to pay the present maximum grant allowed for day schools in the West, that is $500.00 per annum, to take effect from the beginning of the present fiscal year, April 1st, last, upon receipt of returns showing the actual attendance of Indian children as taken from the register of the school. A supply of forms for this purpose will be sent you under separate cover. The Department will also supply the necessary books and stationery for the use of the Indian pupils if you will send in a requisition for the necessary articles. This grant is conditional upon all the Indian children in the neighborhood having the privilege of attending the school.\n\nThe matter of a grant at Peace River will have to stand over for future consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. MOLAN\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. F. Robins,\nAthabasca Landing, Alta.\nOttawa, November 25th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to the Department's letter of the 23rd instant I beg to say that the return received from the White Fish Lake School will be sufficient for the quarter ending June 30th, last, and it will only be necessary to forward a return covering the September quarter. A cheque will be sent you for the June quarter. In future you will be good enough to send these returns through the Agent, Dr. Donald.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. F. Robins,\nAthabasca Landing, Alta.\nSt. Peters Mission,\nLester Place, Alta.,\nDec. 14th, 1898.\n\nThe Indian Dept. at Ottawa:\n\nWrite to inform you that we have in our Mission School here (Church Mission) twelve children who are \"treaty Indians\" or \"Kinoseo's Band.\" Some of them are from \"Cuckoo Creek\" or \"Mowat's Reserve,\" and some are from \"Drift Pile River\" or \"Kinoseo's Reserve.\" These children have been in the school since early in October.\n\nLast year we had eight of these children in our school but for which we received no assistance from your Department.\n\nI now write humbly asking the Department to carefully consider our claim for assistance in the education of these \"treaty\" children. I may say that all these children are well cared for in our boarding school, and are making good progress in their studies, as well as learning to speak English. This is well demonstrated to all observers. This Doctor Donald, the Indian Agent here can fully endorse.\nAnd I understand that he has written your department with respect to this matter.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th ult., asking for a grant towards the maintenance of the Church of England Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that this matter was brought to the attention of the Department in November, last, and on the 23rd of that month Rev. Mr. Robins, of Athabasca Landing, was informed that the Department would make a grant of $500.00 per annum from April 1, last, upon receipt of the usual returns. Probably before this date you have heard from that gentleman.\n\nTrusting that this action on the part of the Department will prove satisfactory,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nS.

In the selection of pupils preference should be given to orphans and the children of parents in destitute circumstances. Pupils must be admitted in the regular way, i.e., applications are to be filled in by the parents or guardians on the proper forms, a supply of which will be sent you under separate cover and which you will be good enough to distribute to the principals as occasion may require. You should warn the principals that no children showing signs of tuberculosis or scrofula are to be enrolled, as it would be a difficult matter to have the children examined by a medical man the Department will have to rely upon the Principals for this information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The Department does not pay the grant for any in attendance over the number stated. Orphans and destitute Indians should have the preference as grant earners.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. B. L. Donald, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nLesser Slave Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with which you enclosed accounts from St Martin's Mission, Wabiscow, for the maintenance thereof or Indian widows and children reported to be destitute; and in reply I beg to say that the amount of the accounts in question is greatly in excess of the amount heretofore paid by the Department for the maintenance of such persons at the Mission, nor do the estimates provide funds for the maintenance of such a large number of children.\n\nIt would seem that the Department is being asked to maintain at the Mission those children who have been brought there but for whom a per capita school grant cannot be asked, owing to the fact that the school is already receiving a grant for the full number of pupils allowed under the grant system.\n\nAs pointed out to you in letter of the 19th May (Pyle 12386/1) preference should be given to orphans and the children of parents in destitute circumstances, when pupils for the school are being selected. This is the class of children which should compose the grant earners at the school. If the school authorities bring into the Institution children over and above the number provided for, and if these children are the offspring of Indians in fairly prosperous circumstances they can not be regarded as dependent in any way upon the Department.\n\nW.B.L. Donald, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nLesser Slave Lake, Alta.\nBefore dealing with the question of the payment of the accounts received the Department requires further information from you on the points indicated. The Department will not consider payment of maintenance of children who are not destitute. So far as possible all destitute children should be enrolled as pupils, but the stipulated number of grant earners should not be exceeded. Payment will only be made for destitute children who can not be enrolled as grant earners.\n\nThe accounts should have reached the Department early in April to be paid from the appropriation for 1908-1910, during which year the expenditure was incurred. It seems part of your duty to see that all accounts are presented for payment at the proper time. You should collect the accounts at Treaty payment time, and forward them to the Department.\n\nThe Department expects you to provide for all necessary expenditure in connection with the maintenance of Indian children and widows when preparing your next estimates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Three of them have recently been transferred from Christchurch school on the Peace River, which I regret to say I have been obliged to close owing to financial stringency. I think it would be a wise thing as these Treaty children should be earning the grant per capitum, to give this school the status of an Indian boarding school, and shall be glad if you will kindly permit this to be so. I am very anxious to maintain the Indian Boarding schools and the other schools, which have not that standing, but to which Indians and Half-breeds are admitted, but the heavy responsibility of the upkeep becomes so great, that I am compelled to look carefully into the possibilities of receiving increased help.\n\nI have written Mr Laird on the matter intimating that I hope his feeling in the matter coincides with my own, and knowing, as I do, from personal contact with yourself and your Department, the careful attention you are ever ready to bestow on the welfare of these poor Indian children I feel confident that you will give the most careful consideration to my suggestion.\n\nBelieve me, Yours very faithfully\n\nEdwin J.

Robins, Bishop of Athabasca, has applied for the re-establishing of the Church of England school at Lesser Slave Lake as a boarding school.\n\nThis school is at present being conducted as a day school and receives a grant of $500.00 per year for the teacher's salary.\n\nThis school was up to the year 1908 conducted as a boarding school, towards which the Department paid a grant of $72.00 per capita for 25 children, but upon the opening by the church authorities of a school at Whitefish Lake the grant was transferred at the request of the church authorities to that school and the school at Lesser Slave Lake has been conducted as a day school since that time.\n\nThe Bishop states that they now have eight treaty Indian children in residence and asks that the Department allow the usual per capita grant for them and that the school be given the status of a boarding school. This\nschool is situated in what is known as the Northern Division and a grant of $125.00 per capita is allowed for schools in this division. One of the reasons why the church authorities asked that the grant formerly given this school be transferred to Whitefish Lake was the difficulty in securing pupils. There are no special funds provided for the paying of a per capita grant to this school.\n\nI should like to be advised as to what reply should be made to Bishop Robins.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 4, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Athabasca has applied for the re-establishment of the Church of England Boarding School at Lesser Slave Lake. The Department has decided to accede to this request and from the first of the current quarter, January 1st, 1915, payment of a per capita grant will be made at the rate of $125.00 upon receipt of the usual returns of attendance.\n\nIn the recruiting of pupils for this school preference should be given to orphans and the children of parents in destitute circumstances. You will be good enough to instruct the Principal to forward applications and certificates of health for the eight treaty Indian children whom the Bishop of Athabasca states are now in residence at the school.\n\nThe Department will continue to recognize the boarding school at Whitefish Lake, but the aggregate number of grant earners at both these schools for which the Department will pay a per capita grant is not to exceed twenty-five.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. B. L. Donald, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, applying for an increase in the pupilage of the Lesser Slave Lake and Whitefish Lake Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that from April 1, 1924, the Department will provide funds for a combined pupilage of 40 at these two schools.\n\nOwing to lack of funds we are unable to increase the pupilage until the date mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The buildings which constitute these schools were built by the Church many years ago, and have long since become out of date.

Our Commission, however, after taking into consideration the desire of your Department not to establish any new institutions until those in existence had been fully modernized and placed on a satisfactory working basis, agreed with the full approval of our General Secretary, to give priority of claim to the new School in northern Alberta, to take the place of the three existing institutions already referred to. They further instructed me to inform you that, in their opinion, the best site for the proposed new School would be\non the ground now occupied by St. Peter's School at Lesser Slave Lake. They were also of the opinion that the School should have a capacity of not less than 60 pupils, and that it should be built during the coming summer as the existing school buildings were no longer safe for habitation.\n\nI am leaving the City tomorrow and will be absent for about two weeks on a visit to our Society's Schools in southern Alberta, and at other centres, but will be very glad to furnish any further information you may desire immediately after my return.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nMISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA.\n\nNECESSITY FOR SCHOOLS MENTIONED ON SHEET 2.\n\n1.

Renison, D.D.,\nBishop of Athabasca, called on me yesterday and among\nother things referred to three schools which he\nthought at some convenient time might be consolidated\nand a new school built. The schools in question are\nSt. Peters at Lesser Slave Lake; Whitefish Lake; and\nWabasca. He stated that the Church was prepared to\npool all their resources in conjunction with the\nDepartment for the carrying out of our work.\n\nThe Bishop's address is Bishop's\nHouse, Peace River, Alberta.\n\nYou might make a note of this for\nfuture reference.\n\nActing D.S.G.I.A.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been instructed to inform you of the decision of our Society to close St. Peter's School, Lesser Slave Lake from the 30th of June last, and to request your Department to authorize an increase in the enrolment at St. Andrew's School at White Fish Lake and at St. John's School, Wabasca, to at least 30 pupils each. Without entering fully into detail with regard to the circumstances which necessitated this action on the part of our Society, I may state that it was prompted chiefly by the difficulty in meeting the expenditure involved in the maintenance of three small schools, and especially so since a 10% reduction has been made.\n\nYou will recall that, for a number of years past, the question of the consolidation of the Lesser Slave Lake, the White Fish Lake, and the Wabasca Schools, has been under consideration, but without any definite and decisive action being taken. It is still the hope and expectation of our Society that one or two new and fully modern residential school buildings may be provided by your Department to preserve and extend the work which has been carried on so long in the three buildings erected by our Church in that part of Alberta. Until funds are available for this, it is the purpose of our Society to maintain the work at the White Fish Lake and Wabasca centres, and those responsible for the direction of the Society's affairs keenly desire to have your fullest possible cooperation in connection with the same.\n\nAs the sanctioned enrolment of 40 pupils between the Lesser Slave Lake and White Fish Lake Schools, and of 25 pupils at the Wabasca School, or 65 pupils in all, will be reduced to 60 pupils by sanctioning an enrolment of 30 pupils at each of\nthe White Fish Lake and Wabasca Schools, I can see no difficulty, apart from that of accommodation, why this arrangement should not be adopted, and I sincerely trust that it may be approved and sanctioned by your Department.\n\nThe difficulty of accommodation, so far as I am informed, applies only to the Wabasca School, and even there it does not appear to be insuperable. The Principal states that, if given material he can add a room to the main building by enclosing the space between the two projecting wings in front. I went carefully into this matter myself when I visited this School last January, and am able to endorse the Principal's opinion. If your Department will supply the material, the school management will be able to do the work. If the material is not provided, a grant of approximately $250.00 would be required to meet the cost of material and of freighting.\n\nAs it is proposed, as soon as the summer holidays are over to transfer to the White Fish Lake School, any pupils who would have been returning to St. Peter's School at Lesser Slave had this letter institution been kept open, I shall be obliged if you will give an authorization at the earliest date possible for the enrolment of 30 pupils at each of the White Fish Lake and Wabasca Schools, and notify me which of the alternative courses your Department decides to take in connection with the provision of the additional accommodation at the Wabasca School.\n\nI may state further, that the beds and bedding, dishes, cutlery, etc., now at the Lesser Slave Lake School can be distributed between the White Fish Lake and Wabasca Schools for the use of the additional pupilage, and I trust that your Department may agree to this arrangement also, and undertake to meet the small cost of transportation involved in the same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, August 8, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department of the arrangements that have been made for the closing of the Lesser Slave Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School as from June 30th, last, and requesting that a pupilage of 30 be provided at each of the Wabasca and Whitefish Lake C. of E. Indian Residential Schools.\n\nRegarding the request for the increased pupilage, I beg to confirm our night telegram of today's date:\n\n\"Reference your letter fourth instant in view of closing Lesser Slave Lake School Department will approve of per capita allowance for pupilage of thirty at both Wabasca and Whitefish Lake Schools.\"\n\nRegarding the supplying of the lumber required to provide accommodation at the Wabasca C. E. Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the local Indian Agent forwarded a requisition stating in detail the lumber, etc., required, and he has been authorized to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of same to the school, to an amount not exceeding $250, which is also to include the freighting.\n\nIt is noted that the bedding, dishes and other equipment now at the Lesser Slave Lake School will be distributed between the Whitefish Lake and Wabasca Schools for the use of the additional pupilage. This Department would pay the cost of the transportation charges involved in moving this equipment upon receipt of accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, with receipts attached for any transportation costs paid by your Society. If you prefer that the cost of transportation be paid direct to the parties who do the work, you should forward certified accounts in their favour, in triplicate, when a cheque would be sent direct.\n\nThe pupils now at the Lesser Slave Lake School can be distributed as considered advisable between the Wabasca and Whitefish Lake C. of E.

I telegraphed Dr. Westgate that more information was needed before any authority was directed and suggested that Mr. Indian Agent Laird telegraph what materials were needed with an estimate of their cost.\n\nOur representative has telegraphed that $1125 is required for the materials, freight and labour in the case of the Lesser Slave Lake institution. There is an item of $700 in the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year and I wish to recommend that Mr. Laird purchase the shingles, lumber, brick, paint and nails, at an estimated cost of $560, and pay for the freight which will amount to approximately $150. The school authorities will have to be responsible for the labour, amounting to $415.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE.\n\nAn order was placed for one sewing machine for the Whitefish Lake Indian Residential School and through error the Singer Sewing Machine Company forwarded two machines. Mr. Agent Laird has been instructed by official letter of May 3rd, 1927, File #131-10-5, to have the extra machine delivered to the Lesser Slave Lake C. of E. Indian Residential School.\nI visited this school on February 16th, and found 6 boys and 5 girls present out of an enrolment of 14.\n\nThree pupils did not return after the mid-summer holidays, namely John Belcourt, age 13, admitted in 1922, Maggie Belcourt, age 12, admitted in 1924, and Margaret Belcourt, age 9, admitted in 1926. These children were taken into the St. Bruno's Roman Catholic School without the authority of the Department, and although the Principal has been notified by the Department to send the children back, he has not done so. The mother of these children was educated at St. Peter's School, and it is her desire that her children remain in that school. It is claimed that the children were baptised Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Principal of St. Bruno's has, in my opinion, taken an unfair and arbitrary attitude in this matter, and in view of the circumstances, I feel that the Department would be well advised in insisting that their instructions are carried out.\n\nMr. W. F. Kent is in charge as Principal and acts as teacher, Miss Allan, matron, Miss Halerow, cook, and Mr. Rawlings, outside man.\n\nThe original school building was built with logs about thirty-five years ago, and is now in very poor condition. The bottom logs have rotted causing the building to settle.\nto settle and warp, with the result that the floors are very uneven and the windows and doors out of line. A frame addition was added twenty-five years ago; the ground floor of this addition provides a classroom 22' x 34' with a 12 ft. ceiling. The upstairs is used as a dormitory for the boys. The old part of the building provides a dining room, kitchen, girls' dormitory, storeroom, and three small staff rooms. The boys' dormitory is 20' x 20' with a ceiling from 3 to 7 ft. high. Three windows provide ventilation and light. There were five beds in use at the time of my visit. The girls' dormitory is 21' x 24', with a 9 ft. ceiling. There are three windows and six beds. Ventilation is obtained from the windows.\n\nIt was noted that each child has his own individual towel, as well as a toothbrush.\n\nThe building is heated with box stoves with drums in the dormitories. Coal oil lamps are used for lighting purposes.\n\nSix Pyrene extinguishers are placed at convenient points in the building, and a 5 gal. extinguisher with hand pump is on hand. A ladder is placed under the end window at the outside of each dormitory to provide means of escape in the event of fire. The children are given regular fire drill.\n\nThe washing of clothes is done in the kitchen, and in the winter months the dining and other rooms are used as a place for drying the clothes. I found the school clean throughout, and can understand that, owing to the rough and uneven floors, it is not an easy task to keep this building in good order.\n\nTwo - 45 gal.\nST. PETER'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (C.ofE) Cont'd.\n\nTwo - 45 gal. barrels are used for water storage purposes. Their water supply is hauled in barrels from the lake.\n\nThere is no doubt but that these old buildings have served their purpose and will soon have to be replaced if the school is to be continued at this point.\n\nSeparate outside toilets are provided for the boys and for the girls. I found these toilets in a cleanly condition.\n\nI saw the children at their mid-day meal, and noted that they are given plenty of wholesome food.\n\nSeven milk cows are kept, which is plenty for their requirements.

The representative of the Department of Public Works, Chief Architect's Branch, who made the inspections was accompanied by Rev. Canon Cook of the Anglican Missions.\n\nThe Whitefish Indian School and the various buildings were inspected and valuations have been placed upon each, with the necessary depreciation being allowed for the years which they have been standing. The total valuation placed on the buildings at Whitefish is shown as $19,927.65. A copy of the valuation for each building is enclosed. I would particularly draw to your attention that there is no well at Whitefish, the water being taken from the river. No plumbing accommodation has been built into the buildings and no electrical services exist.\n\nAt Wabasca the valuations total $13,738.42. A copy of the detailed figures making up this valuation is enclosed.\n\nIn regard to the water supply, sewage disposal and electrical services, the same condition exists at Wabasca as at Whitefish.\n\nIt is my understanding that photographs were taken at both places of the various buildings by Canon Cook of\nthe Anglican Missions, and that he will forward to you copies of the photographs. If there is any other information you require on these buildings please let me know.\n\nThis report constitutes the last of the inspections and valuations which you had requested to be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

J. Dyke, Secretary of the Conference, the undersigned begs to report:\n\n1. That the sum of $700 is provided in the Estimates for 1876-7 towards the support of an Orphanage for the Indian children at Morleyville.\n\n2. To secure the lands claimed by that Institution, the undersigned wrote, as instructed by the Superintendent.\n\nTo the Right Honourable Sir John Macdonald G.C.B.,\nRight. General of Indian Affairs.\nSuperintendent General, on\nthe 29th August last to\nthe Department of the\nInterior advising that\nDepartment that the\nSuperintendent General was\nof opinion that a reasonable\nquantity of land should be\nset aside for the purposes\nof said Orphanage; and\na letter was received from\nthe Department of the\nInterior on the 4th September\nlast stating that Mr. Pearce\nof that Department had\nbeen instructed to proceed\nto Morleyville and discuss\nmatters with the representative\nof the Methodist Body at\nthat point respecting the\nland claimed for the\npurposes of the Orphanage,\nand requesting that the\nRev. Dr. Sutherland, General\nSecretary of the Methodist\nChurch, Missionary Depart-\nment, Toronto, might be\ninformed that this\nDepartment had assumed\nthat the application made for such land would be dealt with in a liberal spirit by the Department of the Interior. The undersigned begs to state that the General Secretary was duly informed of the proposed grant to the Orphanage and of the advice received from the Department of the Interior respecting the land appropriation in connection with the same.\n\n3. With regard to the establishment of an Industrial School at Battle River, the management of which the Memorial prays may be granted the Methodist Church, the undersigned begs to state that the sum of $20,000 was voted by Parliament towards the erection of two Industrial Schools during the year 1876-7 in the North-West Territory.\nTerritories. One of the Industrial Schools the Superintendent General is aware is to be erected at Long Lake. The other Institution the undersigned understands, is to be erected near La Salle and to be for the education of Indian female children. No provision was made for the erection of a third Industrial School building.\n\n4. With regard to the application that deeds and titles be granted for Mission property held by the Methodist Church at certain places described in the Memorial, the undersigned begs to state that in so far as Indian Reserves are concerned it is not customary to grant Letters Patent for lands held for Church purposes therein; but the Department never interferes with the occupan...\nSuch lands so long as Mission work is conducted by the Denomination holding them on the Reserve. It would be obviously a wrong principle to grant deeds in fee of such lands, as should they change hands at any time, they might fall into the possession of very undesirable persons, which would be specially objectionable to the Indians and would cause great embarrassment to the Department.\n\nAs respects lands at any other points, the undersigned does not feel competent, nor does it fall within his sphere of duty, to express an opinion of the advisability or other of giving Patents in fee of said lands to the Methodist Church.\n\nH. Macdonald\nDeputy Commissioner\nIndian Affairs\nCalgary June 22nd 1886\n\nTo His Honor Governor Dewdney\n\nHonoured Sir,\n\nWe the undersigned deputation from the Methodist Conference do hereby express our regret that the arrangements for waiting upon your Honor could not be carried out owing to the fact that your Honor was suddenly called to Winnipeg. The deputation was not aware of your departure until their arrival in Regina; and having pressing engagements in the West, as well as not knowing the date of your return, could not await your arrival.\n\nTherefore we take the liberty of presenting the following subjects of our earnest request:\n\nSubjects of Memorial and Petition\n\nFirst: The deputation on behalf of the Methodist Conference urgently requests the Government to subsidize\nthe McDougall Orphanage and Training Institute at Morley; and also to grant to this Institution the deeds of the lands which it occupies and claims.\n\nSecond:\n\nThe deputation prays the government to grant to the Methodist Church the management and control of an Industrial School at Battle River similar to the institutions granted by government to the other churches.\n\nThird:\n\nThe deputation prays the government to grant the deeds and titles to Mission property held by the Methodist Church during periods ranging from five to thirty years, namely Blood Indians, Belly River; Morley; Woodville; Battle River; Victoria; Whitefish Lake; Saddle Lake; and the Missions north of Winnipeg viz., Fisher, Bear, and Nelson Rivers; also Oxford and Norway House.\n\nFurther we beg to say that the subjects of this Memorial are not the request of a few Individuals. The Memorial\nproceeds from the offices and members of\nthe Methodist Church in the Manitoba\nand North West Conference, and will\nreceive the unreserved endorsement and\nunited support of the entire Methodist\nChurch in the Dominion from its General\nConference which assembles in Toronto\nin September next; and which Conference\nrepresents nearly a million of Methodists.\n\nThe delegation knowing the deep\ninterest your Honor takes in the moral\nand material improvement of the\nIndians, is happy to express the hope\nthat the subjects of request herein\ncontained will receive that sympathy\nand attention, which your Honor from\nyour important office and great\ninfluence is able to give.\n\nSigned in behalf of the Manitoba and\nNorth West Conference of the Methodist Church,\n\n(Sg'd) J.

Wyke Secretary Calgary W.T.\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nNorth-West Territories,\n\nRegina, 5 July 1886\n\nI have the honor to enclose a copy of a memorial and petition signed by a delegation of clergymen and laymen appointed at a last meeting of the Manitoba and North-west Conference of the Methodist Church to wait upon me in reference to the undermentioned subjects:\n\n1st. Liberty to the McDougall Orphanage and Training Institution at Morley and to grant the institution the deeds of the land it claims.\n\n2nd. The erection of an Industrial School similar to those at Battleford, High River and Qu'Appelle.\n\n3rd. The granting of deeds and titles to mission property held.\n\nThe Rt. Hon.\n\nThe Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nby the Methodist church at the following places: Blood River, Morley, Woodville, Battle River, Nelson, White Rock Lake, Saddle Lake, and the missions north of Winnipeg, Fisher, Benson, and Nelson River also Oxford and Norway House.\n\nIn regard to the first I would recommend that assistance be given by the Government to the Institution at Morleyville on the same basis as that given to the institution at St. Albert. The school at Morley is doing good work among the Indians, and it is most pleasing to see the great advancement the children are making under the able tuition they are receiving. I think it would be well to grant them a title to the property claimed for mission and school purposes.\n\nIn reference to the second request I would strongly recommend the erection of an Industrial School in the Peace Hills District; I think Battle River would be a suitable location. There are between 500 and 600 Indians in this district, the greater portion of whom are...\nunder the influence of the Methodist Church. The religious tendencies of Sampson and his brother have been the most influential chiefs in the section are decidedly towards the Methodist denomination and there is no doubt the influence of their chiefs with their people will be exercised for the advancement of their religious sect. The Roman Catholic and Methodist churches have practically control of the missionary work in the Edmonton and Peace River districts and while the former have stations at High River to the south and St. Albert to the north to educate away from home the Indian children, the latter are at present without that privilege with regard to the third request.\n\nI have written to the Secretary the Rev. Mr. Byke asking him to submit to me a plan showing exactly what land is claimed as mission property when this is received I will put the matter to the Department for consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Murray\nJuly 12th, 1856.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Secretary of Public Affairs to inform you of a memorial dated at Calgary June 2nd, 1856, from the Manitoba North-West Conference of the Methodist Church signed by yourself, the Rev. J. Jackson of Ruby, and the Rev. J.H.

For several years this Institution has been doing work of the most valuable kind, which might have been greatly enlarged had the necessary funds been available. During two years a grant of $700 per annum has been received from the Department, a sum not only entirely inadequate for the maintenance of the pupils, apart from other expenses, but in very\n\nThe Right Honourable\n\nSir Dept. General\n\nof Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nsuggesting contrast with the amounts granted to other institutions doing far less work, and with (in some cases) less than half the number of pupils. It is believed by the Missionary Board that all that is necessary is to call the attention of the Department to the matter in order to have the grant to the Orphanage placed upon a more equitable basis.\n\nThe grant of a tract of land by the Department of the Interior, although a step in the right direction, does not lessen, but, on the contrary, greatly increases, the expenditure of the Missionary Society. The cost of fencing alone has already aggregated some $2000, and to provide the necessary buildings on a very modest scale, will require from eight to ten thousand dollars more. It is the conviction of the Board\nof the Board that this expenditure should be provided for, as in other similar instances, by the Department, and they strongly urge that a sum sufficient for the purpose be included in the estimates for the current year, together with a per capita grant of $100 for each pupil now in the Orphanage.\n\nThe intention of the Government, as stated in your favor of April 25th, No. 30,699, to establish an Industrial Institution at the Peace Hills, though most important, does not meet the case in regard to the work of the McDougall Orphanage. The latter will still be needed, and I earnestly hope that the Department will see the justice of placing it in a position to do effective work.\n\nAlthough the Orphanage is open to children...\nto children from any of the Tribes, the Mountain Stoney have thus far derived the chief benefit. These people were the staunchest loyal friends of the Government during the recent revolt, and yet very little has been done by the Department for their welfare. The present will be a good opportunity to show that the Government is not unmindful of those who stood firmly for law and order at a time when inducements to take a different course were very strong.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Dr. Luthersland, General Secretary of the Missionary Department, Methodist Church of Canada, again bringing before the notice of the Department the claims of the McDougall Orphanage and Training Schools to an increased grant, the undersigned has to report that, as stated by Dr. Luthersland, the McDougall Orphanage is at present in receipt of $900 per annum, which has been paid to it.\n\nTo the Honorable Thomas White\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs.\nfor the last two years.\n\nDr. Sutherland in a previous communication to the Department, stating that the grant be increased stated that an allowance of $100 per capita ought to be made for all the aboriginal children kept at the Institution.\n\nThe undersigned begs to state that in his opinion it would be well to place this Institution on the same footing as the Roman Catholic Orphanage and School at Port Albert stands on with the Department. That Institution has been allowed annually hitherto at the rate of $30 per capita for the pupils not to exceed fifty in number. It will be perceived that provided the Institution has the maximum number, the grant would in that case amount to $1500 per annum. Recently, however, the Superintendent General agreed\nagreed to allow $60 per capita to the St. Albert Institution,\u2014the increased grant to extend over the current year, and an amount necessary to cover the increased grant for this year has been included in the Supplementary Estimates to be submitted for approbation to His Excellency in council, as well as the necessary amount to increase the grant from $30 to $60 per annum for the next fiscal year in the regular Estimates for that year.\n\nThe undersigned sees no objection to the McDougall Asylum being placed on a similar footing, that is to say, that it be allowed annually $60 per capita for the inmates of the Institution, not to exceed fifty in number; and he respectfully recommends that authority be given for the necessary amount to increase the...\nthe grant to the above figure for the current year being inserted in the supplementary Estimates, and a similar amount for the approaching fiscal year in the regular Estimates of the Department for 1888-9.\n\nAs respects the application for a grant of $1,000 towards the building required for the Orphanage, the undersigned begs to state that no money has been granted to the N. Albert Institution for building purposes, and unlike the Superintendent General is prepared to recommend a similar grant to the latter Institution, the undersigned is of opinion that it would be injudicious to give a grant for building purposes to the Red River Orphanage.\n\nGreater both of these institutions are on sites the title to which has passed from the Crown, and it is questionable...\nquestionable whether Government money should be spent upon buildings so situated.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

The facts are these:\n\nOne of the boys in the orphanage has never recovered from the illness, and while all has been done for him that could be done under the circumstances, he continued to fail, and the Principal, hearing that the Indian Department were bringing up a doctor to visit some of the Indians who were very sick, made the request that this boy should be visited also, which was done about two months since. The Dr. saw the boy, as said the best had been done, and told Mr. Gurney to continue as he had begun, but gave very little hope of the lad's recovery. The Dr. was in the house five\nfive to ten minutes, and never returns either to the Home or the Reserve, though there are a number of sick. The Indian Department is well acquainted with this fact, and it must be this that is meant when it is said a number are in a very bad state. The Reserve and not the Home is what is meant.\n\n(Signed) John McDayall.\nToronto Jan. 27, 1888.\n\nReferring again to your letter of 9th December last, No. 30648, respecting the employment of a physician for the pupils of the McDougall Orphanage at Morley.

N. Shannon\nfor the Board Secty.\n\nThe Honorable\nThe Sup't General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nI have the honour to inform you that the Rev. H. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Church Missionary Department has written to me on his return from a visit to the Battle River District, relative to the choice of a site for the proposed Industrial School.\n\nPending the result of correspondence on this subject, I beg to inform you of two other matters broached by Dr. Sutherland.\n\nThe one is \"that the Indian Dept. should assume possession of the McDougall Orphanage together with the land belonging thereto and put\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nsit on the same footing as other Indian Institutes, giving the management \"however to the Methodist Missionary Society.\"\n\nI have promised to bring this proposition before the Department, but said that I could hold out little hope of its being favorably entertained.\n\nThe second matter is the necessity of an Institution somewhere near the lower end of Lake Winnipeg for the benefit of the Indians of Berens River, Fisher River, Norway House, &c., other Bands to the west & north. Nearly all the Indians at the three places mentioned, and also at Oxford House, Cross Lake, and Nelson have been under our care for many years and in the present state of Indian affairs, in the North West an Institute has become an urgent necessity.\n\nThis last matter I have promised to recommend to the favorable consideration of the Department should the result of inquiries which I am instituting appear to justify me in doing so.\n\nHave the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nHayte Reed,\nCommissioner.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant submitting\n\nthe request for the Act to\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6355, File 757-1, pt. 1)\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nReport of the Sub-Committee of\nThe General Board of Missions\nof The Methodist Church\nadopted by the Board September 14th\n\n\"Indian Industrial and Educational Institutes.\n\n\"The benefits which have resulted from the operations of several such Institutes in the Province of Ontario have led the Government to adopt a similar policy in the North-West Territories. Within a few years four Institutes have been established, the management of which has been given to persons representing the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Presbyterian Churches. In view of the large extent and successful results of our mission work among the Indians, it has caused no small degree of surprise that the Methodist Church has been almost completely ignored.\"\nignored in Institute work in the North-West. After long negotiation a tract of land has been secured as a site for the McDougall Orphanage and Training School, and a per capita grant, at the rate of $60 per annum, is now made toward maintenance; but application for funds to erect buildings have been repeatedly refused, while the annual grant is out of all proportion to the needs of the Institution, and is in marked contrast with the amounts voted to other institutions.\n\nRecent correspondence shows that it is the intention of the Government to establish an Institute at Battle River or Peace Hills, the management of which will be given to the Methodist Church, and this will in part remove the inequality of which we have had just reason to complain; but there is urgent need that the number of Institutes...\nInstitutes be further increased, and it would be best just that in such increase, the work of the Methodist Church be fairly recognized.\n\n\"We therefore recommend that the secretary be instructed to press upon the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, in the name of this Board and of the Methodist Church, the following points:\n\n1. The speedy completion of the proposed Institute buildings at Battle River.\n\n2. A grant for the erection of suitable buildings for the McDougall Training School, and an annual grant similar to that given to other institutions.\n\n3. The establishment of an Industrial Institute in the eastern part of Manitoba, for the benefit of the Indians around Lake Winnipeg and in the region to the north, northeast and northwest thereof.\n\n\"All the Institutes be under the management of persons appointed by this Society.\"\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\"Respecting Industrial Institutes in British Columbia, we find that it is the intention of the Government to establish four Institutes in that Province, and it is stated by Officials of the Indian Department that the policy of the Government is to make these Institutes non-denominational as to their management. If this policy were seriously intended it would not, in our judgment, be a wise one; but indications thus far, lead to the conclusion that there will be denominational control in fact, if not in name, and that here again the work of the Methodist Church is to be ignored. It is affirmed, on what we regard as good authority, that two of the proposed Institutes are to be located at missions of the Church of England, and two at Roman Catholic Missions; and this in face of the fact that Indian adherents of the Methodist Church, especially on the North-West coast, largely exceed those of the other communions mentioned. We deem it most important that an Institute should\nShould be established at Port Simpson for the benefit of the Tsimshean and adjacent tribes instead of at Metlakatla from which the Indians have nearly all removed. We also deem it most important for our work that an Institute under our control be located at Chilliwack. We therefore recommend:\n\n\"That the Secretary urge upon the Government the claim of the Methodist Church to be recognized in the location and control of some of these Institutes.\"\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a Report of a sub-committee of the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church adopted by the Board at its recent session in the City of Winnipeg.\n\nIn regard to the North-West I may say that during the past autumn I received a communication from the Indian Commissioner, intimating the intention of the Government to establish an Institute in the Battle River Country and asking for suggestions in regard to the best location. A short time afterwards I visited that region and in company with Rev. John McDougall and others, examined a number of possible sites. We are unanimously of opinion that it is desirable the Institute should be located some distance from all...\nan Indian Reserve and we know of no better place than what is known as the Red Deer settlement; supplying, as it does, the important requisites of good soil, good water and a fair supply of timber. Moreover this would place the Institute in the immediate neighborhood of a flourishing English settlement where the pupils would have before them good examples of farming industry, and would find a market for such manufacture as might be carried on in connection with the Institute. I have communicated these views to the Indian Commissioner who doubtless will keep you informed of all suggestions made in the matter. At present our chief anxiety is to have this Institute completed as soon as possible, and while we prefer the Red Deer region we would be prepared to cooperate with the Department on any site that may be selected.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nWith regard to the McDougall Orphanage and Schools, we would be quite willing that the land set apart for this purpose should be taken by the Government and the Orphanage made a training Institute similar to others established in the North West. A valuable work is being done in the Orphanage at the present time, as I know from personal inspection, and it is only the small amount received from the Department which prevents the extension of the institution both in regard to its buildings and its usefulness.\n\nI beg further to call the attention of the Superintendent-General to the great need which exists for an Institute somewhere near the southern end of Lake Winnipeg, or in some part of Southern Manitoba, for the benefit of the Indians around Lake Winnipeg and the North and...\nand North East thereof, and we earnestly hope that this matter will be favorably considered by the Department and an amount placed in this year's estimates for the necessary buildings.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. Sutherland\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo The Honourable\n\nThe Supt. General\n\nOf Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nMemorandum.\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit herewith a letter of the 27th ultimo from the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Missionary Department of the Methodist Church of Canada, also a copy of a Report of a Sub-committee of the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church adopted by the Board September 14th 1888 and enclosed in Dr. Sutherland's letter.\n\nWith\n\nTo the Honorable\n\nE. Dewdney\nActing Sec'y of Indian Affairs.\nWith regard to the several matters referred to in the General Secretary's letter and in the Report of the Sub-committee, the undersigned begs to state:\n\n1st. That the question of a suitable site for the proposed Industrial school at the Peace Hills is in abeyance, pending the result of correspondence which the Indian Commissioner for the North West Territories in his letter of the 15th Nov., which will be found on this file, states he is at present conducting in regard to the same.\n\n2nd. As respects the proposition that the McDougall Orphanage should be made a training school similar to others established in the North West, by which it is assumed it is meant that the Orphanage should be put on a similar footing with the Battleford & Lac La Biche Industrial...\nIndustrial school, the undersigned begs to state that he questions the advisability of acceding to this proposition, inasmuch as the Orphanage at Wesleyville is exclusively, so far as the undersigned has ever learned, for the children of the Stone Indians, whose Reserve is situated at that point, and it is similar in organization to the Orphanage at St. Albert, although the latter institution does not restrict its functions to the education and support of any particular tribe or Band of Indians. The McDougall Orphanage is also similar to the boarding schools established by the Presbyterian Body at Round Lake and near Assiniboine Agency; and to none of the three last named institutions does the Department contribute more than is given to the McDougall Orphanage, viz., $60 per capita annually. If the grant were increased in\nin the one case, it would have to be increased in all the others.\n\nWith regard to the proposition that assistance should be given toward the enlargement and improvement of the building used for the Orphanage, the undersigned is of opinion that moderate assistance to this end would probably be advisable.\n\n3rd. So respects the proposal that an Industrial school shall be established at Lake Winnipeg or in some part of Southern Manitoba, the undersigned considers that the establishment of an institution at Berens River, or at some other convenient point, would be advantageous as there are several Bands of Indians on Lake Winnipeg among whom Baptist Missionaries have worked for a number of years, and day schools have been in operation among these Bands for many years.\nyears past. Consequently they ought to be able to supply a sufficient number of pupils to fill an industrial institution of a moderate size.\n\n4th In respect to the propositions as regards British Columbia contained in the Report of the Sub-committee of the Board of Missions that (a) an industrial school for the Indians of the North West coast should be established at Port Simpson instead of at Quatsino, the undersigned begs to state that the buildings for the industrial school have already been completed at the latter point and the institution will probably be under way in a few weeks, the Principal of the same having been appointed and having gone there to commence operations. It is moreover very questionable whether the site selected is not preferable to that recommended.\nrecommended in the Report of the Sub-committee. There appears to be a consensus of opinion in British Columbia in favor of Metlakatla as the best point at which to establish an Industrial School.\n\n(a) That an Industrial institution under the control of the Methodists be established at Chilcotin. This might be advisable, but the undersigned is not sufficiently conversant with the Mission work of the various religious denominations in that part of British Columbia to give a decided opinion without inquiry.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.

Gordon\n25 Aug 90\nThe Honorable E. Dewdney Esq.,\nMinister of the Interior,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will remember no doubt my calling upon you in your office at Ottawa about a year ago, inquiring about building funds for the McDougall Orphanage, and that you said that you could do nothing for us that year, but would consider it next year.\n\nWe have got along in nearly seven years as well as we could without any help for building from the Government, but our house is far too small and it is so rude that it is fit only for a workshop. It was only intended as a temporary arrangement when put up, and to be used as a shop or for a barn when we should get help to build a proper house.\n\nIf the Stony nation is to be civilized during the present generation we should have house room to accommodate at least 50 children.\n\nYou have architects who can furnish estimates of the requirements of such a building & its probable cost.\n\nWe think the gravel in the hills near here would make good concrete walls and that that would be both cheap & durable. It has been tried at Calgary with success.\n\nThe house should contain at least a kitchen, dining-room, laundry, lavatories, dormitories, clothes closets, boys hall, girls hall, serving-room, 2 school-rooms, hospital, library, reception-room, & perhaps some other apartments besides at least four rooms for the use of those in charge of the Institution.\n\nWe surely expect the Government to do something nice.\nfor us this Summer after keeping us waiting nearly six years.\n\nThe Inspectors, Indian Agents, other Government Officials,\nand visitors generally, all testify as to the thoroughness of our\nwork, and as to the lack of room accommodation.\n\nWould not this place be suitable for the Willow Basket\nMaking Industry? By engaging some of the graduates\nof the Blind Institution at Beamford, Ont., a good\nstart might be made, making great cost to the\nGovernment, which might open up an industry very\nmuch needed in this part of the world, and enable the\nIndians to gain a livelihood. Now that there are no buffalo\nthe Indians in this vicinity have very little occupation & no\nmanufacturing work.\n\nHope you can see that this is worth trying, & that\nsome competent person basket maker of unquestionable\nmoral character to give instruction in the art here.\n\nHoping that this reminder may not be unnecessary, but that\nyou are already fulfilling your promise,\n\nI remain\n\nYour Respectfully\n\nSas A Young\nOttawa. April 17th, 1890.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the claims of the McDougall Orphanage for aid towards its building fund; and in answer I may inform you that the expenditure in connection with the education of our Indian children throughout Manitoba and the North West Territories has so increased in the last few years that the Government has been obliged to curtail in many directions, and therefore I regret very much to say that it was impossible to have an item passed in the Estimates to aid the Morley building the coming year. As you are aware, I had $2,100. voted for the current year for the maintenance of the Orph-\nOrphanage of 35 children at $60. each, but as the number of children was scarcely expected to reach 35, and as we are forced to economize, I placed the remainder for next year at 25, consequently $1,500 have been passed for maintenance for the fiscal year 1890-91.\n\nIn addition to the Morley Institution the Government has agreed to erect an Industrial School at Red Deer, under the auspices of the Methodist Church, which will cost a large sum of money. We are now awaiting the action of the Methodist Church authorities in regard to the land for the site. It also voted a sum for the current year to aid in the erection of a Methodist Industrial School in the Province of Manitoba. We have also increased the salaries of all the teachers of Methodist Schools in the North West from a $12. per quarter per capita salary to a guaranteed amount of $300. per annum. So that it will be observed that when all the\nthe other denominations are proportionately provided for the expenditure is run up to a great aggregate.\n\nI expect, when the Red Deer School is well under way, and the Manitoba Institution is disposed of, I shall be in a better position to impress on my colleagues the advisability of aiding the Orphanage, which I know is doing a splendid work, and one well worthy of consideration and encouragement.\n\nI think it would expedite matters if you were to communicate with Mr. Reed, Indian Commissioner, on the subject, before the North West Estimates are made out for 1891-92, (they will be made out in the Fall) and agree with him on the requirements of the Institution in the way of extra accommodation. He can then make representations to the Department in the regular way, when forwarding his Estimates.\n\nIn regard to the Willow Basket Making Industry, I\nI may say that at present we have no appropriation for the purpose, or any funds out of which we could pay the cost of the experiment, but it might be well for you to open up communication with the Blind Institute at Brantford, and ascertain what the cost would be to send a Graduate to Morley, and at the same time obtain as much information as possible on the subject, with full particulars. The scheme could then be discussed, and perhaps some conclusion arrived at.\n\nYou do not say whether suitable willow grows in sufficient quantity on the Reserve to warrant the establishment of the industry, nor do you give an idea of the extent of the market procurable in the district for the sale of baskets.\n\nWishing you every success in your work,\n\nI am,\n\nJas. A. Youmans, Esq.,\nPrincipal McDougall Orphanage and Training Institution,\nMillwood, Alberta.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) E. Decooney\nAmong the Parliamentary Appropriations for the current yr which, as you are aware, will lapse before the 30 June next there is an appropriation of \u00a36000.00 for the erection of a building for an Ind. sch. to be conducted under the auspices of yr denomination somewhere in the Prov. of Kien. In as much as the site on which this building is to be erected has not been decided upon t even if it were now the erection of the new buildg before the 30th of June would practically be impossible, if it was as much as it has bee\nintimated to the best that\nthe Authorities of the Govern-\nment are desirous of\nenlarging the Mc Dougall\nOrphanage at Morley; it is\nthought that it might be\npossible to utilize a portion\nat least of the above appro-\npriation for that object & to\nprovision arrangements for the\nerection of the former Institu-\ntion buildings until after\nthe 1st July next.\n\nIn order to give the\nproposition to enlarge the\nMorley Institute fair course\naction it is seen that the\nbest should be supplied with\na plan of projection of the\nbuilding proposed to be erected\nalso of specifications in\nregard to the same & as\nnearly as possible an approxi-\nmate estimate of the cost\nthereof.\n\nThe best is addressed\nThat near Millwood in Alberta there is a kind of gravel in the hills out of which good concrete walls could be made that would be both cheap and durable. The best soil be advised specifically as to this matter & likewise what proportion of the cost of the building to church would undertake to bear provided that the Govt. will assist in the same.\n\n[Signature]\nKnow All Men by these Presents that We, Reverend John McDougall, of Morley in the District of Alberta N.W.T., Clerk in Holy Orders, the Reverend James Woodsworth of the City of Brandon in the County of Brandon and Province of Manitoba, Clerk in Holy Orders, Superintendent of Missions in Manitoba and North West Territories, and of the Conference of the Methodist Church, are jointly and severally held and firmly bound under the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for the Dominion of Canada, in the penal sum of $12000.00 of lawful money of Canada, to be paid to the said Superintendent General of Indian Affairs or to his certain attorney, successor or assignee, for which payment well and truly to be made, we, jointly and severally, bind ourselves in the whole and each of us, his heirs, executors and administrators, and every of them forever firmly by these presents.\n\nSealed with our seals and dated this day of\n\nWhereas the said Reverend John McDougall, and Reverend James Woodsworth, representing the Manitoba and North West Conference of the Methodist Church, are desirous of securing the erection and possible equipment, by the Indian Department, of Indian Industrial buildings, to be managed under the auspices of the Methodist Church, in connection with the present Indian Institution\nIn situation near Morley aforesaid, the said buildings to be erected on a tract of ten acres of land to be donated for the purpose.

John MacDougall was attending the conference at Brandon, and as it was desirable to see him, along with another, in order to learn how the proposition would be received, I posted off there.\n\nWith my knowledge of the state of the buildings, I knew well what was required. That one occupied was only intended from the first as a temporary affair, to be replaced when funds would admit, by a better. Consequently in my opinion a good detached building is required.\nrequired, the old one being kept as a school room, and therefore suggest one similar to the main building at Elkhorn, which would cost not more than $5500.\n\nThe plans and specifications are on file in the Department.\n\nMr. MacDougall called in the Rev. Mr. Woodworth, their Superintendent, and having submitted the proposition, the terms were agreed to and I was asked to draft an Agreement to be submitted to them. This was done and by them submitted to the conference and a Committee appointed to go into the matter. The Committee having reported favorably conference unanimously approved of it.\n\nAs the matter stands the land is vested (that is if the patent has been issued) in the Methodist Missionary Society, Head Quarters at Toronto. This fact appeared to offer the only obstacle to a satisfactory conclusion, for as I said, the Government should be the owners of the building, and to become such, a transfer of sufficient land should be made to them in order to retain a proper title in the building. On this score I was assured\nno uneasiness need exist as the conference would write immediately to Toronto recommending a transfer of land. The Committee was perfectly satisfied to leave the plans and specifications to myself, feeling that our interests were identical.\n\nAs will be seen by the Agreement that all moneys can only be payable upon my approval and any balance upon completion of the buildings should be refunded, but I would suggest that any balance should be applied towards equipment.\n\nMy idea is to ourselves send a good man in charge of the work, who will carry out the ideas of the Department under the supervision and general direction of the Rev. gentlemen mentioned in the Bond. One the Rev. Mr. MacDougall as is known lives adjacent to the site of the proposed building.\n\nThe Agreement has not been signed but is submitted to the Department for approval. If approved it might be sent to Rev. Mr. Woodworth for signature, to be forwarded by him to the Rev. John MacDougall.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHayter Weed\n\nHon. E. Dewdney,\nSupt.

[signature]\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT,\n\nToronto, 13th June, 1890.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge your favor of June 2nd, No. 3064, referring to an appropriation of $500 for the erection of an Indian Industrial School in Manitoba, and a proposal to transfer the surplus to aid in enlarging the buildings at the In-charge Orphanage, on the ground that the site for the Manitoba Institute has not yet been selected, and that the erection of the necessary buildings before the 30th of June is desirable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nAttorney.\nwould be practically impossible.\n\nWhile we do much desire the erection of an Institute in Manitoba, and hope that the Department will make provision for this in next year's estimates, we will be quite willing to fall in with the suggestion made respecting increased building accommodation for the Refugium at Stanley. I will communicate at once with the Rev. John McVeygall, and request that plans and specifications be prepared as quickly as possible, and forwarded to the Department. I would suggest that in the meantime at least, at least, of the ancient in question be placed at the disposal of the Ecclesiastical Missionaries for the South-West.\nfor the purpose above referred to,\nand that he arrange with the\nArchitects for such work to be\ndone before the 30th of June as\nwill meet the requirements of\nthe Department.\n\nRespecting the proposition of\ncost that should be provided\nby the Methodist Church to-\nward the proposed enlarge-\nment or the erection of new\nbuildings, as the case may be,\nthat will depend somewhat\nupon the relations of the property\nto the Methodist Church hereafter.\nIf the site and buildings are\nto be the property of the Depart-\nment, it is not likely that our\nMissionary Board would be\nwilling to make a grant, but\nif the land is to be patented\nto the Methodist Church, then\nI presume a proposal to bear part of the cost would be favorably considered by us. In this connection, I may say that a portion of the property on which the Orphanage building is situated was promised to the Missionary Society years ago. Since then several patients have been received from the West of the District, but I do not think this fact is included among them. If there mistakes in this, however, we will be prepared to convey the property to the Government in case it should be decided that the Orphanage shall become a Government Institution in the same sense as the Industrial Schools in the North-West.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Genl. of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 0112 of May 13th inst., I beg to say that the attendance is marked daily at 8.15 and 20.15. It is true the office register of attendance was not written up, but independent of this I keep a pocket register and journal, but owing to my time being so fully occupied just now, I had neglected to copy the attendance into office register, which I usually do morning and evening.\n\nI did not see your Agent on the 29th ultimo or proper explanation would have been given and register produced.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. W. Butler\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina\nH. W. Z.\nStoney Reserve\n\n21st July 1894.\n\nI have the honour to report that yesterday during rationing all the pupils from the McDougall Orphanage came for rations telling me they had been sent home to their parents and had nothing to eat. After I got through I drove down to the Institution and found what they had said correct. The Principal, matron, and teacher had all gone to Banff for a holiday and before going had sent all the children home with the exception of two little ones whose father is away, and another little one who was dying and who died yesterday morning. This may be done with your consent but I cannot think so, as it is simply defeating its own ends.\n\nWith further reference to the calling of the register, re your letter of the 9th inst., wherein you state the Principal marks it twice daily. He may mark it but it is not called at any time in the day, so the employees inform me who have been there for over two years.\n\n(Signed) P. L. Grasse\n\nAsst Commissioner\nRegina\nJuly 31st 1894\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr. Farina, Superintendent of the Stony Plains, informing me that the employees of the hospital, McNaughton Orphanage all went to Banff on a holiday and that the children had nothing to eat.\n\nThe Department would like to know whether you have any further information regarding the substance of your reply to the letter stating that the order has been submitted for report, giving particulars.\n\nWas the hospital able to reply to any of your inquiries?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSir:\n\nThe Principal of the Orphanage has sent me yours of the 8th ultimo No 0112 referring to the Principal and patron and teacher going to Banff for a holiday. The facts in the case are; I made the proposition and the children were given the option of remaining in the institution or going home for a few days. All but four went to their Parents and Guardians. These were told of the arrangement and also that the children might come back before the Principal returned if they so wished: quite a number did this.\n\nThe Assistant patron was left in charge and she had the seamstress and farmer to aid her. One little girl who had been sick for a long time and was expected to die for weeks before she did, died the day after the\n\nPrincipal\nPrincipal left. Everything was attended to as should be in such a case.\n\nMy reasons for proposing the holiday were:\n\n1st the Principal and Matron had worked faithfully for three years without any such intermission.\n\n2nd the season was hot and in my judgment to relieve the children from the day school for a short time would be beneficial to them and the teacher. The latter had kept at his work steadily since the 1st of January up to July 1st in School No 1 and since that date in the Orphanage.\n\nAs to the Department's regulation covering day schools, I do not think this applies in this case as the Orphanage school is constant.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Signed) John McDougall\n\n---\n\nThe original copy of this letter was sent to the Dept. on July 23rd, 1894, by Mr. Casson. Letter has reference to a letter from the Rev. Mr. McDougall, a copy of which was sent to the Dept. under cover of official letter No. 1112 of August 14th, 1893.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Signed) John McDougall\nThe Most Honourable,\nRegina\n\nSeptember 4th 1874\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ask the favour of a copy of a letter from the Revd. Mr. Macdonald in further reference to the closing of the Macdonald Orphanage while the Employes went to Barry for a holiday and in reply they say that Mr. Macdonald is wrong in thinking that the Department Regulation covering day schools does not apply to the holiday for the Orphanage which should not have been taken without the consent of the Deptt having been first obtained.\nI have the honor to report that chicken-pox has broken out in the Orphanage. One of the pupils was very ill with inflammation of the lungs and I sent for the doctor. While there they brought in one of the boys for the doctor to see, and he written to keep cases was completely covered with spots, isolated.\n\nFarmer Grass has been alarmed at first, also been written to, thinking it was small-pox, however, approving action even as he had no symptoms other than what he thought it was perhaps to be continued his chicken-pox.\n\nEfforts to prevent it Monday two more were struck down by communication so I sent for him again. He now believes the Institute report it chicken-pox. There were four down yesterday.\n\nI have warned all the Indians and assistants from going there and taken all precautions against spreading the disease I know of.\n\nThe Indians are much alarmed as they say it is nearly as fatal.\n\nTo\n\nThe Indian Commissioner\n\nRegina\nsmall post among them owing\nI presume to their getting well\nfeet and catching cold in other\nways.\n\nI have the honor to be\nSir!\nYour obedient servant\n(sgd) P. L. Grassel\nFarmer.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that Whooping Cough has now broken out in the Orphanage.\n\nThe classes have all been stopped, and the school room is turned into a sick room.\n\nThis and the chicken pox together, with a few exceptions, has prostrated all the pupils.\n\nI have also to report, that the little girl, pupil No. 1049 Nancy Smallmore, who had her arm amputated some time ago, has now to have her foot amputated.\n\nIt is simply rotting off, and the doctor advises it be done at once.\n\nIt is terrible the condition some of these children are in with scrofula.\n\nI had to call the doctor to make a special visit there this week.\n\nI have, etc.,\nP.L. Grasse,\nFarmer.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit my report of Medical work on Morley Reserve for the month of February.\n\nFeb. 12\n\nI made a visit to the Reserve and found the Indians generally free from sickness.\n\nI visited the orphanage and examined three pupils, viz: Elizabeth Bears-paw, John P. Har, and Jonas and found them good subjects and passed them.\n\nI found Christina Swampey and John Wesley suffering from Trachoma (otherwise known as granular lids) this trouble is more or less contagious and requires certain precautions to be carried out to keep it from spreading.\n\nSuch directions are being carried out.\n\nI saw a number of Indians at the Agency who were suffering from minor ailments and to whom I gave attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. H. Sibbald Esq.\nAgent,\nMorley.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. H. Sibbald\nIndian Agent\nReport No. 1 to the Missionary Executive of the Methodist Church covering the Condition and Expenditure of the Indian Boarding School at Morley, Alta., dated March 8th, 1905.\n\nOn our arrival at Morley we found a man repairing furnaces. An appropriation of $200 has been made by the Department for this purpose. We considered the time opportune to suggest some changes to provide more perfect heating and much needed ventilation. We asked for an estimate of cost of extras suggested. This will be furnished and if satisfactory - we have assumed the responsibility of authorizing the improvements. It is believed that the appropriation of $200 will cover the entire cost of repairs and changes ordered by us. The man in charge of this work gives it as his opinion that the furnaces will not last more than two years longer.\n\nWater - There seems to be an ample supply and of good quality. The spring is situated about 2000 feet from the School, there is a fall of 70 feet. There is at present 2800 cubic feet of water in the reservoir at the spring which means an ample supply for both domestic purposes and fire protection. The work is satisfactory so far as the outside of the building is concerned. As yet the system is only partially installed. There are two taps, one in the kitchen and one in the laundry. The pipes in the building are not sufficiently guarded against frost. This winter considerable trouble has been experienced owing to this defect. More complete installation is necessary to provide for baths and closets.\n\nPupils - No. of pupils in attendance at present is 46. Limit 40.\n\nPer Capita $72 - Average during part year 50.\n\nStaff - Principal J. W. Hildreth Salary $800\nMatron Miss Jull. \" 300\nAssistant Matron Miss Gibson. \" 180\nCook Miss Rowles \" 240\nSewing Teacher. Mrs. Rolston. Salary $200\nTeacher. Miss Walsh. * 300\nFarmer. Mr. Jolly (just left) 240\n\nDuties - The duties of the Principal are so multifarious and varied as to be difficult of specification - General oversight - The purchase of supplies - General office work. He performs a great deal of manual labor which we think scarcely pertains to the duties of his office, i.e., the going to the bush and hauling wood from four to nine miles often two loads a day - 125 cords of wood burned last year - 3/4 of cord in load. This work is done mainly by the Principal and an Indian boy. The Assistant has to attend to stock and until recently haul water in. Both cannot be away from the Institute at the same time. - The Principal sleeps in the dormitory with the boys - nurses them in sickness and personally bathes them on Saturdays - Indeed he does what but few men could be hired to do. - He does it not for hire, but we believe through a sense of duty and love of the children.\n\nHis Assistant should be a more efficient man than can possibly be procured for the salary paid.\n\nMatron - General Supervision.\n\nAssistant Matron - Laundry work. - In summer dairy work. - Keeping Staff's rooms in order. - Oversight of girls while scrubbing floors etc. - Only four or five small girls to assist.\n\nCook - General Cooking including baking of bread. One girl assistant.\n\nSeamstress - Marking and mending of clothing for both boys and girls.\n\nTeacher - Long tried. Thoroughly efficient both as teacher and missionary.\n\nThe question has been raised: - Is not the staff abnormally large\nfor the care of less than 50 children? This question we have carefully considered and fail to see where a reduction can be made.\n\nThe Principal's duties are already too heavy. The money paid for a male Assistant or farmer has failed to procure an efficient man.\n\nThe Asst. Matron has her hands full. The laundry work of nearly 60 people (including staff) is in itself a heavy item, with so little assistance as can be rendered by four or five girls under fifteen years of age.\n\nThe cook has enough to do to cook for sixty people including the making of bread with only one child assistant.\n\nThe Seamstress makes and mends the clothes for both boys and girls. - None are bought ready made. In all these instances it must be borne in mind that help rendered by the children is small. - No boys or girls over fourteen years of age being available at present. - Very few indeed having reached fourteen. - These of course spend part of their time in School.\n\nA general analysis of the accounts would indicate that so far as we can judge, there has been no extravagant expenditure in the following items:\n\n1 - House equipment $386.45, including among other items:\n   New Sewing Machine $56. Mattress $8. Table $6.\n   2 robes $10. Stove for parlor. Brooms, brushes, lamps curtains, cutlery, crockery, granite-ware etc. etc.\n\n2 - Ranch Expenses $377.33 - Oats, feed and seed $100.\n   This is very small. One good horse would eat 100 bushels in a year. The seed is necessary for oats seldom mature in this high altitude. Oats are sown to provide green feed or to cure for feed. New Mowing Machine $78. Bull $47. Wear and tear harness etc. etc.\n3 - Extra Labor Bank Exchange etc. $165.90 - fourteen days labor painting at $2.00 per day - An extra man for two months during Mr. Niddrie's Sickness (by Dr. Sutherland's authority) $60. - Freight $45. etc. etc.\n\n4 - Blacksmithing, building and general repairs $203. - About $100 of this item was for flooring mangers - ceiling in stables The balance for blacksmithing and sundries.\n\n5 - Fuel and lights $302.40 - Light $67. - Balance $235 for fuel. This is for cutting wood in bush and hauling to edge of wood or to the church, a distance of 5 miles from bush. As before stated, the Principal hauled it from church 4 miles or edge of woods 9 miles.\n\n6 - Travelling expenses $120 - Miss Rheuler return expenses to Ontario after five year's service $50. Miss Hudson paid for her ticket when she came to Morley. Having remained two years she was entitled to refund $60. Balance of $10, balance of Miss Fairburn's expenses from Toronto, making a total of $120. We assume these items relate to the terms of agreement between the Mission Rooms and parties concerned. The General Superintendent will know whether these amounts should have been paid. It will be noted that the Principal has not charged any of his own expenses, though he made several trips to Calgary on the business of the Institute.\n\n7 - Provisions and Clothing - $4840.76 We are not clear as to this item. We have not sufficient data to compare with other institutions. Conditions are very different with those which obtain, say at Brandon, where a productive farm yields so largely to the support of the Institute. With the exception of milk and butter in part and some meat in the winter, every-\nthing has to be purchased, and in most instances at high prices.\n\nPotatoes range from $1.00 to $1.50 per bushel. Last year $25. was paid for seed potatoes - Nothing realized. - The crop was an entire failure. The Principal suggests the following way of viewing the situation. - 50 children at $1.50 each for food and clothing -$75. per week. 7 Members of staff at 10\u00a2 per meal - $14.70 per week - $99.70 per week. - 52 weeks - $4864.40.\n\nEverything to buy except what may be realized from cattle. There were 46 head of cattle when Mr. Middrie came. Near 50,3600 worth has been sold in the last five years.\n\nThe milk and butter are considerations. Then the material only of the clothing can be considered in the above calculations. The making otherwise provided for.\n\nThere may be a leakage through any one of all the following ways.\n\n1 - Expensive purchases. - Some economy is possible in this line, though not sufficient to very materially affect results. Suggestions were made to the Principal on this line which may prove valuable in the future.\n\n2 - Waste - The Principal was closely questioned on this point. He seems satisfied that rigid economy is practised. We are not in a position to form a judgment. Much depends upon the cook.\n\n3 - The question as to whether hospitality extended to Indians from Reserve is not a larger drain on the supplies than members of the staff are conscious of.\n\nAn examination of the books revealed a lack of correspondence between statements of amounts received from Mission Rooms and amounts expended as shown by the cash a/c. Although some hours were spent in the effort to reach an understanding, such effort was fruitless.\nThe Principal stated that he had Miss Walsh to assist him in his bookkeeping. The General Secretary will know that the Principal has suffered with severe head trouble in consequence of sore eyes caused by poisoning. Many times he felt the need of help in his accounts when thus suffering, hence he procured the assistance of Miss Walsh. He asked us to allow him time to procure further information which he would do on Miss Walsh's return from the East the latter end of March. We have asked that he prepare full statements which shall enable us to see exactly how things stand at the present time. His books are not all posted up to date. The Principal claims that the over-lapping of the various year's accounts will in part and perhaps wholly account for discrepancies. A fuller report may be expected later.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n(Signed) James Woodsworth.\n(Signed) T. Perrier.\nDear Sir,\n\nSome weeks ago I was on the point of writing to the Hon. Mr. Biston on sundry matters connected with Indian Schools, etc., but his resignation from the Ministry rendered my intention impracticable. As the office of Superintendent remains vacant, I take the liberty of addressing you directly, and trust you will kindly give any representations such representations as in your judgment they may be entitled to receive.\n\nLetters from the Department some months ago called attention to the fact there was difficulty in securing the Annual Report from the Principal of the Indian Boarding School at Morley. When a copy of the report was finally sent me by Mr. Hiddrie, I found that the deficit on the year's operations was abnormally large, but I saw no reason to challenge any of the items unless it were the amount for provisions and clothing; but I thought it advisable that a careful enquiry should be made. I accordingly instructed the Rev. James Woodsworth, D.D., who acts as Inspector of Indian Schools on behalf of the Missionary Society, to proceed to Morley and\nToronto,\n\nEnquire fully into the condition and expenditure of the school. With him was associated the Principal of the Brandon Indian Institute, whose business training and knowledge of affairs gave guarantee of thorough work. I enclose a copy of their first report, which covers practically all the points except the expenditure on provisions and clothing, into which they desire to make further enquiry. You will note what they say respecting Mr. Kiddie's diligence, industry and faithfulness, and if there is any doubt it is in reference to his capability for the details of business which involve careful and accurate book-keeping. But if there is any defect here\u2014which is not yet apparent\u2014I am persuaded it arises from having too much to do in other departments.\n\nWhen a further report comes to hand, I will send you a copy. In the meantime you cannot fail to see how utterly impossible it is to carry on a Boarding School on the present financial basis, and how reasonable is our request that we should receive a substantial grant toward meeting the deficiency of last year, and that the per capita should be increased for the future to at least $100, on a basis of fifty pupils, instead of forty as at present.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA. Sutherland\nOTTAWA, March 31st\u20141905.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th, instant, with enclosures.

He has been overburdened with duties. He has given his time even to the cutting and drawing of wood, and his attention to numerous details that do not properly belong to the duties of a Principal. He has nursed the boys in sickness, sleeps with them in the Dormitory and in many other ways devoted himself to their physical and spiritual welfare in a way and to a degree seldom equaled.\n\nThe Books show that during the past seven years a Total of $44556.70 has been paid to the Institution. This with the $6200 required to meet present indebtedness makes a grant total of $50756.70\n\nShowing an annual average cost for the seven years of $7250 or an annual average cost per pupil of $131.\n\nAssuming that the Church has drawn the full Gov't grant of $72. for each pupil and 40 pupils each year it will be seen that the Department has paid $2680 per year or a total of $20160 for the seven years. While the Church has paid $3485.24 per year or a total of $24396.70 for the seven years.\nIt will be further seen that for the seven years one half the total cost including the deficit of $6200, is $25378, and the Department has paid $20160, leaving a difference of $5218.\n\nWhile the Church has paid $24396, leaving a difference of $962.\n\nConsidering all the existing circumstances it would appear that if the entire Cost of maintenance during the seven years be equally divided between the Department and the Church it would be but a fair solution of this costly and unfortunate situation.\n\nTherefore I would suggest that the present indebtedness of $6200 be divided as follows:\n\nThe Department paying $5218.00\nThe Church paying $962.00\n\nMaking a total expenditure for each for the seven years of $25378.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the Honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nT. Ferrier\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Mr Ferrier, who made an audit of the books of the McDougall Orphanage for the Executive of the Methodist Missionary Society, submits a statement of unpaid accounts amounting to $5,930.11. The estimated cost of conducting the school to the 30th June last, he places at $409.89 which added to the above amount makes a total deficit of $6200.00. He suggests that the Department assume $5218.00 of this liability and it is for it to decide whether it will do so.\n\nThe financial condition of this school comes as a surprise to the Department as at the date of the late Inspector McGibbon's last report, June 1903, the deficit was placed at only $150.00, which showed a reduction of $350.00 from the deficit of the previous year. If Mr McGibbon's financial statement was correct, it is hard to see how the deficit occurred.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMemo of Income and Expenditure at the McDougall Orphanage, 1898 to 1904 - six years.\n\n| Year     | Expenditure | Government Grant | Difference |\n|----------|-------------|------------------|------------|\n| 1898-9   | 4324.35     | 2745.60          | 1578.75    |\n| 1899-1900| 4616.39     | 2731.20          | 1885.19    |\n| 1900-1   | 6809.78     | 2846.40          | 3963.38    |\n| 1901-2   | 7500        | 2880             | 4620       |\n| 1902-3   | 5451.09     | 2770.80          | 2680.29    |\n| 1903-4   | 7600        | 2678.40          | 4921.60    |\n| Six Years| $36301.61   | $16652.40        | $19649.21  |\nExtract:\n\nThe Methodist Church,\nMissionary Department,\n\nToronto, August 6th, '05.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn conversation with you a few weeks ago I promised to write you in regard to various points that came up in the conversation, especially with regard to the Indian Institute at Red Deer and the Boarding Schools at Morley and Norway House.\n\nAccompanying this you will find a memo. of the income and expenditure of the three Institutes above named, covering a period of nine years at Red Deer, six years at McDougall Orphanage, and five years at Norway House. From these figures you will see at a glance that the Institutions referred to have been carried on for a number of years at a very heavy loss to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church.\n\nIn regard to the McDougall Orphanage you will see that the shortage there, which we had to make good, aggregates for the six years nearly twenty thousand dollars, and the greater part of this deficit is owing to the simple impossibility of maintaining a school of the kind on the present per capita grant. You have, I think, in the Department a copy of the report prepared by the Rev. Dr. Woodsworth and the Rev. T. Ferrier, showing the amount of outstanding bills on the 30th of June last. You are also aware of the recommendation made by Mr. Ferrier that the Missionary Society pay the balance due to members of the staff on the date above mentioned, and that the Department\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, make Ottawa, Ont.\nmake a grant to cover the other outstanding accounts. On this point permit me to say that the creditors are pressing very strongly for payment, and it is needful that a settlement be made without delay. I sincerely trust that the Department will accept Mr. Ferrier's recommendation, and even then you will see that our loss has been an enormous one.\n\nTo sum up the whole, you will see that the loss to the Society on the three Institutions covering the respective periods mentioned aggregates nearly forty-one thousand dollars. In the case of similar Institutions managed by other Societies, where serious deficits have occurred in the past, the usual practice of such Societies or Churches has been to appeal to the Department to recoup the entire amounts thus expended over and above the per capita grant, and in a good many cases (possibly all of them for aught I know), the demand has been met. I am not disposed to urge a claim of that kind, but I do think that the Department might very well bear one-half of the deficiencies that have been incurred. One thing is certain, we cannot proceed further on the present basis, and so far as I am concerned, I would rather abandon these schools altogether than have to provide a large annual deficiency out of money which our people have given for a different purpose.\n\nBespeaking prompt and favorable consideration of these matters by the Department, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.

Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Sup't. General.\n\nWith reference to the deficit of the McDougall Orphanage referred to in communication from the Rev. Dr. Sutherland on the 8th. of August last, I beg to say that from a report made by the Rev. Mr. Ferrier who, in company with the Rev. Dr. Woodsworth, made an audit of the books of this institution for the executive of the Methodist Missionary Society and it was found that there were unpaid accounts existing in January last to the amount of $5,790.11. They placed the cost of conducting the school to the 30th. June last at $409.89 which, added to the above, would make a total deficit of $6,200. The Methodist Missionary Society wishes the Department to assume $5,218.00 of this liability for the reason that the Meth. Miss'y Society had, during the last seven years that this school has been in operation, been called upon to pay a total of $24,396.70 in excess of the Government grant which, during that period, amounted to $20,160. Adding the deficit to these two amounts the total cost of the school for that period would reach $50,756.70; and the proposition of the Church is that the entire cost of management during the last seven years should be equally divided. To make this equal division it would require the payment of $6,218.00 from the Department which is the amount they wish it to contribute. It appears that the creditors are pressing for payment of their outstanding claims, and Mr. Ferrier furnishes in his report (on this file) a statement of the unpaid accounts which amount to $5,790.11 as before stated.\n\nThe per capita cost of this school as shown by the audited amounted to $181.00 a year for each of the seven years covered by the auditor's report. This is an exceedingly high rate for a school of this class, and it would show a great lack of economy.\nEconomy in the management, if not worse. The late Principal has been removed as a consequence of his mismanagement, and the Methodist Church are anxious to have the financial matters of the school straightened out so that the new Principal may have a fair start. There would appear to be no doubt as to the insufficiency of the per capita grant of $72.00 to meet the running expenses of boarding schools in the Territories, and it is for the Department to decide what relief it will afford to the Church towards wiping out this existing deficit.\n\nThe Department has paid deficits for other Churches carrying on Indian schools, and the Methodist Missionary Society to as favorable consideration of their claims as any other of the religious bodies similarly situated; but, as in nearly every instance, such deficits have been occasioned by the extravagance and incompetency of the men placed in charge of the schools, I think that the Missionary Society should be called upon to make a better selection of principals and staff for the performance of the work: to do this it would most likely be necessary to hold out better inducements. It would, therefore, seem advisable for the Department to consider whether the present per capita grants are sufficient to counterbalance the increased cost of wages and living.\n\n[Signature]\nOctober 30th, 1905.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to inform you that the funds at the disposal of the Department will not provide for the deficit at certain Indian schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society before paid, and the question is still left for further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Chief, General of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid A. Robertson, P.O.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, February 16, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Agent Fleetham's report on the McDougall Orphanage for the month of January, last, in which he calls attention to the unpleasantness which has been going on for some time amongst the staff.\n\nThe department has noted your remarks on this head, and would like to be informed as to the action taken by the Methodist Missionary Society to restore harmony.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th ultimo, expressing the desire to be informed as to the action taken by the Methodist Missionary Society to restore harmony amongst the staff of the McDougall Orphanage, I beg to say that the Society sent Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, about the first of the present month to endeavor to restore harmony not only amongst the staff, but between the staff of the School and the workers of the Methodist Mission on the reserve outside of the School. He has sent me a copy of his report to Rev. Dr. Sutherland, which states that Miss Walsh, the former teacher of the school, had resigned, which resignation had been accepted, and the friction within the School itself had therefore mostly ceased. In sympathy with Miss Walsh, the Indians had held an indignation meeting or two, in which some of the Mission workers had taken part. Mr. Ferrier when there held a meeting with the Indians and the Mission workers and explained matters so that the unpleasantness will likely disappear.\n\nThe Indians, however, are not quite satisfied with the new school management\u2014they were so fed and pampered when they visited the School while the late Principal was in charge that they do not relish the economical\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\neconomical change. They had also been allowed by the former Principal to take many of their children home every Friday until Saturday evening, that they complained of the restriction which I insisted the new Principal should make not to permit general running home of the pupils.\n\nI have, however, on Mr. Ferrier's suggestion, sent a programme to the Principal that he may allow two or three pupils in turn to go home every Friday evening to be returned in time for Sunday's services. By this programme each pupil will be allowed to visit home about once in ten weeks.\n\nIf this does not satisfy the parents, Rev. Mr. Ferrier recommends compulsion to secure an attendance of children at the School. But I believe there is a better way, if clergymen would only have the patience to use it\u2014namely, more kindly and faithful dealing with the parents in their homes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 2, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ult., advising the Department as to the action taken by the Methodist Missionary Society to restore harmony amongst the staff of the McDougall Orphanage.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. H. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\nSecretary, General Board of Missions,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Sutherland,\n\nTransmitted herewith is a report of my recent visit to the Morley Mission and the McDougall Orphanage.\n\nAfter receiving your instructions to go to Morley I called on the Hon. David Laird, Indian Commissioner, for the purpose of having him or his Assistant accompany me; but this was not possible at the time, he having just returned to his office after business in Ottawa and his Assistant being away. However Mr. Laird gave me all assistance possible by correspondence with the Government Agent at Morley.\n\nI spent from Mar. 3rd, to Mar. 6th, at Morley and during that time I had a personal interview with Mr. Fleetham, Rev Mr. Ing and his wife, and with every member of the staff of the Orphanage, also with Miss Buehler who is doing missionary work for the W. M. S.\n\nI preached to three different congregations on the Sabbath and on Monday held a public meeting with the Indians. Had a conference with all the Methodist workers present, and from all the information gathered it appears that trouble had been brewing for some time at the Orphanage. Miss Walsh, the teacher, having had her own way so long in this Institution, her conduct conveyed the idea of her superiority, and it implied that she should be consulted in many matters of the management of the Institution. She thus created an uncomfortable feeling in the general spirit of the Institute, and even went so far as to refuse to recognize\nMrs. Oakley as the matron of the Institution, always sending some other member of the staff or even sending a pupil of the school when she required anything from the Matron. She positively objected to make any effort to remove the unpleasantness or misunderstanding. Mrs. Oakley very naturally resented this treatment, and a snubbing of one another began, one getting as good as she gave; a tit for tat sort of policy seems to have been established which reached a crisis that is well expressed in Miss Walsh's resignation of which the following is a literal copy:\n\n\"Jan 8, 06\n\n'Mr. G. B. Oakley,\nPrincipal\n\nSir,\n\nPlease take notice that I now vacate the position of teacher on account of the unreasonable, unladylike and unChristian conduct of the matron toward me during the last month.\n\nI shall pack my Xxxx belongings as quickly as my strength will permit and leave the premises.\n\nYours etc.\n\n(Sgd) M.A.Walsh.\"\n\nThe acceptance of this resignation by the Principal would have remedied the difficulty had all other people strictly attended to their own business. But this was not the case. Sides were taken among the workers, a couple of indignation meetings were held by the Indians and thus the fire spread.\n\nThe acceptance of this resignation by the Principal was not the real cause of the outside interference. The former policy of pauperizing the Indians by feeding them in the Orphanage and giving them supplies to carry home has been changed, and the Red dog is growling for his bone; also, the\ngoing to Calgary where more suitable prices can be obtained when purchasing goods for an institution of this kind than at the local stores and neighboring ranches, has, at least, revealed the teeth of a White dog who might be growling over the lost bone of trade.\n\nIn accepting the resignation of the teacher I believe the Principal acted in the best interests of the Institution. It is for the Department and Church to say whether he has a correct policy in not feeding the parents and friends at the Institute also, when he goes to Calgary or wherever he can do the best for his supplies when handling trust funds.\n\nThe public meeting held on Monday was well attended by the Indians. Mr. Fleetham, Mr. Oakley and Mr. Ing were also present. I made a plain frank statement of the whole situation, pointing out what the government and church were doing for the people and what we expected of them in return. Mr. Fleetham spoke to them of many matters on the reserve. A somewhat lengthy conference followed in which Miss Walsh's name was never mentioned by the Indians. If they are let alone there will never be anything more from them re the going of the teacher.\n\nAt a meeting of the members of the staff, Mr. & Mrs. Ing and Miss Buehler, the whole situation and a few general principles that should govern the conduct of individual members of the staff were thoroughly discussed. A very fine and friendly spirit was manifested and, I believe, any lack of harmony was due to misunderstandings rather than any ill-feeling toward each other. Now that these misunderstandings are removed, there will be no further difficulty with the members of the staff and the missionaries.\n\nThe task of securing pupils for the school is a difficult one. The Indians are attempting to hold up the school until the management come to their terms. Two or three boys are continually running away from the school. How to deal with them is a serious question.\nfor it may be, that in some cases the parents may be more to blame than the pupils.\n\nThe only objection they would offer as to why they were not sending their children to school was, that they could not get them home on a visit. A programme will be proposed for a limited visitation on Friday, returning on Saturday in time for preparation for the Sabbath, this to be given to those of good behavior and whose parents will see to their prompt return. If this fails in its desired effect, viz., to remove their objection and to fill the school with pupils, some more stringent method must be adopted. This is certainly a case where compulsory attendance ought to be enforced, for it is an outrage to allow those people in their ignorance to hold up a well-equipped institution when it exists for the express purpose to educate and elevate them.\n\nThe agent, Mr. Fleetham, is in full sympathy with the Principal, and is doing what he can to assist him in his work. Mr. Fleetham is placing before the people opportunities of work. To assist him in this the Department have provided about 100 (One Hundred) head of cattle during the past year. They have also set aside 12 (Twelve) sections of timber land from which the Indians can get good wages for hauling logs for lumber to the sawmill and cord-wood to the track at $32 a car load. The great bulk of the ration beef is purchased from them at 7\u00a2 per lb. From these sources of industry the Band has earned about $18,000 during the past year, all of which is certainly in the right direction since it tends toward making the people independent.\n\nThe financial management of the orphanage is much improved. The total expenditure with all accounts paid up to March 1st, and salary to March 31st, is $4750. Of this amount\n\n$478 has been spent for cattle\n247 \" \" \" horses.\n53 \" \" \" harness\n145 \" \" \" wagons.\n180 \" \" \" an ice house.\n\nThis $1100 being spent in the way of assets, the outlook is\nthat about $5200 will meet the ordinary expenses for the year ending June 30th, 1906.\n\nThere have been some improvements made to the Orphanage. The basement floor has been cemented and a good job made with one exception, viz., the cement is not under the wash basins nor bath tubs. This portion of the floor is of common board flooring and is liable to become more or less saturated and unsanitary. Considerable plumbing has been done and the material and workmanship are good. A system of flush closets and three bath-rooms have been fitted out, also one set of wash basins for the boys and another for the girls. A system of hose sufficient to reach any part of each flat with a strong pressure and a good supply of water gives excellent fire protection. An ice house has been built and preparation made for the keeping of a moderate supply of fresh meat during the summer months.\n\nA number of cattle have been purchased and the herd numbers about 70, quite sufficient for a start on a range that will not maintain more than 100 head. The habit of allowing other cattle to run on the range has been discontinued. A good barn of moderate size would be of great benefit to the ranch and farm, and it is hoped that this will be built by the Department in the near future.\n\nI understand the exchange of land has been made between the Department and the Methodist Church in the interest of the Reserve and Mission property. The portion received by the Mission ought to be fenced as soon as possible, for without a fence it is of little use to the missionary.\n\nA home for the Principal ought to receive immediate attention. The bulk of his personal effects are not yet unpacked and will not be until some suitable place is found for their storing.\n\nOn general principles one of a family is sufficient on the staff of an institution of this kind.\n\nIf the Principal has no family, and his wife has to live\nin the main building, she should have some position, and the only suitable position for her is the Matronship. Then, if she is the Matron, she is first the Principal's wife and second the Matron and such a dual position will lead to partiality and it will only be a question of time till it ends in trouble.\n\nI would strongly recommend the building of a home for the Principal and thus have the way open for some other person than his wife to be Matron.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) T. Ferrier.\nSir,\n\nDuring the past winter the Rev. T. Ferrier of Brandon was requested to visit the Boarding School at Morley, and to report to the missionary authorities concerning present conditions, and the needs of the school. The Report having come before our Executive Committee, I am instructed to send you a copy for the information of the Department.\n\nI would call attention to the statement in page 4 of the amounts which have been paid by the Principal for cattle, horses, harness, wagons, and the building of an ice house, amounting in all to $1100 (Eleven Hundred Dollars). All these expenditures were essential to the carrying on of the work and none of them is of such a nature that it should be made charge upon the funds of the Society. The ordinary running expenses exceed, by quite a sum, the amount granted by the Department, and this makes it all the more necessary that these expenditures on equipment should be met by parliamentary grant. I would respectfully request, therefore, that the necessary sum be put in the estimates for next year.\n\nI would also call attention to Mr. Ferrier's recommendation concerning the building of a good barn and the erection of a home for the Principal.\n\nI have the honor, Sir, to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary,\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 19, 1906.\n\nRev.

I have communicated with the proper authorities to have this matter investigated, and if they find the facts to be as alleged, to take such steps as may be necessary to put an end to the antagonism.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 15, 1907.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nFrom a report of an officer of this Department who visited the McDougall Orphanage in the latter part of March, it would appear that Mr. Ings, the resident missionary, seems to believe that criticism of school methods and those of the Agent of the Department form part of his duties and his action has greatly hindered the successful recruiting of pupils.\n\nIt is evident that neither the educational nor moral welfare of the Indians can advance, if the Missionary is not in close sympathy with the school management. The Department considers that the above remarks call for an investigation by your Society.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nDictated - Dr. S.\n\nToronto, July 10th, 1907\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant #116968/1 referring to a report that the Rev. Mr. Ing, the missionary at Morley, has been pursuing a course antagonistic to the Boarding School and the Agent of the Department which \"has greatly hindered the successful recruiting of pupils.\"\n\nI have communicated with the Rev. J. A. Macdonald, D.D., of Edmonton, President of the Conference, requesting him to enquire at once into the matter, and have expressed my opinion that if he finds the complaint justified he ought to give Mr. Ing the alternative of changing his attitude respecting the School and the Agent, or be dismissed from the Mission.\n\nOn receipt of a report from Dr. Macdonald I shall communicate further with the Department.\n\nI have the honor, Sir, to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 22, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th inst. I beg to say that the Department appreciates the prompt action you have taken regarding the complaint that the Rev. Mr. Ing, missionary at Morley, has been pursuing a course antagonistic to the boarding school there.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nDictated - Dr. S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Morley Boarding-school.\n\nI have the honor to state that a visit was recently paid to the Morley Indian Boarding-school by the Rev. T. Ferrier, who spent some five days in carefully inspecting the whole Institution, examining the accounts, etc., etc. I have just received his report, a copy of which he informs me has been sent to the Department at Ottawa, and another to the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg. You will infer from that report that Mr. Ferrier has serious doubts as to the suitability of the present Principal. Mr. Oakley is earnest, conscientious, and anxious to succeed, but does not seem to have commanded the confidence and good-will of the Indians. This may in part be due to the fact that under his predecessor the Indians were lavishly entertained at the Boarding-school, and were also paid in money or goods for bringing their children to the school, and for returning them to the same after the holidays. Mr. Oakley has refused to continue either of these practices, and this may have something to do with his unpopularity among the Indians. Nevertheless the success of the school is a primary consideration, and as soon as Mr. Ferrier returns from the Pacific Coast I will consult him in regard to the nomination and appointment of a new Principal.\n\nRegretting that such a course seems to be necessary, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Burtland\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGeneral Secretary\nBanff, August 8th, 1907.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nToronto,\nOnt.\n\nDear Dr.:\n\nIn response to your request contained in a letter sent to me on July 17th, I went to Morley. Bro. T.C. Buchanan went with me. There I met Rev. T. Ferrier and Rev. A. Barnet. We reached Morley on the morning of Aug. 7th, and spent the day there looking into the matters of which you wrote. Bros. Ferrier, Barnet, Buchanan and I had a conference with Bro. Ing in his own home and subjected him to a very close examination as to his attitude to the Orphanage and to the Indians. We questioned him very closely as to his statements to the Indians respecting the Orphanage and its management. We went even beyond this, and asked him about his attitude when statements were not made. After a searching enquiry all went to the Orphanage and there held another enquiry in the presence of Mr. C.B. Oakley, the Principal of the Orphanage. We all think that the following facts were brought out by the enquiry:\n\n1. That Bro. Ing has held very firmly to the idea that schools on the reserve would be a better way of educating the children than the method now adopted. But since Bro. Ferrier sometime ago told the Indians distinctly that such could not be, Bro. Ing asserts positively that he has never said a word to the Indians about a school on the reserve. But he has discussed the matter with the white people around the Mission, and this has given ground to the suspicion that he was not loyal to the school (the Orphanage).\n\n2. Bro. Ing has been persuaded that the conditions necessary to the conservation of good health did not obtain in the Orphanage and has expressed his convictions freely to some of his neighbors, and even to the Principal, but never\nto the Indians except on one occasion when he indirectly gave evidence of his conviction by advising one Indian to send his boy to a white man's home. Still it is evident that this conviction has made him, to say the least, apathetic so far as getting children to go to the Orphanage was concerned.\n\n3. We find further that he says that the dislike of the Indians for the Principal was so intense that he felt that there was little use in urging the Indians to send their children to an environment which they so thoroughly disliked. Whether this dislike was due to a more strict regime or to improper management of the school we make no declaration. Mr. Ing thinks it was due to both causes.\n\n4. We find that Mr. Ing's actions and attitude at a meeting called to request Mr. Oakley to reinstate Miss Walsh gave the Indians the impression that he was opposed to the management of the school. We find further that Mr. Ing did not call the meeting and did not lend his influence to the calling of the meeting. Still we consider that he made a mistake in having anything to do with the meeting.\n\n5. We find further that Mr. Ing and Mr. Oakley have never gone out together to get children. The reason for this lies largely at the door of Mr. Ing.\n\n6. We find that Mr. Ing did on one occasion go to get a boy, but he so emphasized the regulations of the school and government that he frightened the Indian and his boy.\n\nWe find, then, that Mr. Ing by his attitude, rather than by an outspoken criticism of the school or its methods, has to some extent hindered the school from securing children. We have pointed out to him clearly his error on this point, and have insisted that he must be loyal not only in word but also in act and attitude to the order of things established by the Church and the Government. We find that Mr. Ing has nothing to say against the Indian Agent, but speaks of\nhim in the highest terms. But Mr. Ing's extreme sympathy for the Indian has made him take some positions which would by the Indian be interpreted as indicating opposition to the \"powers that be.\" I have pointed out to Mr. Ing the seriousness of the situation and have told him that unless harmony and hearty co-operation prevailed we would have to move him to another field. He has promised to co-operate with Mr. Oakley and to go out with him on the reserve to get children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) J. H. Riddell.\n\nP. S. I can give you a more detailed account of the enquiry if you wish it.\nDictated - Dr. S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to a letter from the Department No. 116963/1 dated July 15th, in which complaint was made of the course said to have been pursued by the Rev. Mr. Ing, the resident Missionary at Morley, Alberta, in regard to the Boarding-school and the Indian Agent, I beg to say that I communicated at once with the Rev. Dr. Riddell, President of the Alberta Conference, asking him to visit Morley at his earliest convenience and make full inquiry respecting the alleged complaint. Dr. Riddell complied, and I have just received his report, a copy of which I enclose for your information, from which it will be seen that after an exhaustive enquiry Mr. Ing was required to pursue a different course respecting the Boarding-school, and that failing to do so he would be moved to another field. It appears, however, that Mr. Ing has not intentionally or knowingly antagonized the Agent, but on the contrary seems to hold him in high esteem.\n\nTrusting that the action taken will be regarded as satisfactory, so far as Mr. Ing is concerned, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nOttawa, August 28, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th inst., forwarding a report from Dr. Riddell, President of the Alberta Conference, giving the result of the enquiry into the course pursued by the Rev. Mr. Ing, the resident missionary at Norley, in regard to the boarding school there and the Indian Agent, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the action taken by the committee of enquiry and trusts that no further differences between the parties concerned will occur.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLeaft,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, August 28, 1907.\n\nRev.

Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nMorley, Alta.\n15th August, 1907.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to report that on the 5th of July the Indians called their usual annual meetings, to lay their grievances before the Rev. McDougall. I attended the meeting.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe next question was Day Schools. Again he was in sympathy with them, and promised he would do all in his power to have the two day schools re-opened.\n\nThis as you are aware is against our own views. He did say there were plenty of children for both the Orphanage and Day Schools, but did not even advise them to fill the Orphanage to its fullest capacity, and wait developments as to the future requirements, but expressed to them plainly that the Day Schools should be opened at once.\n\nx x x x\n\nThe sympathy shown so openly by the Rev. gentleman and the Missionary, Mr. Ings, with the Indians simply means what it has always been, \"discontent\", and thus it will remain until something definite can be told the Indians plainly, and prevent this continual misunderstanding.\n\nx x x x\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. T.J. Floetham,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nSir:\n\nI enclose you copy of report referred to in Mr. Agent Fleetham's monthly report for July. I am exceedingly sorry that Rev. Dr. John McDougall, who occasionally does work for the Department in the matter of surrenders, should give advice to the Stony Indians at Morley, apparently at variance with the policy of the Department.\n\nIn regard to re-opening Day Schools on the reserve, a few years ago I had the day school near the Agency re-opened, and the Methodist Authorities objected to it, as it injured the attendance at the McDougall Orphanage. The same cause exists still, as the Orphanage is far from full. The Agent, I know, has done what he could to induce the parents to send their children to the Orphanage, but with indifferent success. If Rev. Mr. Ings, the Methodist Missionary on the reserve, and others of influence, would only help to fill the Orphanage, then when it would not hold all those seeking to attend it, a day school or two might be opened.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 29, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Indian Commissioner, in forwarding Mr. Agent Pleetham's report for July, states that he is exceedingly sorry to see that the Rev. John McDougall, who occasionally does work for the Department in the matter of surrenders, should give advice to the Stony Indians at Morley, apparently at variance with the policy of the Department.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Ing, the resident Missionary, was reported to be acting in a similar manner and he was disciplined by the Alberta Conference and we have the assurance of Dr. Sutherland that he will change his course.\n\nI do not know whether the Methodist Missionary Society has any control over Rev. Mr. McDougall at present, but the Department should, I think, request him, to assist the Agent and the Principal of the Morley Boarding School in recruiting and not to antagonize the Indians against it, as he is apparently doing.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI think he might be written to and asked if he has been to meet the Indians and if so, what he said to them.\nOttawa, September 4, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs\u2014\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to inform the Department whether you have given any advice to the Indians on the Morley reserve as to the opening of the day schools there.\n\nThese Indians are apparently opposed to sending their children to the boarding school, and the Department is anxious that it should be filled up before dealing with the question of reopening the day schools, and for this reason it would prefer that the day schools should not be reopened at present.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. John McDougall,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCalgary Septm 9th 14\n\nExa.\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to Yours of Septm 6th I have to inform you that I had addressed the Indians on the Morley Reserve as to the opening of Day Schools there. I will say that I was present at the meeting of these Indians when the work was gathered and discussed. The Board School and the Day School and I did at that time lay in each other's presence of the Agent and the Principal of the School that I sympathized with the Indians in their desire for the reopening of the Day schools on the Reserve. That the conditions were now much changed from the time when those schools were closed. If the above is termed driving the Indians in the matter then I did do so - at any rate the children are not attending any school and I am afraid that so long as the present Principal is in charge of the Board School the Indians will be reluctant to send their children to it.\n\nEven if this was false there would still be some 50 children imprisoned for\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Signature]\n\nJohn M.\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI have been informed that this institution is to be closed. Because of this information my present staff is leaving. There seems to be some doubt as to when the closing will come into effect and I am ordering the children back after three weeks holiday. Am I warranted in securing another staff for at least the next three, six or nine months? If you are not in position to answer this question will you be good enough to enquire of the Department and give me the information at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am, Your obedient servant,\n\n(signed) C.B. Oakley,\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter from the Principal of the McDougall Orphanage, which speaks for itself, and must say that I know nothing concerning the closing of this institution except by hearsay. I am therefore unable to give a satisfactory answer and would be obliged to be informed of the Department's intentions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 8, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th inst., inclosing a communication from the principal of the McDougall Orphanage for information as to whether the school is to be closed or not, and in reply I beg to say that you should refer him to the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools, as this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, October 14, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent Fleetham in his report on the McDougall Orphanage for the month of September, last, says that on his visit he found only four children and now that the treaty payments are over and the Indians go away there will be none left, unless the Church takes prompt action with the Missionary and probes the matter down to the ground.\n\nThis evidently refers to the antagonism of the Missionary to the school. The course pursued by the Rev. Mr. Ing, the resident missionary, in regard to this school has already been the subject of correspondence with the Rev. Dr. Sutherland, who hoped that the differences would cease, but apparently they have not.\n\nWhatever the trouble, the school is run down to such an extent that it is useless continuing it, and it would be better to close it now than later on in the season, as it would be the means of saving considerable outlay. This school will never be a success and will die of inanition in any event. The Methodists have the Red Deer school to fall back on, and there is no reason why a day school could not be established on the reserve, if the Indians reside there permanently.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Fleetham\nHon.

T. Perrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa January 5, 1912.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr Pedley,\n\nIn the year 1886 the Methodist Conference petitioned the Department to subsidize the MacDougall Orphanage at Morley and grant the institution the title to the lands it occupied.\n\nThis was agreed to and the school was allowed a per capita grant of $60.00 for 50 pupils and a free patent was issued to the Methodist Missionary Society for 1,170 acres on the Morleyville settlement four miles east of the eastern boundary of the Stony Reserve. The patent contained a reservation that the land shall not be used for any purpose but that of an orphanage for Indian children without the consent of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs expressly given in writing.\n\nThe Department was then called upon to provide new buildings which it did at a cost of $11,500.00.\n\nThe Department purchased an adjoining lot to obtain a water supply for the school as there was none available.\non the school lands and paid for bringing the water into\nthe building by a pipe line which cost $2,750.00.\n\nThe per capita grant was increased to $72.00 in\n1898 for 40 pupils and continued at this rate until the school\nwas closed in November 1908.\n\nPrevious to the recognition of this school there\nwere two day schools in operation on the Stony Reserve known\nas Nos. 1 and 2. The Methodist Church suggested the closing\nof these two day schools and the enlargement of the orphan-\nage to accommodate all the children available on the reserve\nand the No. 2 school was closed in September 1896 and No. 1\nin 1898. No. 1 was reopened in 1902 and again closed in 1903,\nreopened in 1909 after the closing of the MacDougall orphan-\nage and was finally closed in July 1910.\n\nThe closing of these schools leaves the 130 child-\nren of school age on the Stony reserve without any chance of\nsecuring an education. The day schools were closed to help\nthe orphanage but the orphanage closed itself through mis-\nmanagement.\n\nThe committee appointed by the General Board of Mi-\nsions for the Methodist Church report as follows on the\nsituation at Morley:- This question was thoroughly discussed\nand the Committee can see but one way of solving the edu-\ncational problem for the Morley Indians, viz; To erect a\ncommodious and modern Boarding School on a new site somewher e\nto the south of the present railway station. The school house should be separate from the residence so that the children who reside near enough may attend as day-pupils. When the Boarding School is filled, a day school might be opened on the north side and a hot mid-day meal provided by rig from the Boarding school.\"\n\nThis recommendation of the Committee has remained in abeyance pending a decision as to the future of the Red Deer Industrial School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nAboriginal Schools\n\nThe question of providing suitable educational facilities for the Stone Indians should be taken up at once.\nMemorandum\n\nMr Pedley,\n\nCan anything be done for the education of the Stony Indians before money is provided in the Estimates for that purpose? No provision is made in the main estimates for the educational needs of these Indians; but I understand, however, that the question of providing funds for the establishment of a boarding school will be dealt with when the Supplementary Estimates are being considered.\n\nMartin Benson\nTo the Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Barnet and myself are arranging to be at Morley on the 16th of September for the purpose of meeting the people and discussing with them the question of building the new boarding school.

We, the Indians of the Wesley, Chiniquay and Bearspaw Bands situate on said reserve do hereby solemnly agree to the following propositions:\n\n1st: That the best method for the education of our children is in a residential industrial school erected upon the reserve.\n\n2nd: That if the Indian Department will build for us a modern and well equipped school to accommodate not more than 75 pupils, we will provide, as soon as it is ready for occupation 50 children, and we further promise that we will use our influence with the Indians to fill the school and keep it full as long as we have sufficient children belonging to the above mentioned Bands. All the children are to be subject to the inspection of a medical officer who shall be appointed by the Indian Department.\n\n3rd: That if at any time the children shall run away from the school we shall be responsible for immediately returning them.\n\n4th: That the school shall be operated for eleven months each year and that all the pupils shall be given a holiday of one month's duration each year. If at any time a parent is considered by the medical officer to be seriously ill and such parent asks an extra vacation for the pupil the request shall be granted.\n\n5th: We request that the Methodist church manage the school according to the rules and regulations of the Indian Department.\n\nWe sign this document believing it to be binding upon our successors in office, and in harmony with the wish of a large majority of our people.\n\nPeter Wesley X his mark (chief)\nJonas Benjamin (councillor)\nTom Chiniquay X his mark (chief)\n\nWitnessed\nJ.W.

Mr. Barner, of the Red Deer Industrial School, was here last week and I attended three meetings with him and the Stony Indians, to talk about building and operating a school on this Reserve. As Mr. Barner was acting for the Dept. in this matter I did not want to report on same until you had heard from him, so as to avoid any confusion in the deal. However, I enclose herewith copy of a resolution signed at that time, the original of which is held by Mr. Barner.\n\nThis resolution, in my opinion, is not of much effect, for the reason that there are double the number of Indians on this reserve, of school age, than that mentioned viz - 75, and if a school were built to accommodate this number only it would lead to trouble in case the Dept. were to enforce a school attendance upon every child of school age on the Reserve. Another reason against it is that the Indians absolutely refused to sign away their right to a day school, though Mr. Barner talked to them for hours in an endeavor to have it included in the report.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Barner gave the Indians some good reasons against having a day school on this particular Reserve, and I fully agree with him when he states that the children will have no home on the reserve when the parents go away on their annual hunt, which lasts about three months, unless it is decided to have a boarding school, as it would break up a school to allow the children three months holidays every year to go hunting with their parents.\n\nThe Stonies held a meeting with Mr. Campbell and myself early in August, and the ones who attended were all in favor of a day school only, they would not talk about a boarding school being established here at all.\n\nIn view of the above you will see that the Stonies are very changeable, and really do not know what they want in the school line, but the fact remains that they want a school of some kind, and are willing to send their children if a school is erected.\n\nSome of the educated Indians, who attended school for years, say they want a residential industrial school, to be erected upon the Reserve, but they do not want to send their children to a school run by missionaries. This brings in something entirely new I believe, but it is the outspoken opinion of some of the leaders of the tribe, and they told Mr. Barner this when he held council with them last week.\n\nWe have in the above three distinct propositions, and it will take a visit here from some person in authority with the Department, who is used to school matters, to find out what is really best to do in the affair. From my position as Agent I cannot give an opinion without getting into trouble with the church, but I will give my endeavors to help out on whatever is finally decided upon.\nIn reply to your enquiry as to accommodation here for a school and teachers quarters, I beg to say that there is a splendid site \u00bd mile west of agency for buildings, with a spring on the hill above same which would deliver water to top floor of any building erected.

Park of Cochrane, the medical attendant for the Stony Band and he said there were no institutions to see and that the health of the Indians there was fairly good, some tuberculosis, but he thinks not so much as in former years. He, Dr. Park, says he would like to have the hospital opened up again, but only on a proper basis. Mr. Markle whom I saw at Hobbema says it is no good, that they had tried it before without any success and at a great expense, but that he would like to see a boarding school and I think perhaps he is right, because in my estimation you can inculcate knowledge into the minds of these people more by illustration than in any other way and by this method it will be an education to those at home which will enhance the condition of the health amongst them generally.

The building of the school house is in a fair state of repair. I am under the impression that the seats have been moved out and taken down to the hospital building for our Indian school. I do not think I would charge them anything for it. I am strongly of the opinion that the best disposition that can be made of the property is to sell it. If this is not soon done you will be under the necessity of putting new fences all around it in order to keep it from being over-run. The building will be kept in a better state of repair by being used and I think I would simply make this proviso.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Fletcher, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nMorley School District,\nMorley, Alta.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nIn personal communications from the resident missionary on the Morley reserve west of Calgary, information has been brought to my attention concerning the growing desire on the part of the band to have school facilities provided. During the last 12 years 80 young people have grown up on the Morley reserve, only 40 miles from Calgary, without any education whatever. I understand the Indians waited on the agent to ask for a school and Mr. Yeomans promised to refer the matter to Ottawa. I am of the opinion that a residential school is what is needed at this point.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Bower\nSept. 30, 1922.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI visited the Morley Reserve this summer and informed certain members of the Indian Band that it was not possible for the Department to erect a boarding school on their reserve in the immediate future. I learned that there was a total of 130 children of school age. Families are scattered over the reserve, hunting and lumbering and wandering to neighboring ranches and farms for day labour. I am of the opinion that the whole band should be moved to a more suitable reserve site, as it is practically impossible to earn a respectable living as they are situated at present.\n\nI am favourably disposed to make a grant to the resident missionary, of $60 for the coming winter to meet the express charges on lantern slides supplied gratis by the Extension Department of the University of Alberta. These slides are used in a series of educational lectures to the members of the band during the winter months.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nFor some time past considerable agitation has been carried on in the Province of Alberta, and particularly among the officials of the Methodist Church in the neighbourhood of Morley, re the necessity of some educational effort being put forth for the benefit of the children on the Morley Reserve. As you know, practically nothing has been done there since the closing of the McDougall Orphanage.\n\nThe object of this communication is to place before you the necessity of some provision being made in the way of a Residential School at the earliest possible date. I trust that this will be placed among the claims that are to be dealt with in the near future.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 13th, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the interview with the Minister and his Deputy that I had the favor of having yesterday, the immediate needs of Morley from an educational point of view were discussed.\n\nThe Minister mentioned the fact that he had been approached by some leading men regarding the matter and suggested that something be done at once in the way of a day school, for which a couple of workers might profitably be engaged, this being a temporary arrangement, with the hope of a Boarding School being built in the near future. In harmony with this, I would make the suggestion that a teacher be appointed to teach in the building that was formerly secured for a hospital, and also that a Nurse and Field Matron be employed as a co-worker with her, with a view to giving the women instruction in their homes on sanitary conditions, preparation of food for the sick and the care of their children. With two such officers in the building, it might be quite possible to prepare a noon hot meal for the children attending the class-room.\n\nThis is understood to be a temporary arrangement only, with the understanding that a Boarding School for the accommodation of fifty children be built as soon as funds can be secured from Parliament for that purpose.\n\nInasmuch as the Department would be furnishing certain staple lines of food suitable to prepare a meal for the children, I would suggest that each of these ladies receive a salary of $600.00, with furnished room and rations of the staple lines provided for the children.\n\nI may say that we have already secured an application from Mrs. Jackson for the position of teacher. She has been very highly recommended to me -- not only as a teacher but as a person who is very sympathetic and motherly toward children.\n\nWould the Department kindly favor me with a\nreply to this communication, addressed to the Methodist Mission Rooms, Toronto, not later than Wednesday of next week.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Ferrier\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 23rd, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Superintendent General has requested that temporary provision be made for the education of the children of the Stony Band at Morley, Alta. The Department would be pleased to have you nominate two teachers for work among this band. There will be housing facilities for them in the building formerly used as a hospital. One teacher will be responsible for the teaching of the Indian youth - the other can be released for extension work on the reserve, doing such duty as is generally performed by a field matron.\n\nThe Department will arrange for what furnishings are necessary for the teachers' rooms upon requisition through the Indian Agent, and will make arrangements to supply rations for a noonday lunch for the children attending school. It may also be advisable to place in the building, for the use of the second teacher, a small supply of drugs and medicines.\n\nThe Department will offer a salary of $600 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law, to each of the teachers appointed.\n\nMr. Agent Yeomans is being informed of this action and, I believe, you would be well advised to communicate with the Rev. Mr. Barnet and the local missionary so that some preparations can be made immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOTTAWA, October 23rd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Superintendent General has requested that some temporary arrangement be made for the education of the Indian youth on the Stony Reserve. I have to inform you that the Methodist Church authorities have been asked to nominate two teachers to conduct a day school and to do extension work in the Indian homes. Their headquarters will be the building formerly used as a hospital.\n\nCertain furnishings will be allowed for the teacher's rooms, and rations will be supplied for a hot lunch for the children attending the school. A small supply of drugs will be placed at the disposal of the second teacher, who will be doing work similar to that of field matron.\n\nThe Department will pay these teachers at the rate of $600 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nWhen the Methodist Church authorities or the teachers present themselves on the reserve you should give them every assistance possible in connection with this undertaking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

Deputy and Secretary.\nIndustrial School, Brandon, Man.,\nOctober 27th, 1926.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of October 23rd No. 119-1-1:\n\nI trust the Department had a letter concerning commencing at Morley, from the Missions Rooms which was to the effect that we would use the church as a class-room to carry on school work and fit up the hospital building for accommodation of twelve or fifteen children in residence thus opening up a boarding school on a very small scale for the time being. This was in substance the action taken by our General Board of Missions. I have written Dr. Manning today asking him to send a copy of the resolution which was to be sent to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nAs soon as this is received by the Department would you kindly inform me as to what action I should take on behalf of the Church? I expect to leave for Morley about the 6th of November. I may say further that the above action was taken by the Board on condition that the Indians would agree to heartily support this movement on behalf of the education of their children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant, referring further to the programme at Morley, Alta. I have noted that it is the wish of the Methodist Church authorities to take into residence in the old hospital building a small number of children, and that the church will be used as a classroom.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General has sanctioned this scheme, and upon requisition from you or one of your officers, through the office of Mr. Agent Yeomans, the Department will supply certain equipment to provide residential facilities for 12 or 15 children. We will endeavour to pay current expenses for which we can find funds, and from the 1st of April, 1923, the school can be known as semi-boarding in type, and will receive a per capita grant.\n\nMr. Agent Yeomans and Mr. Commissioner Graham are being informed of this action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, November 2nd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer further to the subject matter of official communication of this file number dated the 23rd ultimo.\n\nThe Methodist Church authorities have been given permission to take into residence in the old hospital building some 12 or 15 children whose homes are more remote from the Agency. The church will be used as a classroom. Church representatives or the teachers will requisition through your office to the Department for certain equipment to provide residential facilities, and for classroom supplies.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham is being informed of this action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H. Yeomans, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nRE MORLEY, ALTA.,\nINDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nAt the recent session of the General Board of Missions, held in October last, strong representations were made relative to the desirability of proceeding as soon as possible to provide a Boarding School for the Indian children on the Morley Reserve, Alberta.\n\nAfter due consideration, the Board adopted the following resolutions:\n\n\"WHEREAS no school facilities have been provided for the Indians at Morley for some years;\nAND WHEREAS a Boarding School was planned for, but delayed by the War and post-war conditions;\nTHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT we urge upon the Government the necessity of proceeding with the Boarding School as originally planned for, with the utmost dispatch;\nAND FURTHER THAT provision be made for converting the present hospital building into a dwelling for resident pupils, and using the new church for classrooms; thus accommodating twelve to fifteen pupils in dormitories and caring for the ten children resident adjacent to the agency.\n\nThe above plan subject to reasonable co-operation by the Indians.\"\n\nThe proposal to convert the present hospital building into a dwelling for resident pupils and to use the new church for classrooms is suggested as a temporary expedient and not by any means as a substitute for the Boarding School for which we trust the Government will soon provide necessary funds.\n\nIt is many years since the Indians on the Morley Reserve have had adequate facilities for the education of their children, and we cannot regard it as other than deplorable that a generation of Indian children is growing up on this Reserve without even the elements of an English education. We trust that the necessary appropriation to provide the Boarding School will be made at the next session of Parliament.\n\nI am,\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nHon. Charles Stewart,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nC. E. Manning\nOttawa, Nov. 8, 1922.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge your letter of the first instant, concerning the proposed boarding school for the Indian children at Morley, Alta. I have noted that the Methodist Missionary Society urge upon the Government the necessity of a small residential school for this band and for the immediate provision of some facilities.\n\nThe Superintendent General and this Department are seized with the importance of the needs on the Stony Reserve, and the advisability of erecting a boarding school will be kept in mind when the requirements for the coming fiscal year are brought to the attention of the Government.\n\nIt has been decided that in the interim some temporary work should be undertaken, and I am pleased to inform you that the Department has already communicated with the Rev. T. Ferrier, of Brandon, Man., and the interested Department representatives, authorizing a day school with two teachers and residential facilities for 12 or 15 children in the old hospital building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. C. S. Manning, B.A., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary of Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\nTORONTO. ONT.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nLast week I paid a visit to Morley, Alberta and discussed with your Agent and our missionary what might be considered as a policy for carrying on our school work. I would respectfully suggest the following:\n\n1. That all supplies needed and have to be purchased, be done so through your Agent on the recommendation of Mr. Staley. That the Agent be responsible for keeping up the supply of wood and water. For the latter there is an elevated tank in the building which will hold about five barrels. The need can be met by attention every other day. The river is close by but too far for small children to carry the water.\n\n2. That Mr. Staley have the over-sight and care of the buildings looking after the welfare and care of the pupils and teachers. In other words he will be the principal without any salary consideration from the Department.\n\n3. That no parents or friends be given any meals at the school. If it is found that large pupils attend late in the day for the sake of the hot dinner, that they be ruled out at meal time.\n\n4. That a general announcement be given regarding the opportunity of sending the limited number to reside in the school, but that no pressure of any kind be brought to bear upon the parents to bring their children. That all who bring them be required to sign the usual application form required for admittance to our residential schools.\n\n5. That all legitimate means be used to secure a regular attendance of all children of school age to the classes.\n\nMr. Staley has kindly offered to give special night lessons to any over sixteen who desire the same. The policy of giving meals to parents and friends became a system of pauperizing these people at the MacDougall Orphanage years ago. I counted as many as twenty-one sitting down at one meal and they even demanded food for others at home. When the principal was changed and this policy discontinued, they refused to send their children. When they got them home on holiday they failed to return them! This was the reason the boarding school was closed. If the Department approve of these recommendations it might be well to have them incorporated with any other suggestions the Department see fit to make and sent officially to Mr. Staley and your Agent. I believe both of these men will heartily endorse the above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the policy to be pursued at the semi-boarding school at Morley, Alta.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion that the current supplies necessary be purchased through Mr. Agent Yeomans. He is being instructed in this connection and will be asked to arrange for a supply of wood and water. We have also informed him that the Rev. Mr. Staley is to keep supervision over the school, but without remuneration from this Department.\n\nOur agent is being instructed to make a general announcement regarding the opportunity of sending a limited number of children to reside in the school. We are informing him that children living within a two mile radius should not be allowed residential facilities for the time being. It is felt that the opportunity to reside at the school should be given to those children that are more remote. He is being advised, also, that those children residing close to the school should be instructed to attend regularly.\n\nThe noon-day meal will be supplied to those who attend punctually and must not be offered to parents or other visitors.\n\nWe have further requested Mr. Agent Yeomans to intimate to the Rev. Mr. Staley the nature of our instructions. Mr. Commissioner Graham, also, is being advised of the policy that will be followed at this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir:\n\nIt has been decided that the current supplies necessary at the semi-boarding school at Morley be purchased through your office. This Department will honour accounts properly certified by you for provisions that are considered necessary. Will you also arrange for a supply of wood and water. Accounts in this connection should be properly certified by you and directed to Ottawa for payment. Expenses that have already been incurred in connection with initial supplies and the starting of the institution should be - as you have already been informed - directed to the office of Mr. Commissioner Graham.\n\nThe Church authorities have asked the Rev. Mr. Staley to keep a supervision over the school, so you will please favourably consider this gentleman's requisitions and recommendations. His services are being given without remuneration from the Department.\n\nYou should make a general announcement to the Indians of the band concerning their opportunity of sending a limited number of children to reside in the school. Those living within a two mile radius should not be allowed residential facilities for the time being. It is my opinion that those children more remote from the school should be given the privilege of residence. You will also instruct the parents that those children living close to the school will be required to attend classes regularly as day pupils. A noon-day meal will be supplied to those who attend punctually, but must not be offered to parents and other visitors or any pupils that come to school apparently for the meal only.\n\nPlease inform Rev.

I might say that she is a competent woman, and an ex-pupil of the McDougall Orphanage, and speaks the English language well.

SCOTT.\n\nRe Appointment - Housekeeper - Morley Indian School.\n\nMr. Agent Yeomans requested in letter of February 8th, last, that the services of an Indian woman as a permanent helper be engaged to assist in the baking of the bread, the preparation of meals, cleaning, washing, etc. The Agent was asked to recommend a suitable woman for this position, and the amount that should be paid. He now forwards the name of Mrs. Jacob Two Youngmen, an Indian woman, who is willing to do the work required for a compensation of $35 per month. The Agent states that she is a competent woman, an ex-pupil of the McDougall Orphanage, and speaks the English language well.\n\nI beg to recommend, for your approval, the appointment of Mrs. Jacob Two Youngmen as housekeeper for the Morley School, at a salary of $35 per month. The position of \"Housekeeper\" is exempt from the operation of the Civil Service Act insofar as the principle of competition is concerned.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nMr. Christianson informs me that Miss Herbert, Matron of the Stony Agency School, brought to his attention the fact that she had been allowed $35.00 per month for extra help, and was at the present time hiring Indian women, and paying them so much per day. This was very unsatisfactory, as the Indian women did not come regularly. She asked permission to hire white women, and said she was sure she could get one for the same money.\n\nIt seems to me there should be no objection to this. Will you kindly advise me or take it up with her direct?\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C.

She should be designated on your vouchers for salary due her, as \"Housekeeper.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. H.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the Department's letter of July 3rd last, No.119-1-1, granting permission to hire a white woman to assist in the Indian school on this reserve, I have the honour to state that up to the present it has been impossible to hire a white woman for this purpose; the supervisor, the Rev: Mr. Staley, therefor asks permission to again try an Indian woman until such time as a white woman shall be available. He has a suitable woman in view, in the person of Jane Halloway, of this reserve, who will do the work required of her for a remuneration of $35.00 a month. She is a strong woman and can, I think, perform the work satisfactorily.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, August 18, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves of the hiring of Jane Halloway to assist in the Indian school on the Morley Reserve at a salary of $35.00 a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent,\nMorley, ALTA.\nTo the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nOn Sept. 13th, I examined all the children of the Indian school at Morley, Alta. These children are just entering school, and a few, perhaps 20%, appear undernourished. The majority have signs of pulmonary tuberculosis but none have cough or expectoration. The majority have palpable glands in the neck, but no case of open sores, or scrofula. One case of this which was had a year ago, is now completely healed. I arranged to have one girl in the school who is nearly blind see Dr. J. H. Murray of Calgary. I have not heard from him yet. A boy in the school also has had severe inflammation of eyes but his sight is not yet seriously impaired.\n\nThe food and the sanitary conditions\nappeared to be excellent.\n\nI believe that a better supply of cow's milk would be a great benefit.\n\nJames Waite M.D.\nOttawa, October 12th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the last instant, reporting on your examination of the pupils of the Morley Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you found certain of the children undernourished, and that a number show signs of pulmonary tuberculosis. We hope that, as a result of the food supplied these children at the school, they will improve in appearance and general health.\n\nAny expense in connection with the treatment given the girl mentioned by you, who is nearly blind, will be paid upon receipt of proper vouchers, which should be forwarded through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nHobt. Pringle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, ALTA.\nOttawa, October 25, 1923.\n\nMadam:\u2014\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from Inspector Buchanan, who visited the Morley Indian Day School on the 25th ultimo.\n\nIn his report the inspector makes the following suggestions which the Department trusts you will keep in mind and carry into effect as far as possible:\n\n(1) Pupils should be urged and encouraged to make the greatest effort each day. Reading and language work should be stressed. Arithmetic should be made as practical as possible, with particular reference to the use of money and ordinary measurements.\n\n(2) The two divisions into which the pupils are now divided are not sufficient. It would be advisable to make three or four classes, especially in reading. This suggestion, together with the training in oral English should be stressed. Readers should be used with the more advanced pupils.\n\n(3) Physical training should receive attention, especially the games suggested in the Physical Training Syllabus generally used.\n\nIf you require any books for supplementary reading purposes or, if a football, etc., could be used to advantage by the children, you should forward a requisition for the same through the office of your local Indian agent and your request will receive immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Madeline Beck,\nMorley,\nALTA.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter file 119-1-1, dated 25th instant, regarding Mr. Inspector Buchanan's report on the unsatisfactory attendance at the school on this reserve, I beg to inform you that with the present accommodation the attendance will never be any other way. This semi-boarding school has accommodation for one teacher, one matron, and thirteen pupils, and these attend school regularly, together with three to four children of Indians who do not go away hunting. The majority of the Indians are away working or hunting about six months of the year, and as there is no accommodation at the school for their children they are compelled to take them away. When the parents return the children attend school, if the distance is not too great, and weather too cold for the return trip each day. I have spoken to many of the parents and they would be willing to leave the children at school if there was accommodation. The children seem bright and learn very quickly, even the youngest at the school at present can speak and understand English. If funds were available in 1924-25, I would strongly recommend the building of a boarding school on this reserve to accommodate sixty pupils and we would guarantee a yearly average attendance of fifty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 7, 1923.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the attendance at the Morley Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you consider it would be advisable to erect a residential school on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would be glad to know if you have given permission for this school to be closed for two months every year, or was there an exception last year. One month, to my mind, is long enough for the school to be closed for summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

In reply I have to inform you that this school has not been placed on per capita grant and that for the time being the classroom activities shall be guided by the regulations governing day schools.\n\nIf you consider it in the best interests of the children who are attending this school to carry on the activity for eleven months of the year, I shall be pleased to hear from you. Arrangements might be made to increase the salaries of the teachers employed and secure their services for the longer term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 3rd 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just returned from the Province of Alberta, where I have been for nearly three weeks. I visited the Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Blackfoot, Hobbema and Edmonton Agencies, and eight Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nMORLEY AGENCY.\n\nThere is a school on this Reserve, carried on under the auspices of the Methodist Church. I was rather impressed with the Supervisor, Mr. Staley. He has a good grasp of what is required of him, but is certainly working under great disadvantages. There is a large number of children on this Reserve who could attend school, and some provision will have to be made. My idea is that we should make a departure here in the way of schooling our Indian children. I would like to see two detached buildings\u2014one for boys and one for girls\u2014of the bungalow type; and the other building in which would be situated a diningroom and kitchen. I believe we could look after the accommodation of fifty children at a cost of from $15,000 to $20,000, and give them just as good training, if not better, than we can get in most of our institutions which cost four times as much money. I would be glad, at some future date, to give the Department a rough sketch of what I think should be done. I am quite sure something should be done here. There are sufficient children on the Reserve to warrant the Department's doing something more for their education.\n\n(Sgd.) W.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nIn my report of my last visit to Morley Agency, I mentioned the fact that there was a large number of children of school age in this Agency, who are not attending school. The number not attending school is 95, and something will have to be done, at an early date, to give these children an education.\n\nI believe with quarter the amount of money we are now paying for Boarding schools, we can erect a school of the type I described, and give these children as good training as we are now giving in Boarding Schools. I would ask that the Department let me know what they think about this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 30, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your general report of the 3rd instant relative to your proposals for the education of the Indian children at Morley. I have also your No. 409-11B of the 25th in this connection. An experiment with the bungalow type and detached buildings for Indian residential schools commends itself to me. I should be pleased if you would prepare rough sketches of the bungalow residences for boys and girls and of a building which could be used as a dining room, kitchen, laundry, etc. The present arrangements at Morley for classroom facilities could, no doubt, be continued for the time being.\n\nIn the meantime I have noted for our next Estimates the advisability of doing more for the children of this agency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 24, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nRegarding the attached letter from J. T. Shaw, M.P., referring to the lack of school accommodation on the Morley Reserve, I beg to say that there is at present a school of the semi-boarding type being conducted. Fifteen children are in residence and besides approximately 25 children attend irregularly as day pupils. The school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. The classroom activities are carried on in the building that was formerly used as a hospital in connection with the old McDougall Orphanage boarding school. Quarters are fitted up in this building as a residence for the teachers and for the children.\n\nThe members of the Band, the Church Authorities and the late Agent Yeomans have requested from time to time that a boarding school be established. There are about 130 children of school age on the reserve. The families are scattered over the reserve, hunting and lumbering and wandering to neighbouring ranches and farms for day labour.\n\nWe have two teachers and a cook employed at the semi-boarding school which is now being conducted. One of the teachers, besides assisting in the classroom, also performs certain field matron's duties on the reserve as her time will permit.\n\nCommissioner Graham, in April last, recommended that two detached buildings of the bungalow type, one for boys and one for girls, and another building to contain a dining room and kitchen should be erected to provide accommodation for at least 50 children. He estimated the cost of the buildings to be about $20,000. He was requested to furnish a sketch of the proposed buildings. We have no funds provided for the extension of the work or the erection of buildings on this reserve. There are, no doubt, a number of children who are receiving no education.\n\nI find that Mr. Ferrier has noted for next year's Estimates the providing of a grant to erect the buildings as recommended by the Commissioner. The amount this Department expended during the last fiscal year in payment of salaries of teachers, food, clothing, repairs and other expenses for the maintenance of the semi-boarding school was $3,842.24.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nJune 20th, 1924\n\nHon. Charles Stewart,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nMy information from the Morley Reserve would indicate that some 14 children are crowded into a little building used for a school, and that applications have been received for the admission of 40 additional children, but these have had to be refused. I am assured that without the slightest difficulty enough children could be readily secured to fill a residential school built to accommodate 60 children.\n\nI would appreciate very much if you could tell me the intention of the Department with regard to meeting the educational requirements of the Stoney Indians in this regard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sd) J.T.

There are about 130 children of school age on the reserve. The families are scattered over the reserve, hunting and lumbering and wandering to neighbouring ranches and farms for day labour.\n\nWe have two teachers and a cook employed at the semi-boarding school which is now being conducted. One of the teachers, besides assisting in the classroom, also performs certain field matron's duties on the reserve as her time will permit.\n\nCommissioner Graham, in April last, recommended that two detached buildings of the bungalow type, one for boys and one for girls, and another building to contain a dining room and kitchen should be erected to provide accommodation for at least 50 children. He estimated the cost of the buildings to be about $20,000. He was requested to furnish a sketch of the proposed buildings. We have no funds provided for the extension of the work or the erection of buildings on this reserve. There are, no doubt, a number of children who are receiving no education.\n\nI find that Mr. Ferrier has noted for next year's Estimates the providing of a grant to erect the buildings as recommended by the Commissioner. The amount this Department expended during the last fiscal year in payment of salaries of teachers, food, clothing, repairs and other expenses for the maintenance of the semi-boarding school was $3,342.24.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. Macdonald\nOttawa, June 24th, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Shaw:\n\nI have your letter of June 20th regarding the school children on the Morley Reserve, and may say that some weeks ago this Department noted for next year's Estimates an item providing funds for the erection of a school building which would accommodate from fifty to sixty children.\n\nI regret that there are no funds available for the immediate carrying out of these plans, but in the meantime, a school of the semi-boarding type is being conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. I understand that fifteen children are in residence and that some 25 attend as day pupils. We are desirous of providing greater accommodation for boarding pupils, however, as the families of this Agency are widely scattered and the children are unable to attend day school regularly.\n\nThanking you for the interest you have shown in this matter, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.T. Shaw, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa\n\nSuperintendent General\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that pupil No.16 of the semi-boarding school on this reserve, and whose Band No.is 139 Bearspaw's Band, was discharged from the school on the 30th June last as having reached the age limit, 16 years, set for this school.\n\nHis place is being filled by Walter Simeon, aged 12 years, of No.87 Chiniquay Band. This boy appears to be healthy and fit for the school, but will be examined by the medical officer before he is admitted.\n\nForms of Admission and Discharge of these pupils, together with medical certificate, will be forwarded to the Department later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

The Department, however, meets the expenditures which are made under the supervision of your office. It is left to the school management and the Indian Agent to admit and discharge pupils as considered in the best interests of the school. It will not, therefore, be necessary for you to forward admission and discharge forms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nR.

Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss Dorinda Sturdy and Miss Mildred Herbert as teachers of the Morley School. Salary at the rate of $650.00 a year, plus bonus, will be paid to each of the above teachers.

A building programme at this point was mentioned in your 100-9 of April 3rd and your 409-11B of April 23rd.\n\nI believe accommodation should be provided at the outset for 60 pupils. Please let me have at an early date your suggestions, so that the preparation of plans may proceed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nF. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 17th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I left here on August 28th., to visit some of the Western Agencies. The first point visited was Morley. My object in going to this point was particularly to see the new school, which was recently built and opened.\n\nNo doubt the matter of the additional children whom the parents wish admitted to the school, will be drawn to your attention, and I would just emphasize the fact that the Department should, in my opinion, insist on some of those from the Morley School being transferred to Edmonton, in order to make room for the newcomers.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 2, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to that portion of your letter of the 17th ultimo which is relative to the advisability of transferring pupils from the Morley Indian Residential School to Edmonton. I have written to the Rev. Principals of both institutions to this end.\n\nI am pleased to learn that the building at the Morley School is satisfactory and that the Principal has made a favourable impression.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe expect that the new school at Morley will be ready for occupancy about the middle of next month. Would it be possible for the Department to pay the per capita grant for the full number in attendance on March 31st for the entire quarter? This information will help me in my programme in providing finances to meet the expense of securing necessary supplies. You might also state what the per capita grant is to be.\n\nA reply at your earliest convenience will oblige\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, January 29, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, concerning financing of the Morley Indian Residential School for the first few months after the Church authorities take charge. In reply I wish to state that the Department makes a payment in lieu of per capita grant to assist the Church up to the time a sufficient number of pupils are enrolled, so that the school can be placed on the per capita grant.\n\nYou should instruct the Rev. Principal to prepare a statement showing Salaries, Food, Farm and Garden, Fuel and Heat costs. After the school is opened to pupils, a date will be fixed for placing it on a per capita grant basis and all the expenses prior to that date which the Department undertakes in part. Receipts for all expenditures other than salary should be presented with a certified recapitulation. In connection with the accounts for food, only those items which are for food consumed prior to the fixed date can be used.\n\nThe per capita grant for the Morley School will be about $140. It is possible, however, that a supplementary grant will provide for an increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

The first point visited was Morley. My object in going to this point was particularly to see the new school, which was recently built and opened. I found the building to be modern, and first-class in every respect, with the lighting and pumping plants working perfectly. There is a feeling however, on the part of the Principal, that it is not large enough to accommodate all the children of the reserves. I am not prepared to say at the present time that the school is not large enough for the work; especially if we are to carry out the original plan, and insist upon the children leaving this school after a period of time, and going on to Edmonton, where they will be taught the higher grade work. I am told by the Agent that there are a number of Indians who desire to place their children in school, but there is no accommodation for them. These people should wait until some of the children now in the Morley school are transferred to Edmonton. This, however, cannot be effected until the Department insist upon it being done.\n\nThe school at the present time is filled to capacity, having about thirty boys and the same number of girls. The staff appeared to be up-to-date, so far as I could judge. The Principal has a good start in the way of poultry and milking cows, and later on he expects to have pigs. Farming, of course, will not be carried on at this school, outside of a garden and growing a little green feed.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nNEW SCHOOL FOR INDIAN CHILDREN NOT BIG ENOUGH\n\nOn Opening Day Institution at Morley Has to Turn Twenty-five Away\n\nFORMAL CEREMONY HELD ON THURSDAY\n\nResolution Expresses Appreciation to Department for Opening School\n\nWith accommodation for sixty Indian boys and girls, the new school at the Morley reserve, recently completed by the federal government at a cost of $15,000, proved inadequate to meet the demand according to information brought back to the city by Dr. A. M. Scott, superintendent of Calgary schools, who attended the formal opening of the institution Thursday.\n\nBefore noon of the day that the school was opened, the principal, Rev. L. J. Staley, found that he had 25 more pupils than he could accept; or a total of 85.\n\nAccommodation Provided\n\nThis school provides accommodation for 60 boys and girls to live in the institution, as well as classroom space for the school attending for day pupils not living in the school.\n\nOn behalf of the institution, Mr. and Mrs. Staley welcomed the visitors at the formal opening; who had come from Calgary, Okotoks, Banff, as well as from Morley and the reserve. First, under the direction of the teachers, a programme of outdoor sports for boys and girls was carried out at a nearby lake, which afterwards led to the rising roofs of the school, where Mr. Riley presided over the gathering, welcomed the guests and called on Rev. T. Ferrier, representative of the Christian Education for the United Church, who gave a brief account of the history of Indian treaties in the west, outlined the policy of the church and the government regarding Indian schools, and recounted the steps leading up to the opening of the present institution in Morley. He congratulated the principal and staff, praised the contractors and financiers, on behalf of the department of Indian affairs, declared the school open. Mrs. John MacDougall followed with a carefully prepared account of the story of the MacDougall orphanage and training school over forty years ago, and indicated some of the difficulties and struggles of the early days.\n\nResolution Passed\n\nAfter these two interesting addresses a motion was proposed and unanimously accepted by all present as follows:\n\n\"Resolved, that the members of the Calgary presbytery and all others here present do place on record their appreciation of the work of the federal government through the department of Indian affairs, in creating and furnishing this well-equipped Indian-hostelling school at Morley for the education and training of the boys and girls of the reserve. We further express the hope that this school may be used mainly in the hands of the United Church of Canada of developing a fine type of Christian citizenship among the Stony Indians in the future. We also urge that this situation be forwarded through the Rev. T. Ferrier, to the department of Indian affairs at Ottawa.\"\n\nFollowing the resolution, words of appreciation were expressed for the faithful work of the pioneer missionaries of Alberta, especially the late Rev. George MacDougall and his son, afterwards so well known throughout our province. Among those present were Mrs. John MacDougall, as well as other members of the MacDougall family, several of whom were present at the opening, including Mrs. John MacDougall, Mrs. Douglas MacDougall, as well as Mrs. Nellie Macdonald, a daughter of the late Rev. George MacDougall.\n\nThe first Indian orphanage and training school in temporary quarters was opened twenty-five years ago with fifteen boys and girls. One of these, George McLean, was present at the opening and was called upon to say a few words to the gathering. He spoke briefly but forcefully, setting forth his idea that Indian and white people all belong to one great family, but that in his opinion the Indian child had lost its way and needed the help of the white people to enable them to develop as civilized people would put them on a level with the whites. He expressed his pleasure at the opening of this school and hoped it would be beneficial to all the boys and girls of the reserve.\n\nFollowing a musical programme, tea was served by the staff of the institution, and the guests, having examined the building throughout, expressed themselves as thoroughly delighted with the new premises inside, and left with the feeling that a great step in advance had been taken by the opening of this school at Morley.\nNEW SCHOOL FOR INDIAN CHILDREN NOT BIG ENOUGH\n\nOn Opening Day Institution at Morley Has to Turn Twenty-five Away\n\nFORMAL CEREMONY HELD ON THURSDAY\n\nResolution Expresses Appreciation to Department for Opening School\n\nWith accommodation for sixty Indian boys and girls, the new school at the Morley reserve, recently completed by the federal government at a cost of $46,000, has proved inadequate to meet the needs, according to information brought back to the city by Dr. A.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nDecember 11, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nYou will remember that the Department signed an agreement with the Calgary Power Company for the lighting of the Indian Residential School and the Agency Buildings at Morley, Alta. The current charges were to be met by Vote II for the agency and the school management for the institution. The school pays $30.00 per month.\n\nThe Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals has drawn my attention to an educational program on this reserve, for which they receive no assistance from the Department. A number of Indian children attend the residential school classroom as day pupils and the school management is providing a teacher and a heated classroom without assistance from us. You will remember that the classroom used for the Morley institution is the church building.\n\nI wish to recommend that the Department make a grant of the electric light current expenses, or $50 per month, to the school management for this day school activity and that Mr. Indian Agent Pringle be instructed to send the accounts of the Calgary Power Company to Ottawa for payment, when they could be charged to Vote II and Indian Education Vote in the ratio of 2 to 3.

He was told that this action was taken because of the day school activity undertaken by the residential school.\n\nMr. Pringle has written to state that there are no day pupils attending school but only those who are in residence at the new residential school. I should be grateful for an explanation. I believe that those children whose homes are close to the institution should attend as day pupils and that the more distant ones should be enrolled in residence, and I understood that this was the intention of the church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Staley in charge as Principal.\n\nAt the time of my visit there was an epidemic of Chicken Pox in the school. However, I went over the building and was pleased to note that everything was in good order. It was a very cold day when I was there but the building was nice and comfortable. The equipment and furniture has been well placed in the school and the whole building from top to bottom is being well looked after.\n\nA cold storage and ice house is to be erected for the school and the Agent has had authority for this expenditure and has placed the order for the lumber. The only change I made in his plans was to instruct him to line the inside of the ice house with shiplap. This would cost between $25.00 and $30.00 and will be much more satisfactory as it will give an air space and there was sufficient money authorized to make this expenditure.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

T. Ferrier and Mr. Indian Agent Pringle that there is some confusion as to the extent of the class room activity carried on at the Indian Residential school Morley.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Pringle is perfectly correct when he states that there are no day pupils attending school but only those who are in residence at the new Residential School. Further it should be stated that our class room accommodation is so limited that we are unable adequately to deal with our pupils from the Residential school.\n\nIn a letter to Rev. T. Ferrier you state a policy that you believe should be followed, namely \"those children whose home are close to the Institution should attend as day pupils and the more distant ones should be enrolled in residence\". This policy has been so often put forward without due regard to all the facts that I think it should be said perfectly frankly that it is an impossible one. There are not more than half a dozen homes within reasonable distance of the school and the children of these homes except for two or three months in the winter time are for the most part like their parents nomads.\n\nThere is no hope here of dealing with the situation on the day school basis.\n\nI would request the department to ascertain through the local Agent the situation as it now confronts us.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEdgar J. Malby\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter, file #44-119, dated 15th ultimo, I beg to inform you that Mr. Staley, the Principal of the school here, brought me a letter from the Department to Mr. Ferrier regarding day pupils attending the school.\n\nAs I stated in my letter of the 4th instant, there have never been any day pupils attend since the new school was opened. The church is being used as a classroom, there being no provision made for one in the new school. Half of the pupils attend the classroom in the morning and the other half in the afternoon; the church not being large enough to hold all at one time, and the children are not getting the schooling they should; so you can see how utterly impossible it is to take in any day pupils. There should be another classroom and also another teacher.\n\nI have spoken to parents whose children have not been able to get into the school, suggesting that they send their children to Edmonton but they refuse. They do not object to their children going to school but they do not want to send them off the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 1, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo and I note that it is not possible to secure a regular attendance of any day pupils at the Morley Indian Residential School. Mr. Indian Agent Pringle, as well as yourself, has indicated that another classroom is needed and I have made a note for our Estimates for the ensuing fiscal year in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Rev. Mr. Staley has also written and he indicates that there are not a sufficient number of children, regularly living at home, close to the school to warrant a class for day pupils. I have made a note for future estimates in connection with the classroom requirement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.B. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRobt.

The expenditure for this would not be warranted as their attendance would be very irregular, but additional class-room space is required for the pupils now in residence at the new school, as they only receive half-day tuition each under the present system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 13th ultimo pupil Isaiah Crawler, No. 5, of the Indian school here, fired the school building by placing paper chips and wood on the coal heap in the basement and setting a light to same. That when the fire was noticed the flames were spreading across the wall on the southwest side. The staff put the flames out before further damage was done. The pupil escaped from the school but was brought back on the 19th ultimo by two Indians.\n\nOn the 22nd ultimo I held an investigation at the school as the pupil, Crawler, claimed that four other boys knew that he was going to light the fire. This turned out to be true.\n\nThe Principal of the school severely punished the boys and Isaiah Crawler was sent to the Edmonton school on the 23rd ultimo. He is one of the biggest boys of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T.

We are pleased to note that this fire was discovered in time and that very little damage was occasioned. It is noted that action which ought to have a salutary effect has been taken, and that Isaiah Crawler was sent to the Edmonton Indian Residential School on the 23rd ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Just before I arrived there they had an epidemic of Influenza at the school and practically all the children had been sick. Two boys took Pneumonia and one of these died, but the other was on a fair way to recovery when I left and the other children were all up and around before I left the Agency. A special nurse came up from Calgary and was still there when I left.\n\nThe Indians were all excited over the sickness and seemed to blame the school authorities, and some of them were very bitter against the Principal. They presented me with a letter and petition. You will admit the letter has not very much meaning to it, but they persisted that it go forward to the Department, and I would ask the Department to acknowledge the receipt of same through the Agent. I met the Chief and Councillors and enquired into their grievances. They seemed to be under the impression that they had a say in the management of the school, and further, that they were barred admission to the school when their children were sick. I informed the Indians that they could not possibly have any say in the management of the school as the Principal was responsible to the Department, but that they could always put their complaints before the Agent or the Inspector when he visited the Agency. I enquired into the matter of them\nalways allowed to see their children if they are sick, and any time the parents come around, when the children are not in school, they are allowed to see them, so the Indians have no ground for complaint in this matter. I went over the school and saw the children, and in my opinion, they are well fed and well cared for. The mistake that was made, which probably brought about the colds, was that the children were allowed to go out with their parents to a feast held between Christmas and New Years, and the weather being extremely cold, a number of the children caught colds, and naturally it soon went through the school. The Principal admitted this, but the parents are just as much to blame, as they went and got the children and everything would probably have been well if the weather had been a little milder. However, it is most regrettable that a death occurred.\n\nYou will note that in the last part of the letter handed in by the Indians, they state \"for we want a preacher that is honest and true to the Indians\". Some of the Indians made the remark that they could not listen to a preacher they did not believe in. I told the Chief and Councillors that I was quite satisfied with the way in which the school was being managed and that I intended to report that way to the Department, but if they were not satisfied with the missionary part of Mr. Staley's work, they had better take the matter up with the Rev. Mr. Barner, Western Supt. of Missions, and the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, who is, I believe, still Supt. of the Methodist schools that went into the Union. I also told them that as far as the school work was concerned, I was quite satisfied that it was being carried out to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Indians\nStory Reserve Indians Oct\nJan 1st 1928\n\nCallers of School Discipline\nAs we are not being satisfied of the way the children has been treated in the school, so we want to have our way just the same as the school has his rights to say what he likes, and we Indians also want to be treated fairly with the school discipline, for we want the side as there has been too many little things that we the Chiefs and Counsellors would make a settlement and as it has not been on business to work for school, and the principle will start\nworking himself working\npolice of a defense\nwithout our consent\nwe also want this\neducation of our in the\nbest way that could be\ngot and that is why we\nwant a better discipline\nthan it has been that is\nwhy we are signing this\nfor we want a practice that is\nhonest and true to the\nIndian\nThe Morley Trading Company\n\nF.

H. J. Staley principal of the Indian residential school at Morley, Alta., reported to me that a fire had been located and extinguished in the basement of the school on the night of the 16th inst. Upon some of the boys being questioned by Mr. Staley the following morning, they stated that the above named had been the one who had started the fire.\n\nUpon making investigations in connection with this matter I took down the following statements:\n\nMacFarlane Dixon stated:\u2014\"I am a pupil in the Indian residential school at Morley. On the 15th inst., Isaiah Crawler asked me to help him to burn down the school building, he spoke to me several times about burning down the building, but I did not help or see him set the fire.\"\n\nSteinbauer Bar stated:\u2014\"I am a pupil in the Indian residential school at Morley. On Sunday the 16th inst., Isaiah Crawler told me that he was going to make a fire in the corner of the building in the coal bin, he asked me to stay on the steps and look out for Mr. Candy and let him know if he was coming, but instead of staying on the steps I went down to the barn. I did not see Isaiah start the fire.\"\n\nHorace Rider stated:\u2014\"I am a pupil in the Indian residential school at Morley. On the 16th inst., before going to Sunday school Isaiah Crawler sent me to Dick Amos for some matches. I went to Dick Amos who was in the barn and got some matches from him and gave them to Isaiah. After sunday school Isaiah told me that he was going to build a fire in the Coal bin, and not for me to tell anyone. I did not see Isaiah start the fire, the first that I knew of the fire being lit was with the fire alarm ringing.\"\n\nDick Amos stated:\u2014\"I am a pupil in the Indian residential school at Morley. On Sunday the 16th inst., Isaiah Crawler sent Horace Rider to me for some matches which I gave to him. Before sunday school I saw Isaiah put some wood in the corner of the building in the coal bin and put some coal oil on it. He noticed that I was watching him and told me to get out of the building. After sunday school all the other boys went up stairs to take off their clothes, Isaiah went into the coal bin and I followed him, he told me if I did not get out he would hit me. I then went up stairs and in a short time the fire alarm was sounded.\"\nOn the morning of the 17th inst., Isaiah Crawler, age 16, ran away from the school, and upon making enquiries as to his whereabouts, James Rider, Stoney Indian, informed me that on the night of the 18th inst., Isaiah Crawler had come to his camp and had left soon after he had arrived, saying that he wanted to return but did not like the Police to take him back. Rider stated that he expected Crawler would return to his camp again that night the 19th, and requested that he should return him to the school. As there was no charge laid against Crawler I informed Rider that it would be in order for him to bring him Isaiah in, which he did accompanied by George McLean on the 20th inst.\n\nOn the 20th inst., Mr. Pringle, Indian Agent, Morley, Alta., had Isaiah Crawler brought before him in the office of the Indian School, and questioned him regarding the fire. Crawler stated that he had started the fire at the instigation of three other boys, namely, Steinbauer, Bar, age 14, Horace Rider age 16 and Dick Ames age 12, saying that if the school burnt down he would not have to attend school anymore. Mr. Pringle then questioned the other three boys mentioned, and with the exception of Dick Ames they denied having anything to do with the fire. Dick Ames stated that when he gave Horace Rider the matches for Isaiah, he knew what Isaiah wanted them for but was too afraid of Crawler to report.\n\nAfter Mr. Pringle had questioned the boys he ordered Rev. J. Staley, principal of the school to punish Isaiah Crawler by giving him 12 straps, 6 on each hand, and that he be sent to the Indian residential school at Edmonton. At this time I enquired from Mr. Pringle if he did not intend taking criminal action against Crawler for attempt of Arson, he informed me that he did not intend taking any criminal action until such time as he heard from the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, as he had reported the matter to them, but it was quiet in order for him to have Isaiah punished by Mr. Staley under the regulations relating to the education of Indian Children.\n\nI might state that Isaiah Crawler's parents who are camping four miles west of the Bar-O Ranch were not informed that Isaiah had attempted to burn down the school and were not consulted in this matter.\n\nMr. Staley did not carry out the Agent's orders regarding to punishing Crawler, but took him to Calgary on the 22nd inst., handing him over to the principal of the Indian residential school of Edmonton that point.\nThe Commissioner\n\nSir,\n\nForwarded for your information. If any further action is taken in connection with this matter a report will be forwarded.\n\nLethbridge,\n1-11-27.\n\nCh. Isen Jungel,\nSupt.,\nCommanding Southern Alberta District.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., Feb. 15th, 1928\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Morley Indian Residential School which was inspected by Mr. Christianson a short time ago. I am quite satisfied that the epidemic referred to was nothing more than a mild form of 'flu' which was brought about by the unusually mild weather at this time of year and it is not the old 'flu by any means. The death which occurred is the first one that has taken place since this school opened and I can understand the Indians feeling as they do and they are only too prone to complain, no matter how much a person might do for them. I have every reason to believe that the Principal went out of his way to care for the children during the epidemic. I pay very little attention to the complaints made by the Indians regarding Mr. Staley in the attached memorandum.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 409-11 of the 15th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Christianson on his inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School. The Inspector's remarks regarding the recent epidemic of influenza at this school have been noted.\n\nWe are communicating with the local Indian Agent regarding the petition from a number of the Indians on the Stony Reserve who complain of the management of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 23rd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on his recent inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School. A petition was also forwarded by the Inspector, which is presumably signed by a number of the members of the Stony Reserve, regarding the management of the school and the care received by the pupils during the recent epidemic of influenza which resulted in the death of one of the pupils.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Indians interested that the Department considers that the pupils at the school are receiving every care and attention from the Principal and staff and is quite satisfied with the way in which the school is being managed. The Inspector states that during the epidemic of influenza the children who were sick were given every attention, and while the death of the boy is regretted, it is considered that it was through no lack of careful nursing, as, we understand, a special nurse was engaged to assist the school staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRobt. Pringle, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nBrandon Industrial School,\nJanuary 18th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is reported to me by Rev. Mr. Staley that the average attendance at the Indian Residential School at Morley has been 63 for the past three quarters. Is the Department allowing the grant for the extra three pupils? By doing so, the Department will assist the management as we find it a difficult school to finance.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGRD\n\n[Signature]\n\nGrant for 60\n\nRegret it will not be possible.\n\nCould come to transferred to Edmonton?\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 23rd, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, informing the Department that the average attendance at the Indian residential school at Morley has been 65 for the past three quarters, and requesting that grant for the three extra pupils be allowed.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that it will not be possible to allow grant in excess of the 60 pupils already provided for at this school. Could not arrangements be made to transfer the excess pupils at Morley to the Edmonton Indian Residential School?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nInspector of Indian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe United Church of Canada\nBoard of Home Missions\n\n289 QUEEN ST. WEST\nTORONTO 2, ONTARIO\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nMay 10,\n1929.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nEver since the opening of the Indian Residential School at Morley, Alberta, an overdraft of $1,000.00 has been carried at the bank. In addition to this another deficit of $500.00 accumulated during the past year.\n\nIt was agreed at the recent meeting of our Sub-Executive Committee that the Home Mission Board make provision for this recent deficit of $500.00 and at the same time it was resolved to ask the Department of Indian Affairs to take care of the $1,000.00 overdraft which has been carried at the bank since the opening of this School. We hope you will see your way clear to grant this request as this deficit has greatly hampered the financing of this institution.\n\nThe recent deficit of $500.00 is accounted for by the fact that the per capita grant applies only to sixty pupils while last year we had in residence sixty-three or more Indian children. The Board of Home Missions is now making the additional request to your Department that the number be increased from sixty to sixty-five children as there has always been a number of children waiting for admission.\n\nHoping that you will be able to consider these requests most favourably,\n\nI am,\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nColin G. Young\nMay 13, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Young:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant, I regret that there are no funds to pay the deficit incurred in financing the Morley Indian Residential School. In order to assist in the financing of the school, the Department might favourably consider providing a day school grant towards a teacher's salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month. It is doubtful if there is accommodation for more than 60 pupils, as per the requirements with regard to air space in dormitories and classrooms. However, I will have enquiry made in this connection, and further consideration will be given to increasing the pupilage.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Colin G. Young, D.D.,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, May 14, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nA request has been received from the Acting Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, for a grant for an increased pupilage at the Morley Indian Residential School. Before the Department can consider this matter it must be definitely assured that there is accommodation as per the requirements with regard to air space in the dormitories. I have, therefore, to request that you will furnish the Department as soon as possible with the dimensions of each dormitory, stating the length, width and height.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. E. J. Staley,\nIndian Residential School,\nMorley, Alta.\nThe United Church of Canada\nBoard of Home Missions\n\n299 QUEEN ST.

Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nYour letter of May 15th (File 119-1-1) has just come to hand.\n\nWe are grateful to you for favourable consideration toward paying the salary of a teacher at the rate of $75.00 per teaching month. This would help considerably in the financing of the school.\n\nWe will be pleased to hear further from you regarding an increase in the pupilage as it is largely due to the fact that we have had more than sixty pupils in the school that a deficit has been incurred.\n\nI am,\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCGY:AMA.\nThe attention of your Dept. is respectfully requested to a situation that has arisen at our school. When our class rooms were created and opened early this year a second teacher was employed with a view to our opening day school facilities for Reserve children who were unable to enter boarding school.\n\nSome negotiations I think were carried on with your Dept. relative to this by Rev. T. Murray, our Capt. of Recreation and I am referring to the matter because of his regretted and enforced retirement through illness. I think too that Dr. Murray the acting Agent here had some correspondence with you in this respect too.\n\nMy school was opened during last quarter and 15 day pupils were enrolled. A report submitted to your Dept., with the Residential School quarterly returns shows that there was an average attendance of day pupils during last quarter of 9.36 and this average has been maintained. There is every reason to expect that this work will grow and that for at least seven months in the year a respectable day school can be carried on. I hasten to add that the second class room is not occupied altogether by day pupils but that it is used also as a junior room for our boarding school children and much more effective work is the result.\n\nWe have been giving the day pupils a hot meal at noon with our own children and during last quarter 180 meals were served. It was intimated to Dr. Murray that the Dept. would only consider giving a grant of five cents for each meal served. The cost is nearer fifteen than five.\n\nWould you then be good enough to consider whether all or part of the teachers salary could be paid by your Dept. and whether some adequate payment could be made in lieu of the meals provided. It is an extremely difficult proposition to finance our activities here. It is costing in addition to the per capita grant $200.00 a year to carry this school on.\n\nI beg to express appreciation of all that has been done for us in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMAY 22 1929\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the carrying on of day school facilities for reserve children who could not be accommodated at the Morley Indian Residential School, and requesting that the Department consider assisting the school to the extent of providing for the teacher's salary.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that, in a recent communication from the Acting Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, he requested payment of the deficit in the management of the school, and he was informed that there were no funds provided for the purpose, but that, in order to assist in financing the school, the Department would favourably consider providing a grant towards the teacher's salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month from the beginning of the present fiscal year, viz., April 1st, last. This grant will be paid upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns showing the attendance and days taught. These returns should not include the names of any of the children enrolled at the residential school. You should see that these returns are prepared on the forms for that purpose and forwarded to the Department at the end of each quarter.\n\nIn view of the grant allowed towards the salary of a teacher, the Department is not prepared at the present time to provide any part of the cost of supplying a midday meal to the pupils who attend the day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsts. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. E. J. Stanley,\nIndian Residential School,\nMorley, Alta.\nOttawa, May 22, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is desirous of learning if the older girls at the Morley Indian Residential School are being trained in milking cows. As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular. The Department expects that the older girls, under proper supervision, will be given a course of instruction in milking, and I shall be pleased to learn that suitable arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The floor space of our dormitories is as follows:\n\nRoom 1: Dormitories 40 x 10 = 400 sq. ft.\nRoom 2: Dormitories 30 x 30 = 900 sq. ft.\n\nThese figures give an indication of the air space available for sleeping children for the large attic running the whole length of the school and used for no purpose but storage measuring (50) x (60) and 18 ft. high over most of the school could be made available as an exhaust air supply on both sides of buildings by the placing of vents or gratings in the ceiling.\n\nI say there is not the slightest difficulty in ventilating adequately the building even when it is closed up tight. The central ventilating shafts work perfectly with the result that fresh air circulates all through building.\n\nThe dormitories having outside windows on two sides of building can secure in addition fresh air direct from outside by a mere regulating of the double windows therein the building.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, May 31st, 1929.\n\nRev.

In this connection I have to say that there is sufficient air space to provide accommodation for 65 pupils, and the Department will allow a per capita grant for this number from April 1st, last, the beginning of the present fiscal year. You may, therefore, recruit up to that number.

Your letter will be drawn to Dr. Young's attention on his return to the office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGWF.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of the above date I beg to state that we have not been giving instructions to our older girls in the matter of milking. I frankly confess that I do not know why the matter has been allowed to slip. Your letter and your reasons for the request are so very logical and express such a real truth that I have no excuse what is worth while to explain the lack of this instruction. I shall make arrangements to carry out your wishes.\n\nActing out of this would it not be well if your Dept. furnished us from time to time with a list of activities and of suggestions or criticisms that come from your wider knowledge of what is being done at other schools. It could come from your Dept. Such advice than from any place else and I think that many principals would appreciate such information. Any of us are more than willing but we simply fall down in our work for lack of knowledge of the desires of the Dept.\n\nThis is not stated in any spirit of complaint. Your attention to our requests is more than appreciated but personally I would like to see other steps taken to bring us into closer contact with your views and desires.\n\nThanking you,\n\nI am, Yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEdgar J. Staley\nOttawa, June 11, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to instruction to the elder girls of the Morley Indian Residential School in the art of milking cows. I note, with satisfaction, that you are making immediate arrangements in this connection.\n\nI regret there are no printed instructions to principals of Indian residential schools. The activities at our institutions are so many and so varied, because of the geographical and other differences, that it would be extremely difficult to prepare a satisfactory table of instructions. Principals are expected to arrange whatever vocational, academic and spiritual instruction will be in the best interests of the pupils when they return to their own communities. Departmental officers with whom you are in touch will be glad to discuss the work at any time, and, if there is any particular phase of the activity concerning which you would like advice, you should not hesitate to address a letter to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Staley, Principal  \n\nMorley, Alta. Sept. 17th, 1931\n\nMr. R. Hinton,  \nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you be good enough to consider, we sincerely hope favorably, and to pass on to the Indian Department a request that the old Hospital building at Morley be used by the Residential School for extra dormitory accommodation.\n\nThe main building is crowded to capacity, children are sleeping in my own home, and there are at least a dozen small children who could and would be at school if there was room. We cannot discharge any older children we have not any more than enough to carry on our work, we have not a boy over sixteen and only a bare half a dozen over fourteen. Our girls are the same with most of them around or under ten years.\n\nIf the Department see fit, and it is an emergent request, to grant us the use of the building no great expense will be involved for the building is in much better shape than when we used it last for school purposes. The cost of equipping would be one hundred dollars for beds for twelve children. Heaters are available.\n\nWe would undertake to put an extra number on the staff who would sleep in the building with the children. All activities of children would be carried on at the main building. We would request, of course, the regular per capita grant for the extra children. Trusting you will see your way clear to help relieve a pressing situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) E.J.

Graham, Esqre.\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter received from Indian Agent Hinton, together with copy of letter referred to therein, with reference to the occupying of an old building on the Stony Reserve, formerly used as a hospital, for the purpose of providing the school with extra dormitory accommodation. While on the reserve a short time ago Mr. Staley discussed this matter with me, and I asked him to put his request in writing.\n\nI am of the opinion that perhaps $100.00 would put the building in shape, and the only extra cost, above this, would be for beds. It seems wrong that the Principal should be housing pupils in his own residence.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from the Department regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, September 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11A of the 22nd instant, with enclosures, concerning adding to the accommodation in the Morley Indian Residential School. The maximum accommodation in the main building is 65 pupils and grant for this number only is provided. There is no merit in the Principal putting pupils in his own residence or another building, as there are no funds to pay any extra grant. Mr. Staley should seriously consider arranging to send some of the pupils from the Reserve to the Edmonton Indian Residential School, where, I understand, there are a few vacancies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSeptember 25, 1931.\n\nMr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe. Stoney Indians, Morley.\n\nThere is situated on the Morley Reserve an old building known as the \"hospital building\" which was formerly used by the Indians on this Reserve. At a later date, I believe, it was used by the Mounted Police. It has been vacant for the past year.\n\nI have been requested to see if it is possible to get the use of this building for a dormitory for the children attending the school at Morley. I understand that there are at least fifteen children who have made application for admission into the school, but such admission had to be refused on the ground that there was not sufficient sleeping accommodation.\n\nI have interviewed the Rev. Mr. Staley. He advises me that the building at the present time is in a reasonable state of repair, that it would be admirably suited for a dormitory, and that he could take in at least fifteen additional children if such a building were available for such purpose. He estimates that $100.00 would provide sufficient beds and put the building in a fit state of repair. He is anxious that this building should be available at the earliest possible date. I would, therefore, appreciate if you\nMr. Duncan G. Scott,\n\nwould arrange for the use of this building by the Stoney Indians from the date hereof until, say, the first of July, 1922. Mr. Staley advises me that the Indians have agreed to supply sufficient wood, and that he will undertake to keep the building in a good state of repair.\n\nIt seems to me that the building would deteriorate less by being used than it would be remaining idle. Should you be able to grant this, I would appreciate if you would advise Mr. Staley at the earliest possible date.\n\nI also wish to take this opportunity to thank you and those under you for the assistance you have given in the past year to help the Stoney Indians.\n\nIt is just possible that this application should have your agent's approval and should come from the United Church in Toronto. I am sending a copy of this letter to each of them for their approval.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMBP/A\nOctober 2nd, 1951.\n\nDear Mr. Peacock,-\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to using the old hospital building on the Morley Reserve in order to provide accommodation for more pupils at the Indian Residential School. There are no funds to either put the building in question in good condition at the present time nor for a per capita grant for the extra pupils. It may be necessary to have some of the children from this reserve sent to our institution at Edmonton, which is, also, under the United Church.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan G. Scott\n\nM. B. Peacock, Esq., K.C., LL.D.,\n280 Lancaster Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOctober 9, 1931.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd of October.\n\nWhen I was in Morley a few days ago I took a look over this building. I think it is in pretty fair state of repair at the present time. I noticed there was a large stove in it, which I think would be sufficient to heat the building. Mr. Staley assured me that the Indians would supply the wood required to heat the building, that he had an excellent crop of vegetables which he could use for the children, and that he was satisfied he could get enough subscriptions to make suitable sleeping accommodation in the building for this year. If the Department could see its way to give us the use of that building in its present condition from now until the first of July next year, I am satisfied that we could take care of from fifteen to twenty children with very little additional expense.\n\nI also note your remarks regarding some of the Indian children on this Reserve going to Edmonton. I quite appreciate that in an ordinary case that would be the common sense thing to do; but from my experience the Indians are just like big children. They will not consent to their children being sent away. If we get them away, it will mean that they will be away a few months at school; then when they come home at Christmas, their parents will not let\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nthem go back. At least, that was the experience we had years ago when we tried to get the children to go to the Edmonton School. My recollection is that owing to failure of the Department to recognize that the Indians themselves were but children and to bad advice giving to the Indians, it practically meant that these children had no school for years. I am not blaming any one for this. I do not know, except from hear-say, what the real facts were, but I think my guess would probably be correct when I say that the Indians themselves were only to blame.\n\nThe Rev. Staley may be out-spoken, but I am satisfied that he has the welfare of the Indians at heart, and that he is doing a wonderful work among them.\n\nIf I understand the situation correctly, if we send some of these Morley children to Edmonton, the Government will pay the extra per capita tax for the children going to Edmonton. Personally speaking I cannot see why this per capita tax should not be granted in the event of the children going to the Morley school. I quite realize that money is very scarce, but I do believe that even if we cannot get the per capita tax, we can finance it for this year, if you could see your way clear to give us the use of this building for the next few months.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMEP/A\nOctober 21, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Pencock:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, in further reference to taking in additional pupils at the Morley Indian Residential School. I suggested that some pupils be sent to our institution at Edmonton, because they are not yet up to strength and there is proper accommodation there. Surely a few orphans and others, whose parents would agree, could be transferred.\n\nIt must be remembered that the Department is associated with the Missionary Society of the United Church in the conduct of the Morley School. When it was erected, the intention was to provide accommodation for not more than 60 or 65 and that, as far as possible, the school was to be a \"Feeder\" for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. The Department cannot consider any change in policy unless the Church authorities so desire. In any event, at the present time, there are no funds to increase either the pupilage or the accommodation at Morley.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nH. B. Pencock, Esq., K.C., LL.M.,\n280 Lancaster Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\nNovember 3, 1931.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nMany thanks for your kind letter herein. I forwarded it on to Mr. Staley. He now realizes that under the existing circumstances, it is difficult to do anything for this year. He is, however, still in hopes that we can do something to take care of some of the children on the Reserve. I appreciate very much the trouble you are going to in regard to these Indians.\n\nAs I see it, the following facts have considerable to do with the Indians. The Stony Indians came here many years ago, probably from the shores of Lake Huron. They have a different dialect, and in other ways are quite different from the rest of the Indians on the western plains.\n\nThe Cree language is spoken solely in the School at Edmonton. Should the Stony Indian go to that School, it would be almost as strange to him as going to a White School, or as sending a French Canadian child up to Western Canada.\n\nIn any event, all the larger boys are being let out of the Morley School to make room for the smaller ones. I am satisfied if we attempt to send any of these children away to Edmonton, that it will cause a lot of uneasiness in the minds of those who have younger children going to the School. Ordinarily speaking, your suggestion of sending them to Edmonton would be the proper thing to do, but from my point of view, it will probably do more harm than good to attempt to do so.\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\n\nI also think that we can always approach a subject better by knowing the man who is in charge. For an example, the Rev. Staley was probably the greatest football player the Old Country ever produced. While he was in University, he was the champion boxer in Western Canada. He is a wonderful man; a little cut-spoken and head-strong, but he has a heart of gold. He is as honest as they make them. I am satisfied he is doing excellent work among the Stoney Indians, and that he is spending nearly half his stipend in assisting them.\n\nI have tried, and I think with some measure of success, to have him view this from the Department's standpoint. Things are going very well at the Reserve, but I think we could make certain changes which would be a wonderful improvement.\n\nThere are practically 625 Stoneys. Around 125 are at Nordegg, and 500 on the Reserve at Morley. They have an Indian Agent, who has had little experience with Indian work. I believe he is doing the best he can, but I feel that he is not giving satisfaction to the Indians. They also have employed an Indian by the name of Dan Wildman to act as stockman. Dan gets $60.00 per month. From reports, I gather that he knows about as much about stock as the ordinary Indian child. In any event, he is a local man, and the Indians are very much dissatisfied with both Wildman and the agent. Remember, I do not say they are justified, but I am telling you facts. The agent gets around $1900.00 a year and everything found. The nurse, I believe, is paid around $140.00 per month, and the doctor gets $600.00 per year for his work. The last two are a charge on the Indian Fund. The Clerk, who is about to retire, gives wonderful service.\n\nMy idea is that the personnel of the staff should be entirely changed. I would recommend putting a medical man in as agent. Hinton could be transferred to another Reserve. I would also recommend that the new Clerk who is appointed\nDr. Duncan S. Scott,\n\nshould be a practical stockman; and that you continue on\nthe nurse, but that she take her instructions from the\nIndian Agent, who would be a medical man.\n\nThere has been considerable in the newspapers\nin regard to the disease known as Trachoma among the Indians.\nI do not believe this disease is nearly as serious as the\nnewspapers make out. I understand that some years ago, a\ndoctor by the name of Wall made an examination on the Morley\nReserve; that he examined 250 Indians, and that out of these\n250, 129 were suffering from Trachoma. There has been several\nexaminations since then. Some physicians call it \"granulated\neyelids\", while others have another technical name for it.\nThe Alberta Provincial Health Officer has examined them,\nand I understand pronounced it Trachoma.\n\nFrom inquiries I have made, I believe that\nthis disease can be practically stamped out within six months\nor a year if proper precautions are taken. My suggestion\nwould be that after the re-organization as above suggested,\nthe old hospital be opened and the Indians receive regular\ntreatment from the nurse and the agent. I understand that in\na very few instances will it be necessary for the Indians to\nremain in the Hospital any length of time. Most of them can\nbe treated in their homes. I am quite frank to admit to you\nthat I am not in a position to give advice along this line.\nI am only a layman, but I am greatly interested in the Indians.\nI try to help them as best I can. I believe that if you look\ninto my suggestion, you will find in the end it will work out to\nthe interest of all concerned.\n\nI have been associated with the Indians long\nenough to realize that it is difficult to know just what is\nbest for them. If, after investigation, any of these suggestions\nmeet with your approval, I will be well pleased. On the other\nDr. Duncan G. Scott,\n\nhand, if they do not, I trust that you will consider this letter in the spirit in which it is written.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMBP/A\nNovember 17, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Peacock,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of November 3rd, to the contents of which I have given careful attention.\n\nI think we mutually understand the school question on the Stony reserve, and I hope when things improve that we may be able to provide educational facilities on this reserve that will meet all the needs of the case. I share your good opinion of the Reverend Mr. Staley.\n\nAs regards the arrangements you suggest, I may remark that Daniel Wildman is not a stockman, but an interpreter. He has no duties whatever in connection with the cattle. The Agent is himself expected to look after the cattle industry.\n\nWe have several Agents who are also Physicians and whose duties are dual,\u2014that is administrative and medical. As you know, Doctor Murray at the Sarcee Reserve is one of these and we have two in the north, at Fort Resolution and at Fort Simpson. Dr. O. Bourget is at Fort Resolution and Dr. W. A. M. Trussell is at Fort Simpson. We have also Dr. W.L.Tyler at Moose Factory, James Bay Agency, Ontario. It might eventually come to the establishment of such a position at the Stony Reserve. I should like, however, to leave that matter in abeyance for some time.\n\nAs you note, the question of Trachoma on the reserve has come up for public discussion and that question must supersede all others at the moment. I am making arrangements which I hope may be successful to send an expert to the reserve, and we will rely on his experience to deal as effectively as possible with the situation.\n\nThanking you again for your letter, and with kindest regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.B.Peacock, Esq., K.C., LL.M.,\n200 Lancaster Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nINDIAN CHILDREN AT FESTIVAL\n\nFor the first time in the history of the musical festival, Indian children sang in the school chorus competition Monday afternoon at Grace Church.

Maurice Jacot, former adjudicator, paid glowing tribute to the enthusiasm and potentialities of the Indian school chorus from Morley. The afternoon session was opened by the public school choruses in all grades up to VII, part of whom came from rural villages and city schools, and acted songs which proved wonderful entertainment for audience and competitors alike.\n\nFor many of the out-of-towners, the experience of a street car ride around Calgary proved exciting, but not so for the small town children from Morley reserve, who were invited to attend the day's festivities, but declined, saying they preferred to remain at their school for the duration of the contest.\n\nMr. Jacot, in remarking upon their choice, said: \"It was the beginning of great things and their natural musical abilities cannot be overestimated.\"\n\nBlack Diamond school children, led by George Johnson, sang a song competition during the afternoon. Morley Indian school chorus, which had been given marks 85 in their classes, when they were granted a special privilege of being able to perform after having been unable to reach the city in time to participate in the afternoon's activities, sang earlier in the day. McDougall school grade III, with 84 marks, was second place, followed by Black Diamond school grade III chorus, with 83 marks; both classes final results showed.\n\nHillhurst school grade I class, which sang Monday morning, was praised for the splendid spirit of its singing and ability to make itself heard in the class.\n\nBlack Diamond chorus, grades I and II, scored again with 82 marks, singing a charming \"White Song,\" presented by Miss E. M. Ward, public school chorus from High River was second with 81 marks. There were only two entries.\n\nPassed Choirs\n\nVictoria school choir, led by Miss Aldous, sang a song in grades II and III competition, while Hillhurst choir sang a grade IV song. Both choirs competed with 85 marks, closely followed by the only other entry, Miss E. M. Ward's school chorus, which secured 84 marks. The festival platform was given a thoroughly enjoyable performance of the songs under Mr. Jacot's direction.\n\nMiss Evelyn Aldous, leading Rose View school grades VI and VII, sang a song in her class, for which there was no competition.\n\nBlack Diamond grades V and VI chorus was close behind the winner of its class with 83 marks. In the competition for grades VII, choir won the contest with 82 marks.\n\nMr. Jacot led both evening sessions. Adjudicator Jacot arranged the program. The best marked songs were \"Song of the Indians,\" sung by Miss Ward's school, and \"Ode to Joy,\" by Miss Aldous' choir.\nSchool Children Meet On Common Ground of Festival Competition\n\nIndian Schools Represented In Colorful Choral Contests Monday\n\nChildren from the Morley Indian reserve met with pupils from city schools Monday afternoon's festival platform for competitions which were attended by a large audience. Maurice Jacobsen, adjudicator, discussed the musical instinct and potentialities of the Indian school choirs from the reserve after the festival was featured by public school choruses in three grades. The festival included choirs by rural, town, village and city schools, and achieved a high degree of choral delightfulness for audience and competitors alike.\n\nFor many of the out-of-town listeners the city's offer of a street car ride around Calgary proved enticing, but not so far.\n\nThe small Indian children from Morley reserve, who were invited by the city's invitation, politely declined, saying they preferred to remain at their own level and watch the other contests. Mr. Jacobsen, in remarking upon their choice, said, \"I am sure we are at the beginning of great things and their talent is not to be overestimated.\"\n\nBlack Diamond school children, under Mr. E. Bower, won many honors in competition during the day. Morley Indians sang first place and each class secured 90 marks or more. They sang on Monday afternoon, after having been unable to reach the festival grounds earlier in the day. The second place went to the Black Diamond grade III chorus, with 85 marks; and Black Diamond grade II chorus, with 82 marks.\n\nFirst honors in these classes, final results showed:\n\nThe school grade I class, which sang on Monday morning, was praised for the quality of its singing and was granted 85 marks to place first in this class.\n\nBlack Diamond choir grades I and II sang again when it won first place in its class with 86 marks, singing \"Sweet and Low,\" simply descriptive and imaginative. Each Ward public school choir, except Elbow school, was second with 82 marks. There were only two entries.\n\nNamed Choirs\n\nVictoria school choir, led by Miss Alice M. Robson, sang in grades I and II competition, while Hillhurst chorus from grades III and IV won its competition with 84 marks, followed closely by the only other entrant, Turner Valley public school choir, in the same category. The latter choirs were brought to the platform to give a second performance, to serve as a test selection under Mr. Jacobsen's direction.\n\nMiss Evelyn Albert, leading Bow View school grades IV and V chorus, was awarded 85 marks in its class, which had no competition.\n\nBlack Diamond grade V and VI chorus placed third in its class with 83 marks in its competition. Turner Valley school was fourth, with 82 marks.\n\nMr. Bower led both choirs.\n\nRamsay school chorus, from grades VI and VII was awarded 88 marks for \"a highly artistic performance,\" according to Mr. Jacobsen, announced. \"The best performance,\" he said, \"was marked 'bold and tender,' 'soft, but vital tone' and were some of the phrases used by the adjudicator to describe this choir's performance in Monday afternoon's contests.\n\nCriticism of all three choirs for a certain stolidity was offered in the public school chorus from rural school. Mr. Bower led all the three contestants which placed in following order: Turner Valley, 163; Black Diamond and Turner Valley school choruses tied for second place with 163 marks. \"This was not at all a bad class, however,\" the adjudicator said. Ramsay school, also led by Mr. Bower, secured a total of 88 in the second place in the town and village school classes, singing a lullaby and \"The Bells of St. Michael's Tower.\"\n\n\"One must consider entrance and exit as part of the action choreography,\" Mr. Jacobsen said in offering adjudication on the day's evening action choruses. \"Black Diamond school, with 89 marks, was first place; with 89 marks; Turner Valley school was second with 86; and the West Ward public school, High River, tied for third place with 85. East Ward public school, High River, was the only other competitor, it close fourth place with 84 marks.\n\nAmusing Songs\n\nRidgeway Park grade I and Christopher Robin grade II choirs were the only two units in the action song class from city schools, but the audiences were convinced that both of their performances left no possibility of doubt. Ridgeway Park school and the kindergarten 80 in one of the most entertaining events of the day. The very young performers who came second did not receive a critical adjudication, probably because they did everything they did,\" Mr. Jacobsen affirmed later.\n\nHillhurst grade I, conducted by Miss M. Westland, gave a really charming performance with a delightful sense of tone\" and won the public school chorus for its class, with 85 marks. Ridgeway Park School, led by Miss E. L. Glassford, was second with 83; Ramsay school third, with 84; Sunnyside Cottage school, with 88, and Ramsay school, with 82, were the other entrants.\nOttawa, May 19, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of the copy of the Calgary Daily Herald of the 10th instant which you forwarded to me, giving an account of the musical festival competition in which the pupils of the Morley Indian Residential School met with pupils from white schools. The success which the choir from the school met with in the competition is noted, and I am glad to extend to you, the members of the staff who trained the pupils and to the pupils, themselves, congratulations on their efforts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. E. J. Staley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMorley, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE:\nCALGARY, ALTA. Jan. 13th, 1933.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nI have the honor to bring to your attention that I have just reported on an inspection of the Indian Residential School at Morley. The Principal brought to my attention, which he has on several occasions, that there are 75 children in residence in this school, and they only received a grant for 65. Five of the children sleep in the principal's house. Room for the other five additional has been made at the school, and the place does not seem to be over-crowded, as the dormitories have high ceilings and lots of ventilation.\n\nThe reason for having ten more children in the school than the grant calls for is that there are still thirty children of school age on the Reserve that we have no room for.\n\nThe parents come to the principal and request to have their children admitted into school and in this way it is often very hard for the principal to turn them down. However, he is not complaining very much.\n\nThe other matter that I wish to bring to your attention is this, that this school is in a different position from a number of others, in this way, on account of the Reserve being all hills and rock no farming is carried on. There is no revenue from cattle, and all the school has to depend on to finance, is the grant, whereas some of the others get considerable revenue from their farming and stock-raising operations.\nI understand that it costs the church about $7000.00 a year, over and above the grant, to maintain this school. If after the end of the fiscal year this school could receive the grant for the additional ten children it would lighten the burden that the church is now carrying.\n\nThe church authorities may have brought this to your attention. If they haven't, I am aware that they intend to do so, and this letter is written for the purpose of letting you know exactly how the situation stands, from my point of view.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 19, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the number of pupils in attendance at the Morley Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted there are 75 children in residence, while the per capita grant is allowed for 65 only. It is noted, further, that sleeping accommodation for five children is provided in the Principal's residence.\n\nWhen this school was erected, it was to provide accommodation for not more than 60 or 65 pupils, and it is considered, in order to prevent overcrowding in the dormitories, that not more than 65 children should be accommodated in the building. At the present time, there are no funds to increase either the pupilage or the accommodation, and, for the coming fiscal year, grant can be provided for only 65 pupils. As the admission of any children over that number adds to the cost, the Principal should seriously consider reducing the enrolment to the number for which grant is provided. We might keep not more than three children in excess of the 65 allowed, in order that they could replace any absentees and the average be maintained so as to draw the full grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCALGARY, ALTA.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 3rd,\n1933.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Per Capita Grant - Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nI have been thinking a good deal about the failure of the Department to include in the Estimates for the current year an amount to cover an increase in the per capita grants at Morley from 65 to 75, as was agreed upon when I was in Ottawa in February. I wish to quote from a letter which I sent to Mr. Staley following that visit:\n\n\"Re Increase in Per Capita Grants: I visited Ottawa on February 15th and had extended interviews with the new Deputy and several other officials of the Indian Department. I spent a long time with them considering the Morley situation. I feel that there is, under the circumstances, a lot of justification for their attitude. The School was built by agreement with the former Methodist Church to accommodate 60 pupils. Gradually, the number was increased until the financing of the situation was found to be too great a burden and insistent representations were made to Ottawa to increase the per capita to sixty-five. I was faced on this occasion with the necessity of asking that the per capita be allowed for seventy-five children who are actually in residence, although - as the officials of the Department very rightly pointed out, in spite of a definite agreement limiting the number of children to sixty - the number had been gradually increased to seventy-five, without consultation either with them or with the Board of Home Missions.\n\n\"I pointed out to the officials of the Department of Indian Affairs that with a decrease in our income of at least $225,000 in 1933 as compared with 1932, we could not continue to spend almost $6,000 on our Indian work at Morley; that I could see nothing for it except to hand the school back to them and let them make the best of it, unless they were prepared to assume a more adequate share of what it was actually costing. The best I could get, however, was a promise that in the Estimates which are presumably now before Parliament they would put in from April 1st an application for per capita grants for 75 pupils at Morley.\"\n\"The officials who are handling the Department of Indian Affairs at the present time are worthy of our very best support and entitled to sympathetic consideration. With a budget suddenly reduced from five and a half millions to three and a quarter millions and increasing amounts being demanded by practically every Indian Agent across the whole country for relief purposes, the Schools and Medical Services Departments are having a terrible time to keep within their appropriations. I think one might very reasonably protest, as I have already done, against these two Departments bearing the brunt of the cuts and carrying the main burden of relief. With the Dominion Government spending $7,500,000 on relief across the country last year, surely the Indians should have been included, but they were not. All Indian relief came out of the vote to the Department of Indian Affairs.\"\n\nYou will notice that I only promised Mr. Staley that increased per capita grants would be included in the Estimates. I was, however, entirely unprepared for the news that you gave me the other day, that the total amount of the increase asked for had been struck out.\n\nSince my return from Ottawa I have been going over the financial situation of the Morley School and can see no way in which the Board of Home Missions can increase the amount of money which it is now expending to keep this School a going concern. I would suggest that you write Dr. McGill, requesting that he make a personal investigation of this particular situation while he is in the West. He is thoroughly at home in Calgary, and, in the city itself, can obtain information from Dr. Thomas Powell, our Superintendent of Missions, whose address is - 210-2nd Ave., N.W., or from Mr. W. G. Hunt, Secretary of the Alberta Medical Association, who is a member of our Board and a personal friend of Dr. McGill's.\n\nAs you are well aware, we have had in the last four years a good many conferences with Dr. Scott and Mr. Russell Ferrier about this Morley situation, and in the final letter which Dr. Scott wrote to Mr. Staley he said that Morley was one problem which he was handing over unsolved to his successor. I am sure you realize that we are prepared to bear our full share of responsibility for the education of the Indian children in this band, which has been so difficult of approach from every standpoint. We recognize that in the last year we have made some progress both from the point of view of the Department and of the Church. We are grateful for the sympathetic and intelligent interest that Mr. Christianson, your Inspector, is taking in the problem and are hopeful that the appointment of the new Agent at Morley may be helpful.\n\nIn spite of all these facts, however, unless the Department can do something more financially than is suggested for\ntheir current financial year in connection with Morley, I am very apprehensive about the School.\n\nThanking you for your interest in and attention to this important matter,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, July 8, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, relative to per capita grant for an increased pupilage, from 65 to 75, at the Morley Indian Residential School and quoting from a letter which you sent to the Principal, regarding the matter.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, when our Estimates for the current fiscal year were being prepared, an item to provide a grant for ten more pupils was included but, owing to the need for drastic economy, was not allowed. As you are aware, the Principal admitted, without reference to the Department, ten pupils over the number for which grant is allowed. No doubt, the admission of any children over the grant-earning pupils adds to the cost. It might help to lower the cost of this school if the Principal would reduce the enrollment to the number for which grant is provided, keeping not more than three children in excess of the 65 allowed, in order that they could replace any absentees and the average be maintained, so that the full grant would be earned each quarter.\n\nIt will not be possible to provide for any number in excess of 65 during the present fiscal year. It is hoped that it will be possible to carry on with the grant provided. If not, I am not aware of any other solution than the temporary closing of the school. Should Dr. McGill, Deputy Superintendent General, who is at present in British Columbia, visit this point on his way East, he will, undoubtedly, give the situation at this school consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend Kenneth J. Benton, D. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nDr. H.W. McGill  \nCommissioner of Indian Affairs  \nc/o Mr. Christianson  \nCalgary.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nI was very sorry to learn that you were in Calgary while I was away on the postgraduate tour and therefore missed seeing you. I learn however that you were so busy when you were that most of your friends are mourners like myself. Hope for better things next time.\n\nRe Morley Indian School\n\nAs you are aware they have been carrying on there with ten more pupils than the number for which the grant was made, and were under the impression that an additional grant to cover the extra ten had or would be made, but are now informed that nothing is forthcoming.\n\nFew Indian reserves have suffered more than the Stoney Reserve for practically a whole generation, were raised and passed beyond the School age without any provision for Education, and it was only recently that conditions have altered. It was impossible for the principal of the school to refuse admission to the additional children who presented themselves and were of school age, so Mr. Stayley finds himself with 75 and provision for 65 (I think these are the figures).\n\nI have been making some investigation and am informed that there is no band more intelligent than the Stonys, and none inside the settled areas of the Western Provinces where their reserve is endowed with less natural resources or possibilities, which would seem to be an added reason why further consideration in the matter of Education should readily be given.\n\nWill you give this your attention on your return to Ottawa, but perhaps Mr. Christianson will answer any questions you may ask concerning them.\n\nI am handing this letter to him to deliver to you as we understand he is to meet you early in August.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.G. Hunt\nAugust 21, 1933.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hunt:\n\nReplying to your letter of July 19th, I would say that I visited the Morley School early in July and went over the building in company with Mr. Allen, Representative of the Treasury, for the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI have been very busy since returning to Ottawa, but shall take up the matter of the Morley School with the Head of the Educational Branch within a day or two.\n\nI was very disappointed on coming downstairs the other day to find that you had gone, as I was anxious to discuss one or two matters with you to a greater extent than can be conveniently attained in correspondence. My time was very fully occupied while in Edmonton and the only period I had to myself was one of a couple of hours on Sunday afternoon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. G.

WILLIS, on MORLEY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL\nSCHOOL, following his visit on February 22,\n1936.\n\nOriginal on 119-1-24.\n\nThe salaries are shown on a yearly basis and it will be seen that the Principal is paid direct by the church and Mrs. Locke, who was formerly Miss Grayson, is paid by the Department. I believe the cheque still comes in the name of Miss Grayson and she is evidently still in the Civil Service.\nOttawa, March 18, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the employment of Mrs. Gordon E. Locke (nee Miss Dorothy Grayson) as teacher of the Morley Indian Day School, the Treasury Board has drawn attention to Section 36 (1) of the Civil Service Regulations, which provides as follows:\n\n1. \"Hereafter no married woman, whose husband is living, shall be eligible for appointment in the Public Service.\"\n\nThis applies in the case where salary is being paid from Government Appropriation.\n\n2. \"Provided that, when the supply of experienced help for any particular kind of work is not sufficient to meet the demands of the Public Service, a married woman may be certified for temporary employment.\"\n\n3. \"Where it can be established by a married woman that her husband is unable, through illness or other cause, to contribute to her support, such married woman may be certified for permanent or temporary appointment.\"\n\nIn the Public Service, when a woman marries, she is required, under the regulations, to resign her position. The Department was advised of the marriage of Miss Grayson early in September, last, but did not desire to take any exception to her continuing duties as teacher and has been forwarding her salary cheques in her maiden name. However, as the Treasury Board has drawn our attention to the above regulations, it will be necessary for you to arrange for the engagement of another teacher for the coming school year. The Department does not desire to make any break in teaching arrangements during the balance of the current academic year. It will be necessary to continue to issue cheques in payment of salary in the name of Miss Dorothy Grayson.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. E. J.

Mrs. Locke, formerly a teacher, is now matron, and there is a new lady teacher on the staff.

This is an organization which consists of ministers of the United Church and their wives who gather together for about ten days once a year for the purpose of discussing matters of interest - generally theological. We have received a communication, asking whether it would be possible to have the use of the School again this year. I should be glad to know if you would offer any objection to this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLT\nOttawa, May 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nEnclosed, for your information, is a copy of official letter of today's date to Rev. Geo.

An epidemic has been raging on the reserve all summer, which has been diagnosed as Black Measles. The disease is of a serious nature and has been very rampant among the children. The epidemic seemed to be dying down when another outbreak occurred, and it has been thought wise to move the opening date until October 1st, when it is hoped the epidemic will be over.\n\nThe hospital has been filled to its utmost capacity with patients, and the school has been used as a supplementary hospital. We have had as many as nine patients here, with three members of the staff delegated to do the night and day nursing. At present there are five patients.\n\nThis delay in opening has put us to a great deal of expense, as the fall work which is usually done by the boys in the school has had to be done by hired labour.\n\nWe shall keep you advised as to further developments and the outcome of the epidemic.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEJS:JT\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nAt our recent Board meeting we had before us a resolution of the Calgary Presbytery, in which the Morley Indian Residential School is situated, asking us to approach your Department, with a view to having the full cost of Indian Education borne by the Government. I pointed out that the policy of the Department was to make a per capita grant, in addition to providing buildings, etc., and that the Churches co-operating assumed responsibility for carrying on the work on that basis. It was pointed out, however, that there was a difference in the per capita grant received by the Church for the Morley School as compared with that for the Edmonton School; and it was further stated that this seemed an unfair discrimination, in view of the fact that the School at Edmonton was provided with one of the best farms in the Province, from which a very considerable revenue was derived.\n\nI am writing to ask that your Department take into consideration when estimates are being prepared for next year the raising of the grant to the Morley School to the same level as Edmonton, namely, $170. There would seem to be no reason, based on the cost of operation, cost of living, or any other logical ground, why the grant to Morley should be on a lower basis than that of Edmonton.\n\nI hope this request will receive favorable consideration. I shall be glad to discuss it with you on the occasion of my next visit.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nApril 8th, 1938.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nApril 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the per capita allowance paid to the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nYour request has been noted and will receive consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1938-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

E. J. Staley, Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School, enclosing Government cheque for $75.00, payable to Evelyn Willison, who last year was teacher of the Morley Day School. You will recall that we were notified by the Department that the grant to the day school would cease at the end of June, 1939. In any case, Miss Willison is no longer at Morley, her place having been taken by Miss Williams. Under these circumstances, we are returning the cheque.\n\nI should like to add, however, that if the Department could see its way to continue the day school grant for this fiscal year, it would be greatly appreciated by Mr. Staley. He states that the increased price of commodities will make financing rather difficult and this additional amount monthly would help out considerably.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.\nMLT.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Morley Indian Day School\nNo. 700\n\nThe teacher of the above-mentioned school gave up duties on June 30, 1939, and, therefore, no further payment should be made to her after that date.\n\nAt the present time it is not our intention to appoint a successor.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI appreciate very much your kindness in returning the cheque issued in favour of Evelyn Willison.

What had resounded a moment before to the sound of girls' voices at breakfast is now silent. The time is 8:30 am; the place, the Indian residential school at Morley. Suddenly the peace is disturbed by the shrill voice of a bugler which booms out \"Fall in!\"\n\nThen bursts forth from the radio throughout the vast main. Communion track out, and the local militia is off on its first parade of the day.\n\nFeats up, chins in, shoulders squared, round and rounded in and out they sway. No group of girls ever gave such perfect concentra- tion into the job at hand than do these 45 girls, ranging in age from 12 to 16 years. They stand at attention, command, and the not always silent seven of hot soldiers is more effective than the icy glare of the \"mam.\"\n\nIn the early days of the organiza- tion it was suddenly noticed one day that the privates were doing something that was not right for her. It is not known whose idea that was; however, the major decided that the girls must be put out of dignity. It is the en- deavor to feed all the children without favor but if one should imperatively wish you can be very sure that the roll at an \"of- ficers\" place is untouched.\n\nThe metamorphosis of these girls is apparent in a different attitude toward other activities of the school. There are no questions or trouble regarding discipline. They are reading with heads up, in clear sight of the teacher. They are eager to learn when in the classroom, and a more cheerful spirit prevails.\n\nFrom the health angle the good thing about the girls is that they are healthy. They are filled with zest for living. Vigorous exercise brings vigorous appetites. An erect carriage is the result of the constant \"This scarcely touched the school.\"\n\nA Red Cross group was formed and once each week the older girls, with some of the Eltony and white girls, go out to the hospital to wash and knit and do Red-Cross work. The girls put on a concert yester- day afternoon for this purpose. It is affiliated with the South branch.\n\nThe feeling of patriotism is in- creasing among the girls.

A good job of selling was done, for other girls were gradually brought until all are now eager members.\n\nThe girls have selected their own officers, and the organization is complete from the \"major\" to the lowest private.

The girls put on a concert yesterday afternoon for this Morley branch affiliated with the Seneca branch.\n\nThe feeling of patriotism is intense among these poor Canadians, and the desire to do more for the Empire is ever with them. In their more militant moods any escaped internecine would receive far from gentle handling.\n\nAnna Beaver has trained her army to a nice peak of perfection. They march and drill with as much skill as a real military unit, swinging their arms in unison. They have been taught to salute correctly. They have a company bugler. The unit is graded for size, going down from the tall girls in the front ranks, to the small ones at the rear. On week-ends they go on long route marches.\n\n\u2014Photo by J. Rosellis.\nIndian Girls Form Own School Corps\n\nCALGARY, March 30.\u2014Although never noticeable among the boys, the matter of getting girls interested in the corps was always a major problem at the Indian residential school at Morley. However, all that is now changed.\n\nAfter war was declared and soldiers were marching around an idea came into the mind of Miss Anna, the old Indian girl, Anna Beaver. Under her guidance a group of girls formed a corps and started drilling in the forms they had seen themselves. Now every girl attending the school is a member of the brigade.\n\nThe girls have their own officers and the brigade is complete from the \"major\" to the \"privates.\"\n\nA Red Cross group was formed and girls are learning the skills needed to knit and do Red Cross work. Recently they staged a concert to raise funds for the Red Cross.\nOttawa, April 7, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Staley:\n\nI have been very much interested in an article entitled \"Indian Girls have well trained Militia\", which appeared in the Calgary Herald, March 1, 1941.\n\nThis newspaper article reads in part as follows:\n\n\"With the war there came an idea into the mind of a 14-year-old girl, Anna Beaver. With a handful of girls, she formed a little group who tried to act like soldiers. They couldn't march without a soldier's hat, so some being found in the attic, these were brought into use. A good job of selling was done, for other girls were gradually brought in until all are now eager members\".\n\nI am very much interested in this movement from the standpoint of physical education and in the training of Indian pupils in initiative and general deportment and, what is perhaps still more important, the development early in life of a sense of responsibility. You seem to have made a splendid start at Morley, and I have been wondering if groups such as this could not be organized at other residential schools. Do you consider a spontaneous movement such as this more adaptable to life at an Indian school than boy scout or girl guide groups? Have you at Morley a C.G.I.T. group? You might, if you have not already done so, send forward a copy of the Calgary Herald containing this article to the Associate Secretaries of the Home Mission Board. You might also discuss the start in growth of this organization -\n\nReverend E. J. Staley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMorley, Alberta.\norganization at your school with Mr. Doucet who will, as you know, visit your school in the course of a few weeks. I am disposed to think that this movement has possibilities that we cannot afford to overlook when considering a worthwhile, well balanced educational program for Indian youth. Is it your opinion that an organization such as this would appeal more to Indian boys and girls if given an Indian name? This suggestion has been made to me on more than one occasion when discussing the desirability of organizing boy scout and girl guide groups at our Indian schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThank you very much for your letter of April 7. I appreciate the interest revealed in it.\n\nThe article from which you quote could only, of course, tell in part of the start of this movement and of its value to the children and the school as a whole. It is no exaggeration what it has done for the girls of this institution. Our girls, up to two years ago, were much like all girls in these institutions. They did their work without any enthusiasm, they took part in other activities because they had to but there was always the deadening sense that little was being accomplished to develop initiative or anything else. You speak of the C.G.I.T. movement. It has its good points but, frankly, I have found that both it and the boys' movements do not fill the bill with Indian children. The world in which the Indian lives is much too circumscribed to allow full advantage to be taken of the so-called four-fold development. We have tried many things here and I am beginning to wonder if this is not a good example of what could easily result with our Indian population if we took a little more time to allow movements to develop amongst the children themselves.\n\nFrankly, I have been delighted in the past few years at the degree of latitude that you are allowing us in the educational work. I have my doubts about the value of many of the things that we are still supposed to teach. I have my doubts about high school education for 99% of the Indian children. I can see the value of much more time being spent in manual training, in home crafts and handicrafts. To illustrate what I have in mind I think it might be a good thing to allow a boy after he reaches the age of 14, to go on a hunting trip in the fall or the winter with his parents and see for himself how he will have to earn a living a few years later in a place like this. I have a great many more ideas along these lines that I would like to pass on for your consideration if the ideas seem of value to you.\n\nIn your letter you wonder if an organization might appeal more if given an Indian name. I wonder whether back of that idea is not the record of our difficulties. Have we not in much too big a hurry tried to give to the Indian the whole of the civilization that has taken us thousands of years to build up?\nAll we have done in our haste has been a magnificent job of veneering. We have killed initiative amongst the Indians. An Indian with original ideas is not wanted, we call him a trouble maker. Names do not matter a great deal. The big thing, I feel sure, is to allow a little more freedom to the children to do as they please.\n\nYou may be interested to know that this group of girls are going to parade next week before the Governor General when he visits Calgary. You will be delighted to know, I am sure that these girls are just as enthusiastic about the Red Cross work as about the militia group and a week from Friday they are presenting a concert, largely of military drills, the whole proceeds from which will go to the War Services Fund.\n\nYou will notice that I have made no mention of boys in this letter. We have found here that our problem with the boys has been solved by organized games and team work. I should be very happy to discuss the matter with Mr Doucet when he visits our school.\n\nThank you for the courtesies given at all times to our many requests for our school here.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 22, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of two letters dated April 17, 1941, received by me from the Reverend E. J. Staley, Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is to me and the officials here a source of great satisfaction to learn of the success Mr. Staley has made in the organization of his mink ranch and in the organization of his girl pupils.\n\nIt has occurred to me that you and Dr. Cochrane might find this correspondence interesting and perhaps suggestive.\n\nI am sending forward also, for your information, copy of a letter received by Dr. Corrigan, Norway House, from Mr. Luther L. Schuetze, of Berens River, Manitoba. You will be interested to learn that I have decided to purchase three or four goats from Mr. Schuetze, with the object of establishing a small goat farm at the Norway House School. I have always had the feeling that goat farming might be very profitably encouraged on a number of our Indian reserves, particularly Indian reserves in northern sections of the country.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 23rd, with copies of letters which have been written by Mr. Staley, in which I am quite interested. I am quite sure that Dr. Cochrane will also find this correspondence interesting.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I saw these girls marching around when I was at Morley a year ago. It was interesting, but I do not think that it is a movement that can be put into all the schools. It is simply a result of Mr. Staley's work - the children have certain ideas and they enjoy themselves and they develop in their own way. It might be that in another school there would be some other way. I note that that is Mr. Staley's idea, and certainly that is the impression that was created on my mind when I saw those children at drill. In a sense, it is too bad that they have been publicized, because now it will cease to be a really spontaneous movement. I am sure that Mr. Staley will do a good job.\n\nI am also interested to see that the mink farm is making progress. I am not sure that it is other than a good way of getting some revenue and giving the boys some idea of how they can find employment on a fur ranch. So far as developing fur farming amongst the Indians on the Morley Reserve is concerned, I think that is quite hopeless, because they will not stay at home all the year, and, after all, that is what is necessary.\n\nI also wish to thank you for the letter which you sent us about the goats at Barrens River. I am sure that that can be encouraged, with profit to all concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.D.MLT\nNine Art Awards For Banff School\n\nClifford Robinson of Merley has been awarded the scholarship provided jointly by the Calgary Sketch Club and the Alberta Society of Artists for tuition at the Banff School of Fine Arts; it has been announced by the extension department of the University of Alberta.\n\nEight other scholarships have been allotted also, with a young Indian boy, Gerald Tail Feathers of Cardston coming first in the Crow's Nest Pass-Macleod-Cardston district.\n\nOther winners are as follows:\n\nLethbridge-Raymond district, Mrs. Villa Lambert, Lethbridge; Medicine Hat area, Percy L.

Annie has been in the public eye this winter and spring, since she trained her schoolmates for a patriotic pageant that the girls presented at Morley and later at Banff.\n\nThe chief carries the pictures and The Herald story about with him, and shows them to all his friends. He sent his son at school in Morley since she was six, but he says she will soon be through and then she will return to the Kootenay Plains, where her branch of the Stones has lived \"since the world began.\"\n\nThese Stones are treaty Indians, and belong to the Morley reserve. But Stones never lived there; they prefer their homes on the plains, but most of them send their children there to school, and all go down to visit when they take the notion.\n\nWalking Eagle has two boys in Morley and another son, Blue Duck, lives with him. We asked why Blue Duck isn't in school, but it seems he wants to be a cowboy and doesn't think he needs to go to school to learn that trade.\nMORLEY, ALTA.\nJuly 29th, 1942.\n\nMr. Iredale,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley,\n\nDear Mr. Iredale,\n\nI wonder whether you would be good enough to ascertain the wishes of your Department in regard to a situation that here, as well as elsewhere will be extremely acute this fall.\n\nI refer to the problem of labor. It is already apparent that this part of the country will have a bumper crop to harvest and it is already apparent that the labor is not here to handle same. In view of this I think it would be well to ask if there is any plan in prospect, for doing from our schools what is already planned for the white schools. Many, if not most, both in city and in country will not re-open until the harvest is in and I venture to think and to suggest that some such procedure would be the logical one for our Indians to follow in this year of need.\n\nThe Indians here, as you know, go out and contact work by the acre and every member of the family takes part in the labor and so from our school alone more than half the children could be of use in the harvest fields.\n\nPerhaps if the plan proposed by the Provincial Department of Education were followed and if the time lost by our children were paid for by the usual per capita grant, it would mean that any grants by the Dept. for cost of living bonus could be eliminated this year.\n\nI make these suggestions now, in order that we may know early enough what plans to make regarding our fall work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nStony Indian Agency,\nMorley, Alberta,\nJuly 31st, 1942\n\nSir:\n\nThe attached is a letter which I have received from Rev. E.J. Staley, Principal of the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nIn conversation a few days ago with the Rev Staley, he brought up the subject of not opening the school until a month or six weeks after the usual opening date. This would mean that instead of opening on 1st September, 1942, the school would not operate until the 1st or 15th of October, 1942. By doing this, it is hoped that it will be of some assistance in relieving the acute labour shortage in the harvest fields in the Foothills, insofar as some of our Indian families often work for the farmers and ranchers in the surrounding area, and some of them with families could thereby have some of the older children help with the stocking, haying etc.\n\nMr Staley points out that if the Per Capita grant was paid for the period, while the school would be non-operative, he would be willing to forego any \"Cost of Living\" bonus, which may be granted for the next school year.\n\nTherefore I am passing the Principal's letter to you for your perusal, consideration, and action.\n\nAn early reply on this subject will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.N.A.

What advantage would there be in keeping the younger children out of school, as they would be unable to do any effective work?\n\nWe could not adopt the Principal's suggestion at the Morley School without putting the same into effect at other Indian residential schools. This would involve consulting the various churches before taking the action suggested.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.N.R.

The Rev. Mr. Staley is keenly interested in preparing the Indian for the time when he leaves school and has to look after himself. It was this gentleman who asked our nurses' co-operation in First Aid lectures and instructed in child care in the home. He will no doubt do everything possible to encourage this type of instruction. He commenced a manual training class for the older boys; at the time of my visit, each boy had completed a kitchen table which he was to take with him on his return home. These tables were well made and would compare favourably with anything turned out by a factory, of the same type. It is a pleasure to see the more practical side of education stressed in the school.\n\nIn a recent survey Mr. Staley reports that of 98 children tested with tuberculin, only six had positive reactions. The children appear healthy, clean and happy.\n\nW.L. Falconer,\nAsst. Supt. Medical Services.\nAttention - Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAugust 14th,\n1943.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe: Morley Residential School\n\nWe have received from Mr. Staley a telegram as follows:\n\n\"Find it utterly impossible to secure staff. Stop.\nNeed farmer. Stop. Junior room teacher. Stop. Assistant matron. Stop. Seamstress and laundress. Stop.\nCan you help. Stop.\"\n\nNaturally, it is not exactly your responsibility to find a staff but I want to point out I can see nothing ahead but to close the School at Morley for the duration of the war. The only concrete suggestion that I have would be to try to get a good young Mennonite who might be a teacher as well as a farmer, but for the junior room teacher, assistant matron, seamstress and landress I see nothing ahead.\n\nFurther than that, the regulations of the Selective Service simply mean that we cannot advertise for such help, even in our Church paper. It all has to go through Selective Service and I want to say that the results that our Principals are getting from this are simply phenomenal in their crass stupidity. You put in an advertisement for some kind of assistance and you get possibly for one of our Schools a woman of 65, who is suffering from arthritis and general debility, and in addition has absolutely no interest in the work of the School, and has never had anything to do with children, Indian or otherwise.\n\nI am going to see if there is any possibility of coming to Staley's help but I am coming to the conclusion that there is only one thing to do, and that is to close the Morley School for the duration and to let the ninety odd children run wild on the Reserve, being careful, at the same time, to see that everybody in Calgary is aware of what is happening. I don't know whether or not you can be of any assistance because it lies in the realm of high policy and therefore would have to be settled in the other building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD: EWS\nRB44 11-SB TORONTO ONT 16 331P\n\nR A HOEY=\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nOTTAWA ONT=\n\nSTALEY TELEPHONED HE CAN GET STAFF AND OPEN ABOUT USUAL DATE=\n\nGEORGE DOREY.\n\nAUG 16 1943\n\nREGISTERED\nOttawa,\nAugust 17, 1943.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Morley Residential School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 14th instant, in which you refer to the difficulty experienced by Mr. Staley in securing the staff necessary for the operation of the Morley School. I regret that I am not in a position to state just what the answer is to the questions raised by you in your communication. While the war news appears to be encouraging at the moment, I am personally disposed to think that the labour shortage is likely to become more acute during the months immediately ahead of us. In view of the fact, however, that our residential schools are Government institutions it does seem to me that we ought to be able to reach an agreement with the officials of the National Selective Service Organization whereby we would be able to secure the teachers necessary to carry on. The suggestion that these schools should be closed is one that, in my judgment, should not be entertained. Should these schools cease to operate, we would be confronted with juvenile delinquency on our reserves and a number of other problems that would prove more costly than the operation of our residential schools.\n\nIt was, of course, gratifying to receive your telegram of yesterday and to learn that the Principal had secured the staff necessary to carry on. This is a matter, however, which I feel should be discussed more fully with the officials responsible for administering the existing regulations. I shall be glad to discuss this matter with you more fully when I visit Toronto on the 28th.

Would you call me up as soon as you get in, so that I shall know at exactly what time to expect you?\n\nLike you, I do not think that these schools should be closed; but I have heard so much nonsense talked by persons who occupy responsible positions that I feel that some day we should give some publicity to the problem of our Indian Education. There are some people who ought to know better who very lightly say, \"Just close these schools,\" without taking into consideration the fact that by so doing we should very likely increase juvenile delinquency on a rather large scale.

I found it somewhat difficult to answer this question. I stated that, in view of the fact that no request had reached us in recent years for additional accommodation at the school that I was aware of, I could only come to the conclusion that a certain number of Indian families were residing off the reserve. This matter is likely to come up again, either at a meeting of the committee or in Parliament when the Minister's estimates are under discussion. Would it be possible to secure from you a statement with respect to the number of children of school age actually on the reserve, the number enrolled at school and what accommodation we are likely to require on the reserve during the year or two immediately ahead of us?

Harold Perlin, of Banff, came to the rescue, picked the girls up at Morley, brought them to Banff, and after the performance took them home to Morley. Those who enjoyed the concert so much extend their thanks to Mr. Perlin.\nDecember 15, 1944.\n\nR. A.

Some of the Indians have refused to send their children to the school while she is there.\n\nPlease kindly acknowledge receipt of the said statements and we shall be glad to hear from you accordingly so that we may know from time to time how this matter is progressing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMILLCAN & MILLCAN\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAHM:LG\nenc.\nOttawa, December 20, 1944.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing written statements regarding the treatment accorded to Indian children by Miss Anna Beaver.\n\nI am arranging to have these complaints thoroughly investigated and will advise you further when we receive a report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nMessrs.

Willison & Millican. I am also enclosing the statements which the firm just mentioned forwarded with their letter.\n\nOur records show that Anna Beaver entered the Morley School in 1930 and was discharged on September 30, 1940, at the age of 17. While we have no definite information to that effect, we infer that she is now a member of the staff of the Morley Residential School.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could investigate these complaints very thoroughly at the earliest possible date. I also consider that when you proceed to the school to investigate this matter you should be accompanied by Mr. Wilson, the School Inspector who regularly inspects the Morley Residential School. I would like to have a report, both from you and from Mr. Wilson, not only regarding the specific complaints made in the enclosed letter, but also regarding general conditions at the Morley Residential School. An early reply would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. C. P.

Millican and Millican, Barristers, of Calgary, Alberta, together with twelve other sheets (statements made by Indians). Statements by Helen Kootenay and Caroline LaBelle were not enclosed.\n\nMr. G.L. Wilson, Inspector of Schools, being very busy, I was unable to see him before yesterday, when I let him peruse the correspondence and statements mentioned above. He stated that he could not get away before January 8th, and that he would take a day off and go to the Morley School with me during that week. I am to phone him on Saturday, the 6th, and he will state the day we are to go.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. Pant.

Schmidt, and myself, January 8, I may state:\n\n1. In my inspector's report of November 21, 1944, I paid compliment to a policy encouraging the more able young Indians to become members of the staff.\n\nThere are in this school:\n- Anna Beaver, 21 years of age; 4 years as helper in the kitchen and laundry and as supervisor of play activities.\n- Tina Wellman, 21 years of age; 2 years working in the hospital; the past 2 years in the main building engaged mainly in sewing but also assisting in supervision of recreation.\n- Horace Hallway, 17 years of age; farm helper for the past year.\n\n2. Anna Beaver has talent in music and some qualities of leadership, and she has been quite active as matron's assistant in supervising the play and recreational activities of the girls of the school. She conducts an orchestra and in associated marching exercises a military tone has been introduced even to the use of uniforms. I have observed these exercises on a number of occasions and, although I am in no position to remark upon the reaction of parents, I am convinced that the children look to Anna Beaver as a leader and are happy in their associations with her.\n\n3. The matron states that when the children are under the supervision of Anna Beaver and Tina Wellman they are alone with these girls for intervals not exceeding one-half hour, that a spirit of happy co-operation prevails and that formal disciplinary measures are not required.\n\n4. I was present throughout the interviews with the principal and with the matron and endorse the statement being submitted to you by your inspector, Mr. G.P. Schmidt.\n\n5. I should especially urge that, since Anna Beaver shows a disinclination to return to the life of the Indian Reserve and in view of her evident capacity for normal Canadian citizenship, a concerted effort be made to find employment for her, preferably in Indian School work.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nG.L. Wilson,\nInspector of Schools.\nCalgary, January 9th, 1945.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq., Acting Director of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Complaints made against Anna Beaver of the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to my letter of the 30th ultimo, and your No. 119-1-1 of the 20th idem, I beg to report that Mr. G.L. Wilson of Calgary, Provincial Inspector of Public Schools, and myself visited the above-mentioned School yesterday, and took the matter up with Rev. Mr. E.J. Staley, the Principal; we also interviewed Mrs. Leppard, the Matron of the School.\n\nRev. Mr. Staley knew that the Indians had written complaints against Anna Beaver. He said that copies of these had been sent to the Church authorities.\n\nAccording to Rev. Mr. Staley, Anna Beaver is an ex-pupil of the Morley Indian Residential School. She is now twenty-one (21) years of age. Her parents are not living together; her father is in the Nordegg district; her mother is on the home (Morley) reserve, and lives with another man.\n\nRev. Mr. Staley says, that when Anna was discharged from School on account of her age, she said that she had no place to go to live; she was therefore kept at the School, where she helped with the work, and was later given the position of Laundress. She is assisted at this work by the girl pupils.\n\nWhen she is not working, Anna spends most of her time amongst the other girl pupils. Being older than they, she has, it would appear, assumed an authoritative attitude over the pupils, and this has, to a certain degree (more or less) been approved\u2014not to say encouraged by the Matron, with the knowledge of the Principal, it being thought by them that it was beneficial as regards discipline amongst the girl pupils.\n\nI think that probably too much attention and praise, and perhaps some favouritism has been shown to Anna by the Matron and others. This may have been resented by pupils who were in School with Anne, and they mentioned it to their parents, with the result that they are now demanding the removal of Anna Beaver from the School.\n\nRev. Mr. Staley is aware of this, and has decided to let Anne go as soon as he can find another Laundress to take her place; this will likely be before the end of the present month.\n\nRev. Mr. Staley is somewhat worried as to what the girl will do when she leaves the School: Where will she go? With whom will she live? I appreciate his feelings, after having had the girl under his care and guidance for many years\u2014since childhood. He asked whether there is not some other School where she could be employed; I suggested that he take this up with the Missionary Society of the Church.\n\n(over)\nOttawa, January 15, 1946.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of December 15, 1946, with reference to certain complaints about the conduct of Miss Anna Beaver toward certain school children attending the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nAs stated in my reply of December 20, arrangements were made to have these complaints thoroughly investigated, and consequently Mr. C. F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Alberta, and Mr. O. L. Wilson, of Calgary, Provincial Inspector of Public Schools, visited the Morley Residential School on January 8, 1946.\n\nMr. Schmidt has just submitted his report which reads as follows:\n\n\"According to Rev. Mr. Staley, Anna Beaver is an ex-pupil of the Morley Indian Residential School. She is now twenty-one (21) years of age. Her parents are not living together; her father is in the Nordegg district; her mother is on the home (Morley) reserve and lives with another man.\n\n\"Rev. Mr. Staley says that when Anna was discharged from school on account of her age, she said that she had no place to go to live; she was therefore kept at the school, where she helped with the work, and was later given the position of Laundress. She is assisted\n\nMessrs. Milligan & Milligan,\nBarristers, Solicitors,\n311 Lancaster Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\"\nat this work by the girl pupils.\n\n\"When she is not working, Anne spends most of her time amongst the other girl pupils. Being older than they, she has, it would appear, assumed an authoritative attitude over the pupils, and this has, to a certain degree (more or less) been approved - not to say encouraged by the Matron, with the knowledge of the Principal, it being thought by them that it was beneficial as regards discipline amongst the girl pupils.\n\n\"I think that probably too much attention and praise, and perhaps some favouritism has been shown to Anne by the Matron and others.

Mr. Staley is aware of this, and has decided to let Anne go as soon as he can find another laundress to take her place; this will likely be before the end of the present month.\"\n\n\"As regards Anne abusing the younger girl pupils, by corporal punishment or otherwise, I believe this is exaggerated. The matter of keeping one's nose and mouth closed while the other counts up to twenty is more or less a test of endurance, as is twisting an arm, or pinching. The breaking of Eliza's arm was accidental. She slipped and fell in the play-room while being chased by Anne, who immediately reported it to the Matron; and the matter was looked into at once by the Principal. They were satisfied it was accidental, and the girl was taken to the Doctor immediately by Rev. Mr. Staley; and Anne accompanied them.\n\n\"The Matron stated that she tried to find out when certain pupils had been told to take off their clothes, but could not get any information from the pupils. This complaint was very much doubted by the Principal.\"\n\n\"We were extremely anxious to have the\ninspection as thorough in every way as possible and consequently, as mentioned in the second paragraph of this letter, we requisitioned the services of Mr. G. L. Wilson, Public School Inspector, who in his report states:\n\n\"1 - In my inspector's report of November 8th, 1944, I paid compliment to a policy encouraging the more able young Indians to become members of the staff.

If so, I want to know why this money is not drawing interest. You say that Mr. Staley is entitled to requisition $100.00 for each of the five years \u2014 which is all right, \u2014 but what is going to happen to the interest? It would amount to very nearly $15.00 for the first year, $12.00 for the second year, and so on. This, of course, is not a very great deal of money in the Government's reckoning, when it has an income amounting into the millions; but it is a matter of concern to us. If the money could be forwarded to the Board of Home Missions, then we could invest it and get 3 per cent. on it.\n\nI shall be glad if you will let us know whether there is any possibility of this money coming to the School rather than to the Government \u2014 not that we do not trust the Government but that they short-change us in not paying interest.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.D.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 15, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the bequest under the Will of the late Mr. Peacock.\n\nWe have placed this money in the Stony Band Trust Account and interest is allowed at the rate of 5% a year, based on the balance in the account on March 31 of each year. Calculating the interest at this rate will amount to more than that stated in your letter. We will be quite willing to pay the interest as well as the principal to the Morley School for the benefit of the children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2B, Ont.\nOttawa, March 15, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of February 28, requesting you to advise this office if Miss Anna Beaver is still employed at the Morley Residential School.

There is no use in anyone's writing to the contrary, because those are the facts.\n\nThe second thing is, that I should hope that the Department would point out to Millican & Millican that they are not instructing the Churches as to the operation of their Schools.

The receipt of the communication, however, has not been acknowledged. The Chief of the Twinning Division did write to Inspector Schmidt on February 26th. Part of this letter reads as follows:\n\n\"For our information, we would like to know how many children are not attending the school (Morley Residential School) due to Anna Beaver being a member of the staff.\"\n\nInspector Schmidt has not yet replied to this letter.\n\nIt is just possible that we may attach altogether too much importance to these criticisms that reach us from outside sources from time to time.

Mr. E.J. Staley at this office on January 23rd, and again late during the month of February, when he informed me that he was doing everything possible to find and engage another woman to take charge of the Laundry work at the School, but could not find anyone. I drove out to the School today, and called on Rev. Mr. Staley, who said that he was making every effort to get a Laundress, but could not find one.\n\nMr. Staley stated that he had applied to the Selective Service; in February he advertised in both Calgary Papers \u2014 the Herald and the Albertan; and in the Winnipeg Free Press. He also wrote to Dr. Darcey of the Head Office, Toronto; to Dr. R.B. Cochrane, Head of Home Missions Board, and to Dr. T. Powell, head of Home Missions Board for Alberta. He now has two advertisements running in the Calgary Albertan, since March 21st, but has not had any applications. While in Edmonton on March 15th, he took the matter up with Rev. J.F. Woodsworth of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and they could not find anyone. Mrs. Staley is closely following the \"Work Wanted\" advertisements in the papers, and of six women interviewed, none would take the work, remarking that they did not want to wash dirty clothes.\n\nI am attaching hereto copies of advertisements taken from the Calgary Albertan this day.\n\nRev. Staley is offering $50.00 per month and full maintenance for a Laundress; and $100.00 per month for a man and wife, plus full maintenance.\n\nAnna Beaver is working on a day to day basis, pending a new Laundress being found and engaged.\n\nAs regards the number of children who have refused to attend the Morley School due to Anna Beaver being a member of the Staff: Rev. Mr. Staley and Mr. J.N.R. Iredale, whom I interviewed together today, gave me the following names:\n\n(Over)\n1. Pupil No. 089 Violet Rider, age 14 years, daughter of Isaiah Rider.\n\n2. Pupil No. 0136 Kathleen Kootenay, age 8 years, daughter of Joe Kootenay, Jr.\n\n3. Nat Hunter refuses to send his daughter, Helen, age 9 years; this girl has not been to school before.\n\n4. and 5. Joe Mark refused to send two girls, both age 7 years \u2014 one a granddaughter, the other a niece of his (Joe Mark's) wife; both girls are living with him. Rev. Mr. Staley says Joe Mark has now agreed to send one of the girls to school beginning April 1st, next.\n\n6. George Rolling-in-Mud refused to send his boy, John, age 8 years. He changed his mind, and the boy was admitted to the School in December, 1944.\n\nI might say that the School is filled to capacity at the present time.\n\nC. Pant.

Mr. Staley, who said that he was making every effort to get a laundress but could not find one.\n\n\"Mr. Staley stated that he had applied to the Selective Service; in February he advertised in both Calgary papers - the Herald and the Albertan - and in the Winnipeg Free Press. He also wrote to Dr. Darcy of the Head Office, Toronto; to Dr. R.B. Cochrane, Head of the Home Mission Board, and to Dr. T. Powell, head of Home Missions Board for Alberta. He now has two advertisements running in the Calgary Albertan, since March 1st, but has not had any applications. While in Edmonton on March 15th, he took the matter up with Rev. J.F. Woodsworth of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, and they could not find anyone. Mrs. Staley is closely following the 'Work Wanted' advertisements.\"\n\nMessrs.

Glen,\nMinister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 21st, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nThe Board of Home Missions is in receipt of a resolution from the Calgary Presbytery of The United Church of Canada relative to the serious state of education among the children of the Stony Indian Reserve at Morley, and urging us to take up this matter with the Indian Department at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThe resolution goes on to say that there are 163 children of school age on the Reserve and that there is accommodation at the Residential School for only 95, leaving 68 children with no provision for an education. The Calgary Presbytery strongly urges that provision be made for these 68 children, either by way of additions to the present building or a new building.\n\nThe Secretaries of the Board of Home Missions are wholly in accord with the resolution of the Calgary Presbytery and might point out that the facts regarding the educational situation on this Reserve were placed before the officials of the Department during the sittings of the Committee on Reconstruction. We sincerely trust that provision will be made as early as possible for adequate facilities, so that these children can get an education.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Minister of Mines & Resources]\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 23, 1945\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nThe attached letter, May 21st, has been addressed to the Minister by the Rev. Geo. Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, The United Church of Canada, Toronto, in regard to educational facilities for the children of the Stony Indian Reserve at Morley.\n\nWill you please have special note taken of the representations submitted therein which are referred herewith for consideration, and have a departmental reply sent Dr. Dorey in the Minister's absence from Ottawa.\n\nYou might let me have a copy of the reply for our files.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nMr. Hoey:\n\nFor attention.\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, May 23, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nYour letter of May 8th, addressed to the Minister of this Department, has, in the absence of the Minister from the city, been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nA great deal of earnest thought has been given to our immediate post-war program, particularly to the educational needs of the Indian population. You are aware, of course, that a large number of schools have been destroyed by fire during the last five-year period. I have in mind the classroom building at Alberti, the large Indian Day School at Gushnawga and a number of others that might be mentioned. It is our intention to proceed with the construction of new buildings to take the place of the buildings destroyed by fire at the earliest possible date. It would appear also that a number of reserves Indian Day Schools are urgently needed. We have not included an addition to the Morley Residential School in our program, but there is no reason why it should not be included in the list for consideration at a later date.\n\nConditions in the province of Alberta are somewhat unusual. We have, as you know, two Residential Schools in that province operated under the auspices of the United Church - Edmonton, with an enrolment of 150, and Morley, with an enrolment of 100. We have never, however, succeeded in securing a full enrolment at Edmonton in recent years. The enrolment for example at this date is 107 and yet Edmonton is one of our best equipped institutions. Would it be possible to have a member representing your Board look into the educational needs of the Indians of Alberta, with the object of making certain adjustments...\ncertain adjustments between these two institutions? It will be readily appreciated that we may experience difficulty in securing funds for an addition at Nurley while the Edmonton enrolment stands at its present figure. In any event, this is a matter that I would like to discuss with you personally before any final decision is reached.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Director.\n\nReverend George Dorsey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n599 Queen Street West,\nTORONTO 2 B, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 24, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- THE DEPUTY MINISTER -\n\nIn response to the request contained in your memorandum of May 23rd, I am sending forward herewith for your information copy of a letter sent forward by me today to the Reverend Doctor Duryey, Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, The United Church of Canada.\n\nActing Director.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 28th,\n1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Morley Residential School\n\nI have yours of May 23rd. I am well aware of what you say about Edmonton being empty and Morley being full. I expect to be in Alberta some time in September and shall be glad to take up the matter with the two Principals concerned. In the meantime, I am writing to them.\n\nHowever, I do not think there is the slightest possibility of inducing parents of Indian children on the Morley Reserve to send their children to Edmonton. I am sending a copy of part of your letter to the Principals concerned and asking for their reaction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMAY 29 1945\n\nREGISTERED\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Morley Residential School\nSchool Accommodation\n\nI wish again to draw your attention to the lack of accommodation at the Morley Indian Residential School. In view of the situation which is bound to arise in connection with regulations in regard to the Family Allowance payments I would ask that further accommodation be provided as early as possible.\n\nAs the matter now stands we cannot accommodate more than 100 pupils and on the Reserve we have approximately 180 children of the prescribed school age.\n\nAt the present time the parents of the school children are receiving the family allowances for the children during the summer holidays. When school re-opens in September the payments will cease for those children who re-enter or commence school and the children who do not enter school, on account of lack of accommodation, or to be precise, their parents, will most likely continue to receive the allowance cheques.\n\nThe problem thus created will be a difficult one because the parents with children in school will not be paid and those with children not attending school will be paid.\n\nTherefore we may experience trouble in getting the Indians to send their children to school. Of course I know that if they refuse to send their children to school they will forfeit the family allowance for such and each child, but, if we had sufficient accommodation to take care of all the children we could, and would, enforce the act (as it applies to school attendance) to the fullest extent.\n\nI would ask that some concrete plan be formulated, before the re-opening of school, to meet this situation. Could we lower the age for discharge, (temporarily) in order that we could get all the younger children enrolled, until such times as further accommodation is provided?\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you with regard to this matter.\n\nJ.N.R. Laidale,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, August 2, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Ross:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of July 24th, in which you discuss very fully the conditions at the Stony Agency and the needs of the Stony Band of Indians.\n\nThe records here indicate that a number of investigations of the conditions at this particular agency have been made during the last two-year period. It is a matter of regret, however, that the attempts recently made to secure additional reserve lands for this band have not been successful. It would appear that the only suitable land adjoining the reserve is a ranch, which might be secured at an approximate cost of $800,000. The officials of the Indian Affairs Branch are not fully convinced that the acquisition of this land would meet, to the extent that they ought to be met, the needs of these Indians. This matter, however, is still under consideration, and it is my intention to ask a senior official of the department to visit this agency in the course of a month or so and to submit a report, not only on the necessity for the purchase of additional lands, but as well on the other matters discussed by you in your communication. In view of this fact, it is not my intention to deal at length with the issues submitted by you.\n\nI should like, however, to refer to the provision made in existing legislation for the payment of Family Allowances to Indians. The registration of Indians for this purpose has been almost completed. Payments will be made to the members of Indian bands on the same basis as payments are made to members of white families. In this connection, you were apparently misinformed when you state that no Indian mother can get the allowance for children above seven years. As a matter of fact, provisions of the Act are being very liberally interpreted and no Indian entitled to such payments will experience the slightest difficulty in securing these allowances, either in cash or in kind. Since Indian Day Schools have not been established or where accommodation at Residential Schools is inadequate, the provision in the Act for non-attendance of children at school will not apply to Indian families. In other words, the officials of the department are anxious that everything humanly possible should be done to enable Indians to benefit from the Family Allowance Act to the fullest extent possible.\n\nI note also your reference to the Residential School at the Stony Agency and to the fact that no provision has been made for sixty-eight children of school age. This school, as you state, is operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. You are, no doubt, aware that we have at Edmonton a Residential School operated also by the\nOttawa, August 2, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Ross:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of July 24th, in which you discuss very fully the conditions at the Stony Agency and the needs of the Stony Band of Indians.\n\nThe records here indicate that a number of investigations of the conditions at this particular agency have been made during the last two-year period. It is a matter of regret, however, that the attempts recently made to secure additional reserve lands for this band have not been successful.

This school, as you state, is operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. You are, no doubt, aware that we have at Edmonton a Residential School operated also by the\nUnited Church. This school is one of the most up-to-date and one of the best schools of its kind in Canada. The officials inform me that despite the fact that recruiting has been undertaken by the Principal of this school as far west as the Pacific Coast, he has never at any time succeeded in securing the quota of pupils for which we allow per capita grants. You will readily appreciate how difficult, in view of this condition, it would be for the Minister to persuade Parliament that an additional capital outlay for the extension of the Morley School could be justified. However, this is a matter that will be thoroughly investigated by the official to whom I have already referred.\n\nI find it somewhat difficult to understand your reference to the aged and physically incapacitated Indians of this reserve. Our field officials have been instructed from time to time that it is their duty and responsibility to supply these Indians with the full clothing and housing accommodation necessary to maintain them in a state of comfort. The Stony Indians have on deposit with the Government at this date Trust Funds amounting to $75,065.78. Section 95 of the Indian Act, paragraph (d), reads:\n\n\"The Superintendent General (Minister) may whenever sick or disabled, or aged or destitute Indians are not provided for by the band of which they are members, furnish sufficient aid from the funds of the band for the relief of such sick, disabled, aged or destitute Indians.\"\n\nThe records here indicate that relief supplies have been provided on the recommendation of the Inspector and the Indian Agent from time to time from both Parliamentary Appropriations and Trust Funds and no complaints with respect to the inadequacy of these supplies have reached the department since the Inspector made his last investigation, now almost a year ago. The Indian Agent in his quarterly report for the period ending June 30, 1945, in referring to general conditions at the agency, states:\n\n\"There has been no lack of employment for Indians at this agency or for those able and willing to work. Quite a number were employed by the Roxana Oil Company building roads and the Mannix Contracting Company wanted about fifty Indians to work on a dam construction project, but were only able to get twelve men.\"\n\nIt has occurred to me that it would be helpful to the department if you would discuss conditions at this agency with our representative immediately following his arrival in Calgary. It is unnecessary to add that I appreciate very fully your interest in the members of this band and your willingness to cooperate with the department in finding a solution for what appears to be a very involved and perplexing problem.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.)

Careful x-ray examination of the hip and spine did not show any evidence of injury.\n\nI then interviewed Mr. Leppard, teacher at the Residential School. I told Mr. Leppard of the statements made by the girl in question and her father. Mr. Leppard said he could not recollect any such incident as the one under investigation. A copy of Mr. Leppard's statement is attached hereto.\n\nIn summing up I would be inclined to think that the whole thing is untrue, or, to say the least, so grossly exaggerated that there is no truth in the statements of Tom Simeon or his daughter. It seems to me that the sole reason for Tom Simeon making these statements was to keep his daughter away from school and collect the Family Allowance money. I made it clear to Tom Simeon that in any event his daughter would have to return to school, or if found to be ill she would have to go to the hospital and whichever way it turned out he would not collect the family allowance.\n\nHowever the matter has now been cleared up and the daughter May is in residence at the school and she seems to be quite happy and contented.\n\nJ.N.R.

G. Roy Inglis - Principal\nChief Enos Hunter\nChief David Bearspaw\nCouncillor Isaac Two Young Men\nTom Kaquits\nJudas Hunter\nMoses Wesley\nMrs. Moses Wesley\nJudea Wesley Beaver\nEddie Hunter - Interpreter\n\nMoses Wesley said that he had asked the chief to\ncall the meeting to enquire into a complaint regarding\nthe treatment of himself and his daughter during an in-\ncident which occurred at the school at 7 p.m. Monday,\nJanuary 20th, 1947.\n\nOn this day he said he went to see Mr. Inglis\nat the school. He told Mr. Inglis that he wanted to fill out\nthe forms for his young child. He signed the forms and then\nhe asked Mr. Inglis why the children ran away from school.\n\nMoses said his daughter had complained that she\nhad been mistreated. She said she had been whipped by the\nmatron on several occasions six times a week. She said she\nhad been whipped twice by Mr. Inglis.\n\nMoses said that he had told his daughter to\nobey the teachers and the principal.\n\nMoses further stated that when his daughter is\nat home she is always good and does not require any whipping.\n\nHe further complained that on the same night,\nwhen he finished signing etc., he went to the sun porch.\nHis girl had gone for lunch. Then all the girls had to\nreport to the principal's office. A few moments later\nMr. Inglis waved his daughter Rosa to the office.\n\nHe said his girl was too frightened to go to\nthe office and grabbed her father by the arm as she did not\nwant to go to the office.\n\nAll this time, Moses, said, he didn't make a\nmove. Then Mr. Inglis told him to leave the school.\nMr. Inglis \"grabbed me and pushed me to the door and made\na tear in my coat in the process and forcibly ejected me\nand my daughter through the front door of the building.\"\n\nJudea Wesley Beaver said; \"I have heard what\nMoses Wesley has said and I swear it is true.\"\n\nMr. Inglis asked Judea Wesley Beaver, \"Where was\nMoses when I went to the office?\"\nJudea Wesley Beaver admitted he didn't know.\n\nMrs. Moses Wesley and Mrs. Paul Poucette said they were there and the above is true.\n\nMr. Inglis denied emphatically all of the foregoing relative to the incident of force and states that he only told Moses Wesley to leave.\n\nAs Indian Agent I then told the meeting that the matter would have to go to higher authority and that we would try to arrange a meeting to hear further statements early next week.\n\nJ.N.R.Iredale,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nI/H.\n2cc\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Complaint of Stone Indians Concerning the Indian Residential School on that Reserve.\n\nOn the 23rd instant I was interviewed by Mr. Iredale, Acting Agent, and Rev. G. R. Inglis, Principal of the school, in regard to a complaint of one Moses Wesley.\n\nAttached hereto please find copy of report on a meeting held at the Agency Office on the 25th, concerning which these two gentlemen came to see me.\n\nFrom the interview it was apparent that this complaint might be one of many that would arise from the manner in which the Principal was operating this school. The Agent was asked to call a meeting of the Councillors and interested parents at Morley on the 26th, in order that I could meet with them and get a clearer picture of the existing situation.\n\nApparently rumours and complaints had reached the ears of Rev. E. J. Staley, now Principal of the Indian Residential School at Edmonton and formerly Principal of this school. He came from Edmonton and accompanied me to Morley on the 26th. Dr. E. L. Stone, who was on routine inspection in the south, was informed of this complaint and he also went to Morley on the 27th and remained there for two days. A very good representative meeting of Councillors and parents met with us at the Church Hall, and the entire afternoon was given over to the consideration of their complaints, to wit:\n\n1. The Indians had complained of the punishment meted out by the Principal and the Matron in charge.\n2. The food.\n3. Clothing supplied to children.\n4. Part-time school work.\n5. Health and cleanliness of the pupils.\n\nThe verbatim report is not yet available, but dealing with the foregoing as remembered -\n\n1. There were a number of charges that capital punishment was meted out by the Matron, and that, in some instances, she had not only strapped on the hands, but beat pupils on the head. The Principal had also employed capital\npunishment for various misdemeanours even in the presence of parents. We were satisfied that the complaints were mostly true, though possibly exaggerated. The parents stated that they realized that their children should receive a certain amount of capital punishment, but that they felt that the Principal and the Matron lacked kindness and understanding; they had found it very difficult to approach the staff members as friends.\n\n2. In regard to food. It was not clearly indicated that the food was poor and insufficient, but it was not what the parents expected nor what the pupils had formerly received when Mr. Staley was Principal.\n\n3. It was established that children were often not properly clothed to go out into the cold, and that from some source they should be given better and warmer clothing.\n\n4. In regard to part-time school work. The usual complaints were made that children were not getting enough class room work, and too much time was employed in duties in and about the school and the farm.\n\n5. It was stated that a number of children had lice in their hair, which did not indicate that very great interest was employed in assuring that the children were always clean.\n\nThe writer asked for comments regarding these complaints from Mr. Staley, and he spoke to the Indians stating that it certainly would be the desire of his Church to correct anything that was wrong as quickly as possible, and to remove any canker in the organization that would lead to a happier understanding between the staff and parents. Dr. Stone kindly spoke in regard to food and health. He stated that very shortly a Departmental dietitian would report on the food, and he would give it his very particular attention.\n\nAfter hearing all complaints, I informed the Indians that I would report -\n\nThat capital punishment was uncalled for if the organization was running smoothly; that capital punishment was always frowned upon by the Department, and that I was immediately going to ask the Principal to discontinue this form of punishment until he had discussed the reason for it with the parent, and only when there was no better way would capital punishment be meted out.\n\nAs for the other complaints, the Principal would be asked to immediately check on the food and clothing and the cleanliness of the children.\n\nI did not state that the removal of the Matron would be requested, but so many had mentioned that she was so unsympathetic and so prone to punishment on the least provocation, that her removal from this school at an early\ndate would be the only way to satisfy the Indians and regain their confidence in the school. This lady, Miss Hodgson, was for many years a teacher, and though she undoubtedly is very efficient, it is felt that she has not got a sympathetic approach to her present work. It is our belief that the United Church would be well advised to transfer her to some other work and replace her with somebody with better understanding.\n\nThe Principal, Mr. Inglis, appears to be a very fine gentleman, but with no experience in this particular work. Possibly he is too strict a disciplinarian, and he does not mingle freely enough with the Indians. It must be remembered, of course, that he followed Mr. Staley, who lived with them for 25 years, and the Indians must learn to know him just as much as it is necessary for him to learn to know them. Immediately after the meeting I spoke to him and acquainted him of the foregoing.\n\nThe meeting closed with the understanding that every attempt would be made to correct what would appear to be wrong. The Indians were asked to be charitable towards the Principal and to the staff, and they were also asked to give Mr. Inglis the opportunity to make certain reforms in his attitude and that of his staff, which we believe to be necessary for the smooth running of this school. Then, if he should fail, we could do no more than report that he was not the proper person to be the head of this school.\n\nActing Agent Mr. Iredale remained at the meeting part of the time; Mr. Horton, who will be Clerk-in-Charge when Mr. Iredale goes on sick leave, remained throughout and took extensive notes. The meeting was carried on in a very pleasant and orderly manner. The Indians were quiet and deliberate, which fact indicated that they were very serious and disturbed, but not yet to a point of rebellion.\n\nIt is our recommendation that the United Church officials be advised of the unsettled condition and that as quickly as possible try to correct it.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nenc.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Horey\n\nCorporal Punishment in Indian Schools.\n\nThe situation at the Morley Residential School has been unsatisfactory since the opening of the new term. I intend to write to Dr. Dorey telling him of the situation there and sending copies of the letters from Inspector Gooderham and Mr. Iredale that are attached herewith.\n\nI would appreciate your comments upon the draft letter which I have prepared to Mr. Gooderham and particularly to the instructions concerning capital punishment that I have included therein. I can find on file no instance of similar regulations having been prepared but from personal experience I feel that in such instances as at the Morley School, the situation can best be clarified by clearly instructing the principal in this matter. I may say that the principal is new to our service, having just been discharged from the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\nI also intend to let Dr. Dorey know that the Reverend Mr. Inglis has been given these instructions.\n\nBernard F.

Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nMiss Alice McCready, Dietitian of the Department of National Health and Welfare, has spent four days looking into the diet of the Stony Indian Residential School at Morley. Her verbal report was:\n\n(1) That the feeding was about average for the better fed schools.\n\n(2) That the diet is low in citrus fruits, as at all schools, but higher than at some, and perhaps than at the average.\n\n(3) That the present school resources in milk could be better utilized than they are.\n\nOn my own account I ascertained that the average gain in weight of seventy-eight pupils between September 15th and February 15th - five months - was nine pounds.\n\nI conferred with Miss McCready and the Rev. Principal at the beginning and end of her visit. The Principal was interested, open to advice and undertook to profit by Miss McCready's recommendations.\n\nIn view of the limited funds at the disposal of the Principal of this, as of other Residential schools, and considering that the Principal, the Matron and many of the staff are in their first year at this kind of work, I judge that feeding conditions are as good as can be reasonably expected, and are likely to improve.\n\nThe Matron told me that she had apparently solved the problem of keeping the pupils heads free of lice. I had sent her some DDT powder, but consider that the key to the problem is in treatment with oil every Monday, following Sunday contact with members of the family living at home.\n\nE. L.

Leng\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRE: SCHOOL ATTENDANCE\n\nIt is desired to obtain some guidance in regard to pupils of the Stony Indian Residential School at Morley, Alta., who have reached the age of approximately 16 years. This advice is sought in that the following Indians have approached this office requesting that their children be excused and discharged from the school:\n\nPaul Bigstone, on behalf of John Christie Bigstone, pupil #121, birth date Jan 15/1932.\nReba Mark, pupil #101, birth date March 6/1932.\nMary Margaret Chiniquay, pupil #100, birth date Feb 21-32.\n\nI am advised that the parents in these cases have requested the discharge of their children to assist at home. In the case of Reba Mark, I was informed by the parents that this girl had been placed in school when 6 years of age and had been promised discharge at 14 or 15 years of age.\n\nOne other case was brought to the attention of the writer by Isaiah Rider in which he coupled the Family Allowance payments with school attendance, indicating that he would place his girl Irene in the school if he could be permitted to take her home on Friday to Sunday night, and also receive his Family Allowance on her behalf.\n\nThis matter is being placed before the Branch with a view to receiving some clarification, as the matter of attendance at school is not considered good. We have now prepared a complete resume of children attending school, this for Family Allowance purposes. On the last check at the school some 62 children were in attendance or legitimately excused by reason of hospitalization at Sanatorium. The absentee list at this school numbers 40, of whom 6 are discharged, 4 in Sanatorium, 1 at home from Sanatorium with Medical Certificate, leaving 29 children actually truant at this date. We requested truancy forms from the Branch, but to date these have not been received and we wonder if the Branch agrees in the application of this method to secure the return to school of the 29 children mentioned above.\n\nMay we be advised and instructed, please.\n\n[Signature]\n(John E.

Pugh,\nSuperintendent,\nStony-Sarcee Indian Agencies,\nMorley, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th instant with reference to certain pupils of the Morley Residential School.\n\nIt is the general practice in Indian Residential Schools throughout Canada to retain children until the close of the academic year during which they reach the age of sixteen years. Under these circumstances Paul Bigstony, No. 121; Reba Mark, No. 0101 and Mary Margaret Chiniquay, No. 0100 should remain in the Morley Residential School until June 30th, 1947.\n\nWe note your remarks regarding Reba Mark. No Agent or principal has any authority to advise the parents that she would be discharged at fourteen or fifteen years of age and it is very unlikely that any such statement was made.\n\nThe mere fact that Isaiah Rider wishes to take his daughter home Friday to Sunday night would not entitle him to family allowance. As a matter of fact, family allowance payments can be cancelled in the case of any child of school age where school facilities are available, who does not attend school regularly. In addition, it might be pointed out the Department does not approve pupils of a residential school going home from Friday to Sunday.\n\nThe Department feels that you should enforce the compulsory clause in the Indian Act so as to have the children of school age placed in school.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nBernard F.

That those parents who reside within a reasonable distance from the school, say 3 miles, might be permitted to have their children attend the classrooms on a daily basis. There will be approximately 12 families who could have their children attend as day pupils. Of these, there are actually in residence at school at the present time 12 children and approximately 5 other children not now attending school who could attend on a day basis. It is thought that perhaps if the 12 referred to were allowed to attend day school that a like number of children could be brought in from more distant points as residential pupils. This would, of course, bring up the matter of grant earning pupils who are actually be attending day school, but it is felt that the suggestion would be very worthy of consideration and discussion with the Council and Indians concerned.\n\nThe matter was discussed by the Council and Indians present as a result of a general protest following the serving of truancy notices by this office. The Council and Indians were advised that if such a day school were put into effect that the same means of enforcing attendance would be applied.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this matter were considered and instructions given, please.\n\n(John E. Fugh)\nSuperintendent,\nStony-Sarcee Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Superintendent of Training\n\nRe: Attendance Morley Residential School,\nStony Indian Agency.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a letter received from Superintendent Pugh in regard to the enrollment and a suggestion that children who live near the school might be allowed to attend classes on a daily basis. Mr. Pugh makes this suggestion because the school is now over-crowded, and he believes that this can be relieved and other children brought into the school for class room work.\n\nI think it is a splendid idea, and would recommend its serious consideration. In this manner, more children could be given an education, and the parents will get their desire to have their children live at home, and, at the same time, they may learn a little more about the responsibility of parenthood.\n\nIt is not known here whether or not this sort of arrangement is made elsewhere; if it is, you will no doubt have a basis of payment not only of the per capita grant, but also of the family allowance.\n\nIn case such a situation has not arisen elsewhere, it would be my suggestion that the parents be allowed the family allowance, and that the residential school be treated very much the same as any white day school which Indian children are attending. Indian children attending a residential school would of course receive a hot mid-day meal and the monthly payment to the school should be the same as is given to white day schools.\n\nYour reaction to this will be awaited with interest by Mr. Pugh and myself.\n\nG.

It is also noted that this matter has not apparently been discussed with the Principal of the Morley Residential School. I feel certain that we would have some complaint from the United Church if we were to proceed without their approval.\n\nHowever, for your information I may say that we are operating day schools in certain of our residential schools elsewhere. Where a school has a number in attendance in excess of its pupilage we investigate the possibility of having a certain number of children attend on a day school basis. The usual standard is that followed by most Provincial Departments of Education namely:\n\n(a) That pupils under ten years of age can be expected to walk two miles to school.\n\n(b) That pupils ten years of age and over can be expected to walk three miles to school.\n\nFamily Allowances are paid to the parents concerned provided that these children attend the required number of days.\n\nAn Order in Council is obtained authorizing the establishment of a day school. One of the teachers at the school is paid on a part time basis as the day school teacher, directly by the Department. Her salary is based on our day school teachers' salary schedule. For example, if there are twenty-five day school pupils in attendance, we would allow her a salary at the rate of two thirds of the amount which would be allowed her on the day school teachers' salary schedule. It is realized, of course, that these day school pupils might well be scattered throughout two or three classrooms and it would be impossible to pay small amounts to all teachers concerned. Therefore, the denomination is requested to name one teacher to teach and be paid as described above and it is left to the school principal to make the necessary adjustments.\n\nIt will be necessary to approach Dr. Dorey concerning this proposal. Our attitude might be summed up as follows: That if this school had pupils in excess of its pupilage, we would not hesitate to proceed with the establishment of a day school, but in view of the fact that it is not the case, we feel that the denomination concerned will have to be consulted before a decision can be reached. We would appreciate hearing from you if you have an opportunity of discussing this matter with the principal of the school.

Pugh, Supt.,\nStony-Sarcee Indian Agencies,\nMorley, Alta.\n\nRE: Attendance, Morley Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Pugh:\n\nReplying to yours of Dec. 30th, 1947 re. the above. It is apparent that present school facilities are inadequate for the number of children on the Stony Indian Reserve, as there are approximately 180 children of school age, there should be at least two more class-rooms provided.\n\nThe present capacity of the Residential School is for 90 pupils; and unless the present dormitory space were enlarged, some of the children would have to attend on a day basis. This arrangement, no doubt, would involve difficulties. There would be the question as to who should attend the day school or the residential, with the possibility that attendance at the Residential School might drop unless a compulsory system were adopted by the Indian Affairs Branch. There would also be the necessity of standardization of all salaries of teachers.\n\nThese difficulties, in my personal opinion, should not deter the early provision of adequate facilities for the education of all Stony children, as the importance of this objective should assure the co-operation of all those presently engaged in this work, and at the same time meet the desires of the Indian people themselves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned (G. Roy Inglis)\nPrincipal.\nG.H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRE: Attendance - Morley Residential School,\nFile 119-1-1 (WT 1) d/Dec.23, 1947.\n\nAcknowledgement is made of copy of letter received from the Supt. of Welfare & Training in regard to the proposal outlined in our letter 119-6-7 of Dec.9/47. In reply it is advised that while the writer did not place this matter before the Principal of the above school in the first instance, this has now been discussed with the Rev.G.Roy Inglis and a copy of his letter is attached here-to.\n\nIn conversation with Mr.Inglis on this subject it was mutually felt that the suggestion was of an experimental nature, and the sole motive was to utilize the present facilities of the school, either by residential or day attendance, for the advancement of education among the Stony Indians. It is realised that the plan is experimental. The object is to put ourselves in a position to be able to offer the Indians further accommodation for schooling in the simplest and most economical way possible. As a step towards this end, it is felt if there are a number of children living within a 3 mile radius of the school, who could attend on a day basis, that for each of these children not in residence by reason of attending day school only, accommodation could be provided for an equal number of children up to 90 in residence.\n\nTo carry out this plan it is suggested that the school provide a mid-day meal, which could possibly be paid for by a monthly grant. In regard to the teachers, it is not recommended that a difference be made in the status i.e., one being paid as a day school teacher and one by the Church Authorities on their basis. This recommendation is made because of the fact that there are only 2 classrooms and the children attending by day would be in with the the children attending residential school. It is further suggested that if the Branch could see its way clear to permit an experiment at this school along the lines outlined above, placing the responsibility for attendance upon the Indians in the case of both day and residential schools at least for a period long enough to discover the reaction and the attitude of the Indians, that should this experiment prove successful it is possible that it might lead to the establishment of a day school separate from the residential school in so far as pupilage is concerned. In other words the present 2 classrooms might become crowded making it necessary to erect another building which could possibly be used as a day school.\n\nThis matter is respectfully submitted for your consideration.\n\n(John.E. Pugh)\nSuperintendent,\nStony-Sarcee Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Supt. of Welfare & Training\n\nRe: Attendance Morley Residential School\n\nReference your 119-1-1 (W.T.1) of December 23rd. I am attaching hereto copy of a letter from Mr. Pugh, together with copy of a letter to him from the Principal of the school. These letters indicate that the suggestion of day pupils is made purely as an experiment.\n\nYou state in your letter that the pupilage is one hundred. You know as well as I do that the churches always try to keep the pupilage to the very extreme of accommodation. In the case of Morley school, the present accommodation is limited ninety. Therefore, the present attendance is now only two short of capacity.\n\nMr. Inglis states that there are approximately 180 children of school age. This includes Stonies living to the far north near Nordegg and those living in the Pekisko area in the far south. I am sure it is not our intention or hope to continue indefinitely to bring all these children into one central residential school. The Indians in the north are waiting patiently for the establishment of a day school near Nordegg. As for those in the Pekisko area, it is almost impossible to get many to go to Morley, and if and when a reservation can be purchased in that area, a day school would naturally be set up for their children.\n\nI cannot give definite figures, but I would say that there are fifty Stony children at these outside settlements that we cannot ever expect to get into the residential school at Morley. That leaves 125 or 130 to be educated at this point.\n\nI think it is agreed that the residential school should not be enlarged to look after the increasing pupilage, but that some form of day school be set up to care for this surplus. There is therefore a need for a day school on the Stony Indian Reserve, as well as the present residential school. In setting up a day school, we may anticipate complications. These are obvious.\n\nHowever, until something is done along this line, the experiment suggested by Mr. Pugh and Mr. Inglis would not only educate the children but the parents. It is anticipated there are parents, who today are so rabid in their demands for a day school, that they would be very happy after a couple of years to send their children back to a residential school if it were available, thus relieving themselves of a lot of family responsibility. I am not saying it is right to relieve them of this responsibility,\nbut it would create a different mental attitude which would make it easier to operate a residential school as well as a day school in the same vicinity.\n\nTo carry out this experiment, it is suggested:\n\n1. that the total enrollment of the resident and day school be limited to one hundred, because there are only two class rooms.\n\n2. that no day pupils be allowed unless there are ninety in residence.\n\n3. that ten day pupils be allowed, and that the school be paid $10.00 per month per pupil, to whom it will supply not only the normal class room work, but a mid-day meal.\n\nIt is not known here what authority would be required to follow this procedure, but the method of payment mentioned in your letter is too involved and cumbersome. It would not work here.\n\nAll children of school age, within a radius of three miles, could readily get to the school, because most of them ride ponies and do not have to walk.\n\nI want you to know that all the children returned the first day of school after the Christmas holidays, and that there is a different feeling towards the school today than there was a year ago. I feel that the Indians will fully co-operate on this experiment if it can be tried.\n\nMy final suggestions have not been discussed with Mr. Pugh nor the school principal, but a copy is going to them, and of course you will get Dr. Dorey's reaction.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nenc.\nJanuary 19, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nMorley Residential School\n\nPlease find attached correspondence from Mr. Gooderham, Mr. Pugh and the Reverend Mr. Inglin concerning the proposal to have certain children living near this school attend it on a day school basis.\n\nWe are already conducting schools on this basis for both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nYou will find a somewhat detailed account of how these schools are operated in my letter to Mr. Gooderham of December 23rd. As I see this picture, it depends entirely on whether the school can be filled from elsewhere with boarders. It is our intention to build a day school at Nordegg on the new reserve which has just been established. This day school was promised the Indians there when the new reserve was being planned.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you with an expression of your views on the above proposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

G. Roy Inglis and Miss M.E. Woodburn, seamstress at the school.\n\nIt is desired to state that on Tuesday evening, the Principal of the above school interviewed the undersigned, making a complaint against the Chief of the Wesley Band, Enos Hunter, which is embodied in Miss Woodburn's statement.\n\nThe writer's first intention was to proceed against Enos Hunter for common assault, but it is now desired first to place this matter before the Branch for their consideration.\n\nIt should be mentioned that Mr. Inglis was absent in Calgary on the 23rd, and apparently Chief Enos Hunter visited the school in connection with his daughter Lavina, Pupil No. 0156, aged 9 years, who had been disciplined by Miss Woodburn. This discipline took the form of not permitting Lavina to proceed to the Morley Trading Co.'s store with the other children on their customary outings on certain evenings.\n\nIt would appear that when Chief Hunter, who was at the store, found that his girl was not present, he then visited the school and without asking for the Principal or the Matron, took the situation in hand himself, as stated in Miss Woodburn's letter.\n\nThe Principal in conversation with the writer felt that this type of self-administration of school affairs by Indians cannot be tolerated in the interests of the school and the staff. In conversation with Miss Woodburn, Enos Hunter told her that the parents of the children of the Stony Band would take care of the discipline of the children and that the staff should leave them alone.\n\nThe writer realizes that ordinarily this is a problem that can be handled by the Assistant or Superintendent but, as apparently a hard and fast rule will have to be laid down, the writer seeks the advice of the Branch.\n\nEnos Hunter was actuated, no doubt, by some outside influence and consequently presumes to be\na law unto himself. The writer is of the opinion that this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.\n\nTherefore, before taking any action in the matter other than talking to Enos Hunter, the writer would be glad of advice from the Branch for future guidance in matters of this kind.\n\n(John E.

It appears that Lavina Hunter committed some misdemeanor which Miss Woodburn considered deserved punishment and there is no question that Miss Woodburn should be upheld in this particular case as the punishment inflicted was not excessive.\n\nWe also feel that if the Indians interfered in the same manner as Chief Hunter has done, it would totally upset the discipline of the school.\n\nThe Department feels that the Regional Supervisor and yourself should interview Chief Hunter at the earliest possible date and point out to him that the Morley Residential School can only be conducted successfully if the authority of the management is upheld. It should be pointed out to Chief Hunter that as head of one of the Bands, he should show an example to the other Indians and should not assume authority which he does not possess. I would be pleased to have a reply from you following the interview between Chief Hunter, the Regional Supervisor and yourself.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel Reay:\n\nMorley Residential School: Interim Report\n\nAuthorized pupils: 90\nPresently in residence: 81\nLocal eligible children not in school: 103.\n\n(These figures do NOT include Nordegg or Fehnka.)\n\nOnly two classrooms are available for the 81 children. Grade IV and up attend in the classrooms a little better than half time.\n\nOn this basis, this school cannot cope with the local situation. There is evidence that fifty years of this sort of partial coverage has failed to achieve what a school of adequate size and organization should be able to do in ten years.\n\nIt is strongly urged that a building programme should be started here at an early date so as to provide for a total of at least six classrooms with increased residential and administration facilities.\n\nI would suggest a building with six classrooms on the main floor, a full basement, and a top floor for teachers' quarters.\n\nC.W.T. Clark\n\nFor 48/49 building programme?\nColonel Neary:\n\nNorley Indian Residential School; Visited on Nov. 15\n\nThis school continues to serve only a fraction of the eligible children in a fractional way. The children appear to come voluntarily, but too often they come too late in life and too tardily in the school term.\n\nUnless facilities are provided to give complete educational coverage over one generation the effects of any lesser degree of coverage are correspondingly negatived as the small minority of schooled children are returned to the pool of the unschooled. Vital statistics also work against the attainment of the objective as each year the population increases faster than accommodation is being provided.\n\nThe teaching in this school is at a disadvantage. A lack of mechanization for household activities compels an allotment of pupils and time that retards progress through the grades as will be seen from the age-grade tables. This withdrawal of the pupils from congested classrooms appears momentarily to lighten the load on the senior teacher who conducts Grades three to eight.\n\nI understand that the Alberta school inspector is to make some comments on the classroom situation. I had hoped that the Grade eight pupils (two) might have been sent to school in Calgary.\n\nThe junior teacher is to some extent trained but is getting her first experience here under tryout conditions and progress in the primary grades may be expected to be slow.\n\nI deplore the tendency to permit Indians to consume time on alien forms of art to the exclusion of attention to other disciplines. There are already enough examples of white people who prefer or who are content while someone else supports them to fool away their time in art colonies in activities at which they cannot excel sufficiently to bring economic stability to themselves or aesthetic enjoyment to a significant number of people.\n\nFrom the staff's point of view the school's needs appear to be \"more kitchen space and more classrooms\" but actually an all-round expansion is necessary (as previously reported) so that the school may properly integrate all its activities which are presently notably deficient in adequate vocational and physical education.\n\nA canopy over the kitchen stove which I expected to see has not yet been installed.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor Superintendent, Morley.\nExtract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Stony Band Council held on October 27th, 1948 at Morley, Alta.\n\n9. Chief Enos Hunter placed before the Superintendent the matter of Miss Hodgson, matron at the Morley Indian Residential School, stating that, in her capacity as matron at the school, she was unsatisfactory to the Indians. This matter has been before the Council previously and has not been dealt with in view of the fact that individual personalities were more or less at the bottom of the agitation.\n\nThe writer informed the Council that from his observations at the school he felt that Miss Hodgson was rendering good service, and that in the matter of discipline towards their children, that providing this was carried out in a fair manner, it was essential to the welfare of the school, and the following was quoted to the Indians from No. 1 Vol.3, October issue of the Indian School Bulletin, under the heading \"Little Angel?\":\n\n\"I love my infant more than breath\nOr bread or drink. I'd suffer death\nOr pain or illness, short or long,\nTo keep him flourishing and strong.\nBut candor forces me to say\nI eagerly await the day\nWhen some poor kindergarten teacher\nWill wrestle with the little creature.\"\n\nAn explanation of this quotation was made to the Council and they were informed that the writer did not feel disposed to making any specific charges out of their complaint. Chief Enos Hunter advised me that the Council decided to take it to higher authority.\n\n(Sgd) John E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in all schools attended during quarter, excluding holidays, including the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1941.\n\nE.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is calculated by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Principal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means, the total number of days in residence of all pupils referred to in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nDated:\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended of all pupils whose names appear on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Report of the Morley School at Morley, Ontario**\n\n**Stoney Reserve for Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1942**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDARD IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAYS OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 622             | Beaver Dick     | 15  | v   | Cl. 108        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 662             | Bear Jonathan   | 15  | v   | Cl. 113        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 72               | Holloway Horace | 14  | v   | Cl. 113        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 73               | John Wallace    | 14  | v   | Cl. 106        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 74               | Chingewa Walter | 14  | v   | Cl. 106        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 75               | Mark Alfred     | 13  | v   | Bgs. 176       |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 76               | Left Hand Woman | 12  | v   | Bgs. 178       |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 77               | Poweshiek Sally | 14  | v   | Cl. 108        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 78               | Thomas          | 12  | v   | Cl. 109        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 79               | Ferguson, Wallace | 14  | v   | Cl. 109        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 80               | Hunter Alfred   | 12  | v   | Cl. 67         |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 81               | Simon Carl      | 14  | v   | Cl. 105        |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 82               | Smallboy Cecil  | 13  | v   | Bgs. 183       |                   |                         |                           | 20          |\n| 83               | Left Hand       | 12  | v   | Bgs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in a quarter of all pupils attending the Return and is shown by adding the figures under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, should any be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

in residence during Quarter**: 8904\n- **Average attendance of pupils during Quarter**: 96.78\n\n**Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter**: $4113.15\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n##

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils were present and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition of the and School for the Quarter ended Principal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1st 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Morley this 1st July 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI, [Name], declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDated [Date].\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated [Date].\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupil during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ended Dec. 31st, 1944 School for the Quarter\n\nDated Feb. 1st, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 Rep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, can an adjustment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Report of the Marley School at Morley on

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Days pupils in residence during quarter\" for each pupil.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended:\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the Name, House of State School for the Quarter ended................. 19...\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated.................................. 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................. this.................................. 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 4, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 25, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at APR 27 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the columns under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Morley Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 12, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Morley, Alta., this of October 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 405\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI, Henry Cooper, Superintendent, do hereby certify that the above statement of the attendance and tuition at the United Church of Canada School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 15, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in which all pupils entered on the Return are accounted for by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY THAT the within Return contains a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL United Church of Canada Marier, Alta., School for the Quarter ended March 31, 19...\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 21, 19...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI, [Name], certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in the course of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due (or quarter) is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The grant per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ........................................................

Quarter:** 73.09\n\n**Amount of per pupil grant due for Quarter:** $4019.95\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 29th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is obtained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, including the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any adjustment made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Morley School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: G. Roy Ingles\n\nDated October 15, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: M. Hild\n\nDated at Morley this 21st Oct. 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nQUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Morley School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at Morley this 21st Oct., 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, ruling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 20th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI, [Name], certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and may be found by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, including the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any credit be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is determined by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due in quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n|

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, filling the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, can payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

If sold, it would then reduce the expenditure considerably below the grant.\n\nWith regard to Cash in hand of $32.50, I would explain to the Department, that at Morley, as the\n\nWorkmen\nWorkmen employed on the building were obliged to be boarders; the Superintendent was instructed to purchase provisions, and charge the employees a sum per week, sufficient to cover the outlay; when this account was balanced, there was a surplus of this amount of $32.75.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSr.,\nYour obedient Servant,\nH.

Last summer the per capita grant from the Government was increased to $72; does not nearly meet the expenditure, and there has been nothing wherewith to provide comfortable furnishings for the building. The future of this Institute will doubtless be fully considered at the next meeting of the General Board of Missions; and it has been suggested that it be taken over from Mr. McDougall, and be made a part of the regular\nwork of the Missionary Society. In view of this possibility it is very desirable there should be a clear understanding between the Government and the Missionary Society. We think that this Institute should be put on the same basis, and brought under the same Government control as other Industrial Institutes in the North-West. I should have said that years ago the Government promised to give us a patent of the land occupied; but if the change I have indicated should be brought about, then I presume the land as well as the buildings would be the property of the Government.\n\nWhat I would suggest is that the Indian Department take the Morley Orphanage as one of their regular Industrial Institutes, make provision for the present indebtedness, say $2,500, and provide on a more liberal scale for its future maintenance. It is impossible to carry on such an Institute with a per capita grant of only $72, which is very much lower than is given to some other Institutes in the North-West. If such an arrangement is found impracticable, then as an alternative I would propose that the Government give us, as formerly promised, a patent for the land, and make a grant to provide increased schoolroom accommodation, also lavatories and bathrooms, and increase the per capita grant to not less than $100. The first suggestion would be the best, because, on the one hand, we cannot incur the expense of enlarging or erecting buildings on Government land that we do not own, while, on the other hand, the Government would not be willing to expend money on land owned by the Missionary Society. If the Orphanage is assumed by the Government, then it would be easy through their own agents, say the Commissioner for the North-West, to examine Mr. McDougall's accounts, and satisfy themselves as to the amount which he has actually expended over and above the entire receipts, and then they would be in a position to say how much\nshould be allowed in settlement of his claim.\n\nI enclose herewith part of a letter, with sketch of the building attached, received from Mr Bubler who, under Mr McDougall's direction, is in charge of the Orphanage. I may say that in a letter from Mr McDougall he expresses the opinion that the per capita grant should not be less than $110.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Hon. H.C. Atkin, M.N.\n\nCity\nMcDougall Orphanage,\nMorley, March 10th, 1892.\n\nRev A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nToronto.\n\nMy Dear Doctor,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo re Orphanage. I would call your attention to our school accommodation which is inadequate to meet our present requirements. I am informed that when last the Government Inspector visited this Institution he condemned it on account of its being so small. It is also very important and necessary that we have at once lavatories and bath rooms for boys and girls. I feel quite sure that if the matter were brought before the Government steps would at once be taken to remedy this state of things.\n\nWe have no laundry, all our washing has to be done in the kitchen. You will see by the plan enclosed how inadequate the kitchen is for general kitchen work alone; the building is only 18 x 24, with a pantry taken off 6 x 8, and basement steps 3 ft 6 in x 8.\n\nI may say that it is our intention to have more land under cultivation this spring, and also in the future to launch out into the dairy business; it should prove quite a source of income. The outlay will be very small. We will require stables for winter; most of the work we can do ourselves.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n(Signed) J.W. Butler.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1892.\n\nDear Mr. Aikins,\n\nWith reference to my letter to you of the 2nd instant, I may say that I have had a conversation with the Indian Commissioner, who is here at present, relative to the improvements to the McDougall Orphanage, as mentioned in Mr. Miller's letter of the 10th of March last, a copy of which you enclosed with your letter.\n\nThe McDougall Orphanage is regarded by the Department as essentially a boarding school, and therefore, in common with other such schools in the North West Territories, cannot be looked upon as entitled to Government aid for the additions mentioned. I may say that the Government, in expending some $3000, to $3000, on a new wing for the institution last year, did more for it than it has done for similar institutions under Presbyterian, Anglican, or Roman Catholic control. So far I don't\nThe fact that two Industrial Institutions are under construction connected with the Methodist denomination, namely, at Brandon and Red Deer, where any surplus children may be sent.\n\nAs to monies paid out in years gone by, the Department does not feel itself called upon to re-imburse such, as the transactions took place without any reference to or knowledge of the Department, and if such a course were pursued I feel that a precedent would be established which might lead to an unlimited extent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed)\n\nHon. J.C. Aikins, L.L.D.,\nToronto.\nSir,\n\nI have counted and measured the windows at the orphanage, and for the forty-one windows, the storm sashes would cost in the neighborhood of $145.\n\nYours, etc.,\nSyd.

When the furnace was being repaired, it was done by a competent man, in such lines, and he informs me that the roof will continue to be an expense so long as this sheeting is left on, as it will always raise and crack with the frost.\n\nThink the better way would be to have it all taken off, and the roof shingled.\n\nShaw, Esq.\n(Sgd.)

This Certificate includes the 10% holdback which was maintained when previous payments were made.\n\nThis Final Certificate would have been issued sooner but for the fact that several vouchers were lacking when the contractors rendered me their statement of the account, and only last night were these vouchers received by me.\n\nI enclose herewith the contractors' complete detailed statement of their contract and extras, from which you will see how the amount of the Certificate is arrived at. You will note that I have deducted $65.00 for \"Extra re-work at Church.\" I had no authority to include this item, and on questioning the contractors concerning its inclusion in their statement, they told me that Mr. Pringle, the Indian Agent, would take care of this charge, and it is with the contractors' consent that I am deleting it from their statement.\n\nI have gone over the account carefully, and it is correct. The various items making up the extras are properly vouched. The only vouchers lacking are the timesheets for the labour performed on the extra work, and the contractors inform me that they are not in a position to furnish separate timesheets for this, but as the charges for labour are not excessive, I have endorsed the account as rendered.\n\nThe credit of $5.00 on the electrical fixtures results from the cost of these being $5.00 less than the allowance for same in the specifications.\n\nI enclose invoices which apply to the various extras. On the whole, I may say, the contract has been satisfactorily carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR.

The current charges were to be met by Vote II for the agency and the school management for the institution. The school pays $50.00 per month.\n\nThe Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals has drawn my attention to an educational programme on this reserve, for which they have no assistance from the Department. A number of Indian children attend the residential school classroom as day pupils and the school management is providing a teacher and a heated classroom without assistance from us. You will remember that the classroom used for the Morley Institution is the church building.\n\nI wish to recommend that the Department make a grant of the electric light current expenses, or $50 per month, to the school management for this day school activity and that Mr. Indian Agent Pringle be instructed to make the accounts of the Calgary Power Company to Ottawa for payment, so they could be charged to Vote II and Indian Education Vote in the ratio of 2 to 3. This proportion of the cost has been determined by the Power Company, the Indian Agent and the Principal as a fair division.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1926.\n\nGentlemen:-\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to forward, freight charges prepaid, addressed to R. Pringle, Indian Agent, Morley, Alta., one No. 24 school bell, complete with sills and wheel for rope, for the use of the Morley Indian Residential School. Your catalogue No. 35 quotes the price of this bell complete, freight prepaid, at $48.50.\n\nPlease forward your account in duplicate to Mr. Pringle, who is being informed of the order placed with you and requested, upon receipt of the bell, to certify your account and send it to the Department when payment will be made. I would be pleased to have an acknowledgment of this order and date when shipment will go forward.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nChristie School Supply Limited,\nBrandon,\nMan.\nOttawa, December 15th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that we are today placing an order with the Christie School Supply Limited, Brandon, Man., to ship, addressed to you, for the use of the Morley Indian Residential School, one school bell, 24 inches in diameter, complete with bells and wheel for rope. The above firm have been requested to prepay freight charges and to send their account in duplicate to you. When the bell arrives, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send to the Department in order that payment can be made. The weight of this bell, including mountings, is 265 lbs. and the price is $48.50, freight prepaid.\n\nPlease inform the Principal of the order placed for this bell. It should be set up at a convenient spot on the grounds on a strong substantial framework. It is expected that the school authorities will provide the material and erect the frame for this bell without expense to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Mr. Staley in charge as Principal.\n\nA cold storage and ice house is to be erected for the school and the Agent has had authority for this expenditure and has placed the order for the lumber. The only change I made in his plans was to instruct him to line the inside of the ice house with shiplap. This would cost between $25.00 and $30.00 and will be much more satisfactory as it will give an air space and there was sufficient money authorized to make this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

While it is desirable to have the class-rooms as soon as possible, the church can be used for a time. The request comes from the management of the school.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Pringle, with an accountable cheque for $131.00 to cover labour charges and the purchase of posts from the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 12, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nFive thousand dollars is available for the erection of a double classroom at the Morley Indian Residential School. The Church authorities have represented that, equally desirable this year, if not more so, is a farmer's cottage at our school at Edmonton. I wish to arrive at a decision as to which building should be erected this year. Please make the necessary enquiries and let me have a recommendation at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 8, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Shaw:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to conditions at the Morley Indian Residential School. It is true that the accommodation at this institution is not sufficient for the children of school age on the reserve. It has been the intention to transfer the older pupils to our school at Edmonton, where an intensive training in farming is offered. The Edmonton Institution is conducted by the same church authorities, who fully concur in this proposal.\n\nConcerning classroom facilities, I propose to erect a suitable two-roomed building next year. In the interim, the church is serving the purpose. It has been fitted up with desks and other classroom equipment.\n\nI cannot understand the report that the barns are not satisfactory. Mr. Commissioner Graham of Regina had this in hand last year, and the records of the Department show that suitable accommodation for stock has already been provided. Some weeks ago, an expenditure for suitable fencing of the property was authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJoseph T. Shaw, Esq., LL.B.,\nShort, Ross, Shaw & Haywood,\nCalgary, Alta.\nThe Sect.,\nDept. Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI would like to urge again for the immediate consideration of your Dept. that some attention be given to the very inadequate educational facilities on the Morley Reserve. While on every other Reserve practically in Alberta there is room and to spare for all children wishing to enter into a Residential school here we have a waiting list of between thirty and forty, with absolutely no prospect of being able to do anything for them. While a small waiting list may be a good thing to have there is no justification for keeping almost half the children of this Reserve out of school. If consideration cannot be given at once to extra accommodation at the boarding school could not the Dept. at least give us class room accommodation. If two Class Rooms could be provided it would be at least possible to alleviate our problem.\n\nIt was understood some time ago that this matter would be considered. Could it now be reconsidered? If it has been shelved and the matter dealt with so that the class rooms could be in use for the fall term.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 6, 1927.\nOttawa, June 13, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the lack of accommodation at the Morley Indian Residential School. I regret that it will not be possible to give favorable consideration to an addition to the school at the present time. The advisability of providing a building of two classrooms will not be overlooked as the Department prepares its Estimates for next year.\n\nConcerning the lack of accommodation, I wish to refer to earlier correspondence with reference to the advisability of grading the more advanced pupils to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. You should also seriously consider transferring any whose parents are willing to let them go, no matter what age, and also those children who are orphans.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. E. J. Stanley,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMorley, Alta.\n| ARTICLES          | Herbert Paint Co., Calgary | J.H.

Ferrier,\nInspector,\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, August 19, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Inspector of United Church Indian Schools has lately visited the Morley Indian Residential School and asks that consideration be given to the following equipment:\n\n- Water basins in sick rooms,\n- 2 Small Bed Tables for sick rooms,\n- Cement Cistern for soft water,\n- Rubber Treads for stairways.\n\nWhen you are arranging for the building activity at this institution, you should look into the urgency of these last mentioned improvements and take whatever action you consider advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Sept. 1st, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo No. 409-11A regarding certain equipment for the Morley Indian Residential School, and reply to say that I went over this school thoroughly with Mr. Staley, the Principal, and he made no request to have the articles mentioned in your letter supplied. He did, however, make a request that mattresses be supplied to the institution. You will remember that I had a great deal of correspondence with the Department some time ago over the matter of furnishing mattresses instead of the ticking to be filled with straw or hay which we have at a number of our schools.\n\nWe could send two small bed tables up from here. I do not think the soft water cistern is at all necessary, as the water at the school is quite soft. The rubber treads for the stairways can be supplied if you think it advisable but, personally, I do not think there is any great urgency for this, and there are other things required at our institutions throughout the country that are of much more importance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, September 8, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11A of the first instant, with reference to improvements at the Morley Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would send two small bedside tables from Regina. I note you did not consider the soft water cisterns nor rubber treads for the stairways necessary at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, September 8, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 13th ultimo, concerning equipment for the Morley Indian Residential School, I have now to inform you that Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham is sending two small bedside tables from Regina. He does not consider the soft water cistern nor the rubber treads for stairways are necessary at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nInspector\nIndian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nI beg to ask for a cheque for $150.00 to pay for wages and the freighting of material to erect a work-shop and root cellar at the Morley Indian Residential School, and painting shop at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Paget, Esq.,\nChief Acct. & Purchasing agent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe circular letter issued by your Dept. with regard to fire escape and fire fighting facilities at Indian School prompts me to make several requests of you with regard to the Morley Residential School. While our fire escape facilities are on the whole adequate we have next to nothing with which to combat a fire. Our water supply is such that we can never have a reserve of more than 4500 gallons and such are the conditions that within five minutes our tank would be empty and we would be unable to force water through the building for another hour at least. Under these circumstances and bearing in mind further that ours is a wooden building I would request the Dept. to provide at least twelve large chemical fire extinguishers, four for each floor of the building. Two of these should be larger than the other ten to be placed adjacent to the two furnace rooms.\n\nI would also ask that six lights be placed, two by the entrance porch at the front, two by the back doors of the building and two above the fire escape platform. All doors leading into the building have to be approached by a flight of steps, and in the dark, in the event of the slightest panic a disastrous piling up of children might result.\n\nThanking you for your attention to these matters,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files (RG 10), Volume 6559, File 757-5, part 2\nOttawa, October 20, 1927.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease quote your lowest price, F.O.B.

In any event the covering suggested by the agent would not be serviceable, especially in the boys' play-room and until there is further evidence that the nature of these floors endangers the health of the pupils I cannot recommend the purchase of material to cover them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.

I found that Dr. Murray had made all the necessary arrangements for the building of the two classrooms, and had secured prices on all the material, as well as getting several tenders on the erection, and picking out a site for the building, which I went over and approved of. Everything at the school was in good order, and I must say they have an excellent garden, which is something new up in that part of the country. The children, of course, were away for the summer holidays at the time of my visit.\n| ARTICLES | Oldtown | Woodville |\n|----------|---------|-----------|\n| 3rd Class Bedstead | $25.00 | $25.00 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $18.00 | $18.00 |\n| 1st Class Bedstead | $15.00 | $15.00 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $12.00 | $12.00 |\n| 1st Class Bedstead | $10.00 | $10.00 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $8.00 | $8.00 |\n| 1st Class Bedstead | $6.00 | $6.00 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $4.00 | $4.00 |\n| 1st Class Bedstead | $2.00 | $2.00 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $1.00 | $1.00 |\n| 1st Class Bedstead | $.50 | $.50 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $.25 | $.25 |\n| 1st Class Bedstead | $.10 | $.10 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $.05 | $.05 |\n| 1st Class Bedstead | $.02 | $.02 |\n| 2nd Class Bedstead | $.01 | $.01 |\n\nI recommend that lowest tenders, as underlined, which have been accepted, be approved\u2014tenders marked with circle not satisfactory; for reasons given in remarks column.\n\nSigned: [Signature]\n\nDate: Oct. 9/28\n\nCity or town: Calgary, Province: Alberta\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| LBS. 2\u00bd\" NAILS               | 320      | $5.30      | $16.96      |\n| \" 4\"                          | 225      | $5.05      | $11.36      |\n| \" 2\"                          | 100      | $5.60      | $5.60       |\n| 1 \u215b BLUED SHINGLE NAILS      | 175      | $7.10      | $12.43      |\n| 2\" FIN                       | 100      | $6.10      | $6.10       |\n| 2\u00bd\"                          | 25       | $5.80      | $1.45       |\n| 3\"                           | 5        | $5.70      | $.28        |\n| 28x11 SIDING NAILS           | 25       | $5.55      | $1.38       |\n| 1\u00bd\" FIN                      | 3        | $6.30      | $.19        |\n| 2\u00bd\" FLOORING                 | 55       | $5.55      | $3.05       |\n| 14 GA ANN WIRE               | 20       | $6.05      | $1.24       |\n| DOZ. #900 RIM LOCK SETS      | 7        | $.65       | $.45        |\n| PR. 241 D2 3\u00bdX3\u00bd BUTTS       | 2        | $.25       | $.50        |\n| SCREWS 1X10                   | 1        | $.05       | $.10        |\n| PR. 241 D2 4X4 BUTTS          | 1        | $.35       | $.35        |\n| DOZ.

At the first opportunity I would ask you to please have an examination made of the foundation and have the defect remedied, if same can be done with a moderate expenditure. He mentioned in his letter that if eave troughing was installed on the building it would probably relieve the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

Funds for this purpose are available, and when you are making a recommendation as to the canteen troughing, you should add a note with reference to a soft water tank.\n\nI have also to inform you the church authorities requested that the Department provide funds this year for a little additional laundry machinery.

July 5th, 1929.\n\nInspector Christiasson's Report on the Indian Residential School, Stony Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that while at the Stony Agency I inspected the Residential School there, and I must say that I found everything in A shape. The building, from top to bottom, was clean and tidy. The furniture was well arranged and has been well cared for. The same can be said about everything inside the school. It shows that proper care is being given to the building. The grounds were also in good shape and an effort is being made to beautify them. Some shrubs and flowers have been planted in front of the school, earth having been hauled, but I must say that this is some proposition here as a wind comes up and blows everything away.\n\nThe children all appeared to be in the best of health and looked as if they were well cared for.\n\nThe school planted a large garden just below the hill right by the school. They also broke considerable land for potatoes up on the side hill above the school. The night before I arrived they had a frost which killed most of the potato tops. They will probably come back, but the potatoes will no doubt be small.\n\nThe school has a very nice herd of milk cows and they are getting abundance of milk, which is given to the children. One thing I was pleased to note was\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nwas that the children all get butter twice a day. I wish this could be said of more of our schools.\n\nAdditional stable room is required which should be provided for in the Estimates this coming year.\n\nIn my opinion it would be economy to have the school and outbuildings painted this coming year.\n\nOne thing that is badly needed at this school is a frigidaire as they really have no place where they can keep anything in the way of perishable food supplies, and if possible, this should be provided for in next year's Estimates.\n\nThe school was filled to capacity as far as pupils are concerned, and I believe about ten or eleven children have been attending school and living at home.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., July 10th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a satisfactory report on the Indian Residential School in the Stony Agency.\n\nYou will note that additional stabling accommodation is asked for. I am placing an amount of $1200.00 in the Estimates to provide for this, and also $600.00 for the painting of the school and outbuildings. I am not asking anything for the supplying of Frigidaires.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 15, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11 of the 10th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Morley Indian Residential School. A note has been made for next year's estimates in connection with the additional stabling and the painting. As you were informed in my letter of the 3rd instant, funds are available for some improvements at this school this year, and I am expecting your recommendation concerning a soft water tank, eaves troughing and additional laundry machinery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWill the Department kindly let me know if there is any correspondence going on with the Principal of the School, or the Church authorities regarding the building of summer dormitories at the Morley Indian Residential School. Surely the Department is not going to build dormitories of this kind there. They are not at all necessary and it would mean a useless expenditure of money. Of course it is possible that nothing is being done in this connection but in a letter from the Agent he makes the remark that the Principal states if the summer dormitories are built the rooms under same can be used as drying rooms, thus dispensing with a dryer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 22, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11A of the 17th instant, with reference to improvements at the Morley Indian Residential School. There has been no correspondence concerning summer dormitories. I shall be glad to have your recommendation with reference to the subject matter of official letter of the 3rd instant, as soon as you have reached a decision as to what is most urgently required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nWith reference to Department No. 119-1-5 of the 3rd instant, I have to state that the questions on which the Department desire a recommendation have been looked into, and I have ascertained that waterproofing of the cellar walls at the Morley School will cost approximately $25.00, and this should be proceeded with. Sewer troughing ought to be supplied also, and this can be done for an approximate expenditure of $110.00. All important buildings should be supplied with sewer troughing, and I would recommend that provision for this always be made when estimating the cost of our schools etc.\n\nI do not consider that any additional laundry equipment is needed at the present time, and as to the question of the provision of a soft water tank, I do not see the necessity for this. Inspector M. Christianson informs me that the water used at the present time is soft, and the installation of a cistern for soft water would, in my opinion, be an unnecessary expenditure; however, I am having this matter looked into further by the Agent, and I may make a further report in regard thereto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 1st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11A of the 25th ultimo, relative to certain repairs required at the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the waterproofing of the cellar walls and the supplying and installing of the eaves troughing required.\n\nRelative to the additional laundry equipment and soft water tank, it is noted that you do not consider these are required at the present time. It is noted, however, that you are having further enquiry made as to these two latter requirements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The Church gives a large grant to maintain this School, and we feel sure that the excellent work that it does should commend itself to the Department of Indian Affairs. Although the grant towards the teacher's salary is $750 a year, yet the teacher's board and the additional amount required for fuel for this extra room reduces the grant from the Department by a very substantial amount.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you will see your way clear to continue payment of this account.\n\nWith all kind regards,\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\nCGY:BJ\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Hinton, Indian Agent at Morley, submitting a request from the Principal of the school to be furnished with glass for the purpose of repairing at the cost of approximately $15.00. The Agent also states that six lengths of fire hose are in such a bad condition that they leak when used, and further, owing to the inadequacy of the water supply in case of a fire, the school should be supplied with more fire extinguishers.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, I have directed the Agent to purchase the glass, immediately ascertain the size and correct lengths of the hose which ought to be replaced, secure quotations thereon, and advise me, and I myself have ordered to be shipped through a local firm eight Pyrene extinguishers with two re-fills.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. M.

INSPECTOR MACGREGOR,\nDATED OCTOBER 3, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nBORLEY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 119-1-6.\n\nIt will be noted that, while there are desks for only sixty pupils, there are seventy-six enrolled. A table and chairs in the junior room have been provided to accommodate eight additional pupils. This leaves eight pupils for whom there is no accommodation, if all of those enrolled were present at the same time. Furthermore, I am advised by the Principal that there are some forty pupils of school age on the reserve who are not attending school on account of the fact that there is no accommodation for them, neither in the school nor in the residence. It would appear that the matter of additional accommodation should receive attention at an early date so that those now without any educational facilities could be provided for by September next, at least. The present two-roomed school can easily be remodelled to provide two additional classrooms, which additional accommodation seems necessary if all of the pupils on the reserve are to be afforded some educational advantages.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Morley Indian Residential School, which was inspected by Mr. J. A. MacGregor on October 3rd.\n\nYou will note that the Inspector in his report speaks well of the school, and states that there are 76 pupils enrolled.\n\nHe points out that there are about forty children of school age on this reserve who are not attending school. His information is of course received from Mr. Staley, and I do not think it is exactly correct, as I understand there are about 25 or 30.\n\nThe question of enlarging the school is one that should be considered by the Department, and I believe we could provide the necessary accommodation for additional pupils at a cost of about $12,000.00. However, I do not think it was within the province of Inspector MacGregor to comment on this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

M.

You will note that everything in connection with the institution seems to be in good shape.\n\nI am not satisfied, however, with the Principal's reply to the Inspector when he asked whether the girls were milking cows - that they did once in a while. They should milk them regularly, during the summer time at least, and I am writing him to this effect.\n\nIt is true that I received a request from Mr. Hinton, asking that the dormitories be re-floored. I told myself it was a most extraordinary request when the school was only built a short time ago. You will note what the Inspector says - that he found holes where they had been neglectful, but this can be repaired for a small sum. It just shows how much reliance can be placed on the recommendations of some people. The work is being done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nREGINA, SASK., Jan. 14th, 1931.\n\nInspector Christianson's Report on the Stony Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to report that on my last visit to the Stony Agency, I inspected the Residential School. There were 70 children in residence, but as there is not sufficient room in the school for that number of children, 5 girls were sleeping in the Principal's residence.\n\nEverything at this institution was in good shape. The children all looked healthy, and at the time of my visit the teachers were preparing for the Christmas concert.\n\nA new addition to the stable was built last summer, and they now have sufficient stable room to take care of their stock. They have 18 milk cows, 9 of which were milking at the time of my inspection.\n\nI made enquiries from the Principal as to whether the girls milked the cows, and was informed that they only did this once in a while. However, he informed me that as soon as spring came, he would see that the girls did the milking during the warm weather.\n\nThe buildings are all in a good state of repair, with the exception of the floors in the dormitories. I believe you received a letter from Mr. Hinton asking that the two dormitories be re-floored. I went into this matter, and found that the small castors on the beds have worn the floors; this is caused by the movement of the beds back and forth.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nforth. There are about two boards at the wall and about three boards at the foot of the beds which are badly worn\u2014some of them right through to the under flooring. All that is necessary is to have these boards taken out and new ones put in. There were some carpenters working on the residence for the Mounted Police, which was being erected there, so I had one of them over, and he informed me that he could take out the boards that were worn, put in new ones, and it would be just as satisfactory as if it were re-floored. This would only mean a small expenditure, and it should be carried out.\n\nI am of the opinion that it would be money well spent if the Department furnished the school with castor shoes. I note that they are quoted at 20\u00a2 for a set of four in Eaton's catalogue.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, January 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11 of the 15th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Christianson on his recent inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is pleased to note that general conditions at this school are satisfactory. Your action in having the floors in the dormitories repaired is approved. In order that the casters on the beds will not again wear out the flooring, the Department will approve of the supplying of caster shoes, which, the Inspector states, can be obtained at a cost of 20 cents per bed, and I shall be pleased if you will arrange for the purchase and instruct the Principal to have same properly installed.\n\nIt is noted that you will take up with the Principal the matter of having the girls given proper instruction in milking. It is considered that the girls should milk the cows regularly during the summer months at least.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

The Reverend Mr. Staley drew to my attention that the floors throughout most of the building were in very poor shape. Being ordinary fir floors, the Department will realize that with several boys and girls continually tramping around the school, it does not take long to wear them out.\n\nI pointed out to Mr. Staley that as far as I knew the amount allowed for repairs to schools was very limited, and we would have to try to get along with as little as possible. This, of course, the Principal is quite prepared to do, and the floors will be left as they are for another year. In parts where they are more worn than others, such as the boys' dormitory and the dining room, patches will be put in, and they can get along without any expense in that connection.\n\nIf there is any money available, over and above what it takes to pay the grant, it would certainly be very much appreciated if the school were furnished with a new kitchen range. The one now in use has never been suitable from the first; It is too small for the purpose for which it was intended, and is so badly burned out that it does not warrant repair.\n\nI might also bring to your attention that this school was never furnished with a refrigerator, and naturally they have always had difficulty in keeping their food supplies cool in the summer. The Principal purchased an electric refrigerator for $300.00, on monthly instalments, and I think it would only be fair if the Department could so arrange it, to pay something towards this. If there are no funds available, of course the Principal will have to go on paying his monthly instalments, and either they will have to\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nget along with the range they have now, or the Church authorities will have to buy a new one.\n\nThe building as a whole is in a first class state of repair, and has been well kept up. The staff and the boys have done considerable painting in the interior, and the premises as a whole are certainly well looked after. The school has about 35 acres of green feed and their garden is excellent; it will supply the school with sufficient potatoes and other vegetables, providing they do not have an early frost. The potatoes froze off about a month ago, which probably retarded the growth, but at the time of my visit Monday, the garden looked exceptionally good.\n\nMr. Staley is running a good school. The children are well fed and well looked after in every way. From year to year the church authorities in the East have to put up considerable money over and above the grant to finance the school, as nothing can be earned here: No farming can be done and only enough cattle to supply the school with milk, &c., can be raised. The schools where farming and stock raising, &c., is carried on are certainly in a different position. Therefore, I think it would be only fair if this school were furnished with a range, and even a small sum provided to partly pay for the refrigerator.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, August 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 109-11A C.E. of the 27th ultimo, reporting on your visit to the Morley Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that general conditions at this school are satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the request of the Principal that a new kitchen range be supplied, I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of a range of the type required from a firm on the list to receive consideration. The cost should be kept as low as possible, having in view the obtaining of a suitable range. You should consult the Principal and ascertain the type of range he requires. After the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWe will have no funds this year to reimburse the school authorities for the cost of an electric refrigerator or in carrying out any repairs to the floors throughout the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I could have purchased the same kind of a stove as we previously had in the school for $260, whereas this one was $335, but the other stove has only lasted a few years, and this should last a lifetime. For the difference, the present stove will certainly be a great deal cheaper, in the long run, than the other.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary, D\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report on an inspection of the Indian Residential School at Morley, where I spent the best part of a day this week.\n\nAt the time of my inspection I found that there were 75 children in residence there. As the classroom work in this school has been recently inspected by the Provincial School Inspector, I need not dwell on this part of the work and more than to say that we have two splendid teachers at this institution, and good progress is being made in the classroom work.\n\nThe children are bright and looked exceptionally well. They are well clothed, and outside of the classroom work the children engage in different sports. A rink is maintained throughout the winter, which is boarded in on all sides, and is located just below the hill, right near the school, and only a short distance from the C.P.R. pump station, where they get water to flood the rink, and the Calgary Power Company are giving the school the power free of charge, for lights on the rink.\n\nA hockey league has been formed on the reserve, and besides this the boys from the school play teams from Calgary, Cochrane, etc.\n\nAs the Department are aware no farming is carried on at this school on account of the soil on the Reserve not being fit to carry on farming. They put in some green feed and a large garden. Last summer the potatoes were a failure, on account of a heavy frost in June and July, which froze off the tops and the crop did not amount to anything. They raised 40 ton of turnips, 2 ton of carrots and a \u00bd ton of beets, and all other kinds of garden truck such as onions, parsnips, peas, etc.\n\nThe school maintains a herd of 35 cattle, practically all cows, so the school has ample milk, and several cows are due to freshen shortly, so there is no shortage of milk at this institution. The school also keeps chickens and a few hogs, sufficient to take care of the refuse etc. from the school.\nAs no farming operations are carried on at this Reserve it is not possible to teach the boys anything in that nature, but the boys are taught all the possible carpenter work that is done around the building, and to look after a garden, milk cows etc. The girls are taught along the same lines as in other Indian institutions of this kind. Cooking, sewing, and general housework.\n\nThe main school building and the two classrooms are in good state of repairs, with the exception of floors wearing out in the main building. The Department are aware that the out-buildings at this school are a very miserable affair. The stable serves the purpose at the present time, although it is very small, but the other out-buildings are practically useless. I trust some provision is being made in the Estimates for some repairs to the floors in the main building. The floors are pitch-grain fir, and the Department are aware that as there are a great many children tramping over the floors every day, and the floors being of a soft wood, that they soon wear out. This will again be brought to the attention of the Department after the end of the year.\n\nWhen the holidays come around the two furnaces need to be over-hauled by a competent furnace man. The electric wiring in the school should also be gone over next summer, as there are some short circuits in the wires evidently, as a lot of fuses burn out from time to time.\n\nThe staff consists of the principal, the Reverend Mr. Staley, J.Hogarth as laborer, and Mr. and Mrs. E.Sheppard as teachers. Mrs. J.Rich, Matron; Mrs. N.Magee, seamstress; Miss L.Landale, laundress; Mrs. E.McGee, cook.\n\nFrom my observations the staff at this institution are efficient, and rendering good work. In conclusion I wish to state that in my opinion this is a very good institution. The children are well cared for in every way, and good results are being obtained by the school, as far as it is possible to do so.\n\nMr. Staley brought to my attention that the school only received a grant for 65 children, although there are 75 children in residence. Five of these are sleeping upstairs in the principal's residence. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General by special letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA - Ontario\nOttawa, January 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 409-11A of the 14th instant, reporting on your recent inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School. In this connection the Department is pleased to note that conditions generally at this school are satisfactory; that there is an efficient staff in charge and the children are well cared for in every way.\n\nWith reference to the repairs mentioned by you as being required, I have to say that an item is being placed in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, to cover the cost of the repairs to the floors in the main building. However, at the present time, I am unable to inform you whether this amount will be authorized or not.\n\nConcerning the number of pupils in attendance, I have to say that you are being written in a separate communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I understand that some roofing and tar, &c., are required. By the staff there doing the work the cost would probably be in the neighbourhood of $25.00.

I returned just before the repairs were started, and in view of the authority from Mr. Christian, or the lack thereof, to the extent of $50.00, I paid the charge forthwith, although we could not get the boiler repaired with that amount. The cost of repairs were held down to the lowest possible figure which you will note is $11.60. The balance on this authority more than makes up for the first repair done by the boiler, but a further break appeared, necessitating the expenditure as per the enclosed Voucher.\n\nMr. Grady stated that it was absolutely impossible to carry on without the above mentioned repairs, and I trust my actions will be approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nLetter No. ...........................................\n\nOffice of the ...........................................

What is required is to have the casing straightened and repaired on the furnace; three new 20-inch elbows; some asbestos covering for the heat pipes and some new bricks. It would be necessary to have a man go up from Calgary to overhaul the furnace. If this is not done there is danger of fire, and this work should be done during the holidays. I cannot give the Department an exact estimate of the cost of this work, as there is no furnace man there, but I do not think it would cost over $50.00.\n\nIf possible, I would ask the Department to authorize this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Further, you may purchase three new 20 inch elbows and the quantity of asbestos necessary for the heat pipes and bricks. You may also arrange for the labour in carrying out this work.\n\nI enclose encumbrance certificate authorizing an expenditure which must not exceed the sum of $60 in having these repairs made. If possible, a saving in this amount should be effected. After the repairs have been completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour.

At the present time Dr. Murray is attending the Medical Convention here in the city, and he was unable to get in touch with him.\n\nIt seems that yesterday the hot water tank which supplies the hot water for the building, cracked open at one of the seams. As the tank evidently in some way controls the whole water supply at the school, the building is without water at the present time. Mr. Staley also informed me that the girls' end of the basement, where the tank is, is flooded, and he pointed out that something would have to be done. I authorized him to get in touch with an electric welder at Chochrane, the nearest town to the school, and get him to weld the seam in question. If he is successful in doing this the tank may last for sometime yet, and it would save the purchase of a new one, which, I believe, would cost over $100.00.\n\nThe cost of welding the present boiler will not be very great and I trust the Department will approve of the action I have taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

F. MacKENZIE\nOttawa, October 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your telegram of the 15th instant, I have to inform you that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and installation of a new hot water tank for use at the Morley Indian Residential School. The cost of the tank, including installation, should not exceed the sum of $110. In this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"May incur expenditure one hundred and ten dollars, purchase hot water tank and installing same, Morley Indian Residential School.\"\n\nAfter the tank has been installed, please forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. You should state on each copy of the account that the expenditure was authorized by E.R. No. 1054, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nI may add that the Department also received a telegram from Dr. W. B. Murray, the local agent, regarding the matter. Please advise him that you have received the authority to supply a new tank and install same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I must say that I was greatly surprised when I read the last paragraph of your letter stating that a telegram had also been received from Dr. W. R. Murray, the local Agent there. I am sure when the Department received two telegrams on the same subject they had every reason to believe that something was wrong with the administration here.\n\nWhat actually happened was that Dr. Murray called me up about 10.00 P.M. Saturday advising me that the tank had just burst open and that something would have to be done to install a new tank as the school would be without water. I informed him that I would wire the Department on Sunday, which I did. Shortly after I received the Department's letter yesterday, Dr. Murray was in the office here and I asked him for an explanation; He claims that over the phone he understood me to say that he was to wire. This accounts for the two wires being send, and I am sure that I told him quite distinctly that I would send the wire. However, I have no reason to believe anything but that he misinterpreted what I said. I am sorry that the Department were put to the expense of paying for two wires instead of one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM.

At present there are approximately 70 children of school age on this reserve who are not attending school.\n\nI would appreciate your letting me have as soon as possible a full report giving your views regarding the situation on the Stony reserve.

Although there are a number of the Nordegg children attending the school, it is possible we could not count to any extent on them; although I am given to understand that no pressure has been brought to bear on account of the crowded condition of the school, with some child usually on the waiting list.\n\nI am of the opinion that the request of the Church is a modest one; and if the Department's financial condition would warrant it, I should be pleased to recommend that more accommodation be provided at the Morley School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 14, 1894.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, in connection with the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that there are only six children attending the day school. Is it not possible to increase this attendance? Do you think that a day school located at a distance from the Morley residential school, would meet the needs of the present situation, or do you feel that the only practical way to provide educational facilities on this reserve is to increase the accommodation at the Morley Residential School?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Barr Murray, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMorley, Alta.\nDr. H.W. McGill\nDeputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Doctor,\n\nRe Morley School\n\nAs you are doubtless well aware of the fact that the residence school on the reserve at Morley is not large enough to accommodate the children on the reserve. There being about 50 who should be at school getting no education.\n\nIf an extension could be made for increased dormitory rooms for thirty or forty and another class room, it would help meet the nation's obligation to the Indians there. This would cost about $20,000, we are informed.\n\nIt might be considered unreasonable to ask for this at the present time but on the other hand, it is needed, would be permanent, and if the amount could be included in the money to be spent on Public Works at this time to help those out of employment, the project would be good from all standpoints.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.G. Hunt\nIndian School at Morley Alta.\n\nPresent Provision for 65 pupils.\nPupils attending at the present time 70\nPupils of school age not attending 50\nIncreased accommodation wanted for 30 to 40 pupils\nwith an additional class room.\nTotal estimated cost $20,000.00\n\nIf the above extension could be included in the Public Works program this year it would help on all sides.\nIt would be permanent.\nIt is needed to fill the nation's responsibilities.\nIt would give work.\n\n[Signature]\nMar. 16th, 1934\n\nDr. G.

I believe it is operated by the United Church. He left me the attached memorandum.\n\nHunt wondered if the Government were going to put on a work program, if this School could not be enlarged. You will perhaps know something of the Government's intentions in regard to this work program, and may think this is of sufficient importance to take up with the proper authorities.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nMarch 19, 1934.\n\nPersonal\n\nDr. H.

I am attaching hereto a memorandum which presents the argument.\n\nI had an interview with the Secretary of the Home Mission Board of the United Church of Canada and he emphasized the necessity for this work. I was impressed with the representations which he made. I have also received a number of communications including W. G. Hunt, M. B. Peacock, Colonel George S.

This has been passed to the Schools Branch and will receive every consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. G. D. Stanley, M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant enquiring as to the feasibility of enlarging the day school running in connection with the residential school.\n\nThe six pupils shown in day school are actually in residence. Mr. Staley has found it possible to do this by putting six pupils in the attic of his own home.\n\nI may state that the day school idea has not been found satisfactory on this reserve. The Stonys are by nature hunters. In the fall of the year about three quarters of the tribe leave the reserve to hunt for about two months, and take their whole families. This winter many families have been hunting squirrels off the reserve for the greater part of the winter. During such times the children would be out of school.\n\nIt has also been found here that when the families are at home, the attendance at day school has been so irregular as to be almost useless. That was the reason for Mr. Staley taking as many pupils in to his house as he could reasonably accommodate.\n\nFrom enquiries I have made I believe 50 children more would be eager to go into residence. This is due not so much to a thirst for knowledge, as to the desire of the parents to have the children fed and clothed. Most of the parents are too apathetic toward a day school to cooperate in the matter of attendance.\n\nFor the above reasons, I would not recommend a day school here; in fact, I believe the system would be better left as at present. There is, however, a real need of further residential school accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Barr Murray\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\n\nPB\nCALGARY, ALTA., March 23rd, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to the attention of the Department that just as I was leaving for an inspection at Morley last week, the Agent called me up on the phone stating that the pump rods in the well at the school had broken off down near the cylinder and as a consequence the school was without water, and as it required special tools to get the broken rods out and put in new ones it was necessary to send a man out from Calgary. I immediately got in touch with Mr. Anderson, who is on the patronage list here and he went out to the school.\n\nI intended wiring the Department at the time, but as I was all ready to leave and someone came in while I was telephoning and I got into conversation with him, it slipped my mind. I was at the Agency while the work was being done and I think the time Mr. Anderson put in was a day and a half with three men. I regret my oversight in this matter, but trust the Department will approve of the action I have taken. Vouchers for the payment of same will go forward as soon as received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM.

This matter has been brought to Mr. Bennett's attention and he asked me about it this morning. I wonder if you would be good enough to let me know what the situation is at that school.\n\nQuite a number of people who are well known to you, including Mr. W. G. Hunt and Mr. Mark B. Peacock, take an interest in the Morley Indians and they are among those who recommend some extension to this school having regard to conditions which they indicate exist.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nDr. H. W. McGill, M.C., V.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nApril 7th, 1934.\n\nDear Miss Millar,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of April 4th regarding additional accommodation at the Morley Residential School.\n\nIn reply I would say that the observations contained in your letter are quite in accord with the information we have concerning the need for additional accommodation at this school. The matter has been under advisement by the Department for some time, and the only reason for the delay in our taking measures to remedy the situation is the lack of funds.\n\nThere is no item in our Estimates for the present fiscal year to provide an addition to this school. However, we have it on our selected list of buildings urgently required and hope to be able to submit the project for incorporation in the programme of public works construction in the event of such a programme being undertaken.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMiss A. E. Millar,\nSecretary,\nOffice of the Prime Minister,\nOttawa.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on a recent inspection of the Morley Indian Residential School. While there I went thoroughly into all matters pertaining to the management of the school, care of children, food, &c.\n\nBUILDINGS:\u2014 The buildings, both school and outbuildings are kept in a first class state of repair. The Principal showed me a stock of paint that he had on hand and the interior of the building is painted as required from time to time. The boys do the work. At the time of my visit the boys' dormitory was being painted, both walls and ceiling. This naturally keeps the buildings in a good state of repair, and the only replacement necessary at this institution is the flooring in the boys' dormitory and dining room which is in very bad shape. I believe this matter was brought to the attention of the Acting Superintendent of Indian Education when he was there last fall. Therefore it is not necessary for me to dwell on this matter here, any more than to say that\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOTTAWA.\nBuildings. (Continued).\u2014\nif there are any funds available this coming year, this work could be done during the summer holidays. However, if the Department have not the funds the school will simply have to get along without the new flooring.\n\nThe machinery in the school was in a good state of repair and well taken care of. The only thing that I noticed had gone out of order was the well, about which I wrote the Department a few days ago, but this had been repaired when I was there.\n\nThe furnishings of the school were all in good order and seemed to be well taken care of.\n\nTraining outside of classroom work.\u2014\nIn receiving instructions in household science the girls are divided into five groups: No. 1, that is the youngest girls, do sewing from 8.30 to 9.00 in the morning and on Fridays from 2.30 to 4.00. The other groups, 2, 3, 4, and 5, are handled in a similar manner, certain hours of the day being set aside for sewing. I saw the work the girls were doing and was very well pleased with what I saw. I also noticed that the girls worked in the kitchen and laundry. Washing is done every morning with the exception of Sunday, and they have a White girl, Miss Lansdale, as Laundress. Different girls are detailed each morning to assist her in the laundry, and also to do the ironing in the afternoon. The girls\nTraining (Continued):\n\nALSO do the mending of the school. The older girls help in the kitchen and receive instructions in cooking; and I was told by those in charge of the various departments that every girl was taught everything in the way of housekeeping, cooking, scrubbing floor and general household duties before leaving the school. It would appear that the girls are getting a very fair training in this work. Of course, as the Department knows, most of the bread used at the school is purchased from outside and the washing is done with modern laundry equipment. Still, every girl is taught to bake bread and wash by hand, which is very essential, as they will not have machinery to work with when they leave the school.\n\nThe outside training that the boys receive is, of course, very limited, as no farming is carried on there. Both boys and girls help with the garden, and the boys milk cows and look after the stock.\n\nCLOTHING AND FOOD:\n\nAmple clothing is supplied to the children. The girls all have four or five changes of dresses. In the winter they are supplied with woollen and fleece-lined underwear, and all have winter coats. The girls wear moccasins and rubbers in the winter time. The moccasins are made by the Indians and purchased by the school. The girls make most of their clothing and their dresses were very nice. Of course the Department will understand\nClothing & Food (Continued):\n\nthat occasionally the Principal has an opportunity of buying a job lot of dresses at a very low price, which he does, but this does not happen very often, so that most of the dresses are made by the girls themselves under the instruction of the seamstress. The girls knit the mitts for the school and also some stockings, and most of them can do embroidery work as well.\n\nThe boys were all well dressed and their everyday clothes consist of sweaters, overalls and a wind-breaker if it is cold. Woollen and fleece-lined underwear, woollen stockings and heavy gum-rubber shoes in winter and running shoes in the summer time. The boys also have good warm overcoats, caps, mitts, &c.\n\nI was at the institution when the children sat down to lunch, and went into the question of food. I was informed that breakfast, as a rule, consists of porridge, milk and sugar, bread, butter, jam, honey or syrup, and tea; and twice a week they give the children cereals instead of the porridge. Dinner consists of two vegetables, meat in some form, bannock, pudding or pie, water and milk. Supper consists of weaners, sausages or cold meat and sometimes fish; pork and beans, peas, or peas and pork, bread and butter or biscuits; cake and fruit, tea; and sometimes they are given an apple apiece after supper. The food of course varies from time to time, but this is the main issue.\nHEALTH & GENERAL:\n\nThe children looked exceptionally well and there was no illness amongst them. There were 76 children in residence and as the Department is aware, this is more than are provided for in the grant, and I believe 5 or 6 of the girls sleep over in the Principal's house. I also took special note that each child had a tooth brush and an individual towel both upstairs and down, and I enquired particularly as to whether the children were using the tooth brushes, and found that they were actually using them. I have often been at schools where the tooth brushes were never used.\n\nFor recreation the children have skating rink on a flat below the school which is boarded in and lit electrically, and all are furnished with skates. They also play other outdoor games such as football, &c., so they get lots of exercise.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, the outbuildings, although not in conformity with the school, are kept in a good state of repair. The cow and horse stable is kept well whitewashed inside, both walls and stalls.\n\nThe school owns 24 head of cows and at the time of my inspection there were 11 cows milking, and about 5 pails were milked per day. They make 24 pounds of butter per week and a great deal is made during the holidays while most of the children are away. Besides this the school purchases a quantity of butter\nGENERAL (Continued).-\n\nThe children receiving butter with their bread twice every day is something that is done at very few schools. They may give them fat of a kind, but actually giving them butter used to be unheard of. I am glad to note as I go around, that butter is being given to the children in several of the schools. The school also has 6 horses, 6 pigs and 40 chickens. The Department will understand that it would not pay the school to raise many hogs as they do not raise any feed, so they just keep enough to take care of the leavings from the school.\n\nOn the whole the work carried on at this institution is very satisfactory. They have a good competent staff and the children are well cared for. Personally I have no criticism to offer of anything I saw there.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The present heating system is entirely inadequate, and with more space to heat, will be worse than ever. If a new heating plant is to be installed, it would not be wise to apply for repairs to the present plant, but if the present furnaces will have to go through this winter, one of them will have to be re-lined.\n\nMr. Staley and myself would greatly appreciate any information which is available as to the likelihood of the building being started soon as we are handicapped at present in not knowing what to do to the present building in preparation for the winter term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 30, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, giving a list of requirements for the Morley Indian Residential School, in the event that the proposed addition to the school will not be completed in the near future.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the question of the addition is now receiving attention. In any event, it will be necessary to have the furnaces in the present building placed in a satisfactory condition for the coming winter's use. It is noted that one of the furnaces will have to be relined. The Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the quantity of fire brick required for this purpose, and, if the staff are unable to carry out the work of installing the brick, you may arrange for the services of a competent man to do the work. Purchase of the fire brick should be from a firm on the approved list. Mr. Inspector Christianson would, no doubt, advise you the name of a firm from whom to purchase the brick required and also regarding the services of a man to do the work if same is necessary. Please keep all costs as low as possible and forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, of two lengths of fire hose, 40 ft., and forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe other materials mentioned in your letter can stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDr. W.

The plans have not yet arrived, but will probably come by the next mail, and I shall lose no time in staking out the addition and starting the excavating. On Monday we shall put some Indian teams to work hauling gravel from a bar on the Bow River about 3\u00bd miles distant, where sufficient excellent gravel is available.\n\nWe are delighted to learn that we are soon to have the pleasure of a visit from you. I hope the weather will treat you kindly, and that your trip will be a pleasant one.

This figure applies to the No. 3250 Brown Weld steel boilers. As far as I am in a position to judge, this type of boiler would be quite satisfactory, and has been given satisfaction where used elsewhere in the West.\n\nI have advised the four firms from whom we received tenders that the matter is being held in abeyance until I receive further instructions from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\n\nGurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nP.S.

November 27, 1934.\n\nR. Guerney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Plumbing in Residential School at Morley.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI enclose herewith an estimate from Anderson Plumbing Co., of Calgary, for installing various plumbing fixtures in the addition to the school.\n\nYou will recall that when you were here you authorized the providing of a staff bath-room on the ground floor of the new addition, utilizing for the purpose the room marked \"store rm\" off the sewing room, and in this location will be placed the usual three-fixture installation.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has drawn attention to the omission of wash-basins in each of the girls' dormitories, which have, presumably, been inadvertently left out in the plan. Both he and Dr. Murray state that these basins are indispensable, and as the basins have been provided for the boys' dormitories, it seems equally necessary that similar provision be made for the girls.\n\nIt is also requested that a wash-basin be provided for the dispensary shown in the new addition; also a floor drain in the girls' play-room in the basement of the new addition to facilitate the washing of the floor. This washing is often done with a hose.\n\nYou will observe that Anderson & Co.'s price for the aforesaid materials and labour is $1060.00, not including the floor-drain mentioned which has more recently been asked for.\n\nAs this contractor gave us the best price for the hospital plumbing, and is already familiar with the local conditions, it seemed to me that if his price is satisfactory to you, it might be as well to give him this work rather than inviting others to estimate it. However, I shall await your instructions before doing anything in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDecember 5th, 1944.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nEnclosed is a memorandum from Mr. Orr regarding prices for the installation of a heating system in the Morley School.\n\nI concur in Mr. Orr's recommendation that the Anderson Plumbing Company submitting the lowest price be given the contract.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitects' Department,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nFor the last five weeks I have been in Western Canada and the other day had the opportunity of going carefully over the School at Morley, Alberta. Fortunately, the plans for the extension had arrived and I had the chance to discuss them in detail with Mr. Staley. There are a few suggestions I should like to make after having studied the plans in the building itself rather than from the blue print. These will not add appreciably to the cost and will make no difference in the letting of the contracts.\n\nI think that the dispensary and the principal's office should be exchanged moving the principal into the inside room. It would be very much easier for the nurse to carry on in the room opening off the hall than it would be for the principal to have the children passing through his office every afternoon in order to get to the nurse.\n\nThere is no provision made in the present plans for lockers, but with the enlarged play rooms for both boys and girls, I think that some type of cheap lockers should be put in. The school is also tremendously short of cupboard space. I would appreciate it when you are on the ground if you would discuss this important matter with Mr. Staley and the matron.\n\nIn connection with the sewing room to which I objected on the original plans because I felt it was going to be too dark, I have changed my mind, as the three windows which are in the present sewing room seem to give adequate light.\n\nThere are no separate bathroom and toilet facilities for the staff in the present building and I should like to request that the room marked \"store room\" on your present plans should be turned into a bathroom for the staff.\n\nBy putting a few locked cupboards or even open shelves around the walls of the new sewing room, I think you could secure all the storage facilities needed, in view of the fact that there will be two other small rooms available in the building when the alterations are completed which are not now in use for that purpose.\n\nI wish it were possible also in connection with the work which is being done to put a rough floor into the attic as was done in connection with\nthe Norway House School. That provides excellent storage facilities for the heavy winter clothing and bedding during the summer and for any extra stock which the principal has an opportunity to buy when the market is good. At the present time he has to buy in small quantities because of lack of such a store room.\n\nWhile you are at Morley, I would like to get your expert opinion in regard to the possibility of providing running water in the principal's residence. Four or five years ago I discussed this with Mr. Russell Ferrier who was enthusiastic about it. Our proposition at that time was to pipe the water from the present school supply which seems to be quite ample for the purpose. There are those who feel, however, that it would be cheaper and more satisfactory to dig a well close to the house and put in a small electric pump on account of the great difficulty of digging drains of the necessary depth through the hard gravel of those hillsides. If you have time, I would appreciate getting an estimate as to what you think both types of equipment would cost. I feel that having put in fifteen years in that house without running water, the principal's wife is entitled to immediate consideration from both the Department of Indian Affairs and the Board of Home Missions in this particular.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation and with very kind personal regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB/DM.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Eau Claire Sawmills Limited,\nCalgary,\nAlberta.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Dec 8 | Account; Addition to Residential School, as per invoices listed below: |        |\n|      | Invoice No. 12895, Nov 16th, Lumber etc. | 93 03 |\n|      | 12899 16 | 88 45 |\n|      | 12951 22 | 535 98 |\n|      | 12960 23 | 149 97 |\n\nAuthority: No. E.R. 2562, File 119-1-5,\nOct 24th, 1934\n\nInvoices attached.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 53\n\nVr. # 253\n| OUR INVOICE NO. | PIECES | DESCRIPTION                  | FEET | TOTAL | PRICE   |\n|----------------|--------|------------------------------|------|-------|---------|\n| 12960          | 168    | 2x4 - 24 No. 1 fir           |      |       | 96.77   |\n|                |        | wd. frames 5x12 - 6 lts      |      |       |         |\n|                |        | bottom 12x30 - 2 lts 1/2 C.H. set up | | 5.50  | 27.50  |\n|                |        | smsh frames 12x24/30 1/2 K.D. |      |       | 7.20    |\n|                |        | dr. frames 5'0x7'0-2\u00bd o.s.o.m.|      |       |         |\n|                |        | oak sill K.D.                |      |       | 18.50   |\n|                |        | 6-1/8 jbs. \u00be blind stop, 1-1/8 o.s.o.m. | |       | 149.97 |\n\nSOLD To Department of Indian Affairs\nShipped to Morley, Alberta\nRoute Car No.\n\nYour Order No.\nEst.

I.\nMorley, Alta., Jan. 17, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI am requested by the principal of the Residential School, Rev. E.J. Staley, to report that the furnace in the Classroom building is inadequate. Since it was first installed it has been impossible to heat the building. It is only a small furnace, which is apparently the reason that it is unsatisfactory.\n\nWhen the new heating plant is installed in the residence building, it will replace the two old furnaces at present in use. One of them is in good condition as to brick and grates, and it would undoubtedly heat the classroom building satisfactorily. The Anderson Plumbing Co., who are putting the new heating plant in the Residence building, have quoted $69 to change the furnace in the classrooms. It would be such a great advantage to have this done, that I beg your authority to do it.\n\nIn connection with the same building, it is reported to me by Mr. Gardiner-Smith, that the floor is not sufficiently supported, in fact that it is unsafe. One person walking across the floor causes it to swing, as was demonstrated to me. There is one beam supporting the joists, in the centre, and it is 36 feet from this beam to the foundation on either side. Two more beams with posts, under the joists, would make it solid. I am assured by Mr. Gardiner-Smith, that the cost will be under $25, as beams will be made out of waste lengths of plank from the construction now going on. I beg to suggest that this be done while we have carpenters out here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSPECIFICATION\n\nOF\n\nMODEL \"C\", CANADIAN IRON STOKER\n\nFOR\n\nThe Indian School,\nsituated at\nMorley, Alberta\n\nManufactured by:\nCanadian Summer Iron Works, Ltd.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAgents:\nWildfire Coal Sales Ltd.,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nJanuary 14, 1935.\nSPECIFICATION\n\nMODEL \"C\"\n\nCANADIAN IRON STOKER\n\nHOPPER:\n\nTo be made of Copper Steel, Heavy Gauge, Rust Treated, with a capacity of 500 pounds of coal.

Christianson,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir: Re - Automatic Stoker,\nIndian School,\nMorley.\n\nWe attach herewith specifications\nof our Model \"Q\" Automatic Iron Stoker, which is our\nrecommendation for the Indian School at Morley, Alberta.\n\nThis unit, you will note, has a\ndelivery capacity of fifty pounds, one hundred pounds,\nand one hundred and fifty pounds, per operating hour,\nwhich with calorific coal value of 16,000 B.T.U. is\nequivalent to a steam radiation of 270 square feet. As\nthe required radiation is only 250 feet this Stoker\nsupplies a comfortable factor of safety.\n\nA few arguments at this time in\nfavor of our Stoker I feel would be very much in order.\nThe first is the very pronounced savings associated with\nevery installation. In the case of the Yacht Club at\nVancouver the saving in the first three months of operation\nwas 33%. In the hospital at Penticton (Creeq Gables) their\nsaving last winter ran about 30%. At schools at Kelowna,\nKerritt and Princeton where temperatures fall as low as\n20 degrees below zero the saving was 25%.\n\nThere is also associated with the\nuse of a Stoker that safety from backfire or explosion,\nwhich causes most of the fires, which are so destructive\nto property. The effect of uneven firing on the boiler\n\nAll prices are subject to change or previous sale without notice. Delivered prices are based on freight rates in effect\nat time quotation is made. All quotations, agreements and contracts are made contingent upon strikes, fires, accidents\nor other conditions beyond our control.\nMr. M. Christianson,\n\nJanuary 19, 1935.\n\nWe would also point out to you that the underfeed method of stoker firing gives you a steady fire, a continuous radiated heat, and a boiler or furnace always warm. All the volatility formerly escaping as smoke will be conserved in the form of valuable heat and render the fire sootless and without smoke, and all danger of odors throughout the building will be absolutely removed.\n\nYou will readily see by perusing these specifications that the whole cost of the stoker will be saved by its use inside of three and one-half years.\n\nI would like to point out to you a very specific saving in this case, which is the cost of fuel. The fuel you are now using costs you $5.65 per ton F.O.B. Morley. The fuel you would use with this stoker would cost $2.10 F.O.B. Morley, being a net saving of $2.45 per ton, which is an extremely important item in the saving above referred to. I might also add that if the stoker is installed we are in a position to contract with the Department to supply coal at Morley at $3.10 per ton.\n\nWe are prepared to install this stoker complete in every respect, and guaranteed as to workmanship and material, and leave the job completed to the satisfaction of your Superintendent or Engineer, for the sum of $1019.75. We should be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience in this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAlex G. Low\nWESTERN REPRESENTATIVE.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., January 21st, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith a letter which is addressed to me by the Wildfire Coal Sales, Limited, of Calgary. Mr. Low, the Western Representative here, interviewed me sometime ago in connection with installing a stoker on the new furnace at the school at Morley. He was at that time accompanied by a representative of the company that manufactures this article at Vancouver. I advised him then that as far as I knew the appropriation for buildings, &c., which had been allotted to our Department last year, had been pretty well used up; but I was requested to forward the specifications and letter to you.\n\nI have made certain enquiries and I believe the stokers are working very satisfactorily and no doubt they are money-savers, as they will burn cheaper coal. You will note that Mr. Low claims the saving will be anywhere from 25% to 53%.\n\nNo doubt, if the Department have funds to install this stoker, it would greatly assist the school in keeping down expenses, as in Indian Residential Schools here fuel is a big item. The Principal of the School, the Rev. Mr. Staley, is, of course, very anxious to get one installed as he can see a saving in the fuel bill. I am simply forwarding this for your attention as I promised to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nJanuary 28, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General with reference to the installation of a stoker in the Morley School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is not the intention to provide a stoker at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Gardner Smith\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on Addition to School, Stony Reserve.\n\nSir:\n\nSince my Report of a month ago we have been experiencing the most extreme wintry weather for many years, with drifting snowstorms, and phenomenal low temperatures. Under such conditions it was generally impossible to carry on any outside work, and although we had just succeeded in getting the new addition closed in, yet without heat it was almost equally impossible for men to work inside. The result is that for several weeks but little progress has been made on this job. However, our carpentry work had almost reached the stage where it could have been stopped until after the plastering, which cannot be commenced at this season of the year until heat is available. The heating men have been working intermittently whenever the weather was not too severe, and the various heating mains, returns and risers are now being placed, and a fair proportion of this work is well advanced. Two or three days ago a welcome Chinook wind made its long-awaited appearance, and we are now experiencing its genial influence. The temperature today is well above freezing.\n\nThe heating boilers have not yet arrived, but are expected shortly. Railway services are greatly disrupted in consequence of serious snow-slides in the mountains, which may delay their shipment. I am sending you a blue print of the boilers we are getting. Owing to somebody making the heating contractor order No. 109, and which I had to reject because of insufficient capacity, we are now getting boilers No. 112, which seem in every way suitable. I have asked that the Provincial Boiler Inspector at Edmonton approve these boilers before they are shipped, and they will be inspected again in the usual course after installation. Mr. Alex. Walker, of Calgary, has been useful to me in checking the proposed boilers, and on heating matters generally.\n\nIn my last Report I mentioned that I had had to reject the siding sent because of too many dead knots. The lumber people agreed to take it back, and replace it with No. 1 Coast fir siding. This arrived about two weeks ago, but only recently was it possible to commence putting it in place, because of the very cold weather. However, we have now seen the siding all on, and as the lathing will be completed about the same time, we shall have to await the completion of the plastering before any more carpentry work can be done. However, I can employ the best of the men in placing the inside finish in the new hospital, at which work I already have three good men engaged.\n\nIt will probably be about three weeks before the plastering of the school addition can commence, for from present indications it will be fully that time before temporary heat will be available.\n\nI duly received the Architect's telegram accepting Lepper & Co.'s tender for the plumbing required in the school, and I lost no time in notifying this contractor accordingly, and the roughing-in, etc., will, I expect, be done promptly, and in advance of the plastering.\nThe Reverend Principal has asked that all ceilings in the new addition be metal ceilings similar to that in the main building, with the exception that in the original school the ceilings of the top storey are plastered. The main reason why he wants metal ceilings for the top storey of the addition is because he intends using the attic space there for storage of children's garments when not in use. He has thought that even this light traffic on the small loftists might tend to crack plastered ceilings. As I could see no objection to meeting his wish in this respect, I have had this ceiling sheeted with metal in preparation for the metal. We shall build him a new stairway from the store room of this top storey, giving access to the attic, and shall place a light switch (in conduit) in the attic, with switch controls in said store room, and shall lay a sniplap floor 12 wide the length of the new attic. The cost of this convenience will be but little more than if the ceiling were plastered.\n\nThe electrical contractor, Mr. Lloyd Orr, of Calgary, has completed the placing of conduits with light and switch outlets, and panel boxes, bell and gong wiring, etc., and will return when the job is ready to pull his wires and hang the fixtures.\n\nWe shall defer the erection of the divisional wall in the present girl's dormitory, also the extension of the plumbing in the existing girl's dormitory until the new dormitory is available, because of the present girl's dormitory being occupied to capacity, there being scarcely walking room between the beds. We shall also defer taking down the existing stairway, and the alterations in that area, until other work is about completed. Our aim is to make as little disturbance and interruption to the operation of the school as possible.\n\nWill you kindly send me another blueprint of the school, as the three copies sent are being used by the various trades, and I am without a copy at present.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

Christiansen,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir: Re - Automatic Stoker,\nIndian School,\nMorley.\n\nWe attach herewith specifications\nof our Model \"C\" Automatic Iron Stoker, which is our\nrecommendation for the Indian School at Morley, Alberta.\n\nThis unit, you will note, has a\ndelivery capacity of fifty pounds, one hundred pounds,\nand one hundred and fifty pounds, per operating hour,\nwhich with calorific coal value of 10,000 B.T.U. is\nequivalent to a steam radiation of 2700 square feet. As\nthe required radiation is only 2650 feet this Stoker\nsupplies a comfortable factor of safety.\n\nA few arguments at this time in\nfavor of our Stoker I feel would be very much in order.\nThe first is the very pronounced savings associated with\nevery installation. In the case of the Yacht Club at\nVancouver the saving in the first three months of operation\nwas 53%. In the hospital at Penticton (Green Gables) their\nsaving last winter ran about 30% at schools at Kelowna,\nMerritt and Princeton where temperatures fall as low as\n20 degrees below zero the saving was 25%.\n\nThere is also associated with the\nuse of a Stoker that safety from backfire or explosion,\nwhich causes most of the fires, which are so destructive\nto property. The effect of uneven firing on the boiler\nMr. M. Christianson,\n\nJanuary 19, 1936.\n\nWe would also point out to you that the underfeed method of stoker firing gives you a steady fire, a continuous radiated heat, and a boiler or furnace always warm. All the volatility formerly escaping as smoke will be conserved in the form of valuable heat and render the fire smokeless and without smoke, and all danger of odors throughout the building will be absolutely removed.\n\nYou will readily see by perusing these specifications that the whole cost of the stoker will be saved by its use inside of three and one-half years.\n\nI would like to point out to you a very specific saving in this case, which is the cost of fuel. The fuel you are now using costs you $5.65 per ton F.O.B. Morley. The fuel you would use with this stoker would cost $3.10 F.O.B. Morley, being a net saving of $2.45 per ton, which is an extremely important item in the saving above referred to. I might also add that if the stoker is installed we are in a position to contract with the Department to supply coal at Morley at $3.10 per ton.\n\nWe are prepared to install this stoker complete in every respect, and guaranteed as to workmanship and material, and leave the job completed to the satisfaction of your Superintendent or Engineer, for the sum of $1019.75. We should be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience in this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. O. LOW\n\nWESTERN REPRESENTATIVE.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFebruary 15, 1935.\n\nDR. McGILL:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter to Mr. Christianson from Mr. Alex. G. Low, Western Representative of the Wildfire Coal Sales, Calgary, together with that Company's Specification of Model \"C\" Canadian Iron Stoker, which they recommend for use in the new INDIAN SCHOOL at Morley.\n\nWill you kindly inform the Minister if the Department approves of the installation of this class of equipment, and if funds are available for such a purpose.\n\nGeorge Buskard,\nPrivate Secretary.\nFebruary 19, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Doctor McGill,\n\nWith reference to the attached correspondence and quotation for the installation of a stoker in the Morley School, I beg to say that there is no doubt that there would be considerable saving in fuel to the Church in operating the heating system if a stoker were installed. You will note that the cost would be $1,019.75.\n\nAt the present time it is rather difficult to say whether funds will be available in the amount provided under the Public Works Construction Act. I would therefore suggest that decision be left in abeyance until a later date.\n\nArchitect.\nFebruary 1, 1925.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 15th instant, with enclosures, I am attaching hereto copy of a memorandum submitted by the Departmental Architect, Mr. Orr, regarding the installation of stoker in the Morley School.\n\nI concur in Mr. Orr's suggestion regarding this stoker.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Lloyd Orr Electric,\nCalgary,\n\nDATE 1935\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Jan 26 | Electrical material, labour etc., in addition to Residential School, as per invoice attached | 198 12 |\n\nAuthority: S.R.

This contract is now completed and the system is performing efficiently. Mr. Alex Walker, local engineer and representative of the Dunham Heating Company has been out to Morley and has checked over this system, this service being rendered free of charge to the Department, and Mr. Walker also reports the heating system as being well installed and in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nThe various tenders for this work were duly submitted to the Department, and on your instructions the work was awarded to the Anderson Plumbing and Heating Company.\n\nWith regard to this account, I may say that the Riverside Iron Works, Ltd., of Calgary, have requested that their account of $1300 for supplying the boilers be protected. In addition to this there is a fairly large sum owing by this contractor to Bell and Morris of Calgary, for materials supplied at Morley, and they seem somewhat anxious also. The Dunham people have advised us of a sum of $758.57 owing to them for heating specialties, &c., supplied on this job.\n\nE. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nIn view of these outstanding accounts I feel that it is incumbent on me to draw the attention of the Department to these matters, and would respectfully suggest that the cheque in final payment to the contractor be sent either in care of the Indian Agent or to myself so that we can make sure that all accounts are paid before turning the cheque over to the Anderson Plumbing Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

I am quite aware that leaving the door unlocked gives instantaneous opportunity of getting into the girls' dormitory, and it is also an invitation for the boys to slip out of the school at night.

Since his visit, the painter now working on the new addition has estimated the cost of painting the outside of the old part at $360. This covers two coats on walls, roof and trim. The present paint is quite weathered on the south and west sides and will require painting in about two years in any case.\n\nI may recall for your convenience, that the school is painted a dark brown with green roof, whereas all other Department buildings are grey with red roof. It is the desire of the school principal and myself to have the school the same color as the other buildings, which is a good color combination, as well as to have them all in harmony. The result would well repay the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B. Murray\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 9, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, you may arrange with the painters now at work at the school to paint the outside of the old portion of the Morley School, the work to be done by day labour, and to be charged to the Public Works Construction Act funds, the same as for the erection of the addition.\n\nTime sheets should be kept for all labour and if materials are required they should be purchased from firms on your approved list, and vouchers submitted showing in detail the amounts purchased.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

Stephens & Co. Ltd., Calgary, Alta., for Paint etc., for addition to Residential School Building, Morley.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 119-1-5 dated Oct. 24th, 1934, Exh. No. 2562.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nMorley, Alta. April 3rd, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on Addition to Indian School.\n\nSir:\n\nSince my Report of January 28th steady progress has been maintained. On the 16th ultimo the plastering of the new addition was completed, and the plasterers (Jonathan & Sons) returned to Calgary. An excellent job of plastering was performed. We supplied all the materials, including excellent sand, cement, etc., and specified and supervised the work for this work, and the plastering was done by day labour, to a strict specification. The plasterers will return to plaster the new partition wall in the existing girls' dormitory, the toilet extension in the same room, and in making good around the existing stairway after removal.\n\nOn the 21st of Feb'y the heating contractors, (Anderson Plumbing Co.) completed the installing of the new heating system, and steam heat thus became available for the plumbing work. The domestic immediately following the new heating plant is proving very satisfactory, and the fine new boilers fitted remarkably well into the former furnace room, just neatly filling the furnace pit. As we had to cut a deep opening in the west concrete wall to admit the boiler, the new Principal urged that this opening instead of being closed up again be converted into an outside entrance into the boiler-room which has been done, and this entry is being provided with concrete steps, with roof over, and a further outside door as its outlet from the boiler-room will be most convenient for removing ashes, and permitting bulk articles. As the 24\" breeching from the new boilers passes just below the basement ceiling to reach the altered chimney, I deemed it necessary to take unusual measures against fire hazard, and have had the ceiling along this line of breeching entirely insulated with asbestos bricks 12\" wide, covered with galvanized iron, with air-space between the insulation and the ceiling. The contractors may make an extra charge for this feature of their work.\n\nThe plumbing fixtures have been installed in the new addition to the school, and this branch of the work is completed except in the lavatory extension which we have yet to extend in the existing girls' dormitory. The fixtures are here for that purpose, but the work in doing out the completion of this work is having to be deferred until the lavatory extension can be made. In reorganizing the plumbing and heating of the school, it became necessary to remove the hot water storage tank to the room adjoining the new boilers, also to remove the siphoning pipe at similar location, so as to make a few other minor changes resulting from these removals. The plumbing contractor performed this work very satisfactorily. The east furnace room is being converted into a drying room, with connection to their laundry-room, and provided with radiation. This will be very helpful in drying their washings, especially during severe weather. An extra charge was made by the heating contractor for this feature, as radiators spared from outside rear porches were placed in this room instead.\nCarpenters are now doing the finish carpentry in the new addition. We are finishing the top dormitory and adjoining matron's room. These rooms are now completed, and the plumbing in operation, and the painters are painting the metal ceilings, staining and varnishing the trim, and oiling the floors. This fine new dormitory will be ready for occupation within about two or three days, and then the beds will be moved from the existing dormitory and we can proceed with the partition wall across the old dormitory, and build the lavatory extension shown on the plans. Most of the door openings in the new addition are now cased in, and most of the doors hung. The floorboards have been laid in the new addition, and the carpenters will commence laying the floors on the ground floor, and joiners will follow as fast as the carpentry work is ready. After that we shall take down the existing stairs which have to be removed, and install them in the new addition. Then the existing entry and steps will be taken down and moved to their new location to give access to the verandah of the addition.\n\nThe sheet-metal workers have completed putting on the metal ceilings of the first and second floors, and are today doing this work in the basement of the new addition. We shall then have a good deal of patching of the metal ceilings to do in the original building, where numerous pipes and risers from the old furnaces passed through the basement ceilings.\n\nWe have not yet laid the concrete floor in the new addition, partly because we have utilized this room for storage of materials, and also because the weather has been too severe for mixing concrete outside. All through March the weather has been unusually cold, with zero and sub-zero temperatures. However, we should get milder weather very soon now, and it will not take long to run this floor. Excellent gravel and sand are on hand for this work.\n\nRegarding the outside painting of the new addition, both the Reverend Principal and the Indian Agent would like it to be done in a light grey with red roof, and dark green trim, so as to harmonize with the existing Agency buildings and residences. But the existing school was done in a dark brown with green roof, and as this color is drab and depressing, and also commencing to show age, the wish has been expressed that the old building be painted again, and therefore I will likely be asked to match the colors of the Agency buildings, as stated. Our painting contractor estimates that it would cost $350.00 to paint the old building 2 coats, including the roof and trim, and as I have no authority to make any extra expenditure, I am desirous of the outside painting until the Department instructs me concerning the colors for the new addition. Also, any request for the re-painting of the existing building would more properly come from the local authorities rather than from me. Obviously, however, it would soon be necessary to paint the new addition grey if the former building is to remain brown. I shall, therefore, await your instructions regarding the outside colours for the new addition before ordering the materials.\n\nThe work throughout has been carried on without any interruption to the operation of the school, and I have received friendly cooperation from both the Reverend Principal and the Indian Agent. The extension to the building will provide much needed additional accommodation; and the modern heating plant, and additional plumbing facilities make the building quite up to date.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nMorley, Alta., April 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that about 12 sq.yards of plaster have fallen off the ceiling of one of the class rooms of the Indian residential school.\n\nThe cost of replacing it has been estimated by Mr. Gardiner-Smith at not more than $30, labor and material. I beg to request authority to have it fixed while we have plasterers and material here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B. Murray\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the repairs required to the ceiling of one of the classrooms at the Morley Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have the necessary repairs carried out when the plastering is being done to the new addition. It is noted the material and labour will be approximately $30.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. W.
