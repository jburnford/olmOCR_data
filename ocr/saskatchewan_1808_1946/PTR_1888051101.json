The councilmen present were Donaldson, Johnson, Knowles, Davidson and Agnew.\n\nCorrespondence was read from Messrs. Rossiter & McKay re grant of building across the R.C. property, lot No. 72.\n\nA telegram was read next from the legislature at Ottawa which gave great satisfaction.\n\nA petition, signed by a large number of taxpayers, was presented, asking that a subdivision be made of Mr. Clark's to Jackson's drug store, which was referred to the Board of Works.\n\nCorn. Johnson reported that the low rent price placed on the church property was $500. An offer was made to get the same reduced to $400. Further consideration was given to introduce a by-law for the purchase of said property, but it was lost on a vote. Corn. Johnson announced his intention of making the motion.\n\nCorn. Johnson, on behalf of the special committee appointed to wait on Sheriff Hodgson, stated that Sheriff Hodgson had promised $600 for the improvement of the street leading up to the Court House and the Government Road. The matter was referred to the Board of Works.\n\nCorn. Davis, chairman of the special committee to confer with the board committee, stated that the council pay the debt of $710 in assessed value of the membership of the instruments, that the latter be placed in the hands of the clerk, who shall record the same and have full control of its management. The report was received and referred back to its proper committee.\n\nConsiderable amount of sporting took place during the evening and was very amusing to the spectators.\n\nDonaldson & Pembroke", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File": "/home/jic823/projects/def-jic823/pdfs_sask_test/PTR_1888051101.pdf", "olmocr-version": "0.3.4", "pdf-total-pages": 4, "total-input-tokens": 5996, "total-output-tokens": 1322, "total-fallback-pages": 0}, "attributes": {"pdf_page_numbers": [[0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 2], [0, 838, 3], [838, 4753, 4]], "primary_language": ["en", "en", "en", "en"], "is_rotation_valid": [true, true, true, true], "rotation_correction": [0, 0, 0, 0], "is_table": [false, false, false, false], "is_diagram": [false, false, false, false]}}]
