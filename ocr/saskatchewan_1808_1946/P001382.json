He has, therefore, adopted as far as practicable the rates allowed on the Imperial Regular service to the widows and families of deceased officers, and made similar provisions for the widows and families of deceased soldiers, based as in the case of officers on the respective ranks of those on whose account the pensions and gratuities are to be issued.\n\nThe Minister further represents that the distinction made in the Imperial Regulations has been followed in granting a higher rate of pension to those killed in action or who die from wounds received in action than to those who die from injuries or illness contracted on actual service. In both cases the rates fixed for lieutenants, colonels, majors and captains closely approximate those adopted in the Imperial Army but are less for Lieutenants owing to the Imperial rate for that rank being in excess of the actual difference in pay. Also there are two rates of pay for lieutenants in the active militia, the one in the permanent corps being higher than the other, and he, therefore, recommends in order to bring the rate of pension in that rank nearer to that in the Imperial army, that the minimum rate of pay for pension on account of deceased lieutenants, in all corps of the active militia be counted at $2.44 per diem, which is the rate paid to lieutenants on appointment on the permanent corps of the Dominion. The Committee advise the adoption of the annexed regulations and they submit the same for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nJOHN J.

If any militiaman shall receive injury or contract illness on actual service, which, although of a temporary nature, shall necessitate his discharge from such service, he shall be placed either in a military or civil hospital, and on his discharge from hospital he shall be conveyed to his home at the public expense; and he shall receive compensation for loss of time at the rate of one dollar a day, for the period during which he has been detained in hospital. But in case he should elect to be sent to his own home in place of the hospital, he shall receive compensation for loss of time at the rate of one dollar a day, for the period during which, according to the certificate of two qualified medical practitioners, he shall have been actually and necessarily incapacitated from following his ordinary occupation; and no allowance for medical attendance shall in any such case be given.

No claim to a gratuity or pension shall be entertained unless the officer shall apply for the same within five years after being wounded.\n\n4. A pension shall not be granted for the loss of an eye, consequent upon a wound received in action, unless loss of vision shall have occurred within five years after the wound, and shall be solely attributable to such wound.\n\n5.

To each child, a compassionate allowance annually at the rate of one tenth of the pay of the officer or soldier, and in addition for the first year a gratuity equal to four months' pay.\n\nIf the deceased officer or soldier died from illness which can be directly traced to fatigue, privation or exposure incident to active operations in the field, within six months after his having been finally incapacitated for duty, or if the deceased officer or soldier shall have lost his life in consequence of wounds received in the execution of military duty otherwise than in action,\n\n(a.) To the widow a pension annually equal to three eighths of the daily pay of the officer or soldier during twelve months.\n\n(b.) To each child a compassionate allowance annually at the rate of one-thirteenth of the pay of the officer or soldier.\n\n8. A pension to the widow or other relative of a deceased officer or soldier shall only be granted as a reward of good, faithful and gallant service rendered, and shall not be claimed as a right. It shall not be conferred if the applicant be left in wealthy circumstances, or is already in possession of any pension, provision, or allowance from the public.\n\n9. A widow's pension shall, as a rule, commence the day following that of her husband's death, and shall be discontinued should she subsequently prove unworthy of it, or attain to wealthy circumstances.\n\n10. The pension of a widow who re-marries shall be suspended from the date of her re-marriage; but in the event of her again becoming a widow, her pension may be restored, upon proof that she is not in wealthy circumstances, and is otherwise deserving.\n\nChildren.\n\n11. Compassionate allowances as shown in paragraph 7, may, subject to the conditions which apply to widows' pensions, be granted to the children of deceased officers and soldiers. They shall not be granted to sons over the age of eighteen, nor to daughters over the age of twenty-one except in very special cases in which it shall be shown that the sons or daughters became afflicted during the officer's or soldier's life with some mental or bodily infirmity rendering them dependent upon him, and permanently incapable of making adequate exertion for their support; and that such incapacity dates from a period before the children reached the limit of age, as above laid down, and that they are in distressed circumstances.\n\n12. The allowances granted under paragraph 11, to the sons of officers and soldiers may be continued until they respectively attain the age of eighteen, or are otherwise previously provided for; and those to the daughters may be continued until they respectively marry or attain the age of twenty-one, whichever shall first happen, and no longer; except in very special cases, in which it shall be shown that such children are afflicted with any mental or bodily infirmity rendering them incapable of making adequate exertion for their own support; and that they are in distressed circumstances.\n\n13. In the case of an officer or soldier killed in action or dying from wounds received in action within twelve months after such wounds shall have been received, and not leaving a widow, but a daughter or daughters only, an annual allowance equal to half the rate of widow's pension may, under special circumstances, to be\ndetermined by the Minister of Militia and Defence, be granted, instead of the compassionate allowances referred to in paragraph 11, to such daughter or to such daughters collectively. Such allowance may be continued until the daughter, or the last survivor of them in case there be more than one, may become disqualified by marriage or otherwise.\n\n14. A compassionate allowance shall be paid from the date of the officer's or soldier's death to the 30th June next ensuing; and subsequent payments shall be made yearly in advance from 1st July in each year.\n\nMother.\n\n15. The mother of an officer or soldier killed in action, or dying of wounds received in action within twelve months after such wounds shall have been received, without leaving either widow, or legitimate child, such mother being herself a widow and in distressed circumstances, and having been mainly dependent upon the deceased officer or soldier for support, may be granted an annual allowance, according to the rank of the officer or soldier, and at half the rate of widow's pension; but if she shall be in receipt of a pension as an officer's or soldier's widow, or shall have any other provision of any kind from the public, no allowance shall be made to her on account of her son, unless she relinquish such pension or provision. In the event of her allowance ceasing in consequence of re-marriage or death, it shall not be transferable to her daughters.\n\nSisters.\n\n16. The sister or sisters collectively of an officer or soldier killed in action, or dying of wounds received in action, within twelve months after such wounds shall have been received, without leaving widow, legitimate child, or mother; and provided she or they be an orphan or orphans, without surviving brother, and mainly dependent for support upon the officer or soldier deceased, may, under special circumstances, to be determined by the Minister of Militia and Defence, be granted an allowance equal to half the rate of widow's pension.\n\n17. In instances where the regulations do not meet the circumstances of individual cases, they may be specially considered by His Excellency the Governor General in Council.\n\nThe minimum rate of pay for pension on account of deceased lieutenants in all corps of the Active Militia will be counted at two dollars per diem.\n\nPermanent Disability.\n\n1007. All cases of permanent disability, arising from injuries received or illness contracted by officers or men on actual service, shall be reported on by a medical board, and compensation awarded for the same according to the merits of the case; Par. 152, R. & O.\n\nRegulations for Claims.\n\nThe following regulations apply when claims to pensions, or gratuity on account of death or wounds, of officers or men, or of disability from illness contracted while on actual service, require to be established.\n\n1008. A board of officers composed of one field officer and two captains of the Active Militia, will be assembled at such time and place as may be ordered, and shall take cognizance and report on the various claims presented for its consideration; Par. 374, R. & O., 1870.\n\n1009. Where the claims are on account of disability, the cause, degree and probable duration of the disability must be established by evidence before a medical board; and the report of such board will form part of the evidence required to be produced before the board of officers referred to in the above paragraph. The claims will be divided into three classes.\n1st Class.\n\n(1.) Claims on the part of relatives of militiamen who have been killed in action, or who have died of wounds or injuries received, or of disease contracted on actual service.\n\n(2.) The evidence required to be produced before the board in support of claims of this class, is, in the case of a militiaman killed in action, a certificate from the commanding officer of his corps, stating that he was killed in action or on actual service. (Form marked A, par. 1013.)\n\n(3.) In the case of a militiaman who has died of wounds or injuries received on actual service, a certificate from the medical officer who first saw him after he was wounded or injured, countersigned by the commanding officer, stating the nature of the wound or injury which caused death; also a certificate from the medical attendant at the time of death, stating the cause and date of death, (form B, par. 1014,) the same is to be corroborated by any other material evidence that can be procured.\n\n(4.) In the case of a militiaman who has died of disease contracted on actual service, a certificate from the medical officer who first attended him after he was taken ill, countersigned by the commanding officer, stating the nature of the disease, and that it was contracted on actual service (form B, par. 1014); Also a certificate from the medical attendant at the time of death, stating the cause and date of death. (Form B, par. 1014.)\n\n(5.) In all the foregoing cases, evidence must be produced of the circumstances of the deceased, and the amount of income he was in receipt of at the time of his going on service; and whether his income died with him in whole or in part, stating what part, if any, was independent of his life; also evidence of the number, age, sex and proximity of relatives who were dependent for support on the life of the deceased; also evidence of the amount of medical attendance received by the deceased (supposing him to have died of wounds or disease,) between the time of his discharge from actual service and the date of his death, with the names and residences of the medical attendants who had charge of him during that period. (Form C, par. 1015.)\n\n2nd Class.\n\n(1.) Claims on the part of militiamen who have received wounds or injuries, or have contracted disease on service, which may incapacitate them wholly from following their former trade or profession.\n\n(2.) The evidence required to be produced is as follows:\u2014Report of medical board referred to in first part of this paragraph 1009. (Form D, 1016) Evidence as to the circumstances of claimants:\u2014the amount of income he was in receipt of at the time of his going on service\u2014whether his income depended in whole or in part on his personal exertions; and what portion thereof, if any, was independent of his personal exertions; also evidence of the age, sex and proximity of relatives who depended for support on the claimant's personal exertions; also evidence of the medical attendance received by the claimant between the time of his discharge from actual service and the date of investigation of his claim, with the names and residences of the medical attendants who had charge of him during that period. (Form C, par. 1015.)\n\n3rd Class.\n\n(1.) Claims on the part of militiamen who have received wounds or injuries, or have contracted disease on actual service, such as to incapacitate them for a time from following their usual trade or profession. The evidence required to be produced is as follows: report of medical board referred to in the first part of this paragraph 1009, which shall establish the amount and probable duration of incapacity (form D, par. 1016). Also evidence of the same nature as prescribed for claimants under the 2nd Class. Par. 375 R. & O. 1870.\n\n1010. The Board, having taken the necessary evidence, will make its report\u2014and will recommend such amounts of pension and gratuity, subject to the regulations on that head, as may appear equitable. The report of the board will be solely on the evidence which is embodied in the proceedings. Par. 376, R. & O. 1870.\nBoards of Medical Officers.\n\n1011. The following applies to such boards as may be assembled for purposes mentioned in paragraph 1009, to investigate cases of disability of militiamen occasioned by wounds or injuries received, or by disease contracted on actual service. These cases are divided into two classes. Par. 387, R. & O. 1870.\n\n1. Cases of militiamen who have received wounds or injuries, or have contracted disease on actual service, such as to incapacitate them wholly from following their former trade or profession.\n\n2. Cases of militiamen who have received wounds or injuries, or have contracted disease, on actual service, such as to incapacitate them for a time from following their former trade or profession.\n\n1012. The board will take such evidence as may be produced, and will report its own opinion thereupon, either as to the total or partial disability of the claimant; if the disability is partial, the board will state the amount of injury or incapacity under which the claimant is suffering at the date of investigation, and its probable duration; the opinion of the board will, of course, be based solely on the evidence which is embodied in the proceedings.
