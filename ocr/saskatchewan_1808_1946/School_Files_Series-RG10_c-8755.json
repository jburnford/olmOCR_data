I am grateful for the information contained in your favor of the 18th instant and after careful consideration have come to the following decisions which I trust you will approve and the department as well.\n\n(1) I have personally interviewed Miss Finan, have studied the excellent references she was able to produce and therefore confidently nominate her as the new teacher for the East Saanich Reserve School. (2) For the Songhees school I nominate Miss Francis for though not a certificated teacher she is certainly by far the best available now and if there is any delay in accepting her she will certainly take up other work already open to her talents. As the inspector has certified in his report on her work during the period when she was replacing Miss Blue, there can be no doubt that by her intelligence, enthusiasm, cheerfulness and discipline she gets excellent results all along the line. She is moreover young enough to endure a heavy curriculum as she enjoys perfect health. (3) In regard to the West Saanich School situation I quite appreciate the impossibility of two teachers teaching in the same little room so I have persuaded Father Lauzon to allow the department the use of his parish hall for a nominal sum of ten dollars a month until the new school has been built. Of course the department would have to provide the few desks required, improve the lighting somewhat, provide the fuel and possibly make a few minor alterations but I feel all this could be done for about $200.00 or less. Please let me know\nif you approve of this arrangement. My address in the East will be 184 Bayswater Avenue, Ottawa, Ontario in case you may wish to contact me.\n\nWith every good wish I beg to remain\n\nSincerely yours in Christ,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Victoria.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of June 24th, regarding the resignation of Miss Mary Wadel as teacher of the Saanich Indian Day School, and to forward herewith Bishop Cody's letter of July 24th nominating Miss C. E. Finan to the position. Miss Finan, who taught at the Moricetown Indian Day School during 1941 and 1942, was recently discharged from the C.W.A.C. and her appointment is recommended for your approval.\n\nI would also refer to your letter No. 152-21-1 of June 21st accepting the resignation of Miss Bertha Blue of the Songhees Indian Day School, and would bring your attention to Bishop Cody's nomination of Miss Mary Francis who, although not a certificated teacher, received a very favourable report from the Provincial School Inspector during the period she acted as substitute teacher for Miss Blue.\n\nItem 3 of Bishop Cody's letter will be dealt with in due course in a separate communication.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nHN\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6424, file 870-1, part 1)\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 27th ultimo which mentioned the request you had received from Bishop Cody for a school at West Saanich.\n\nI had an opportunity of discussing this matter with Bishop Cody on Saturday afternoon and he feels that there is a necessity for this school and that it should be operated under the general direction of the present teacher of the Tsartlip School. I understood from Bishop Cody that the proposed new room is a comparatively short distance from Tsartlip. It has been decided to recognize this second room as an adjunct of the Tsartlip School. Bishop Cody will nominate a qualified member of the Order to which the teacher at the Tsartlip School belongs. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $30 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nDuring the course of our conversation Bishop Cody stated that he understood from Inspector Coleman that surplus desks were available at some other schools and consequently it would not be necessary to purchase new ones. If this is correct, you may arrange for the transfer of these surplus desks, but, if you have to purchase new desks, you may do so.\nThe Department also approves an expenditure of approximately $200 for minor alterations to the parish hall and we will allow a nominal rental of $10 a month for this building. I presume that arrangements will be made to open this extra room in September and no doubt you will advise me as soon as Bishop Cody nominates the teacher.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nAugust 1, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, the Department approves the appointment of Miss C.H. Finan as teacher of the Saanich Indian Day School. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $90 a teaching month, plus bonus, effective September 1, 1944. As soon as she begins duties you should have her prepare and forward to this office the usual forms.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, August 22, 1944.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRe: Saanich Indian Day School,\nNo.870.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay has recommended an increase in salary to the teacher of the above-noted school. Effective September 1, 1944, the salary rate should be at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month, plus bonus. Major MacKay's letter, with list, is on File 1-1-3, dated August 9, 1944.\n\nThe Department has approved the appointment of Miss C. E. Finan as teacher of this school - see official letter dated August 1, 1944.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nYour File 152-15-1\n\nWith reference to your letter of 1st August, I am enclosing herewith the following forms in connection with appointment of Miss C.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nREPORT ON COWICHAN INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST, 1944.\n\nI also visited the Sooke, Beecher Bay, Songhees, Esquimalt, Saanich (4), Malahat, Cowichan, Westholme, Chemainus, and Nanaimo Reserves, during the period, as well as the Day Schools, another one room school is to be opened at or near the Saanich I.R. No. 1. Reserve in the R.C. Church Hall at the beginning of the school term. This is to be a temporary arrangement pending the building of a new school on that reserve large enough to take care of all the pupils.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 26, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Saanich Indian Day School\nNo. 870\n\nThe Department has appointed Miss C.E. Finan as teacher of this school at a salary of $100 a teaching month, plus bonus, effective September 1. I enclose copy of letter of appointment and also T.D. 1 form and cost-of-living bonus form. Staff questionnaire will be forwarded to you shortly.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nDuring the first week of the month all the Day schools opened and the Kuper Is. Res. School. Attendance at two schools only could be considered good, Koksilah and Songhees, Tsartlip Sr. and Junior Rooms had a satisfactory enrollment from the opening date with a gradual improvement during the last week. St. Catherine's and Saanich Schools were quite low although a much larger attendance in both these is expected from now on as a lot of the Indians have returned from the Hop fields and fishing grounds during the last few days. Please note that the poor attendances were caused entirely on account of the Indian families being absent from their reserves at seasonal employment.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nDuncan, B.C.\n\nJanuary 19th, 1946\n\nMajor D. M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nI wish to report that a serious situation has arisen in the Saanich I.D. schools with respect to the problem of transportation. As you know, the three sisters drive to and from the three schools each day in one car making a total round trip of about 26 miles.\n\nIn November last, the transmission failed in the Sister's Car, which is a 1941 Hudson, and the dealers and mechanics in Victoria have been trying ever since to get a replacement, but without success. In fact a telegram has been sent to the Hudson factory twice weekly ever since trying to get them to expedite shipment but so far no reply has been received, the factory simply ignore the telegrams. The result of all this has been the Sister's having to borrow the mechanics car, which convenience ended last week, and so now they are right up against it, no car and no immediate chance of getting repairs for their own car which has the broken transmission, unless of course there is some pressure put on the Hudson Factory to either send a reply to the many telegrams which they have ignored, or forward the necessary parts as ordered last November. The strike situation in the U.S. of course complicates matters still more.\n\nThe Teachers have transportation for Monday next only only, after that the schools will have to close until arrangements of some kind are made. In checking over the possibility of procuring some means for the Sister's to get to school and back daily, I find that the Sylvester U-Drive Co. in Victoria will provide a car at the rate of $30.00 per week, Sister's to supply gas, oil and repairs which they are willing to do providing the Department will pay the cost of the actual hire. As you know, Bus transportation is not available at hours suitable, and then it would mean a walk of 2 miles to and from the schools.\n\n(over)\nIn giving this matter serious consideration and trying to arrive at some solution for the problem, I cannot see anything that would be at all suitable other than for us to hire a Car from the U-Drive Co., at the price stated.\n\nIt may be unusual for the Department to be asked to supply transportation for the teachers, but this is an unusual set-up and in my opinion at least calls for action in an unusual manner. I would therefore recommend that the Dept. pay the hire of this Car, and in the meantime try and put some pressure on the factory to ship the parts for the Sisters' car.\n\nThe schools will be closed on Tuesday next pending some suitable arrangements being made. The Sister's have done everything they possibly can do and only came to me as a last resort when they were unable to borrow a car any longer.\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 21, 1946.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq., Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of January 19th regarding the difficulties being experienced by the Reverend teachers of the two Saanich Indian Day Schools in the matter of transportation to and from these schools.\n\nAs you know it is not the policy of the Department to provide transportation in such cases and I doubt if any exception will be made. The matter is, however, being referred to the department for a decision but I can give no assurance whatever that any assistance will be forthcoming. The teachers must find the means themselves to get to and from their work in the same way as any other employees of the Department.\n\nIt is noted that it may be necessary to close these schools for the time being as from Tuesday, January 22nd.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Moore's letter to me of the 19th instant reporting that the teachers of the Saanich Indian Day Schools are experiencing difficulty in securing transportation to and from these schools, together with a copy of my reply to him of this date. It will be observed that the Agent recommends that transportation be provided for the teachers at the rate of $30.00 per week at the expense of the Department.\n\nThe responsibility of getting to and from work devolves on the teachers of our schools in the same way as any other employees and as I am not convinced the Department should accept this responsibility I regret that I am unable to endorse the Agent's recommendation.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, 28th January, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the difficulties experienced by the teachers of the Saanich Indian Day School in securing transportation. As you pointed out in the last paragraph of your letter, the responsibility of arranging transportation to and from the schools depends on the teachers in the same way as in the case of other employees. If we accepted responsibility in this particular case, we would probably have many more such applications.\n\nThe only possible solution that I can think of is that if they cannot get their car repaired it might be possible to rent for a few months some residence near the schools at which they can reside. We want to keep these schools open if at all possible and such arrangements might be made at fairly reasonable cost. The difficulty which they are experiencing in obtaining parts for their car should be overcome within the next few months.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 1, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nCalifornia State Teachers' Certificates\n\nReference your letter of July 18, it will be necessary to delay action concerning these American teachers until the citizenship and allegiance oaths are taken by them.\n\nYou will receive details in connection with the taking of these oaths by all Civil Servants in the near future.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDuring the present emergency, there is no certainty that engines and tires would be available for the motor vehicle used in the transportation of the Cole Bay children to Tsartlip School, and in any case I am not prepared to recommend the establishment of any school bus service in Saanich at the present time, apart from the fact that I am not at all convinced that there would be accommodation at Tsartlip for these children.\n\nA short time ago I recommended that Indian boys and girls attending Residential Schools on or near the coast might, under certain circumstances, be discharged on reaching their fourteenth birthday, in order that such children might engage in the fishing industry. Should the Department approve of my suggestion, it is quite possible that several boys and girls would, in the near future, be discharged from the Xuper Island Residential School. The vacancies caused by such discharges as I have referred to above, might well be filled by some, at least, of the Cole Bay children now in need of education.\n\nFor the reasons given above I am not prepared to recommend provision of day school facilities for the small number of children at present available on the Saanich Indian Reserve No. 3.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGa.

It was upon St. Peter that Christ promised to build His Church as upon a rock against which the gates of Hell should not prevail. It was St. Peter whom Satan especially sought and for whom Christ especially prayed that his faith fail not and that being converted, she should convert his brethren. It was to St. Peter that Christ entrusted the office of shepherd\u00acing His flock when He was about to leave the world for the right Hand of His Heavenly Father. It was to St. Peter, chosen first among the Apostles, that Christ said: \"Feed my lambs, feed my sheep.\"\n\nYes, the Chair of Peter is the centre of unity, and he who seeks it elsewhere seeks in vain. Christ Himself established it there, and no man or set of men has a right to change it.\n\nThe past few centuries have witnessed many abortive attempts to undo what Christ has done, but every one has been doomed to failure. Self-opinionated men have arisen at different times and in different places to give utterance to Luther's \"non serviam\"\u2014I will not serve. And separating themselves from the centre of unity, have lured countless others along with them. But when the branch separates from the vine it can bear no fruit. Christ said that and experience emphatically proves it. Rebellion against divinely constituted authority can end only in religious anarchy and religious chaos.\n\nFrom Vatican Hill, the successor of St. Peter, whom Christ chose at the Chief Shepherd of Christendom, looks anxiously towards these sheep who have strayed from his fold. He recalls the prayer of Him whose Vice-regent here on earth he is: \"That they all may be One, as Thou, Father, in Me and I in Thee; that they may be One in Us.\"\n\nSetting aside the Octave from January 18 to January 25 as Church Unity Octave, Our Holy Father issues a special appeal to Catholics the world over to pray with him that God's grace may enlighten their minds and strengthen their wills to leave the path of error, to re\u00actrace their erring footsteps, to come back to their spirit\u00acual Home, to the One Fold and the One Shepherd.\n\nGod grant that it may be so. Would that each one might be able to say as Cardinal Newman once said:\n\n\"Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\nLead Thou me on!\nThe night is dark, and I am far from home\u2014\nLead Thou me on!\nSo long, Thy power has blest me, sure it still\nWill lead me on,\nO'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent till\nThe night is gone;\nAnd with the morn those angel faces smile\nWhich I have loved long since and lost a while.\"\n\n--Cathedral Bulletin.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe members of the C.Y.O., Saanich Chapter have directed me to thank you sincerely for the interest you have shown in the concert they held in St. Ann's Academy, on Jan 10th.\n\nWe hope to make this event an annual one, with all the schools in the district taking part. We would like to have a drama festival for the Indians. If we succeed in this plan we will possibly call on the Department of Indian Affairs to put up a trophy to be awarded each year to the best group.\n\nMeanwhile we have turned the greatest part of our share of the proceeds into an educational fund to promote contests among the school children, the first of which will be a spelling bee, to take place on the first Sunday in March.\n\nRev. Father Lauzon told us that you are from Victoria and that you know the situation in Saanich very well. It makes us hope to see our new school being built very soon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAnn Elliott\n\nSecretary\nAugust 19, 1949.\n\nSister M.

(RG 10, Volume 6424, file 870-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nI presume that the estimates on the new schools are at present studied by your Department. So I present, for the last time, my case for a consolidated school in Saanich, B.C. I feel that a three-room-school is required to give accommodation to our rising school population. I am sending you a copy of the survey I made for Mr. R.F. Davey, the B.C. School Inspector.\n\nMy reason for asking for a consolidated school is the necessity of providing extensive vocational training to the Indian children. Some may look at St. Catherine as not being a complete success. Nevertheless the vocational training, among the girls especially, has brought about a marked improvement in the care they take of themselves, and for the few that are married, of their homes. Here in Saanich, it is easy to tell when a home is cared for by women who have had vocational training. In my opinion, it takes a daily routine of training to teach those children how to manage a home.\n\nAlthough the academic progress of the pupils would be retarded somewhat on account of the time taken for vocational training, I feel that it would be for the benefit of the majority and that it would give them the type of education that would prepare them to better their home condition.\n\nDiscussing a future school with the Superior General of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, she told me that from the academic viewpoint, she that the efforts of the teachers are too scattered at present and that the same staff would do more and better work if they were in the same school. Moreover she told me that she does not favour the situation where one sister is isolated, although she would be ready to leave one sister in East Saanich if needed be.\n\nThe grouping of the children would help in many activities. I have had two older girls take a Girl-Guides course this summer. With the Sisters' supervision they would be able to start a Broyny pack.\n\nThe question of attendance is one that is not easily answered. But judging by the present situation, it should be very satisfactory. I have proposed and the Sisters have agreed to begin school at 9:30 to give the little ones more sleep in the morning.\n\nSomeone would have to be found to operate a bus. The Vancouver Island Coach Line have their nearest depot in Victoria and they charge for every mile out of the depot, which would mean, at least 30 miles of dead load. I have told Mr. Davey that I would be interested in the transportation contract.\nSpeaking with the Indians, I have found no objection to a consolidated school. Moreover, the larger the school, because they are always complaining (to quote one in the Daily Colonist) that the Department of Indian Affairs is only building 2x4 schools.\n\nI have asked the Superior General of the Sisters of I.H.M. to write to you, giving her opinion on the new school and to tell you what she thinks would be required for the sisters' quarters. It would be well to provide for a social worker, as she told me that she would be willing to have one sister trained and sent here.\n\nPersonally, I hope that the efforts and the sacrifices the mission has made to provide facilities during the difficult years, will be rewarded by a liberal grant for a new school.\n\nRemind me to Mr. Phelan and the others. Give my best regards to Major MacKay.\n\nI am sending a word to the two Mrs. Neary, with copies of the Time.\n\nWith the assurance of my prayers and with my best wishes for a continued success in your endeavours in favour of our common friends, I remain,\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nWhen Reverend Father Lauzon, S.M.M., suggested my writing to you in behalf of the Saanich Indian Schools, I experienced no difficulty in conceding to his suggestion. On the contrary, I consider it a pleasure to address one who has shown so many courtesies to the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in the past.\n\nSince you are already acquainted with the work being done in the Saanich Indian Schools and the handicaps under which the Sisters labor, I feel that I need not say much. Briefly, therefore, may I express myself in favor of a consolidated school for the Saanich area with convent quarters for the Sisters and this for the following reasons:\n\n1. It would offer facilities which cannot now be offered in a one-room school, such as, Home Economics and Manual Training.\n\n2. A larger class would seem more practical than two smaller classes with the teacher concentrating on two or at the most three grades in the group.\n\n3. With a larger group in the same grade level there would be greater possibilities for developing leadership and better school spirit which in turn would create an interest in education in their homes.\n\n4. The living facilities for the Sisters on the same grounds would give more time for school work, and it would give them the opportunity to do catechetical work in neighboring areas where white children could profit by the instructions.\n\nThe above reasons are those submitted to Father Lauzon last year when the matter was being discussed. I submit them to you for consideration.\n\nThank you, Mr. Neary, for the many courtesies you have shown to the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSister M. Eucharis, Mother General\n\nSME:sf\nSeptember 26th, 1949.\n\nRev. Sister M. Eucharis,\nSuperior General,\nSisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary,\n5515 Franklin Avenue,\nLos Angeles 28, California,\nU. S. A.\n\nReverend and Dear Sister:\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant recommending the erection of a consolidated school for the Saanich area.\n\nColonel Neary is absent from the office on business at the present time, but when he returns next week your letter will be brought to his attention.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nSeptember 26th, 1949.\n\nRev. J.C. Lauzon, S.M.M.,\nCatholic Rectory,\nSaanichon, B.C.\n\nDear Father Lauzon:\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th instant suggesting the establishment of a consolidated school for the Saanich area. Colonel Neary is absent from the office at the present time on business, but your communication will be brought to his attention when he returns.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nMajor General Pearkes, V.C., M.P., visited this office a day or two ago and brought up for consideration the following matters:\n\n(1) That Indian high school students failing to pass their year be extended financial assistance to enable them to repeat the year when recommended by the principal of the school.\n\n(2) That a consolidated school be built to replace the small day schools at East Saanich and Tsartlip.\n\nI doubt if much objection could be taken to the suggestion in number 1. I should think, however, that it would be well to have the recommendation of Major Davey in addition to that of the principal concerned.\n\nWith respect to number 2, it will be recalled that Inspector Barry recommended a consolidated school similar to St. Catherines, Duncan, some years ago. Our early experience with St. Catherines, however, was such that the plan for a consolidated school for Saanich was dropped. As the subject has been revived, you might let me have any comments you wish to make following a discussion of the proposal with Major Davey. I should also like to have your views and those of Major Davey with respect to the suggestion contained in number 1.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\nOctober 11, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSaanich Indian Day School\n\nI understand that you have discussed with Mr. Phelan the two letters from Father Lauzon and Sister M. Eucharia concerning the proposed consolidated Indian school in Saanich.\n\nI would welcome an opportunity of discussing these proposals with you.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOctober 3, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nI have read your letter of September 28 to Mr. Arneil and would like to point out to you the following points which I feel should also be raised with Mr. Arneil:\n\n(a) That the recommendation of the principal of the high school should also be supported by a recommendation from the Inspector of Schools for B.C.\n\n(b) That the report card of the student concerned should be submitted to the Department for consideration when the case is being reviewed;\n\n(c) That this exception be made only for pupils who have not been attending provincial schools.\n\nI understand that General Pearkes raised this primarily with regard to Indian pupils who had been attending our own Indian schools and not to Indian pupils who had been attending provincial schools. His argument was that in their first year of high school, such pupils were at a handicap due to the difference in classroom procedures between a one-room Indian school and a large high school with many teachers and classrooms.\n\nI also feel that in such cases of failure it should be made very clear that this will apply only to the first year of such failures, in other words that this failure exception clause would only apply to students in Grade 9.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 16, 1949\n\nMr. Bernard P. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nWe have not received notice regarding Sister M. Noel's application for classification under the 1942 Revised Salary Schedule for Indian Day Teachers.\n\nI realize this adjustment must require considerable amount of time on the part of the Department, but I did not want to delay notifying you in case there has been an oversight.\n\nThank you kindly for your attention regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSister M. Socorro, I.V.M.\n\nSee draft below, please.\nNovember 3, 1949.\n\nReverend Sister M.

A.\n\nReverend and Dear Sister:\n\nI have for answer your letter of September 20 which was answered in part by Mr. Phelan during my absence on an inspection trip of our Indian schools.\n\nI have discussed this matter at some length with our Director, and I intend to present a plan of action to Inspector Davey when he visits Ottawa within the next fortnight.\n\nBecause of the expenditures involved, you can appreciate the need for careful investigation into this request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 3, 1949.\n\nRev. J.C. Lauzon, S.M.M.,\nCatholic Rectory,\nSaanichon, B.C.\n\nDear Father Lauzon:\n\nAs Mr. Phelan has told you, I have been inspecting schools for the past few weeks and have just returned to my office, and I am attempting to answer the piles of correspondence awaiting my attention.\n\nI note that you are very concerned with the establishment of a consolidated school at Saanich and have discussed this matter with the Director. When Inspector Davey visits here within the next fortnight, it is one of the matters which I intend to discuss with him immediately so that a plan of action can be prepared.\n\nYou can rest assured that this matter will be thoroughly investigated and that your survey of school age children will be of great assistance when a decision is reached concerning this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNovember 1, 1949\n\nSr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sr. Neary:\n\nSince I have not received a reply to my letter addressed to you October 16, 1949, I have become more concerned regarding the matter.\n\nSister Mary Noel has not received notification regarding her application for classification under 1949 Revised Salary Schedule for Indian Day Teachers.\n\nI do not mean to be impatient, but I would appreciate very much your kind attention and advise regarding this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6424, file 870-1, part 1)\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to acknowledge yours of Nov. 3rd.\n\nA day or so before I received your letter, Mr. W.S. Arneil, answering a letter that I had sent to Major Davey, told me that the Department was doing all it could to provide school accommodation to all the reserves. But that there are greater needs than ours. But as I pointed out before and as I am doing again in my answer, the need would be very great here also, if we had not offered the use of our church in East Saanich and our parish hall in West Saanich. The Department would have to provide for about 65 pupils with only a class-room large enough for 25 pupils.\n\nI do not mind if the church is used as a school but I would like to see the hall free. It is the only hall that we have and both white and Indians are deprived of it, so that all our parish activities are at a standstill. I have started a C.Y.O among the young Indian people, but it very difficult to run it under the present condition. Yet now that many are coming our of school with a better of education, this society could help very much in keeping the teenagers together.\n\nBut as I told you so often, I want to have a consolidated school for the whole district.\n\nGive my best regards to Major MacKay and Mr. Phelan.\n\nMost sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6424, file 870-5, part 1)\nAs soon as your above noted letter was received at this Office the necessary authority was given to Miss Wadel to get the playground equipment etc., as soon as conveniently possible. However, the difficulty of finding a cleared space to put the swings etc., and use for a playground was encountered. There was a field adjoining the school that had grown up with small brush and blackberry vines which would be quite suitable if cleared. Miss Wadel suggested that she and the pupils clear this field, doing a little each day after school, to which I readily agreed. She has now completed this work and I would like to recommend that we pay Miss Wadel and the pupils $10.00 for doing this work, actually there was about $30 worth done, out of land clearing money. I told Miss Wadel that I was going to recommend this and she said that if they got the money it would be used for all the children at a Christmas party at the school. I have great pleasure in recommending this expenditure and feel that something well worth while has been accomplished at a fraction of the cost we would have to pay had we to hire the work done.\n\nA Voucher for that amount, accompanied by paylists in duplicate is attached hereto.\n\nIndian Affairs.

July 4th 1945\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThere is a discrepancy about the rentals for the \"Saanich Indian Day School\" and the \"Tsartlip Junior Indian Day School\" which needs to be cleared up before the new school year. Briefly the situation is this: from the opening of the \"Saanich Indian Day School\" (on the East Reserve called L.R. #2) till last summer it was agreed between the department and myself that I should receive the sum of $10.00 per month token rental for the new school I had erected. Last summer in my personal interview with you I represented that this sum was rather small and you agreed it should be raised to $20.00 per month the new rate to be effective beginning last September. In regard to the \"Tsartlip Junior Indian Day School\" opened on the West Reserve last Fall, we agreed that the monthly rental would be $10.00 per month payable not to me but to the parish priest Rev. K. Lauzon C.M.M. Through Father Lauzon I now discover that with the exception of one payment covering a few months he has not been receiving any rental at all.\n\nI think the confusion must be due to the department being under the impression you had left the rental of the East Reserve at $10.00 whereas it was raised to $20.00 last summer. I should like to have the matter ironed out to our mutual satisfaction before the Fall term if possible.\n\nYours in Christ,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This was due to an oversight in this office and I am arranging to have a cheque forwarded to you for $100.00 for the balance due for the period September 1st, 1944, to June 30th, 1945. Our files indicate that you have already been paid $100.00 in monthly payments of $10.00.\n\nRegarding the Tsartlip school, our records show that a monthly cheque for $10.00 has been forwarded to you for the period September 1st, 1944 to June 30th, 1945, covering the rental of the original building. The second classroom was opened last September and in January we issued a cheque to Reverend X. Lauzon for $40.00 covering rental of the second classroom for the period September 1st to December 31st, 1944. I am now arranging to have a cheque forwarded to him for $60.00 which covers the balance for the period January 1st to June 30th, 1945. I hope that the above adjustments will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMost Reverend J.C.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nYou will please remember that when the Day school at the Saanich I.R. #2 was opened about three years ago that it was necessary for us to construct two toilets, one for the boys and one for the girls. At that time it was proposed that we also erect one for the Teacher but somehow or other it got overlooked and has not been built since.\n\nI have now received a request from the present Teacher, Rev. Sister Maria Socorra, that a new toilet be erected for her own use and which cannot be used by the Indians.\n\nThis is a reasonable request and one that I have no hesitancy in recommending for your early consideration and approval. Taking the price of the other toilets as a basis of cost of this new one, I estimate that it will entail the expenditure of approximately $15.00. Mitchell & Anderson Lumber Co. in Sidney will be able to build it and then haul it to the reserve and set it up.\n\nWindy advise in this regard as soon as conveniently possible.\n\n[Signature]\n(R.M.

This latter authorization is not understood as the building used as a senior room at Tsartlip school is owned by the Department according to the information we have on file here.\n\nThe attached vouchers would appear to be in order with the exception of No. 621 which, it is considered, should be payable to Bishop Cody as it is understood that Father Lauzon has left Saanichton and may not return. I would suggest that the submission of one voucher each month in favour of Bishop Cody for $30.00 would cover rental of both schools.\n\nD. M.

MacKay,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Major MacKay,\n\nFurther to our conversation regarding a new school to take care of the Indian population on Saanich, I have received another communication from Father Lauzon who, as you know, is keenly interested in having a consolidated school for the Indian children on the various Reservations in Saanich. Father Lauzon tells me that he has been in touch with Mr. Arneill regarding this matter.\n\nFather Lauzon also advises me that there are more than 70 children of school age, and he believes that their educational needs can best be supplied through a consolidated school. The small parish hall which has been used as a classroom appears to be needed for its original purposes. It is hoped that a suitable building can be erected and that emphasis may be placed on vocational training which is particularly needed amongst the Indians.\n\nI do not know whether you have heard from Mr. Arneill. You will no doubt recall that you promised to write him to the effect that interest in a consolidated school for Saanich is being revived. May I assure you that your interest in this matter is greatly appreciated, and I hope that it will be possible to include an item in the estimates to cover the construction of a school in the near future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGeorge R. Pearkes\nOctober 17, 1949.\n\nMajor General G.R. Pearkes, V.C., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nDear General Pearkes:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of October 6th, regarding the representations made by Reverend Father Lauson, O.M.I., that a consolidated Indian school be built to replace the Indian day schools now in operation at East Saanich and Tsartlip.\n\nImmediately following our discussion of this subject, during your visit to this office, I wrote to Mr. Arneil but have not yet received a reply. This is quite understandable as he would, no doubt, wish to have the Inspector of Indian Schools for British Columbia make a survey to determine whether such a school should be provided. As soon as I receive a reply from Mr. Arneil, I will be glad to write to you further on the subject.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nDMM/BM\nOctober 25, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to the Director's letter of September 28th, 1949, in connection with suggestions made by Major General Pearkes, V.C., M.P., regarding educational matters, I am enclosing a memorandum dated October 8th, from District School Inspector Davey, dealing with the two points specifically mentioned by Major General Pearkes.\n\nMy own views in connection with these matters are in line with those of Mr. Davey and it is felt that his memorandum covers the matter fully.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOctober 8, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO INDIAN COMMISSIONER:\n\nI refer to the Director's letter dated September 28th, 1949, in which reference is made to matters brought up for consideration by Major General Pearkes, V.C., M.P.\n\n(1) \"That Indian high school students failing to pass their year be extended financial assistance to enable them to repeat the year when recommended by the Principal of the school.\"\n\nAlthough it has been the general practice of the Department to refuse assistance to enable students to repeat a year's high school work, there have already been departures from this general policy. I do feel, however, that the Department might be somewhat more lenient in its rulings where both the Principal and myself recommend assistance.\n\n(2) \"That a consolidated school be built to replace the small day schools at East Saanich and Tsartlip.\"\n\nThe problem of the most suitable type of school to serve the four reserves at the north end of the Saanich peninsula has concerned me for some time. In the early part of this year I made a visit to the four reserves, namely, Tseycum, Pauquachin, Tsartlip and Tsawout and I attach herewith a rough sketch map showing the location of the reserves and the distances involved. There would be no difficulty in having a bus operate so as to serve these reserves and had it not been for the experience at St. Catherine's and several other points where we have Indian children attending Provincial schools by bus, I would undoubtedly have recommended the establishment of a consolidated school. I find, however, that wherever the teacher is removed from contact with the home, there is a falling off in the regularity of attendance; in fact, this problem becomes so acute that the benefits of consolidation are lost. One factor appears to be of paramount importance in the successful operation of our Indian schools, that is continued contact between the teacher and the home.\nYou will remember that we have two schools established in this area, one on the Tsartlip Reserve and another on the Tsawout Reserve (East Saanich). The operation of both these schools has been reasonably successful. On the two remaining reserves, Pauquachin (Cole Bay) and Tseycum, the school population is not sufficient to justify the establishment of separate schools and consequently, a taxi is now being hired to transport the pupils from these two reserves to the Tsartlip School. How successful this will be remains to be seen but in view of the very small number of school age children, there appears to be no alternative.\n\nI would recommend that the new school on the Tsartlip Reserve be of two rooms, preferably of such plan that the construction of an addition at a later date would present no difficulty. This would serve the three reserves on the west side of the peninsula.\n\nI am convinced that we should maintain our school on the East Saanich Reserve for the present time. The distance which a bus would have to travel from the East Saanich Reserve in a circuitous route to serve the Union Bay and Cole Bay reserves, would be 9.5 miles as measured by car speedometer. This means that the bus would have to leave the East Saanich Reserve at about 8:15 in order to arrive at the Tsartlip School at the usual opening time. Although this would present no difficulty in a white community, our experience indicates that the necessity of pupils catching a bus at 8:15 would result in a high rate of absenteeism.\n\nIn June of 1948 a tabulation was made of the school population on the four points concerned. This indicated a school age population of 152 on the three reserves on the west side of the peninsula, however, the school enrolment and attendance indicates that there are a large number of children who are apparently not available for attendance at a Day school. In fact, in the 1947-48 year the enrolment never exceeded 39.\n\nThe school should be located on the Tsartlip Reserve, so as to serve the two other reserves on the West side of the peninsula. A site adjacent to the existing one-room Department-owned school would be the most suitable location.\n\nThe school should be provided with a teachersage, for although this area is thickly populated for a rural community, the teachers\nwould undoubtedly have difficulty in finding boarding places within reasonable distance of the school.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Oct 1949   | To rental of the Saanich Indian Day School for the month of October, 1949 | 20.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

F. MacKinnon, reports the children bright, academically and that they have become much more presentable and clean since School started. The Anaham Lake Indians who form part of the Ulkatcho Band are becoming increasingly noisy about a school for their children and I consider it would be a worthwhile idea for the Department to run another 4 months School at this point. Mr. MacKinnon should teach at Anaham Lake after the school closes at Ulkatcho since the Anaham Lake Indians are better off and do not leave home during the summer months. A separate report has gone in on this project.\n\nWm Christie\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRecommendation:\n\nI would recommend that if the Department can find about $215.00 of the suggested $500.00 during the present Fiscal Year and the balance for salary and rent to the end of June out of the 1941-42 vote, the experiment of a temporary seasonal school be tried at Anahim Lake.\n\nThe Archbishop of Vancouver should I believe be informed of the intention, should the school be decided on, and his approval of the teacher suggested obtained.\n\nIf this temporary school prove a success this year as I have no doubt it would were Mr MacKinnon named as teacher, I would recommend that it be continued as a seasonal school, the exact months of operation to be decided later.\n\nShould the school be approved for this year, may I ask that the Indian Agent at Bella Coola be instructed to make the necessary arrangements at a very early date. He may have some difficulty in going in to the school. The Post Office address of the proposed school would be Anahim Lake P.O., B.C. Mail arrives there twice a month I understand.\n\nP.O.Box 444\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 15, 1941.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSummary of Non Indian Children\n\n| Boys | Girls | Total |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| Of School Age | 7 | 8 | 15 |\n| Under School Age | 5 | 1 | 6 |\n\nReligion:\n\nI understand that the whole of the Indian children belong to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe visiting Priest comes from the Cariboo Indian Residential School once or twice a year. None of the children are being educated at the Cariboo School or as far as I can learn anywhere else.\n\nTeachers Available:\n\nShould a seasonal school be established at Anahim Lake I presume that His Excellency Archbishop Duke of Vancouver would be asked to nominate a teacher.\n\nMr Colin F. MacKinnon, now teaching the Ulkatcho Seasonal Indian Day School appears from all accounts to be making a success of his work. The Department is aware of his qualifications, and the fact that the Ulkatcho School will be in operation till February 28th 1941 only.\n\nMr C.F. MacKinnon now receives $90.00 per month and would I believe be willing to teach a seasonal school at Anahim Lake for the four months March 1st to June 30th 1941 at the same rate.\n\nProbable Cost of Seasonal School:\n\nConsidering a temporary seasonal school for four months March 1st to June 30th 1941 the main items of cost which come to mind now are as follows:\n\n- Salary of teacher at $90.00 per month: $360.00\n- Rent of Dowling House mentioned above for four months at $5.00 per month: $20.00\n- Lumber for desks and cost of construction: $50.00\n- Simple box heater for schoolroom: $25.00\n- Lumber for and section of two toilets: $20.00\n- Cost of fuel March and April (Perhaps): $10.00\n- Two pieces of Blackboard, or materials such as five ply wood and special surface blackboard paint, which for country districts like this would be better than expensive blackboard: $10.00\n\nTotal: $485.00\n\nThe above is only a rough estimate and does not include freight, but I believe that a sum of not more than $500.00 should be available if this temporary seasonal school is to be authorized.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 15, 1941.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nYesterday I had a conference in my office with Mrs Lehman, R.N., and obtained some valuable information with regard to the Indian children at Anahim Lake.\n\nMrs Lehman was before her marriage Miss Jane Bryant, and is as you know our Field Matron in the Ulkatchot and Anahim Lake districts.\n\nI have worked out a brief survey report on the Anahim Lake area for the information of the Department, and have included all the information given to me by Mrs Lehman, and added my own recommendations.\n\nMay I suggest that a copy of this Anahim Lake Survey (Educational) Report be sent to the Indian Agent at Bella Coola and that he be asked to forward without delay his comments on my suggestions.\n\nAn early decision by the Department is most important as Mr. C.F. MacInnon completes his work at the Ulkatcho Seasonal Indian Day School on February 28th 1941.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nPurpose of Survey:\n\nThis survey has been prepared with respect to the educational needs of the Indian children living at or near Anahim Lake, in the Bella Coola Agency.\n\nA suggestion has been made by Mr. Indian Agent Christie, of Bella Coola, that a seasonal school be established at Anahim Lake, and he has been asked for further particulars.\n\nAs Mr. Christie may have some difficulty in obtaining the required information, owing to the difficulty of a journey into Anahim Lake from Bella Coola, the following information, which is only of an approximate nature, has been outlined in the hope that it may be of some assistance to you and the Department.\n\nProcedure Adopted:\n\nMrs. Lehman R.M., who before her marriage was Miss Jane Bryant, our Field Matron in this area called on me in Vancouver, January 14, 1941, and was most helpful.\n\nMrs. Lehman was not certain of the names of some of the children or of their ages, though the information is no doubt fairly correct. This information has been put together in the form of a survey report, but it should be understood that I have not visited the area myself and have no personal knowledge of the people.\n\nList of Indian Children living near Anahim Lake:\n\n**CAPOOSE**\n- Boy Ogie Age 13\n- Boy Jimmy 12\n\nThe mother Josephine Capoose is a member of the Ulkatcho Band. She lives with Louis Squinas a member of the same Band. Louis Squinas's wife lives at Kluskas in the Stuart Lake Agency with another man and has children by him.\n\nThe children mentioned above Ogie and Jimmy are, I understand, illegitimate, but may I suppose be considered members of the Ulkatcho Band. They would live near Chief Squinas's house.\n\n**CASIEL**\n- Girl Lena Age 15\n- Girl Theresa 12\n- Boy Albert 12\n- Girl Minnie 9\n- Girl Vivian 4\n\nThese children live at Chief Squinas's house at Anahim Lake.\nList of Children Continued:\n\n**WILLIAMS**\n\nBoy Thomas Age 13\n\nThe mother and father are dead. This boy lives with and has been adopted by Chief Squinas.\n\n**THOMAS SQUINAS (son of Chief)**\n\n| Boy    | Harry | Age 14 |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Girl   | Annie | 13     |\n| Girl   | Alla  | 12     |\n| Girl   | Susie | 9      |\n| Girl   | Liza  | 4      |\n| Girl   | ?     | 1      |\n\nThese children live about 3 miles from Chief Squinas's house but this distance is over ice of Anahim Lake. They would ride to school over ice.\n\n**MADELEINE SULIN (widow)**\n\n| Boy    | Billy | Age 4  |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Boy    | Dick  | 3      |\n\n**SAM SULIN**\n\n| Girl   | Ellen (?) | Age 14 |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| Girl   | ?         | 13     |\n| Girl   | ?         | 9      |\n| Boy    | John      | 6      |\n\nThese children would live near school if established as suggested.\n\n**EDNA**\n\nGirl ? Age 7\n\nThis child and probably her parents have moved from Redstone to Anahim Lake and lives with SAM SULIN, shown above.\n\n**SUMMARY OF INDIAN CHILDREN**\n\n| Boys | Girls | Total |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| Of School Age | 6 | 10 | 16 |\n| Under School Age | 2 | 3 | 5 |\n\n8 13 21\n\nIndian Children Available for School:\n\nThe number of Indian children available for school would be 16, and only one child on the average would become available each year to take the place of the two reaching maximum school age on the average.\n\nAttendance could no doubt be very good for some years and an average of at least 10 might be expected.\nLocation of Proposed School:\n\nThere are two houses which might be rented for a school. One is a log cabin about 16 feet by 24 feet. This is owned by Stanley Dowling, a white man, who is Postmaster at Anahim Lake.\n\nThe above house is only about one year old and it has been used as a store. I understand that the owner might rent it for the sum of $5.00 per month. There are three windows on one side and one on the other. This house will be referred to as the Dowling house.\n\nThe second possible house for a school is a store house belonging to the Hudson's Bay Co. at Anahim Lake. This H.B.C. store house is used by Paul Kresenmuk, though he does not make any great use of it. It is an old building and will be referred to as the H.B.C. house.\n\nIf it is decided to operate either a regular or seasonal Indian school at Anahim Lake, consideration should be given to the renting of the Dowling House, as it is obvious that it would be the best available building for a school house.\n\nThe location is quite close to Chief Squinas's house at Anahim Lake.\n\nAccommodation for Teacher:\n\nThere would be no difficulty with regard to finding accommodation for the teacher, who could no doubt board and room at Mrs Bowser's within half a mile of the Dowling house mentioned above.\n\nPeriod of Instruction at Proposed School:\n\nI understand that many of the Indians, including some parents of children mentioned above, live at or near Anahim Lake during the months of November, December, January, and February. From March to June some of the Indians are away from their winter homes engaged in trapping mainly muskrats.\n\nThough some of the parents are away for these spring months the people are so anxious for education that the children would remain at Anahim Lake with older members of the same family or with friends and attend school in March, April, May, and perhaps June.\n\nThe better time for a seasonal school would no doubt be for the five months November 1st to March 31st, but it could be given a trial from March 1st 1941 to June 30th 1941 if the Department had any available funds as the Indians seeing the success of the Ulkatcho Seasonal Indian Day School appear anxious to have education this year.\n\nA full eight or nine month school would not be probably a success, I am informed, for the Indians would become restless.\nNon Indian Children:\n\nWhile the fact that a number of Non Indian children are living near Anahim Lake should be noted here for record the establishment of an Indian seasonal school should in my opinion be dependent on the number of the Indian children available alone.\n\nI understand that the below mentioned \"white\" children have no Provincial school but that some at least are being educated by the Provincial Department of Education through their Correspondence system.\n\n**DORSEY**\n- Girl ? Age 13\n- Girl ? 11\n\nThese children live at Anahim Lake.\n\n**CHRISTENSEN**\n- Girl ? Age 13\n- Girl ? 14\n- Boy ? 11\n\nThe mother in this case is well educated and I understand the children are taking the Correspondence Lessons. They live some five miles from the point at Anahim Lake suggested as the location of the proposed school.\n\n**DORSEY**\n- Boy ? Age 6\n- Boy ? 5\n- Boy ? 4\n- Boy ? ?\n\nThese children only one of whom is of school age live some six miles from the suggested location of the school.\n\n**HOLTS**\n- Boy ? Age 11\n\nThis boy would live at Dorsey's if a school were available.\n\n**SMITH**\n- Boy ? Age 15\n- Girl ? 14\n- Girl ? 11\n- Boy ? 5\n- Boy ? 5 (twins)\n\nThese children at the moment live some 15 miles from the suggested site of the school. They would no doubt move nearer in and live with \"white\" people were a school established to which they might go. At the moment the three older children come for the school term to Vancouver and board with their grandmother.\n\n**BATIST DESTER OR WOODS**\n\nBatist is Non Indian. He was married in a legal manner to Lucy Dagg also a Non Indian, but is now living with an Indian Willie Sulin at Fish Trap some 15 miles from Anahim Lake.\n\n- Girl Annie Age 15\n- Girl Edith Age 1\n- Girl Josephine 14 Child of Willie Sulin\n- Boy ? 12\n- Boy Mac 8\n- Boy Billy 6\n\nChildren of Batist Dester, and Lucy.\n\nThese children might or might not move in nearer to Anahim Lake.\nSummary of Non-Indian Children\n\n| Boys | Girls | Total |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| Of School Age | 7 | 8 | 15 |\n| Under School Age | 5 | 1 | 6 |\n| **Total** | **12** | **9** | **21** |\n\nReligion:\n\nI understand that the whole of the Indian children belong to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe visiting Priest comes from the Cariboo Indian Residential School once or twice a year.

MacKinnon now receives $90.00 per month and would I believe be willing to teach a seasonal school at Anahim Lake for the four months March 1st to June 30th 1941 at the same rate.\n\nProbable Cost of Seasonal School:\n\nConsidering a temporary seasonal school for four months March 1st to June 30th 1941 the main items of cost which come to mind now are as follows:\n\n- Salary of teacher at $90.00 per month $360.00\n- Rent of dwelling house mentioned above for four months at $5.00 per month $20.00\n- Lumber for desks and cost of construction $50.00\n- Simple box heater for schoolroom $25.00\n- Lumber for and erection of two toilets $20.00\n- Cost of fuel March and April (perhaps) $10.00\n- Two pieces of Blackboard, etc materials such as five ply wood and special surface blackboard paint, which for country districts like this would be better than expensive blackboard $10.00\n\n$495.00\n\nThe above is only a rough estimate and does not include freight, but I believe that a sum of not more than $500.00 should be available if this temporary seasonal school is to be authorized.\nRecommendation:\n\nI would recommend that if the Department can find about $215.00 of the suggested $500.00 during the present Fiscal Year and the balance for salary and rent to the end of June out of the 1941-42 vote, the experiment of a temporary seasonal school be tried at Anahim Lake.\n\nThe Archbishop of Vancouver should I believe be informed of the intention, should the school be decided on, and his approval of the teacher suggested obtained.\n\nIf this temporary school prove a success this year as I have no doubt it would were Mr MacInnon named as teacher, I would recommend that it be continued as a seasonal school, the exact months of operation to be decided later.\n\nShould the school be approved for this year, may I ask that the Indian Agent at Bella Coola be instructed to make the necessary arrangements at a very early date. He may have some difficulty in going in to the school.\n\nThe Post Office address of the proposed school would be Anahim Lake P.O., B.C. Mail arrives there twice a month I understand.\n\nP.O. Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJanuary 15, 1941.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI note from your report for the month of January that you have received inquiries from the Indians regarding the establishment of a school at Anaham Lake. In January, 1941, the Department received a letter from Commissioner MacKay in which he enclosed a report regarding a survey of the Anaham Lake area that has been made by Inspector Barry. The matter was carefully considered at that time but, as no provision had been made in the current year's appropriation for a school at this point, it was impossible to give favourable consideration to it. The same situation prevails at the present time; namely, that it was impossible to provide in our appropriation funds that would be necessary to operate a school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Wm. Christie,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nBELLA COOLA AGENCY\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1942.\n\nThe Agent has been getting enquiries from the Indians at Ansham Lake as to whether there is a possibility of their boys and girls being provided with school facilities and a request is going forward to the Indian Commissioner in this regard.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing Inspector Barry's survey report on the Anaham Lake area.\n\nNo provision was made in the current year's appropriation, nor have funds been provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41, for the operation of a school at this point. Under these circumstances I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given at the present time to the opening of a seasonal school at Anaham Lake.\n\nIndian Agent Christie should bring this matter to our attention when preparing his estimates for the fiscal year 1942-43.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith Inspector Barry's School Survey Report on the Anaham Lake area, which was undertaken as a result of a request from Mr. Indian Agent Christie that a seasonal school be established at Anaham Lake for period of four months commencing March 1st; the intention being to have Mr. C. F. MacKinnon take up the work at this point on completion of the term at Ulkatcho, which terminates on February 26th.\n\nNo provision has been made for a seasonal school at Anaham Lake and, unless funds to the extent of $500.00 are available, no action can be taken in respect to same this fiscal year, nor in fiscal year 1941-42 unless the necessary provision is made.\n\nFrom Inspector Barry's survey it would appear that some 16 children would be available to attend the proposed school, which for this term would only operate for four months, following which the question of the establishment of a seasonal school on a permanent basis could be considered.\n\nShould funds be available, I would recommend that a seasonal school be operated at Anaham Lake as proposed, and that Mr. C. F. MacKinnon at Ulkatcho be authorized to take up his duties as teacher following the close of the Ulkatcho School on February 26th.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBella Coola, B.C.,\nJanuary 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour file 15/2/9699\nRe Proposed School Anaham Lake\n\nYour letter of the 21st instant is acknowledged enclosing copy of Captain Barry's educational survey for Anaham Lake District.\n\nThe Report is I consider complete and accurate with the exception of certain ages and names of some of the children which do not agree with that in my census book, but there is no substantial error which might decide either for or against this project.\n\nLocation of Proposed School\n\nIt is agreed that the Dowling house is the best available building and slightly more central.\n\nPeriod of Instruction\n\nIt will in my opinion be difficult to get two teachers for part time schools at Anaham Lake and Ulkatcho which leaves very little choice as to the months these schools shall be operated. There is no question that from November 1 to the end of February is the best time for the Ulkatcho School, and from then on to the end of June at Anaham Lake. Another point is that the Ulkatcho children stay in the village while school is on but some of the Anaham Lake children including Whites may have in some cases to come four or five miles on horseback and the days are getting longer and warmer from March on. Another consideration is that it is to the advantage of the Department to have a school teacher like Mr. MacKinnon at Ulkatcho during the winter months to more or less look after things and especially the children.\nProbable Cost\n\nThe estimated cost of $500.00 for operation of this school for four months including lumber for construction of desks, blackboard, labour, and freight should be approximately correct. The box heater will not be necessary this year at least as Stanley Dowling agreed to rent the building for $5.00 including use of a heater.\n\nRecommendation\n\nA gratifying report on the Ulkatcho School was received from Mr. MacKinnon in which it is noted that five pupils did not miss a day which is a record for any day School in this Agency and the attendance averaged 12.36 out of a possible 18. Some of the pupils started late but apparently attended very regularly thereafter. At Anaham Lake I expect the attendance to be equally satisfactory and it is remarkable that these Indians have expressed so keen a desire for education. Last fall Torway Squinas asked me to send him some school books with which to teach his children but I do not know how much success he had as his education is very limited and he has more or less been self-taught.\n\nIn view of these circumstances and the fact that this Band has cost the Department nothing for Education up to 1939-40, I strongly recommend that a Seasonal School is started for the Ulkatcho Indians at Anaham Lake from March 1 to June 30 and that the Department recommend the appointment of Mr. C. F. MacKinnon as teacher on the termination of his duties at the Ulkatcho School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nWO:MC\nDecember 30, 1942.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are sixty (60) Roman Catholic Indian children of school age on the Anaham Reserve, Williams Lake Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided;\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 166, 1942-43, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school on the Anaham Reserve.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established on the Anaham Reserve, Williams Lake Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 95, 1927, to be known as \"The Anaham Roman Catholic Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nExtract from Acting Indian Agent Christie's report on the school situation in the Williams Lake Indian Agency.\n\nANAHAM BAND\n\nThe Anaham Band with a population of 302 is the largest Band in this Agency. The Reserve on which their village is built contains some of the finest cultivated land in the Chilcotin, all in one block. The Anaham Indian village is situated on the main highway, 70 miles West of Williams Lake, and is supplied with a domestic water system. Should a school be established here, it is quite possible that a number of children from the Stone Reserve, 12 miles distant, might be able to make arrangements to attend.\n\nThe Church and Priest House on this Reserve are also available for school purposes, but the Community Hall, a log building 22' x 40', would be more satisfactory. This building will require the following material to make it comfortable, and the Indians have promised to contribute the labour:\n\nSchool Building\n\n- 2,000' shiplap for floor and ceiling ................. $50.00\n- 1,500' shiplap to line walls inside .................. 37.50\n- 6 rolls of Kraft sheathing paper for floors and walls @ $1.50 ............... 9.00\n- 2,000' dressed lumber for seats, desks, cupboards, etc. @ $25.00 ............ 50.00\n- Nails .................................................. 10.00\n- Blackboard material .................................. 20.00\n- 1 large heating stove .................................. 30.00\n- Freight .................................................. 25.00\n- Labour free .............................................. $231.50\n\nTeacherage (for two teachers)\n\n- 2 beds, springs, and mattresses ....................... $50.00\n- Cooking utensils, wash basin, brooms, etc. .......... 40.00\n- 1 gasoline lamp & 2 coal oil lamps ..................... 12.00\n- Cook stove ............................................... 35.00\n- Heater ................................................... 15.00\n\n$152.00\n\n$383.50\n| Name          | Age | Sex | Name     | Age | Sex |\n|---------------|-----|-----|----------|-----|-----|\n| Pigeon Albert |     |     | Randolph | 1   | M   |\n| Johnny Edward Joseph | 9   | M   | Aggie    | 4   | F   |\n| Irene May     | 7   | F   |          |     |     |\n| Hance Johnny Douglas | 16  | M   | Catherine| 5   | F   |\n| Christine     | 13  | F   | Augustine| 2   | M   |\n| Herbert       | 11  | M   |          |     |     |\n| Ernest        | 9   | M   |          |     |     |\n\n78 - 47\n## LIST OF CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE & UNDER\n\n### ANAHAM Band\n\n| Name            | Age | Sex | Name   | Age | Sex |\n|-----------------|-----|-----|--------|-----|-----|\n| JOHNNY WILLIE   |     |     | Augie  | 4   | M   |\n|                 |     |     | Hilda  | 2   | F   |\n| MURPHY          |     |     | Arthur | 4   | M   |\n| Catherine       | 16  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Edna            | 14  | F   | Wilfred| 3   | M   |\n| Rosie           | 12  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Aline           | 11  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Prosper         | 9   | M   |        |     |     |\n| Jimmy           | 8   | M   |        |     |     |\n| JACK            |     |     | Ignace | 6   | M   |\n| Tommy           | 15  | M   |        |     |     |\n| Marguerite      | 9   | F   |        |     |     |\n| Emilia          | 14  | F   |        |     |     |\n| JEFF JOSEPH     |     |     | Christina| 3 | F   |\n| Casimer         | 12  | M   |        |     |     |\n| JEFF TOMMY      |     |     |        |     |     |\n| Augustine       | 14  | M   |        |     |     |\n| ALEXANDER WILLIE|     |     | Narcisse| 5 | M   |\n| Margaret        | 11  | F   |        |     |     |\n| FRANK           |     |     |        |     |     |\n| Henry           | 16  | M   |        |     |     |\n| Justine         | 14  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Marie           | 13  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Catherine       |     |     |        |     |     |\n| GILPIN FREDDY   |     |     | Leadpre| 5   | M   |\n| Melanie         | 13  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Celestine       | 12  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Davon           | 11  | M   |        |     |     |\n| Leonard         | 9   | M   |        |     |     |\n| Julianna        | 7   | F   |        |     |     |\n| ELKINS JOE      |     |     | Catherine| 6 | F   |\n| Louise          | 14  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Marvin          | 12  | M   | Mary   | 4   | F   |\n| Jack            | 11  | M   | John   | 1   | M   |\n| Adam            | 10  | M   |        |     |     |\n| Justine         | 8   | M   |        |     |     |\n| BOYD GEORGE     |     |     |        |     |     |\n| Jack            | 15  | M   |        |     |     |\n| CHARLIE LITTLE  |     |     |        |     |     |\n| Mary            | 14  | F   |        |     |     |\n| SAM JOHNNY      |     |     | Duncan | 4   | M   |\n| Geneva          | 15  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Matilda         | 13  | F   |        |     |     |\n| Dave            | 12  | M   |        |     |     |\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Anaham Band is the largest one in the Williams Lake Agency. The reserve on which their village is built contains some of the finest cultivated land in the Chilcotin District. The village is situated on the main highway 70 miles west of Williams Lake and is supplied with a domestic water system.\n\nAll the Indians of this band are members of the Catholic Church. There is a community hall belonging to the Church which can be used for school purposes, although it may be necessary to expend about $200.00 for material to make it more comfortable. The Indians have agreed to contribute the labour free of charge.\n\nIn view of the information outlined above, I believe it would be advisable to open a school on this reserve and, in order to comply with Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, an Order-in-Council is required.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 7th ultimo and my reply of the 2nd instant, in connection with the establishment of a day school on the Anaham Reserve. Order-in-Council No. P.C. SS has recently been passed authorizing the establishment of this school.\n\nAs funds are available in our current year's appropriation, you are authorized to expend an amount of $383.50 for material and labour in making repairs to the building to be used for school purposes and also the building to be used for a teacher's residence. The sum mentioned is the amount that Indian Agent Christie stated in his letter of November 17 would be required. You forwarded this letter to us under cover of your communication of the 7th ultimo. In forwarding the accounts you should attach copy of your purchase order and these accounts should reach here before the end of March. I am not certain, from either Indian Agent Christie's letter or yourself, whether you desire this school operated on a yearly basis or as a seasonal school. You might let me know later regarding your suggestion in this regard and at the same time intimate what salary you consider should be paid. I understand from your letter that it is not your intention to open this school until about June 1, 1943.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 160-2-1\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of January 15th, 1943, regarding the establishment of an Indian Day School on Anaham Indian Reserve, Williams Lake Agency.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to advise that an Order has been placed for the materials required to make the necessary repairs and alterations to the buildings that are to be used for a classroom and teacher's residence. It is expected that the buildings will be ready well before the commencement of the new school term. Mr. Christie has also been instructed to purchase the furnishings for the teacher's residence listed in his letter of November 17th, a copy of which was forwarded to the Department with my letter of December 7th.\n\nI would recommend that this School be operated on a yearly basis from October 1st to June 30th, and that the teacher's salary be at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with further reference to the establishment of an Indian day school on the Anaham Indian Reserve. It is noted that you recommend a salary for the teacher at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month and provision will be made for this payment. As I stated recently in my letter to you regarding the Alexis Creek School, the academic year for 1943-44 will commence on September 1, 1943, and I, therefore, presume the Anaham Reserve School will open on the same date. You should consult the Church authorities with a view to securing a qualified teacher. It is very desirable that a capable teacher be secured to open this school. The salary of $100.00 a month, plus bonus, should be fairly attractive.\n\nI trust you will find it possible to forward the accounts covering the cost of the repairs and the furnishings in time to have them paid from the current year's appropriation.\n\nR.A.

Next year they hope to take over the school at Redstone if it is in accordance with the wishes of the Department.\n\nI wish to thank you for your kind cooperation and sympathetic understanding in this matter in the interest of the little Indian children.\n\nWith kind regards, I beg to remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nW.

However, we are now in receipt of staff questionnaires from two Sisters, namely, Sister Mary St. Stanislaus and Sister Mary of the Angels, in which they state that they began duties on October 1, 1944, and they are being placed on the pay-list. As these Sisters are members of a religious community, there is a regulation providing that no income tax will be deducted from their salary of $100 a month. However, in this event no bonus is paid them. I thought you would like to have this information, in order that there may be no misunderstanding.\n\nR.A.

As the above teachers are members of a religious community, no income tax deductions should be made, nor should bonus be paid. Staff questionnaires will reach you shortly. I enclose copy of letter of appointment.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nEDUCATION:\n\nThe Caribou Indian Residential School opened on September 1st and the Anaham Indian Day School on September 4th, 1945. The return of the pupils to the Residential School was much better this year. It was expected that there would have been very poor attendance at the Anaham Indian Day School during September due to the fact that most of the Indians were still having away from the main Reserve, but a special effort was made to get their children back in time and practically all the pupils who attended last year are now back.\n\nThere are now fourteen pupils in the senior room and they show a very keen competitive spirit. Sr. Mary of the Angels, teacher of the senior room, visited St. Mary's school at Mission last year and saw the Pro-rec work, and now has her pupils started on this type of physical education.\n\nDuring the Indian Commissioner's visit, a site was chosen for a new school on this Reserve, and, as soon as it is possible to get a representative meeting, the Indians will be asked to surrender this land to the Department for school purposes.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has not yet found a teacher for the Alexis Creek Day School, but Fr. Hennessy will, in all probability, fill for the winter months, i.e., November to March. With the erection of a school and living quarters, it may be possible to get the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King to supply a teacher for this school next year.\n\nIt was thought that there might be great difficulty in getting new pupils for the Cariboo Indian Residential School this season due to the non-payment of Family Allowance to pupils attending Residential Schools, and, although the principal advises me that he is ten pupils short of the number provided for by the Department in the grant, there\n\n(over)\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING MARCH 31st, 1945, ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAnaham Indian Day School: The attendance at this school has been quite good for a start, and it is expected that when the family allowance comes into operation it will be an added inducement to Indian parents to make arrangements for most of their children to attend regularly. Already some of the Indians who live on the meadows are making arrangements to build houses on the Anaham Indian Reserve No. 1 to enable the children to attend school. The Missionary Sisters to Christ the King, who are teaching this school, are very competent and are doing good work. Clothes have been made up by the children under the supervision of the Sister Superior out of used Army clothing.\n\nThe relationship between the children and the Sisters is very good and every night the Sisters' home is full of children. With the erection of a suitable school building, which should include a fairly large club room, much good work will be accomplished by the Sisters on the Reserve outside of School hours. Building material is becoming more plentiful and I would suggest that immediate attention is given to planning a suitable, modern school building for this reserve, including accommodation for the Sisters and a dispensary.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nDr. Pomp is leaving Williams Lake on July 15th, 1945 and sent his resignation to the Department. Dr. L. E. Avery, Orillia, Ontario, older brother of Dr. Avery now assisting Dr. Baker at Quesnel, will arrive at Williams Lake on or before that date and a recommendation has gone forward that he receive the Indian grant.\n\nIt is quite clear, however, that a full time doctor is required in this agency for Indian work. All that is being done at present is of an emergency nature, where a patient has to be brought to hospital. A portable X-ray should also be provided and also equipment for testing eyes so that clinics can be held at the reserves, when all the Indians are home, such as during the periodic visits of the Priest.\n\nSister Mary St Paul, R.N., Anaham Reserve, is doing very good work without any co-operation from the visiting doctor, and I would suggest that when a new school building is erected on this reserve, that a small hospital is provided as a preventorium for T.B. children of this agency with a few beds for emergency cases. The small hospital at Alexis Creek and the services of a nurse there could then be dispensed with, since, even with a resident doctor at Alexis Creek, there is no X-ray or other equipment to do anything but a minor operation.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR JUNE QUARTER, 1945 - WILLIAMS LAKE.\n\nThe Anaham Indian Day school was inspected by Mr. T. S. Carter, Provincial School Inspector, and the Department will have received a copy of his report which I think is quite good for the past year. Most of the criticism the inspector had to offer was regarding the building and equipment, but I think the Department will realize that a very good beginning has been made and that the attendance, which will undoubtedly increase with the application of the Family Allowance, was very good and consistent throughout the year and justifies the erection of a modern building as soon as conditions permit. I am of the opinion that the Inspector has been rather conservative in his grading of the teachers, especially in regards personality and health.\n\nWm. Christie.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 1, 1945.\n\nMajor D. H. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 26th ultimo, you may purchase playground\nequipment for the Alexis Creek and Anaham Lake\nIndian Day Schools, at a total cost of $26.75.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter of January 22nd with reference to the supply of playground equipment for the Alexis Creek and Anahim Indian Day Schools at a cost of $26.75.\n\nIf funds are available, the application is recommended for approval.\n\nD.M.

The junior room are making some progress although very few of them know much English. The teacher has been trying to get them to sing but they are still rather shy. A sewing machine is urgently required for Domestic Science.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nGeneral;\n\nA rather interesting incident occurred in connection with the Anaham Day School. Upon the teacher asking how many had a bath during the week-end, one boy who had answered in the negative, asked to get out about 11 a.m. He did not return to school until 2:00 p.m. and upon the teacher asking the reason, he informed her that he had gone for a bath and clean clothes.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAM'S LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER, 1944\n\nEducation:\n\nThe Anaham Indian Day School opened on October 2nd with an attendance of about 40 pupils although some had not yet returned from their meadows. The School was visited by Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, during his visit to the Agency and also by Mr. MacArthur, Provincial School Inspector for the district, who happened to be in the vicinity and who was favourably impressed with the teachers. Major MacKay also visited the Redstone Day school which opened on November 1st and Father Hennessey arrived before we left to get everything ready for the opening. The Cariboo Indian Residential School was also visited accompanied by the Indian Commissioner.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nThere are forty-seven pupils attending Anaham Indian Day School, an increase of six over last year. There are still sixteen children of school age from this Reserve who are not attending school, and the parents of these children have had their Family Allowances cut off on this account. One hesitates to take any further action on account of the fact that most of the Indians are back on their meadows feeding cattle or trapping. On the whole, I think the attendance is very good, one child having a perfect attendance for the quarter with an average attendance for those on the register of approximately 85 per cent.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nAGENTS REPORT FOR QUARTER ENDING JUNE 30, 1946.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nThe Anaham Indian Day School had a fairly successful year with approximately 75% attendance of those on the register during this quarter. The whole Reserve moved out to Riske Creek for the week ending June 22nd, to take in the stampede, taking the children with them and I am afraid there is nothing much can be done about this since it is about the only entertainment that really appeals to the Indians in this Agency.\n\nThe Sisters teaching school here are, I consider, doing excellent work and it is hoped that better facilities will be provided in the near future with the erection of a new school building.\n\nWm.

In view of the fact that we have spent close to $30,000.00 in the last two years to help Indian people in that very location and have brought there, the Sisters of Christ the King to look after the School and that they are living there under restricted conditions so much so, that I fear the Mother may call them away. I plead with you to build that School this summer.\n\nI understand that the lumber can easily be obtained from our Agency Sawmill at a very considerable saving, and I hope that your promise to me will give a higher priority to the building of this School, due to the circumstances I mentioned above.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nW.

I recently discussed this matter with Major Mackay and he suggested that I write to you with regard to this school.\n\nIt is presumed that a two room day school is required at this place.

It would perhaps be advisable however to leave the matter in abeyance until we are definitely advised what amount will be available for new construction in British Columbia in the 1948-49 fiscal year. If it is apparent that new construction at Ansham should be left in abeyance Mr. Christie will be requested to investigate and report on the repairs and improvements which might be carried out to the present building.\n\nW.S.

Last summer when Archbishop Duke visited the Department, I assured him that an amount would be included in our next estimates for the construction of a school at Anaham. In view of this assurance, it will be necessary to go ahead with the construction of this school this summer. Under separate cover, I have arranged to forward to you a set of specifications and drawings for our two-room Indian day school with attached teachers' residence. This is similar to the building which we are erecting at Chenail on the St. Regis Reserve and also to that now being built at Lennox Island. The only difference from the Lennox Island School is that there the teachers' quarters have been extended to provide additional accommodation for a nurse.\n\nI hope that this explains the situation and that arrangements can be made to proceed with the construction of this school this summer. I would suggest that either you or Inspector Davey visit the Archbishop and discuss with him the plans which we are forwarding.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Attendance during the month of September is usually very poor due to the fact that the majority of the families are absent from the village cutting hay. This condition was accentuated this year due to the very wet weather. Inspector Davey is of the opinion that it is usually poor practice to change the normal school calendar for any particular school, but the conditions on this particular reserve are so unusual and attendance during the month of September is so poor that he believes an experiment at this point would be justified.\n\nThe Indians on this reserve must of necessity be away from the reserve during the greater part of September in order to harvest the hay crop on their meadows which are located at a considerable distance from the reserve and it is impossible for the children to attend the Anaham school when the families are away at the meadows. Unfortunately we have no record of the previous attendance at the Anaham school during the month of September for previous years but Inspector Davey believes that an inspection of these would indicate that attendance is extremely poor during this month.\n\nW.S.

However, we are extremely reluctant to give this authority. It has been found in the past that Indians are only too prone to criticize our educational system. Any variations from the normal procedures followed in provincial schools are apt to be the subject of adverse comment, even though such variations may be caused directly by their own customs and habits. It would seem that even though the attendance at the Anaham Day School is low during September, it is not low enough to warrant a change in the normal school calendar. However, we will expect to hear further from you concerning this matter.\n\nBernard F.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nMr. Wm. Christie,\nIndian Agent,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Christie:\n\nYour letter of December 18, reached us Tuesday the 4th. We are somewhat surprised that the Department does not deem it advisable to forego our teaching in the month of September, since, as you say, we would not have had any pupils at all this year during that month, on account of the flooded condition of the meadows and the necessity for the parents to be away from the Reserve later than usual. In fact, all the years that we have been teaching in Anaham, that is since 1944, the attendance at school in September has been very low. If we look at the Register for those past four years, we do not count any more than about 10 pupils altogether in the two classes, from the opening of the school to September 15. On the other hand, the work does not call them away from school before July 15, therefore it might be just as well to begin school in the middle of September and have a good attendance all the year.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Anaham Indian Day School\n\nDear Bernard:\n\nI was very much perturbed regarding the attached inspection reports covering District School Inspector Davey's visit to the above-mentioned School on September 27th and after studying them I visited His Excellency, Archbishop Duke, and discussed them with him at some length.\n\nAs you are aware, there is temporarily at present a great scarcity of Catholic teachers in our Day Schools in this Province, and the same condition exists, although to a lesser degree, in those schools where Sisters of various Orders are teaching. The Sisters teaching in British Columbia are all fully qualified and from teaching Orders, with the exception of the above School, which Order is primarily a missionary congregation, doing extensive missionary work in the Orient and who only accepted work in the Anaham district because of continued request and then only because of their inability to carry out additional missionary duties in the Orient, due to war conditions.\n\nLast year, at the Anaham School, Sister Mary St. Bernard was in charge and was most successful in making a real contribution, not only in the classroom but with the children's parents and throughout the entire community. She was transferred to senior duties in the East and was replaced by Sister Mary Immaculata. I am writing to the Mother General of the\nMissionary Sisters of Christ the King, drawing to her attention the desirability and necessity of qualified teachers occupying teaching positions at the Ansham School and it is my hope that this important matter may be rectified at a fairly early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.S. Ameil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOctober 29, 1949.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAnaham Indian Day School.\n\nDear Bill:\n\nI am very concerned, naturally, over your letter and Bob Davey's report on the above school. I note that you are writing to the Mother General of the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King and I will be pleased to write a similar letter also if you will give me her address. I am pleased to note that you have discussed this matter with Archbishop Duke because he can do a great deal more than you and I in rectifying this situation.\n\nI have already visited two Heads of Religious Orders with regard to qualified teachers and feel that we should not relent in our efforts to obtain qualified teachers - especially with the salaries we are offering now.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 25, 1949.\n\nReverend Mother Mary of the Sacred Heart,\nMissionary Sisters of Christ the King,\nGasp\u00e9', Quebec.\n\nDear Mother General:\n\nI would like to draw to your attention a difficulty which we are experiencing in our Anaham Indian Day School, Hanceville, B.C.\n\nYou will recall that last year Sister Mary St. Bernard had charge of the Anaham School and during that period she made an excellent contribution, not only in the classrooms with the children, but with the parents and adult population throughout the entire community. Her transfer to greater duties, while fully appreciated, was very keenly felt by all concerned in the community and in this Branch, where her marked ability was so greatly shown in the improvement in school enrolment and regularity in attendance. As already mentioned, however, her transfer to more important work in your congregation is fully appreciated.\n\nA replacement by Sister Mary Immaculate is also appreciated and insofar as her devotion to her work and her conscientious approach is concerned, it leaves nothing to be desired. Our difficulty arises, however, in the minimum qualifications necessary for any person to assume a teaching position and particularly so amongst the children of a native group such as we are catering to at Anaham, where their family background is lacking from a language point of view as well as lacking background where general information is available in the home. We are very much afraid as time goes on without the best possible academic results being obtained at School that our serious attempt to provide an adequate Day School to improve and to educate the young folks amongst our native population there will be retarded.\n\nIn writing to you regarding this matter, I am not unmindful that the congregation of Christ the King are not a teaching Order but a missionary congregation, doing splendid work here.\nas well as in the far East and we were fortunate that the congregation established themselves at Anaham, with resultant benefit to our native people, nor am I unmindful that possibly the great progress made last year by Sister St. Bernard encouraged us too hopefully and to appoint where we felt that in a reasonable time our native population would be raised by education in school to a par with the natives of more progressive areas.\n\nIn considering the above matter it would be greatly appreciated if assistance could be rendered us to the extent that if within your congregation you have one or two Sisters experienced to some degree in teaching where English is spoken, you could find it convenient to possibly make them available at Anaham.\n\nIn closing may I take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for the work which the Sisters of Christ the King are doing for us here.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nNovember 2, 1949.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Anaham Indian Day School\n\nDear Bernard:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 29th, relative to our teachers at the above School and have noted your willingness to also write to the Mother General of the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King. Attached you will find a copy of my letter to the Mother General dated October 25th, so that you may decide whether or not a further communication is necessary.\n\nI would also like to add that His Excellency, Archbishop Duke, will be visiting Ottawa in the not too distant future and I know he intends to visit the Branch and I feel quite sure that the Anaham School will crop up in a general discussion when it will give opportunity for any desired debate.\n\nMay I repeat from my previous letter I am hopeful that by our drawing the matter to attention it may be rectified at a reasonably early date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nNovember 17, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.

However, this arrangement has been overlooked in our memo to Treasury appointing Sr. M. Immaculata effective 1-9-49. (See memo to C.T.O. dated September 1, 1949). Sr. M. Immaculata has been paid from September 1, but Sr. M. of the Assumption only from September 15, 1949.\n\nOur reclassification memo concerning Sr. M. of the Assumption (dated 4-10-49) reclassified her effective September 1. Miss Bell says they have not this memo.\n\nIf we wish to maintain the dates September 15, 1949 to July 15, 1949, for the academic year, I presume we will have to send an explicit memo to Treasury concerning both teachers.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAnaham Indian Day School\n\nThere is great confusion concerning the payment of teachers at this school, and we wish to straighten this matter out so that the Treasury Office can be notified accordingly. The big question is concerning the operation of the school and whether it did operate this year from September 15 to July 15, 1950. In other words, did classes begin on September 1 or on September 15?\n\nThis will be the last year for which this latitude will be allowed at this school. In future, classes must commence on the date set out in our school calendar, and we will not permit any variation, even if the attendance is very low.

I also understand that they have been running Sanatoriums and there is certainly a very urgent need for a Preventorium in this Agency. It is very discouraging to see so many children suffering from T.B. which has got too great a start to give any hope of their recovery even if there is accommodation for them at Coqualeetza. As you also know there is practically nothing being done on the Reserves in this Agency in the way of public health work. The present medical situation gives no hope of having clinics on the Reserves, and there is, therefore, no possibility of checking any disease until it is well established and requires hospitalization.\n\nNo doubt Archbishop Duke has already discussed the set-up with you since it would appear that it is now just a question of accommodation. The Indians have already put up a log cabin for the Priest at Anaham, and the Priest's house, which is 21' x 14' can be used by the Sisters. This is quite a good building divided into two bedrooms and a kitchen-livingroom. I would suggest that a lean-to for a kitchen and bedroom is built 30' x 12'. I would imagine\nthe Department would be prepared to put up a modern building similar to the schools that were built at Bella Bella and Kitimat but this will no doubt have to wait until after the War. Meanwhile, there will be no waste entailed in alterations to present buildings since these can always be used by the Indians or the Department for some other purpose.\n\nThere may be some difficulty in getting Indians to work on the school buildings at present since all are busy harvesting and will be now for some time but authorization for the purchase of the attached list of supplies and material is requested if the Anaham Day School is to be opened this year.\n\nIt should be further pointed out that the cost of alterations to the building to be used as a Day School has been small and that the Indians have done all labour so far gratuitously.\n\nIt should also be noted that the main building of the teacherage has been contributed by the Indians, since it was built for the Priest and therefore the cost of the addition is far below the cost of an entirely new building suitable for this purpose.\n\nIt is regretted that provision was not made in the Estimates for this expenditure but it was not possible for me to foresee that such a program as outlined by the Sisters and the Archbishop Duke would be put into effect until after the War.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Anaham Indian Day School\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Christie in which he advises that it is expected that teachers will be available from Sisters of Christ the King for appointment to the above noted school. Archbishop Duke has the matter under consideration and will no doubt submit the necessary nominations within the next few days.\n\nIndications are that 70 children will be available to attend this school and in view of this it would appear desirable to have two classrooms which of course would necessitate the appointment of two teachers. Mr. Christie has been requested to advise if suitable accommodation is available for a second classroom.\n\nWith reference to the repairs, etc., referred to by the Agent, the following information regarding the costs involved has now been received.\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| School building | $302.20 |\n| Teacherage    | $304.40 |\n| **Total**     | $606.60 |\n\nThese quotations were submitted by H.J.

The Department approves the expenditures recommended in your letter; namely, $608.60.

Mr. Christie now finds that the services of a skilled carpenter will be required for a period of twelve days at the rate of $1.00 per hour.\n\nI would recommend that, if funds are available, authority be granted for an expenditure of $100.00 for this purpose.\n\nD.

Vancouver. The two teachers' desks, size 42 x 30, made of Birch in oak finish may be secured from The Office Specialty Mfg. Co., Ltd., Vancouver, at a cost of $43.00 each, f.o.b. Vancouver, and four chairs may be purchased at Williams Lake at a cost of $2.00 each.\n\nIf funds are available, it is recommended that authority be granted for the purchase of these articles at a total cost of $150.16 plus freight on the sewing machine and desks from Vancouver and chairs from Williams Lake, to Anaham Indian Day School.\n\nfor D.

With the cold weather already here, they are anxious to get coats made for the school children who never seem to be adequately clad in the cold weather.\n\nIt may be very difficult to get sewing machines now but it will be appreciated if you will kindly try and have this expenditure approved and get the priority if necessary.\n\nAlso enclosed is a requisition for two school desks for the teachers and two chairs for each room.\n\nWm.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a requisition for 4 rolls of poultry fencing wire to enclose the Anaham Indian Day School and teacherage.\n\nI might say that the Anaham Indians have removed the stones and plowed out the ground around these buildings which will be planted with trees and garden by the Sisters who are teaching school there. These school buildings should be fenced to protect the windows from horses and cattle which frequently are running loose around the reserve.\n\nAlso, a garden with flowers and trees would do much to improve the appearance of the place and also will probably be an incentive to the Indians to do something about beautifying their own homesites.\n\nIt will require approximately 612 feet of fencing, so that 4 rolls will be necessary. It is difficult to get this wire around town, and Mr. Gosman is the only one who had 4 rolls available, and he has promised to hold same until I hear from you.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWC:MM\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Christie's letter of April 28th and enclosure referred to therein in connection with the proposed fencing of the school and teacherage at the Anaham Indian Day School. It is presumed that the Indians will supply the necessary labour and although no specific provision is made in the Estimates for this purpose it is recommended that if funds are available Mr. Christie be authorized to purchase the required wire at a cost of $39.00.\n\nFor D.

(RG 10, Volume 6424, file 871-5, part 1)\nWilliams Lake, B.C.,\nJanuary 31, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a list of children of school and pre-school age belonging to the Anaham Band, and also a surrender of land for school purposes on Anaham Indian Reserve, No. 1.\n\nThe Anaham Indian Day School is now in its second year of existence in the makeshift building formerly used as a Community Hall by the Indians. I think the results so far achieved have been very good and that the time has come to erect a modern school building on this Reserve in conjunction with a ward for emergency hospital patients and perhaps a small preventorium for T.B. cases.\n\nConsiderable thought has been given to the desired set-up on Anaham Reserve, the largest reserve in this Agency, with approximately 4,000 acres cultivable when irrigation is extended, in the centre of the Chilcotin, and adjacent to the Alexis Creek, Stone, Nemaiah Valley and Toosey Reserves, with the object of making the most advantage of the services of the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King, who specialize in teaching and nursing amongst native races. In this regard, I would direct your attention to Inspector T.G. Carter's reports of June 14th, 1945.\n\nRegarding Sr. Mary St. Paul, R.N., her reports speak for themselves, and more so from the reduction in hospitalization at the Chilcotin General Hospital at Alexis Creek. There are other advantages which cannot be estimated yet, such as the interest taken in gardening, in the children after school hours, and so on.\n\nThe attendance so far, I think, is satisfactory,\ntaking into consideration the fact that most of them sending only one or two legs of a sacrifice. They live anywhere from five to fifteen miles where they feed cattle during the winter to their trapping activities. Then conditions in many cases are poor on the reserve because there is a lack of accommodation.\n\nThere are forty-seven children attending the Anaham Day School, one of these being a boy attending to Nazko Reserve. The average attendance for the last quarter was forty. Twenty-one children belong to the Anaham Indian Reserve are not attending any school because, for the most part, their parents are out trapping and feeding cattle. With better houses and more accommodations on the Reserve, it is expected that more children will attend. The development of all of the Anaham Indian Reserve No. 1, possible with irrigation from the Chilcotin River, will also enable more of the Indians to stay at the village where the school is situated.\n\nIn my opinion, the ideal arrangement would be that two small dormitories be provided, one for boys and another for girls, to hold six beds in each dormitory, to accommodate pupils while their parents are at the meadows. I wish it clearly understood that this would not change the status of this school into a Residential School, as the Indians would be asked to contribute food, such as meat and vegetables, and the Sisters could have the Family Allowance payments to purchase the extra food recommended. There is a resident priest on the Reserve now\u2014Father P. Brown, O.M.I., and this has been discussed with him and also the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King, who would be prepared to arrange for the supervision necessary. This idea might be extended to include Indian children from outside Reserves such as Nemaiah Valley, Stone and Toosey, depending upon what the Department proposes to do about the Cariboo Indian Residential School, which will be more fully discussed in a separate report.\n\nMy reason for going somewhat into details is so that the Department may decide what kind of a building is required and so that they can plan it for an extension when this is considered necessary, if not now, at some future date.\n\nAt present, there are twenty-nine pupils on the register of the junior room, in grades 1A, 1B,\nand kindergarten, which is a heavy class of beginners, considering that they have to be taught a new language. There are 18 pupils in the senior room, mostly in grades two and three.\n\nThe minimum requirements, then, would be two classrooms, with possibilities for an additional classroom at an early date. The school building proper, erected at Bella Bella and Kitimat, would be satisfactory at Anaham with a full basement, providing possibilities for two rooms in the basement, one of which could be a manual training room and the other an additional classroom and club room.\n\nAdjoining the school building would be the Sisters' Residence with kitchen, living room, four bedrooms, bathroom and dispensary. Part of this could form a wing so that the building would be an \"L\" shape, and provision could be made for the dormitories and/or two rooms for emergency hospital patients as desired.\n\nI might say that Sr. Mary St. Paul, R.N., has made the services of Mrs. Anderson, R.N., at Alexis Creek unnecessary, with the exception that the hospital accommodation there provides for emergency cases from Redstone Reserve. Most of the patients who formerly were admitted from Anaham Reserve, are now taken care of in their own houses by Sr. Mary St. Paul. Mrs. Anderson, R.N., is continually complaining about the lack of patients for the Chilcotin Hospital, apparently forgetting that the Department had no idea of hospitalizing Indian patients there at all without the services of a resident physician. Mrs. E. Anderson is a very good nurse, but is, of course, not in a position, since she lives seven miles from the nearest Reserve, to give the same service as Sr. Mary St. Paul. In these circumstances, I would recommend that two rooms accommodating three beds each be included in the new building to take care of emergency cases.\n\nWith the appointment of a full-time Indian Doctor for this Agency, of course, it might be found more economical to hospitalize medical cases as distinct from surgical in the Chilcotin, but it is recommended that the Department have their own Hospital on Anaham Reserve in conjunction with the School.\n\nWhile the Department may not be able to finance the construction of a building as indicated this\nyear, I thought it well to give my ideas of what is required, since it is much more economical to plan for expansion than to build two or three buildings, each with a separate heating plant, and so on, later on.\n\nThe Missionary Sisters of Christ the King have made it possible for a different set-up at Anaham than would be the rule in most day schools. The ultimate idea is to educate Indians girls so that they will be able to graduate as nurses, teachers and social workers amongst their own people. While this program would seem rather ambitious at present, among the Indians in this district, a beginning has to be made sometime, and, in the meantime much valuable social work as well as educational and medical service, is being given by the Order. I think I could also state that any work undertaken by these Sisters would be done more economically than by any other Agency since they are not primarily in hospitalization as a business to the extent that St. Paul's or the other large Catholic Hospitals in the country.\n\nIn conclusion, I would respectfully suggest that consideration is given to these ideas before a school building is began at Anaham, and I think that the Department should also get in touch with the head of the Missionary Sisters of Christ the Kind,\u2014\n\nSister Mary of the Sacred Heart, N.C.R.,\n60 Spadina Road,\nToronto, Ontario\n\nwho has given me the impression of being a very capable and practical lady with modern ideas.\n\nWm.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 3rd, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 28th ult., with reference to the desks for the Anaham Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you will not likely be able to secure these until after the end of March. The order may stand so that it will be delivered whenever the desks are available.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour file 160-2-5 (A.T.I.)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of November 28th, an order has been placed with the Associated Foundry Limited, for school desks sufficient to accommodate sixty children at the Anaham Indian Day School, at a cost of approximately $750.00 f.s.b. Vancouver.\n\nPresent indications are that these will not be delivered before the end of the fiscal year, but it is presumed the Department would wish the order to stand until the desks become available.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 25 November 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that there are no school desks at the Anaham Day School.\n\nIf it is possible to secure school desks in Vancouver, you may do so for this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 29, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from Indian Agent Christie with reference to suitable accommodation that he considers necessary on the Anaham Indian Reserve.\n\nWhile Mr. Christie has submitted a very comprehensive report, I agree with the statement made in the last paragraph of your letter, that the matter will have to remain in abeyance for the time being. No funds were specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a new school on the Anaham Reserve.\n\nThe suggestion made by Mr. Christie, that small dormitories be provided for a limited number of boys and girls, is a proposal that has been submitted to us from other points in the Dominion. Whether Mr. Christie realizes it or not, the provision of such accommodation would actually mean a small residential school. I think you will agree that we would have all the problems with a small group that we would have with a much larger group. A special staff would have to be engaged to look after the children during their free time and adequate provision would have to be made for sleeping accommodation, as well as meals, etc. The use of Family Allowances in the manner suggested by Mr. Christie would not be feasible. The basic thought in the payment of family allowances is to provide certain extras for children. The amount is certainly not sufficient to provide for their full maintenance in an institution, if an institution were established, as suggested by the Indian Agent.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith for the information of the Department a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Christie in which he makes certain suggestions with respect to the provision of suitable accommodation for educational and medical requirements at the Ansham Indian Reserve.\n\nThe site which the Indians have agreed to surrender for school purposes is a very desirable one, being located close to the village and providing sufficient space for a playground and the development of a large school garden. Covering resolution of the Band, agreeing to the surrender of the area required, is enclosed.\n\nProvision was made in the Post-War Program of Worthwhile Works for a two classroom school with a teacher's residence and no doubt the Department will proceed with the construction of a suitable building as soon as conditions become favourable.\n\nAgent Christie's proposals are as follows:\n\n(1) A two classroom block with provision for an additional room when required.\n\n(2) A teacher's residence, including accommodation for a dispensary, dormitories for the housing of children whose parents for various reasons are not in continuous residence on the Reserve, and two rooms for use as an outpost hospital.\nIt is not clear from Mr. Christie's letter whether the services he refers to should be housed in one building or a group of buildings.\n\nI feel that these matters can be held in abeyance until a full-time medical officer fills the vacancy existing since the retirement of Dr. McQuarrie, and the appointment of a School Inspector is made.\n\nD.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n**Date:** March 12th, 1947\n\n**For:** Abraham Indian Day School Williams Lake Agency\n\n**NOTE:**\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well-known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \u201cNumber Authorized\u201d.\n\n| ARTICLES          | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED | REMARKS       |\n|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Paper Labels      | 0              |                       | 1 box           |                   | Black and White |\n| Picture           |                |                       |                 |                   |               |\n| Reference Books   | 0              |                       |                 |                   |               |\n| Soap              | 0              |                       |                 |                   |               |\n| Dustbane Sweeping Compound | 0 |                       |                 |                   |               |\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Missionary Sisters of Christ the King\n\nSchool: Abraham Indian Day\n\nPost Office (nearest): Vanderhoof B.C.\n\nExpress Office (nearest): Williams Lake\n\nProvince: British Columbia\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nFORM No. IA 418\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWhen I was in Ottawa this summer I mentioned to you the question of the proposed new school at Anahim and you turned to Mr. Neary and asked him to put that first on the schools for 1948. This school will need to be serviced with water from outside the village.\n\nIn looking over the sight for the proposed new school we found it necessary to move back some distance from the church because of solid rock which we encountered a few feet under the earth and consequently moved back to the proposed sight as marked on the enclosed Map. If you would like to return the map for our records it would be appreciated.\n\nNear the proposed school we placed the novitiate, for the training of Indian girls, which was built by the Sisters of Christ the King who now teach in the school.\n\nThe girls who will come to this novitiate have been selected from the different Catholic Residential schools of the province, recommended by their Missionaries and by the Sisters who have had charge of them, and will be prepared by special instruction and training, hoping to obtain among them some teachers, social workers and nurses. The novitiate will cost in the vicinity of $25,000 which is being financed by the Church for the benefit of the Indian people.\n\nNow, I am writing you to see if the pipelines necessary for the new school could not be brought in at the present time so that we could make use of it for the new novitiate. The Oblate Fathers in charge and the Sisters of Christ the King and our office here will appreciate very much your consideration of this project which, while perhaps in advance of the plans of the Department, will eventually be a part of their own work. You might like to refer the matter for consideration to Major MacKay, the Commissioner here, whom I am confident, because he knows the area so well, can furnish any other necessary information in the interest of the Indian people or of the Department.\n\nI hope you are keeping well and have had a little rest from your many duties during the summer months. With kind regards to Mr. Neary and assuring you of our appreciation of the direction of the Department, I remain as ever\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nW. M. Duke\nArchbishop of Vancouver\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6424, file 871-5, part 1)\nOttawa, September 12, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Please return the map when you are finished with it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnclosure.\n\nBFN/EM\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Your File 160-2-1 (W.T.)\n\nI have your letter of September 12th in which you refer to a communication received from Archbishop Duke in which His Excellency suggests that if at all possible the pipe line for the proposed new Departmental Day School at Ansham Indian Reserve, Williams Lake Agency, be installed immediately in order that water may be available to the institution for the training of Indian girls being constructed by the Sisters of Christ the King.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I discussed the matter with the Surveys and Engineering Branch and enclose herewith a copy of their reply dated September 25th from which it will be noted that both wood stave and iron pipe are in short supply and that the earliest date for supply of the former is March, 1948, and in the case of the latter promise of early delivery could not be secured. Under the circumstances and bearing in mind that construction is out of the question once frost penetrates the ground to any depth, it is most unlikely that the pipe line referred to could be installed until the coming spring. It therefore appears that it will be necessary for the Sisters to make the best arrangements possible to secure the water required from the existing system for the time being.\n\nThe sketch referred to in the last paragraph of your letter is being returned herewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nD. M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver\n\nRe: Domestic water Supply - Anaham Indian Village\nAnaham I.R. #1\n\nWith reference to your verbal enquiry of this date we have contacted Canadian Wood Pipe and Tanks and the Pacific Coast Pipe Co., who are the only local manufacturers of wood stove pipe and both advise the best delivery dates for immediate order of 3 or 4 inch wood stove pipe is next March (1948). Neither firm could quote prices as it is expected they will increase shortly.\n\nWe have recently tried to secure iron pipe of larger sizes (2\" to 3\") but were unable to get any promises of early delivery in anything like the quantity (2200 ft.) which would be needed in this case.\n\nIn regard to items listed in Mr. Robinson's report of August 14, 1947, as needed for repairs to present system all can be obtained on early delivery except the following:\n\n- Fencing and barbed wire - delivery indefinite\n- No. 7 self-closing Eclipse hydrants and lead\n- Pigtails - delivery f.o.b. Vancouver 8 weeks.\n\nC. L. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nPer \"G.H.

These repairs were recommended by an engineer who inspected the system and the Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Chief Engineer and Mr. Wardle seemed to be of the opinion that we should not undertake the repairs until the location of the new school was decided upon but I was of the opinion that they had misinterpreted the Engineer's report. If you will draw the Water Supply File, you will note that the Engineer seemed to be in doubt as to whether the present source of supply would take care of the needs of the school. I believe that at the present time this system supplies water to the Indian Agency only.\n\nMcMcG\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT   |\n|-----------|----------------------------------------------|----------|\n| January 13 | To supplies for the Anaham Indian Day School - Anaham Indian Reserve | $12.56   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

(RG 10, Volume 6424, file 871-5, part 1)\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, April 19, 1948.\n\nPERSONAL:\n\nDear Bill:\n\nOn Friday last Charlie Buck and I went with Emmett Morris to thoroughly inspect the new Chenail School. As you know, this is the two room school built to the plan sent you recently. We found the building entirely satisfactory and the contractor has done a very good job. Mr. Morris was particularly interested in the minor modifications which can be made in the plan so that he can make these minor improvements at Lennox Island. I would say that the following minor details are ones on which improvements can be made:\n\n(1) If steel beams are obtainable, then the posts in the basement can be eliminated and you will find that the two basement rooms will be much better for future classroom use.\n\n(2) The windows in the kitchen and living room downstairs are rather small and Mr. Buck is going to improve them (this will take some time as they are absolutely swamped with work).\n\n(3) The stairs from the teacher's living quarters can be straightened out to remove the landing. This will allow more space in the living room and also will give you to take furniture upstairs more easily. The contractor has been able to do this at Chenail by putting in fourteen steps and raising them to 8\" apart.\nThe classrooms are just perfect and I am sure that Bob Davey will be very pleased with them. Of course, we installed flush toilets, running water and electricity at Chenail as a result we have a very modern and satisfactory school.\n\nI was discussing the situation with Mr. Buck on the way home and we agreed that perhaps you would like to look at another two room school plan which has been especially developed for the Northwest Territories. There we can not put in a basement because of the perma-frost. The attached blueprint is only a preliminary drawing and changes will be made. I brought to the Architect's attention the fact that the fenestration is not sufficient for our needs. This is due to the fact that Mr. McKinnon specifically asked for folding doors between the two classrooms so that it could be used as a community hall. This meant that they were unable to work in windows along the other side wall. However, I would ask you to look it over and let me have it back. If you feel that it would be better for your needs at Anaham and Hazelton then I can arrange to have you sent the final plans.\n\nI hope everything is going well with Mrs. Arneil and yourself and that you are both finding Vancouver to your liking. As you probably know I have had Betty out visiting my people in Victoria and she is now on her way home.\n\nAs ever,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nEncl:\n\nBFN/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Anaham Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 23rd the plans of the Department's standard two-room Indian Day school with attached teachers residence were reviewed with Archbishop Duke and with Mr. E. J. Boughen, the contractor who built the Convent at Anaham. Mr. Boughen has just returned from a visit to the Williams Lake Agency during the course of which he discussed with the teachers of the Anaham Indian Day School and with Mr. Indian Agent Christie the requirements in the way of accommodation for the former. The following changes to the basis plan are suggested and submitted to the Department for consideration following which we shall secure a tender on labour:\n\n1. Mr. Boughen has suggested, and I concur, that it would be advisable to make the stair wells on each end of the building of slow burning construction.\n\n2. Provision of fire exits with panic bolts from each cloakroom with fire escapes to the ground.\n\n3. Installation of a unit to provide forced air heating to the basement rooms and other rooms if necessary.\n\n4. Extension of the section of the building providing First Aid and Dispensary accommodation in the basement and living quarters on the first and second floors a distance of approximately six feet to provide sufficient\nfloor area on the second floor to permit of a minimum of three bedrooms for the Sisters, one of whom, Sister Mary St. Paul, R.N., is employed by the Indian Health Services as Field Matron.\n\n(5) Extension of the building as above referred will provide sufficient floor space for the installation of a flush toilet and bath in the second floor living quarters. In addition it is proposed to install a flush toilet, one two-part urinal and two showers in the basement for the boys and three toilets and two showers for the girls. I may say that the pipeline serving the Convent passes within one hundred feet of the school site and provision of the sanitary facilities referred to is strongly recommended.\n\nA proposed arrangement with the Church whereby they supply the school with water in return for the provision of electricity on a metered basis to the Convent from the plant to be installed in the school will be the subject of a separate communication. I might mention that water pressure from the church system is 28 pounds on the second floor of the Convent and will be adequate for the operation of flush toilets.\n\nMr. Boughen, according to information we have, has an excellent foreman, Iver Hottlien, who would carry out construction with local labour under the supervision of Mr. Christie and on receipt of the Department's decision of the changes above listed he will be asked to submit a tender for labour and Mr. Boughen will prepare a list of materials apart from lumber which can be provided by the Agency sawmill and tenders will be called for on this basis. A reply in due course would be appreciated.\n\nW.S. Amos,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 10, 1948.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nAnaham Indian Day School\n\nReference your 17-11-3 of June 4, 1948.\n\nThe Department is willing to consider Mr. Boughen's recommendations concerning the slow burning stair wells. The provision of fire exits from this school, as suggested, has not been considered necessary elsewhere because of the fact that this is a day school and not a residential school.\n\nWe are prepared to consider the extension recommended by Mr. Boughen but we have only a sum of $28,000.00 in our estimates for the construction of this school. We have found elsewhere that if we start making major changes in the plans of the school the expenditure increases by leaps and bounds. However, this school is so designed that flush toilets, etc., can be installed in that part of the building marked \"First Aid Room and Dispensary\". We can send you a marked plan which will indicate how this was done at the Chenail School on the St. Regis Reserve. By enlarging the chemical closet room on the second floor we were also able to provide a toilet and shower for the teachers.\n\nMr. Boughen can submit a labour tender or we can pay Mr. Holtlien on a day labour basis.\n\nBernard E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Anaham Indian Day School\n\nI have delayed replying to Mr. Neary's Army Signals message of May 20th regarding the provision of accommodation for the Sisters at the Anaham Reserve in our new Day School building pending an opportunity of discussing the matter with Dr. P.S. Tennant. I have now ascertained from Dr. Tennant that Sister Mary St. Paul is not employed full time by the Indian Health Services and that consequently they are not committed to provide accommodation for her and therefore it presumably is not necessary for us to consider the requirements of the Indian Health Services in our school construction program, particularly as accommodation for Sisters other than our two teachers should be available in the noviciate building if not in the present day school building where the nursing station referred to is apparently established.\n\nI might mention however it is my understanding there is another Sister at Anaham who I believe looks after the housekeeping needs of the two teachers and possibly the Department would wish to provide accommodation for her.\n\nW.S.

The following is a breakdown of this cost:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Excavation & backfilling                  | 350.00   |\n| Labour: Foreman $1.50 an hour, carpenters @ $1.40, helpers $1.00 (Indians at $6.00 a day) | 8,700.00 |\n| Concrete walls and floors                 | 1,250.00 |\n| Septic tank, drains, etc.                 | 300.00   |\n| Chimney                                   | 215.00   |\n| Outside finishing material                | 245.00   |\n| Insulation                                | 278.00   |\n| Wallboard (Bestolite and masonite)        | 1,580.00 |\n| Blackboards                               | 80.00    |\n| Asphalt shingles, 210 lb.                 | 400.00   |\n| Freight and cartage                       | 1,500.00 |\n| Finish lumber, mouldings, etc.            | 800.00   |\n| Sub-Contracts Millwork                    | 2,754.00 |\n| Heating, forced hot air                   | 2,532.00 |\n| Plumbing                                  | 2,323.00 |\n| Electric wiring                           | 1,020.00 |\n| Generating plant                          | 3,357.00 |\n| Common Lumber                             | 2,000.00 |\n| Hardware                                  | 650.00   |\n\nTotal: $30,334.00\nWhile the information detailed above has been secured largely by Mr. Boughen, he has other commitments which will prevent him from undertaking complete supervision of the construction but Mr. Ivor Holtbein, whom I have interviewed, is I believe fully competent to carry on with the work with possibly infrequent visits to the site by Mr. Boughen.\n\nIt is recommended that I be authorized to have construction proceeded with at the earliest possible date so that the preliminary work involved, excavation and installation of the basement prior to the actual erection of the building, may be proceeded with at once.\n\nIt is anticipated that we will be able to forward to you within the next few days tenders from local sources of supply on all materials required and would ask that when these are received they be referred to the Purchasing Agent and the orders placed as soon as possible.\n\nIt is intended to have labour costs paid from the Williams Lake Agency office and I would ask that an accountable advance of $9,350 be forwarded to Capt. Christie from which he can pay the men and also pay the cost of excavating and backfilling. It is essential that construction be commenced immediately if we are to complete the building before winter.\n\nEncs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

According to the Company, material and labour costs have increased 15% since the date of their original tender of July 7th and their tender for the provision of labour and material necessary for wiring the building according to plan for acceptance now is $1,173. Their tender on the supply and installation of a 10 K.W., 110-220 A.C., three phase, fully automatic lighting plant complete with starting batteries is $3,417.00. The price on this plant includes the material and labour necessary for connecting the plant to the Novitiate as detailed on the specifications for electrical wiring submitted by Mr. Boughen and the price quoted on both the wiring and the lighting plant includes board, transportation and expenses for the Company's electricians.\n\nThe Mott Electric Company's tender for wiring and supply and installation of the plant is as set out in your letter. It does not include starting batteries (two 6-volt storage batteries are required for the plant quoted on) and the Department would be required to provide travelling expenses, room and board and pay additional wages to the Company's electricians for travelling time.\n\nI understand the Jarvis Electric Company have been awarded the contracts for wiring in several public buildings in Vancouver, including the Unemployment Insurance Commission building and from information available it would appear that\ntheir work is satisfactory. Their tender is considerably lower than that of Mott Electric. As intimated in my letter of October 20th, construction of the new school has proceeded to the point where it is essential that the contracts for heating and wiring be placed immediately and I trust that the Purchasing Agent will now be in a position to decide to whom the electrical contract should be awarded.\n\nW.S.

You will note that the account requests payment at the rate of $3.25 each, or a total amount of $19.50.\n\nDo you think we should pay the account at the increased amount, or should the account be returned for explanation?\n\nPP/ST Attach.\n\nBernard F.

Purchase orders covering these\nmaterials were as follows:\n\n16899, 33347, 33344, 33345, 33342\n\nThere was also two five gallon tins of asphalt\nwhich were ordered by letter from your office dated\nSeptember 9, 1948 from the Sydney Roofing and Paper\nCompany.\n\nAll items mentioned in these purchase orders\nare not included in this account so it is rather\ndifficult to check on them.

Boughen, who supervised the construction of the above-mentioned School building. You will note that the building is nearing completion and apart from a few details of minor nature, will likely be completed by April 1st.\n\nThe total cost is estimated at $33,670.00 which, in view of the modern facilities provided the School, is considered to be reasonable. A final report and summary of costs will be submitted at a later date.\n\nI would like to say at this time that we are greatly indebted to Mr. Boughen and as a matter of fact, it is doubtful if we would have been able to complete the School at this time, at such a reasonable cost, had it not been for his efforts.\n\nW.S. Armell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\n1529 West 65th Ave\nVancouver, B.C., March 21st, 1949.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Comm. for B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nI have just returned last Friday evening from a trip of inspection to the school at Anahim Flat Reserve.\n\nI found the work proceeding quite satisfactorily. The foreman, Iver Holtlien, and myself judged it would be possible to complete the job, barring unforeseen contingencies, by the last of April with the men we have on the job now.\n\nI made a report, on the official documents in Mr. Christie's hands, of the electrical wiring, etc., the electric generator and the forced warm air, automatic conditioning heating system all of which I found complete and in good working order.\n\nThe plumbing should be completed in a week or so. All the piping, wastes and vents are installed but not as yet tested. Four of fifteen plumbing fixtures are installed. Most of the other fixtures' installation is delayed by the frost still being in some of the basement so that it has not been advisable to lay the concrete floor on it, as yet.\n\nI attempted to check the accounts on this school that are in Mr. Christie's hands when I was in Williams Lake but it was too big an undertaking for the time at my disposal there, so Mr. Christie allowed me to bring them down. I have checked them over and made up a complete summary of costs and returned the accounts, etc., to Mr. Christie by registered mail. I am enclosing a copy of my summary to you.\n\nIn July, 1948, I made an estimate of probable costs which amounted to $27,934.00 but which did not include the common lumber (which we had expected to get from the mill on the Stone Reserve) and freight on same and the hardware, costs of which I did not have. Paints & Electric fixtures also were not included as I was not certain what instructions I would receive in this connection. These items total up to $4570.00 making a grand total of $32,504.00. Actually the cost of the building, according to my Summary of Mar. 19th\nW.S. Arneil, Ind. Comm.\n(2) Mar. 21st/49\n\nwill be, if $2500.00 completes it,-and it should,-$33,690,\nor about 4% over my original cost list. The bill for trucking\nappears to be heavy,-considerably beyond my estimate. The\ncost of the gravel for concrete was too high and of course we\nlost considerable through avoidable and un-avoidable delays,\nincluding $213.00 added to the original electric wiring and\ngenerator plant tender.\n\nI am of the opinion that better results might\nhave been obtained if all invoices, etc. had been mailed to\nMr. Christie, c/o myself 1529 West 65th so that I could check\nthem against the original order.\n\nNaturally I would be in a better position to\ncheck quantities and costs than could Mr. Christie or Iver\nHoltlien the foreman (Mr. Christie had him sign the bills).\n\nI requested the Reliance Lbr. Co. last summer\nto supply me with a list of the material they were to supply\nwith the prices. I got the list of material but the prices\nwere cut off. Their total bill for finish lumber, wallboard,\nBestolite and Masonite proved to be $416.00 higher than I\nestimated from prices I had got for the Novitiate (principally\nfrom the Valley Lbr. Yards and Mohawk Lbr. Co. & Can. Western\nLbr. Co.)\n\nOf course there may have been some increase in\nprices in the meantime.\n\nIt is in my mind that when we were discussing\nthe probable cost of the school last June & July you asked me\nif I thought the total cost would be $35,000.00 and I said I\nfelt sure the cost would not go over that amount. If that is\ncorrect (I do not know, of course, what amount the Dept. set\naside for the school) I am still $1200.00 or $1300.00 below\nthat figure.\n\nRight here I wish to thank you, your office staff\nand Mr. Christie for the consideration and assistance they have\nso willingly given me at all times in connection with this\nbuilding. Mr. Christie is quite evidently proud of the build-\ning and says Anahim Flat Reserve will be the show place of the\nCariboo and moreover that you should arrange your schedule to\ninclude giving the school your official blessing at the opening.\n\nYours very truly, Edmund J. Boughen Sgd.\n## ANAHIM INDIAN SCHOOL\n### SUMMARY OF COSTS TO DATE - - - MARCH 19/49\n\n| FIRMS                        | MATERIAL                          | COST   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------|\n| Mc & Mo                      | Hardware, etc.                    | $657.42|\n| Sigurdson Mill Co.           | Millwork contract                 | 2,734.00|\n| \"                            | Millwork extras                   | 119.50 |\n| Can.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nAnaham Indian Day School.\nWater Supply - Electricity.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of your army message I went to see the Director concerning the matter of the electricity and water supply at this school. It is very difficult, naturally, to settle these matters by long distance correspondence and therefore I would suggest that either yourself or Major Davey interview Archbishop Dako and advise him of the cost of installing the electrical plant. It is evident from his letter that he believes the water supply cost more than the electrical supply. As you are aware (your letter 17-11-3 (167) of March 22) the electrical plant has cost as follows:\n\n| Item               | Cost     |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| Contract wiring    | $1,173.00|\n| Electrical plant   | 3,417.00 |\n| Extras             | 13.66    |\n| Lamps and fixtures | 219.01   |\n| **Total**          | **$4,822.67** |\n\nThe Director does not wish to have the Department obligated to the Church. I would suggest, therefore, that after discussing this matter with the Archbishop, we be advised as to what settlement would be mutually agreeable to both yourself and him.\n\nBernard F.

Supv's time & expenses and Inspection) $2300.00\nPlumbing (for extras, accounts now under review) 459.00\nCement, etc. (ordered by Mr. Christie at Wms Lake) 20.00\nPaint, etc. (ordered April 27th, etc.) ............ 20.00\nMillwork, extras 35.00\nLumber (ordered Apr. 27Th) and some from Wms.

In order that there may be no delay in the completion of the Anaham school I would recommend that $3200 of the amount provided in appropriation for construction of the four classroom block at Alberni be transferred and made available and that $2300 of this amount be advanced to Supt.

Neary,\nPP/ST Supt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Fencing - Anaham Indian Day School\n\nSuperintendent Christie has advised that it will be necessary to fence the school and grounds, in order to protect the windows from horses and other animals on the Reserve and to establish the boundaries of the school site, thus preventing encroachment by, and consequent difficulty with, band members who may wish to establish themselves too close to the school.\n\nThe cost of labour and material for the fence is estimated at approximately $410.00, $200.00 of which is for labour.\n\nWhile I am most anxious to avoid the unnecessary expenditure of funds from Vote 516, Allotment 13, the erection of the fence in this case would appear to be a necessity. I would recommend that the Department approve the expenditure required and that an accountable advance of $200.00 be forwarded to Mr. Christie. The required funds which are in addition to the $3,164.00 necessary to complete the school building, might be transferred from the appropriation for the Alberni classroom block.\n\nW.S.

We have already transferred the amount which you previously requested and we will have to arrange another transfer.\n\nIn the meantime, we are forwarding Superintendent Christie an advance of $200.00 which he recommends.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n**APPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:**\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | William's Lake Indian Agency Trust Acct. | $200.00 |\n\nSend cheque to:\n\nMr. W.

This total is somewhat in excess of the advance previously requested by Mr. Christie and it would appear to me that if the advance has not already been sent to him it would be easier to pass the vouchers for payment and have cheques issued to the individuals concerned.

Christie has forwarded to me paylists covering labour employed for completion of the above-mentioned school building and it is apparent he and the Contractor under-estimated these costs by $1325.17 when advising us what funds should be transferred for completion of the building. I regret exceedingly that it is necessary to ask that this additional amount be made available but as wage accounts to this amount have been outstanding since June 30th I would ask that an accountable advance to complete payment be forwarded to Mr. Christie as soon as possible.\n\nI might mention that work on this building was carried out continuously after March 31st and the unavoidable delay in making funds available for payment of the carpenters resulted in complaints from them to the Provincial Department of Labour which we found most difficult to explain. To prevent a recurrence of these complaints will you please have a cheque airmailed to Mr. Christie.\n\nCredit voucher No. 405 accounting in part for the $2300 already advanced to Mr. Christie is enclosed and recommended.\n\nS.

I feel that the room in which the plant is presently housed could be adequately ventilated with an exhaust fan but concur with his suggestion for the reason that space occupied by the plant could be used to greater advantage for storing fuel.\n\nI would recommend that the Department endeavour to make funds available to the extent of approximately $305.00 for the erection of a separate building to house the plant, and $180.00 for repairs to the plant.\n\nW.S.

Previous to that, however, Mr. Lees had checked the cooling system and removed the thermostat in order to try and improve same. The cooling system then was working perfectly.\n\nWe have not had an opportunity to examine the Plant further but have a quotation on labour and material to build a small powerhouse.\n\nIn view of the fact that the concrete will have to be poured, I would suggest that authorization is received to build this house as soon as possible.\n\nIf you require any further information regarding the Plant I would suggest that you contact Mr. Davey, School Inspector or Mr. Kendall, Fur Supervisor, both of whom know the condition under which the Plant was working.\n\nIn addition to the cost of building this house it will also be necessary to get the services of an electrician to move the switchboard and extend the lines.\n\nWm.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Lighting plant - Anaham School\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 12th, we have now been able to get an estimate of the cost of repairs to the above-mentioned Plant. It will cost approximately $125.00 for repairs and $55.00 for labour, a total of $180.00.\n\nThe following repairs are required:\n\n4 connecting rods, complete with bearings and shims\n1 crank shaft\n1 complete set main bearings and shims\n1 set main bearing caps\n1 set main bearing cap screws\n1 set rings STD.\n1 complete set gaskets\n\nWith further reference to the building for this Plant, I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Boughen, a copy of which is enclosed. You will note that Mr. Boughen considers that the bearings burned out on account of lack of oil, presumably because the room door was closed and the engine overheated. After all the only reason for having a fireproof door on the Engine Room was to prevent fire and therefore the door should be closed to comply with fire regulations.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Boughen designed the building and supervised its construction and made several inspection trips to see that everything was as it should be.\n\nThe only reason I am sending you a copy of Mr. Boughen's letter, however, is because he does not favour a separate building. It is quite true that a separate building will cost more money but Mr. Iver Holtlien, who was foreman on construction of the School and also Jack Miller, who installed the lighting plant, both favour a separate building.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.  \n16/11/49.\n\nAs Mr. Davey will verify, with the plant in its present position, the exhaust pipe runs up the wall and the exhaust filters into the classrooms.\n\nI consider that Mr. Boughen has given too much prominence to the danger of the plant freezing up in the cold weather. Freezing up is entirely eliminated by the use of anti-freeze. On the odd occasion during the Winter there might be a little difficulty in starting.\n\nWm. Christie, Supt.,\nWilliams Lake Indian Agency.\n\nWC/B.\n\nEncls.\nWm. Christie,\nSupt.,\nIndian Agencies,\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Christie:\n\nJust got a letter from Iver in which he says that more trouble has happened with the electrical equipment at Anahim School. That the engine bearings burned out on account of lack of oil presumably because the room door was closed and the engine overheated.\n\nSeems like as though there is no responsible person there to see that even the simplest conditions are carried out.\n\nUndoubtedly if the room was closed up the engine would overheat. But the bearings being burned out of the engine might be the lack of new oil being put in the engine at proper periods because that oil will stand tremendous heat if there is sufficient quantity in the pan.\n\nWhen I was there about a month ago your Asst., Mr. Lees, mentioned a vent shown on the Plants which was not put in. He said it could be cut in the wall under the engine radiator.\n\nApparently this has not been cut in. Can you get Iver to do it, and put a piece of screen over the opening.\n\nIver said you were speaking about a shed outside where plenty of ventilation could be obtained.\n\nWe considered this in connection with the St. James School but it was my opinion that, - even with a small stove in it,- (which would probably be allowed to be without fuel some cold night anyway) would not be altogether fool proof either.\n\nSo the St. James School will be built with a 10 ft x 12 ft extension which will take in the back steps from the basement as well as the Electrical equipment with door into the main basement and heat from there also when necessary. It won't freeze up anyway. If you are going to put up a separate building for it I think it should be done along the same lines as the St. James School plans, but I do not think it necessary to do so. To make a new building and move the electrical equipment into it and connect up again is quite an undertaking.\n\nI suggest that you have a vent cut in the wall and screened as I wrote above (about 20 in x 14 in) and if that is not enough (and I don't think it will be) get a suction electric fan put in the outside wall, near the ceiling, with a metal box into the elec. room. That will be easier to put in and will keep the room well ventilated at all times by having it connected so that whenever the plant is working the fan will also work. It will also be\nvastly cheaper than an outside house, will be more nearly fool proof, and if they can keep water in the radiator and oil in the engine should give no more trouble. Will be glad to see about fan and piping if you decide to put it in that way.\n\nI hope you will adopt my suggestion for the vent and the fan. It will be less trouble for you to get installed, will be fool-proof and will remedy the present trouble. I probably could get the fan assembly made up here, ship up to you as soon as ready. It could be put in by almost anyone.\n\nIf you build a shed for it there would always be the danger of it freezing up. Some one will let the fire go out in very cold water some time and even with anti-freeze in the radiator the plant would be too cold to start easily with the possible result of damage to something or exhaustion of the batteries.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"Edmund J. Boughen\"\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\nOctober 26th, 1949.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nRe: Electric Lighting Plant\nAnaham - Your File 17-5-2\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant regarding the lighting plant located in the school on Anaham Indian Reserve.\n\nIt is very much regretted that serious damage was done to this plant on October 15th. I have not written until today because I was waiting for the return of Mr. Lees, the Assistant, to find out exactly what damage had been done. He advises me that the following damage occurred to the plant, which has a Waukeshaw Motor, Model FC-182-A, No. 756632:\n\n1. Three main bearings burned out.\n2. Four connecting rods burned out.\n3. Crankshaft scored.\n4. Pistons seized.\n\nIt is also quite possible that the piston rings will have to be replaced and the cylinders may have to be honed out and the pistons polished; new head gaskets and new pan gaskets will also have to be supplied, the crankshaft will have to be machined and it may be advisable to get a new crankshaft.\n\nI would suggest that the machine be brought into Williams Lake, which we can do in our truck and Mr. Lees can take the head off and find out whether the motor will have to be shipped to Vancouver or whether it can be repaired here with the replacement of the parts mentioned.\n\nMr. Lees is of the opinion that there was sufficient oil in the motor but it overheated causing the evaporation of the oil and that a flash fire took place in the pan. His opinion is based on examination of the parts and from statements received from the Sisters. The Sisters advise that on Saturday, October 15th, they turned on the plant about five o'clock, about 8.30 the lights started to die down and...\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.  \n26/10/49.\n\nWhen they reached the plant it had already stopped and smoke was pouring from the engine. They also advise that the door of the power room had been closed by some of the children.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that a separate building will have to be erected for this plant. With this in mind I contacted Ivor Holtien, who has agreed to submit an estimate for material required for this building. It is suggested that the building be $12 \\times 12$ or $12 \\times 14$. When I have received the list of material required it will be submitted to you together with an estimate of cost of labour.\n\nMr. Lees, Assistant in this Agency, advises me that he could repair this motor providing the cylinders do not have to be honed out. However, if this has to be done I think it will be necessary to ship the head down to Vancouver.\n\nKindly advise me as soon as possible what you wish us to do in this matter toward getting the plant repaired.\n\nWm.

We are forwarding this week an additional amount of $536.85 which will pay in full the Vouchers mentioned in our letter of December 9th.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of December 9th (file 871-5 E.1) in connection with outstanding accounts, Anishin Indian Day School, which exceed the amount which we advised would complete the structure, it is regretted that the amount transferred has been over-expended but you will realize that it is difficult if not impossible for either this office or the Indian Superintendent to check such estimates and we must necessarily be guided by the person in charge of the construction. As a matter of fact the over-expenditure is greater than the amount indicated in your letter for the reason that we were confronted recently with a statement from Mitchell Brothers, plumbing and heating contractors, which indicated an outstanding balance of $460.60 and enquiry revealed that the plan provided to Mitchell Brothers by Mr. Boughen showed the kitchen sink in a location which was in a later plan changed, necessitating the relocation of the rough plumbing for this fixture, the labour and material for which cost $109.98. This change was not brought to the attention of the plumber until after the rough plumbing was in and the change was made at the request of the building supervisor, Mr. Boughen or his foreman, Mr. Holtlien. The Company performed the work in good faith and are entitled to payment.\n\nThe other invoice, in the amount of $350.52, covers rough plumbing for the showers for the girl's and boy's washrooms, which installations were arranged by Mr. Boughen without authority from this office and in explanation of which he states he requested the plumber to rough in only that part of the installation which would be covered by concrete and that this was done in order to avoid the necessity of breaking up the concrete at a later date to install these facilities. Mr.\nBoughen insists that the plumber carried the installation beyond this stage and as a matter of fact completely roughed in all plumbing for the showers.\n\nThe total of the two accounts is as stated above $460.60 and the invoices have been forwarded to Mr. Christie so that if the work detailed thereon has been satisfactorily completed the covering voucher can be submitted.\n\nI might mention at this time that in our opinion Mr. Boughen, in his capacity as erection supervisor, assumes more authority than he should and it is our intention if the school at Fort St. James is erected under his supervision to inform him prior to the commencement of construction that he will have to be personally responsible for unauthorized expenditures.\n\nIn order to make payment of the amount owing to Mitchell Brothers a transfer of $992.38 will be necessary.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Furnishings - Anaham Indian Day School - Teacherage\n\nAttached are requisitions for furnishings for the teacherage, Anaham Indian Day School.\n\nQuotations were obtained from all local firms and requisitions are based on price and quality.\n\nIn view of the fact that the floors have not been sanded the Sisters at Anaham recommended battleship linoleum or Marboleum to cover all the floor space. This would however necessitate the employment of an experienced Carpenter to lay same and would probably cost an additional $100.00. An alternative would be to purchase linoleum rugs but the Marboleum would last much longer.\n\nA price was also got on a second hand Range in first class condition for the basement room it is proposed to teach Home Economics.\n\nAn item of $1000.00 was placed in the Estimates for 1949-50 for this purpose.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Furnishings - Anaham Indian Day School\n\nThe attached letter dated August 18th, from Superintendent Christie, with enclosures, was forwarded to you under cover of my letter of September 13th, but was returned here without any explanation, presumably in error. Will you please advise if purchase of the furnishings requisitioned is approved.\n\nW.S.

The recommended items can be obtained in Vancouver at an approximate cost of $110.00 and the expenditure is recommended for approval.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n16th May, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant enclosing a requisition for equipment for the Domestic Science class at the Anaham Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to favourably consider supplying the articles mentioned at the present time. We feel it would be advisable to wait until after the school re-opens for the 1949-50 academic year.

Inspector Davey has just returned to this office from a visit to that school and reports that there are nine girls in attendance of an age who would benefit from this type of instruction. Although he favours the supply of the materials, he suggests that if the Department is short of funds for this purpose, the supply of these items could be deferred until next year without serious loss.\n\nW.

Duke of Vancouver, and Mr. Inspector Barry's report of the 6th ultimo, also letters from Mr. Taylor dated 12th and 23rd of July.\n\nPerusal of this correspondence will show that the proposal is to erect a day school on Alexis Creek Indian Reserve No. 3 to provide accommodation for 40 pupils and teacher's quarters, the school to be operated from November 1 to March 31, during which period the Indians are on their cattle feeding grounds, the balance of the year being scattered over a wide area in connection with their cattle industry when it is not possible to bring the children together for tuition.\n\nThe question of whether funds could be provided for the construction and outfitting of the school and quarters and a teacher secured in time for opening a school for the coming winter is problematical, but it might be considered advisable to set aside $100 for the purpose of getting out the logs, in order to give them an opportunity of drying out before proceeding with the construction. It is probable that this could be attended to during next winter. Provision is being made in the 1941-42 estimates to build and furnish the structure in case funds are not available to proceed with construction during the present fiscal year.\n\nFollowing a careful review of the subject with Mr. Taylor recently, the estimated costs were placed at\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nAugust 19, 1940.\n\n$1500.00 which amount includes $200 for furnishings for the teacher's residence and $100 for getting out the logs this winter.\n\nI should appreciate being informed at an early date of the Department's decision in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.,\nJuly 2, 1938.\n\nGerald H. Barry Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 3rd, last regarding the suggested day school for the Alexis Creek Band, I enclose herewith a list of the children of this Band up to the age of sixteen years.\n\nThe distance at which families at present reside from suggested school site does not need to be taken into account as I am advised by all the parents that in the event of a school being erected, they are prepared to build houses in the immediate vicinity. These houses will not be clustered around the school building, but will be erected at distances varying from three hundred yards to within one mile on suitable sites.\n\nAt a meeting with the Alexis Creek Band this week, I find all of them still very anxious for the establishment of a school as soon as possible. They agree with me that a winter school operating from 1st November to the end of April is the most feasible solution as during the rest of the year they will be travelling in connection with the hunting, trapping and haying activities.\n\nA log building is considered most suitable for a school and the Indians are prepared to cut and haul logs to the school site in return for rations, no wages being expected. The same would apply to the building of a log house for the accommodation of the teacher.\n\nIt would be necessary for the Department to supply lumber, doors, windows and roofing material, etc., for both buildings.\nThere are competent carpenters in the Band who could complete construction of the buildings on a food ration basis. Lumber can be secured locally at a distance of within fifty miles.\n\nIt might be considered advisable to secure a married male teacher, whose wife would be available to supervise the children in their homes and possibly render elementary medical attention when necessary, as it might be difficult at times during the winter for a doctor to get in there.\n\nThe matter of a suitable water supply was enquired into and I am advised that there are suitable springs which would give an adequate supply of good water although some piping may be necessary.\n\nAs you will see from the attached list there are seventy-eight children up to the age of sixteen years practically none of whom are at present able to secure any schooling. I may say that the Indians are opposed to the idea of a residential or semi-residential school being established in the vicinity of the Anaham Reserve.\n\nMany of the parents have already built cabins in the vicinity of the suggested school site and even if all of them do not carry out their promise to build in the vicinity of the school, I am satisfied that there will be a sufficient attendance to justify the erection of the school.\n\nSome of the Indians intimated that it would be necessary for the Department to supply them with lumber and other building material to complete the erection of their log dwellings.\n\nIf you contemplate a visit to the suggested school site this year, I would suggest Priest Time in October as the most suitable time, as the haying will then be finished and most of the Indians will be assembled to meet their priest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.E.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nIn a letter dated the 4th instant His Excellency Archbishop Duke informs me that on a recent visit to the Cariboo he found at Redstone 42 children of school age from 6 to 16 years of age, without school facilities, and also 20 children from 1 to 6 years of age, and that all these children live within twelve miles of the proposed site of the school, should one be authorized.\n\nHis Excellency mentions the Chezacuz Meadows as a good site for a school, and offers to have Rev. Father Hennessy meet me in the Cariboo if I could go up there in the Fall to see the place.\n\nThere has as you know been some correspondence with regard to the establishment of such a school, and I would refer you in particular to the Department's decision in letter 160-82-1 that I was not to make a special trip into Redstone to conduct a school survey. Though I have been twice at Williams Lake since the receipt of the above mentioned letter from the Department, I have on neither occasion been able to arrange for the special and rather long motor trip into the Redstone country.\n\nOn July 6th 1938 I forwarded to you, with reference to the distribution of pupils from Coqualeetza School, a proposed building programme to cover the Fiscal Years 1939 to 1942. For a number of reasons, particularly perhaps because the Redstone children live at such distances from a common centre at present, and also because they are all over the country on hay meadows in the summer months, but also because provision had to be made during the years mentioned for the education of children who otherwise would have gone to Coqualeetza I could not include the proposed Redstone school in that proposed building programme.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter from Indian Agent Taylor dated July 2 1938 and his list of children available then. The ages of the children must now be advanced two years in each case.\n\nMay I particularly draw your attention to the suggestion contained in Mr Taylor's letter, Paragraph 3, that the school should be a seasonal one for six months from November 1st to April 30th, and also to the suggestion in Paragraph 4 that the necessary buildings be of log construction.\n\nIf a log building is erected it should certainly be large enough to accommodate 40 pupils. Small log buildings are not suitable for school purposes.\nThe Department may wonder why I have not previously recommended the establishment of an Indian day school at Redstone.\n\nI have been very doubtful with regard to the wisdom of gathering Indians together into a new village just to make it possible for the children to attend a day school. It is of course obvious that no school could be a success at Redstone unless the Indians did build new houses in a central location. As you will see from the second last paragraph of Mr. Taylor's letter even now some of the Indians are looking to the Department for assistance in the completion of their proposed new houses.\n\nI have felt that it might well be better to permit the Indians to continue their present mode of life, that of active trapping, hunting, and haying.\n\nAs these occupations take up almost all the year I did not see just how we should be able to keep up anything like a satisfactory average attendance at the school.\n\nHowever I may be quite wrong in this case and have therefore gone into the whole matter again with care, considering the lists of children, the Indian Agent's recommendations, the Archbishop's letter etc.\n\nProvided the Indians in return for rations, etc., erect under the supervision of a competent person a large log building for a school and a smaller building for a teacher's residence, and the Department can find sufficient funds to provide the lumber, windows, doors, roofing, inside finishing, etc., as well as material for rough homemade desks, blackboards etc., I am now prepared to recommend the establishment of a seasonal school at Redstone.\n\nI consider that a five month's school during the winter, that is from November 1st to March 31st would be all that these Indians could make proper use of, and this type of school would be in line with other seasonal schools.\n\nI am not very well and do not believe that the strain of a journey into Redstone would be worth while in any case. My travelling has been limited by instructions from the Department. The site chosen by the Indian Agent is no doubt a suitable one, and a special trip to Redstone does not appear to me to be necessary just to confirm his findings. Should such a school be established I would of course do my best to get in there at least once to see that the teacher understood what was necessary, though such seasonal schools are not in the usual way inspected by me.\n\nWithin the limits suggested above I would recommend the establishment of the seasonal school asked for by His Excellency Archbishop Duke.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n646 Richards St.\nVancouver, B.C.\nJuly 4, 1940.\n\nCapt. Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools\nP.O.Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Captain Barry:\n\nOn my visit to the Cariboo, I found at Redstone Reserve 42 children of school age from 6 to 16 years of age without school facilities, and also 20 children from 1 to 6 years of age to ensure a future to the school, all the children living within twelve miles.\n\nA good site for a day school would be Chezacuz Meadows. Father Hennessy thought you might be able, perhaps, to go up there in the fall and see the place yourself, and I will make arrangements for him to meet you whenever it is convenient.\n\nOn my recent visit to Enderby on Confirmation tour, I found a number of Indian Children not attending school and it was the opinion of Fr. Cullinan as well as my own, that a day school at Enderby would do a lot of good and would have a great influence on the Indian families and children.\n\nI will gladly confer with you about these two points at your convenience.\n\nWith kind personal regards, I am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW.M.DUKE\nArchbishop of Vancouver\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6425, file 872-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nJuly 12, 1940\n\nFile 15-16-6593\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 10th instant regarding the proposed Indian day school for the Alexis Creek Indian Band at Redstone. The official description of the land on which it is intended to erect the proposed school is Alexis Creek Indian Reserve No. 3. This was formerly known as Lot No. 1424.\n\nIn regard to the cost of cutting, peeling, and hauling logs to the school site, the Indians previously advised me that they were prepared to do this work in return for food whilst working, no cash wages being expected. This would also apply to the logs for the teacher's residence.\n\nIt would be necessary for me, however, to know the approximate size of the building before I could figure out the cost, and I would also have to see the Indians at Redstone regarding the distance from which logs require to be hauled. If you could advise me as to the estimated size of the contemplated buildings I will go into this matter with the Indians at the first opportunity. They are now widely scattered in remote haying meadows, inaccessible except with horses.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay\nIndian Commissioner\nBox 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6425, file 872-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the proposed Indian Day School for the Alexis Creek Band, I am of the opinion that the teacher's residence should be a part of the School building, mainly for simplicity in heating. The size and design of this residence would depend upon whether a married couple were employed, or only a single teacher. There was some question previously raised about this matter, and I understand that the Department prefers to have a married couple in isolated places where the man can teach and the wife can do a certain amount of first aid and home hygiene work amongst the Indians.\n\nI would submit that sufficient logs for any contemplated building could be cut and hauled and peeled for rations not exceeding $75.00 in value. The building of the School would be a separate matter. The Indians are competent to erect the building and finish it off, and they are prepared to do that work also on a ration basis with material supplied by the Department such as shingles, flooring, windows, etc. For this work I would suggest that a further sum of $125.00 be allowed for rations for the workmen. This would make a total of $200.00 with a possibility of perhaps reducing this a little.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M.

I do not consider it necessary for him to make a special trip for the purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a request from the Indian Agent of the Williams Lake Agency, for a survey of the school situation at Alexis Creek with a view to the establishment of a full-time Day School for these Indians in the near future.\n\nI would recommend that the Department authorize Inspector Barry to make a survey of the situation sometime in June, as at that time the Agent will be holding a meeting with the Indians and he would be able to meet a great number of them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nfor D.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n15/16/2904\n\nOttawa, July 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the construction of an Indian day school at Alexis Creek, Williams Lake Agency.\n\nWhen preparing the current year's appropriation it was found impossible to include any amount for the erection of a new Indian day school at any point in the Dominion. Under these circumstances, you will realize that we have no funds available for the erection of a school at Alexis Creek.\n\nI presume that the Indian Agent will include the amount in his estimates for the fiscal year 1948-49, and further consideration will be given to the matter when these are being prepared. However, I can hold out no hope that it will be possible to secure this amount of money.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you to Departmental letter 160-22-1 of August 26, 1940, with reference to the construction of an Indian Day School at Alexis Creek, Williams Lake Agency.\n\nWith special reference to the last sentence of the above quoted letter, I may say that the sum of $1,500.00 was included in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1941-42 to cover the construction of a day school at Alexis Creek.\n\nIn Departmental letter 159-36-5 of April 5, 1941, with reference to the Ahousaht Indian Day School, I was informed that no provision had been made in this year's estimates for the construction of Day or Residential schools anywhere in the Dominion. I should, however, be glad to know if it would be at all possible for the Department to make the comparatively small sum necessary for the construction of the Alexis Creek school available this year. The Indians of the Alexis Creek Band are still greatly interested in getting a school started. It will be remembered that the proposal was to erect a Day school on Alexis Creek Indian Reserve No. 3 to provide accommodation for forty pupils and teacher's quarters and that this school, if sanctioned, would be in operation from November 1 to March 31 yearly. The $1,500.00 mentioned above includes the sum of $200.00 for the furnishing of the teacher's residence.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n15/16/7321\n\nOttawa, August 28, 1940.\n\nRe: Construction of Alexis Creek Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 13th instant and also copy of certain correspondence relating to the construction of a school at Alexis Creek.\n\nI may state that there is nothing on file here relating to the construction of this school, other than the departmental letter dated April 30, 1938, referred to by you in your communication.\n\nI regret to state that no provision whatever was made in the estimates of this year for the construction of a school at Alexis Creek, nor will it be possible, in my judgment, to secure the comparatively small amount this year for the purpose of obtaining logs. However, in view of the number of children without educational facilities, it might be well to include an item for the construction of a school at Alexis Creek in the 1941-42 estimates. There is no assurance, of course, at this date, that the construction of a school will be authorized by the Government, but it might be well to have the claims of the district for a school carefully reviewed when the estimates for the coming year are under consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.

The Alexis Creek Band with 36 children of school age has not got a single child attending school and the Abraham Band, with a school population of 78, has 18 or 23% of the children of school age attending the Residential School. It would appear that no increase in pupilage accommodation has been provided for the past 40 years in this Agency.\n\nIn the Agent's opinion, this is a serious situation and one that will no doubt be sure to find expression in public sooner or later. Moreover, Indians are being called up for Military Training in the same manner as Whites and it must be very difficult for them, without even the rudiment of an education, to fit in to army life in this day and age. There is no doubt that they feel this handicap very keenly as I have been told on numerous occasions. It must also be borne in mind that, when this war ends, it is going to be extremely difficult for an Indian to get work and he will require to be better equipped for life than ever before.\n\nIn the present emergency it is no doubt difficult to get the material for building schools without taking into consideration the expense, but it is felt that some effort should be made to make a beginning at least in the establishment of Day Schools in the...\nReserves with a large and more compact population. In these circumstances, I would respectfully suggest that some consideration is given to the establishment of Day Schools on the Alexis Creek Indian Reserve on Redstone Meadows, and also on the Anaham Indian Reserve. Since the Alexis Creek Band have no contacts, at present at least, with the Cariboo Residential School, and since there has been some previous correspondence regarding the establishment of a Day School on this Reserve, it might be well to discuss the possibilities for such a project first.\n\nThe population of the Alexis Creek Band at present is 170. They live within a radius of two or four miles from Chief Charleyboy's land, on which the Church is built and a number of log cabins, which the Indians use during the periodic visits of the Missionary Priest. This Redstone Reserve is situated approximately 25 miles from the main highway running from Williams Lake to Kleena Kleene, 145 miles West of Williams Lake.\n\nAn item of $1,800.00 has been placed in the Estimates for construction of a log school house but in view of the difficulty experienced at present in securing an appropriation for any new buildings, I would suggest that the Church, a log building 24' x 30' is used for this purpose temporarily. Father Hennessey, the visiting Missionary, and the Indians have unanimously agreed that the Department have the use of the Church as a School building and the Priest House as a residence for the teacher. The Church is a well constructed log building with plenty of light and a suitable wood stove for heating purposes. The following material, however, will be required for interior furnishings:\n\nSchool Building\n\n- 1,000' dressed lumber for seats, desks, cupboards, from Duke Martin, Alexis Creek, B. C. $25.00\n- 500' rough lumber for two outside toilets @ $20. Per M 10.00\n- Nails 8.00\n- Blackboards 30.00\n- Freight on lumber to Redstone Meadows 30.00\n- Labour constructing seats, desks, and building toilets 75.00\n\nTotal $168.00\n\nTeachersage\n\n- Bed, Spring and Mattress 35.00\n- Cooking utensils, wash basin, brooms, etc. 30.00\n- Kerosene lamp 8.00\n- Camp stove and drum oven 15.00\n\nTotal $78.00\n\nThe greatest difficulty at the present time will no doubt be experienced in finding a suitable teacher. The ideal solution, since these Indians are all Roman Catholics, and it will therefore be left to the Roman Catholic Church to nominate teachers, would be to have two Sisters, one of whom had training as a Nurse and could do social work, similar to that done by district nurses in white settlements and outlying districts. The alternative would be to hire a woman without children, the wife to have had some experience or ability in social work and nursing. Since, however, the Priest's house on the Reserve is a one-roomed building, either of the latter suggestions would not be possible without an addition to the Priest's house to provide the necessary accommodation. It might be found advisable for the present to concentrate on a male teacher who is prepared to put\nup without any of the modern conveniences.\n\nThe duration of the school year on this Reserve should be for nine months, October to June, inclusive.\n\nANAHAM BAND\n\nThe Anaham Band with a population of 302 is the largest Band in this Agency. The Reserve on which their village is built contains some of the finest cultivated land in the Chilcotin, all in one block. The Anaham Indian village is situated on the main highway, 70 miles West of Williams Lake, and is supplied with a domestic water system. Should a school be established here, it is quite possible that a number of children from the Stone Reserve, 12 miles distant, might be able to make arrangements to attend.\n\nThe Church and Priest House on this Reserve are also available for school purposes, but the Community Hall, a log building 22' x 40', would be more satisfactory. This building will require the following material to make it comfortable, and the Indians have promised to contribute the labour:\n\nSchool Building\n\n- 2,000' shiplap for floor and ceiling $50.00\n- 1,500' shiplap to line walls inside $37.50\n- 6 rolls of Kraft sheathing paper for floors and walls @ $1.50 each $9.00\n- 2,000' dressed lumber for seats, desks, cupboards, etc. $25.00\n- Nails $0.00\n- Blackboard material $0.00\n- 1 large heating stove $0.00\n- Freight $0.00\n- Labour Free $0.00\n\nTotal $31.50\n\nTeachersage (for two teachers)\n\n- 2 beds, springs, and mattresses $50.00\n- Cooking utensils, wash basin, broom, etc. $40.00\n- 1 gasoline lamp & 2 coal oil lamps $12.00\n- Cook Stove $5.00\n- Heater $5.00\n\nTotal $102.00\n\nThe Priest's house on the Anaham Reserve is quite a good building with three small rooms, two of which can be used as bedrooms and the other as a living-room - kitchen. The accommodation, of course, is not all that could be desired since two teachers are required on this Reserve but it would suffice for the present.\n\nThe population of this village is not much short of that in Kitimat in the Bella Coola Agency and there is a better prospect of a much larger average attendance since there is no fishing season, and, therefore, no general exodus of the people for a large part of the year.\n\nWith 75 children of school age, two teachers are the minimum requirements here as there is no doubt that some now attending the Cariboo Indian Residential School will wish to return home, thus providing accommodation for children from other reserves where a Day School is not possible.\nI consider that the operation of a nine month school at the Anaham Reserve has a good chance of success and that the school year should be from October to June, inclusive.\n\nEnclosed is a list of the children of school age & pre-school age from the Alexis Creek and Anaham Bands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent (Acting)\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nEnc.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 160-22-1.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of July 15th, 1941, and previous correspondence relating to the provision of an Indian Day School for the Alexis Creek Indians.\n\nDuring a brief visit to the Alexis Creek and Anaham Reserves, the need of day schools in these Reserves was stressed by the Indians and, from the information given me at the time it was abundantly clear that something should be done as soon as possible to meet the situation. Following our meetings with the Bands mentioned I instructed Mr. Christie to secure the necessary information on the subject and let me have a report. This report has now been received and a copy is enclosed herewith.\n\nIt will be observed that there are, at present, 36 children of school age belonging to the Alexis Creek Band and 60 of the Anaham Band not attending any school. There is no accommodation for these children at any of the Catholic Residential schools, as nearly all of these schools are now carrying a few pupils in excess of the grant earning number.\n\nI advised Mr. Christie that in view of the fact that half of the school year was nearly over and, the difficulty in securing qualified teachers, that it was unlikely that we could do more than have certain repairs made to existing suitable buildings that might be used for school purposes and, secure the necessary equipment preparatory to opening the schools in June next. Mr. Christie estimates the amount required to put the buildings in proper shape and secure certain equipment and furnishings at $629.50, but I doubt if this is sufficient and, would recommend that favourable consideration be given to authorizing an expenditure up to $1000.00 for these purposes. An amount\n\np.t.o.\namount of $1500.00 was included in the current year's Estimates to meet probable costs in this connection. Should the Department approve immediate steps will be taken to purchase the equipment, materials etc., to have the buildings in readiness for the coming school year.\n\nD. M.

The Indians in this band are all members of the Catholic Church. It is stated that the present population of the Alexis Creek Band is 170. They live within a radius of two to four miles of the Chief's property on which the church is built. The local missionary and the Indians have unanimously agreed to allow the Department to have the use of the church as a school building and the Priest's house as a residence for the teacher. The church is a well constructed log building with plenty of light and a suitable wood stove for heating purposes. It will be necessary to supply some material for interior furnishings.\n\nIn view of the information outlined above I believe it would be advisable to open a school on this reserve and, in order to comply with Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, an Order-in-Council is required. I attach Memorandum to Council.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP\n\nIndian Affairs.

While no salary is mentioned, it is presumed that this would be at the rate of $100.00 per month. I am prepared to recommend Father Hennessy's appointment on a strictly temporary basis, to terminate immediately a teacher could be secured, and would also recommend that every effort be made to secure such a teacher.\n\nI enclose herewith a list showing the vacancies existing in the Indian Day Schools in this Province at the present time, from which it will be observed that in some instances the schools without quarters are paying less salary than those with quarters and heat. This subject will be further discussed with you if teachers become available. I am of the opinion that the minimum salary for a teacher of a school without quarters should be $100.00 per month under present conditions.\n\nFor D.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nOctober 15, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nSince the Catholic Church have failed up to the present to supply teachers for the Indian Day Schools at Redstone Meadows and Anaham reserves, I would respectfully suggest that you consider the appointment of Father Hennessy as teacher at Redstone Meadows, commencing November 1st until the end of March or until suitable teachers are found.\n\nFather Hennessy has been so struck with the enthusiasm of the Redstone Indians regarding the Day School and with the work they have done - they have built a log residence for the teachers comprising a fairly large kitchen-livingroom and two bedrooms, built seats and desks and painted them - that he felt it would be too bad to let them down now. Moreover Father Hennessy feels that he has not enough to do in the Winter months when travelling to outlying reserves is curtailed to some extent.\n\nFather Hennessy has already received permission from the Rev. Principal of the Cariboo Indian School and also the Provincial of the Oblates and despite the fact that he may not have the required teaching certificate, I feel sure that he will fill the position very well, for the present, and I recommend that he is paid the salary allotted.\n\nI wrote Archbishop Duke recently regarding teachers and His Excellency advised me that he was going east and would try and contact some of the Orders of Nuns but I think it would be well to accept Fr Hennessy's offer pro tem and as soon as possible.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 14, 1943.\n\nEX'D\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer you to previous correspondence with reference to the establishment of schools on the Alexis Creek and Anaham Lake Reserves. In official letter of March 13 last I advised you regarding the amount we were prepared to allow as salary.\n\nAs yet we have not had any information from you that you have been able to secure teachers and I presume you are having considerable difficulty in this regard. However, in order to keep our files up to date I should appreciate hearing what the prospects are of securing teachers for these two schools.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1943.\n\nThe Alexis Creek Band started work on their road and on the school on June 1st. The work was well organized by Chief Charleyboy and the foreman. An old grader blade was procured from the P.W.D. and a home-made grader constructed from hewn timbers which powered by a six horse team did excellent work. They also undertook the construction of a log house for the school teacher which was no small job since the logs had to be hauled three or four miles to the site. It speaks well for the integrity of Chief Charleyboy that he produced 40 lbs of sugar which he had locked up for two years, left over from a previous food allowance, for roadwork.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 22, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 160-22-1\n\nI would refer to my letter of March 5th, 1943, in respect to alterations and improvements to the Alexis Creek Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection, I enclose herewith a letter dated the 10th instant received from Mr. Indian Agent Christie advising that he was unable to complete the work during the last fiscal year owing to the fact that suitable lumber was unobtainable and he now wishes to secure authorization to expend $75.00 for completion of the work.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me if this amount could be made available.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\nEnc.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nMay 10, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nSince it was impossible to get the repairs done to the school building, building toilets and constructing seats and desks for the Jay School at Redstone Meadows in the past financial year due to the fact that it was impossible to get other than green lumber, I would now respectfully request that the amount of money estimated for food rations to the Indians while engaged in this work, is now made available. The sum mentioned was $75.00, and it is hoped to start this work immediately the roadwork is completed.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box\n70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, in which you state that you have secured the materials required for repairing the building to be used for school purposes on the Alexis Creek Reserve. It is also noted that you have placed an order for the furnishings for the teacher's living quarters.\n\nIn view of the recommendation contained in the last paragraph of your letter, the teacher will be allowed salary at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month. A circular letter is going forward in the near future advising you that in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44 provision is being made to operate Indian day schools on a ten-month basis. Under these circumstances I presume that the Alexis Creek School will open on September 1, 1943. I suggest that you consult the Church authorities immediately in the hope that he can secure a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school. I know you will agree with me that it is very important that this teacher should be secured at the start.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 160-22-1\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 15th, 1943, regarding the establishment of an Indian Day School on Alexis Creek Reserve (Redstone Meadows), I beg to advise that a Purchase Order has been issued for the materials required. It is expected that the necessary alterations and improvements to the building to be used for school purposes and also the house intended for use as a teacher's residence will be completed before the commencement of the new school year. An Order has also been placed for the furnishings required for the teacher's quarters.\n\nFollowing a review of the subject with Mr. Indian Agent Christie, it was decided that this school should be operated on a yearly basis from October 1st to June 30th, and that the teacher's salary be at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month, and I would so recommend.\n\nD.

The Agent states that Father Hennessy reported to him that the children and their parents would have liked to see the school continue and, in Father Hennessy's opinion, a good attendance could have been obtained to the end of May at least. However, it appears that Father Hennessy had to resume his missionary activities on the other reserves and, as a consequence, had to give up his duties as teacher of the school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would make another endeavour to secure teachers for both the Anaham and Alexis Creek Schools for next year.\n\nR.A.

There were 26 pupils on the roll and the average attendance for the quarter ending March 31st was 22.7.\n\nIt is to be hoped that teachers will be found for both Anaham and Alexis Creek Day schools before the next school year.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON WILLIAMS LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1944.\n\nEducation;\n\nAlexis Creek Indian Day School was visited, when twenty miles had to be negotiated in low gear owing to the heavy snowfall. The general spirit of the teacher and pupils was found to be excellent, and I consider good progress has been made in the short time this school has been open. The pupils were quite responsive, and most of them could do additions up to nine. Flash cards were being used and there was a good competitive spirit between the boys and girls. Some of the children read out loud quite well, but most of them were rather shy when reading alone. Numerous drawings in crayon have been done, all of them of familiar subjects, such as horses, moose, coyotes, cowboys, etc. Some of the older girls around twenty years of age were left in charge of the younger children while their parents went on their traplines, and these girls also attend school.\n\nI would suggest that hot cocoa and some of the pilot bread taken over from the military authorities be supplied next winter for the children's mid-day meal.\n\nWm.

Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nEDUCATION:\n\nThe Caribou Indian Residential School opened on September 1st and the Anaham Indian Day School on September 4th, 1945. The return of the pupils to the Residential School was much better this year. It was expected that there would have been very poor attendance at the Anaham Indian Day School during September due to the fact that most of the Indians were still having away from the main Reserve, but a special effort was made to get their children back in time and practically all the pupils who attended last year are now back.\n\nThere are now fourteen pupils in the senior room and they show a very keen competitive spirit. Sr. Mary of the Angels, teacher of the senior room, visited St. Mary's school at Mission last year and saw the Pro-rec. work, and now has her pupils started on this type of physical education.\n\nDuring the Indian Commissioner's visit, a site was chosen for a new school on this Reserve, and, as soon as it is possible to get a representative meeting, the Indians will be asked to surrender this land to the Department for school purposes.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has not yet found a teacher for the Alexis Creek Day School, but Fr. Hennessy will, in all probability, fill for the winter months, i.e. November to March. With the erection of a school and living quarters, it may be possible to get the Missionary Sisters of Christ the King to supply a teacher for this school next year.\n\nIt was thought that there might be great difficulty in getting new pupils for the Cariboo Indian Residential School this season due to the non-payment of Family Allowance to pupils attending Residential Schools, and, although the principal advises me that he is ten pupils short of the number provided for by the Department in the grant, there\n\n(over)\nOttawa, November 15, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, the Department approves the re-appointment of Rev. J. W. Hennessey as teacher of the Redstone Meadows (Alexis Creek) Indian Day School. We have notified the Treasury Branch so that Father Hennessey's cheque will be sent to him at the end of each month.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 12th October, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Alexis Creek Indian Day School, No. 872\n\nThis school will be in operation from November 1, 1945 to March 31, 1946, and we have re-appointed Reverend J.W. Hennessy, who was in charge of the school last winter. Salary should be allowed him at the rate of $100 a teaching month. We already have on file the necessary forms.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 160-22-1\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of October 18th, 1944, approving the appointment of Reverend J. W. Hennessy as teacher of the Redstone Meadows Indian Day School (Alexis Creek School) for the period November 1st, 1944, to March 31, 1945.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Christie's letter of November 6th is attached hereto from which it will be noted that Father Hennessy opened the Redstone Meadows School on November 1st and that it will likely continue in session until the end of March. It is recommended that Father Hennessy's appointment be approved at the same salary as last year, namely, $100.00 a teaching month.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.,\nNovember 6, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nThis is to advise you that Rev. J. Hennessy opened the Kelowna Meadows Indian Day School on November 1st.\n\nIt would appear that I overlooked obtaining permission from the Department for the appointment of Father Hennessy for this academic year, and I do not know whether Archbishop Duke has made any recommendation. There is no doubt, however, that the Department is exceedingly fortunate in getting a teacher of Father Hennessy's calibre, and I trust that the oversight will be excused.\n\nThe school will be in session until at least the end of March. Father Hennessy will then have to resume his missionary activities on the Indian Reserves.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Agent.\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\nFebruary 18, 1948.\n\nW. S.

Father Hennessy was forwarded a cheque for the month of January and in view of your statement that the school was not in operation, this cheque should be returned to us.\n\nPlease let me know the reason why Father Hennessy has given up duties.

May I please be advised if we are to continue to refer to this school as Redstone Meadows as authorized in Mr. Phelan's letter referred to or if we are to revert to the name Alexis Creek Indian Day School.\n\nW.S.

The general spirit of the teacher and pupils was found to be excellent, and I consider good progress has been made in the short time this school has been open. The pupils were quite responsive, and most of them could do additions up to nine. Flash cards were being used and there was a good competitive spirit between the boys and girls. Some of the children read out loud quite well, but most of them were rather shy when reading alone. Numerous drawings in crayon have been done, all of them of familiar subjects, such as horses, moose, coyotes, cowboys, etc. Some of the older girls around twenty years of age were left in charge of the younger children while their parents went on their traplines, and these girls also attend school.\n\nI would suggest that hot cocoa and some of the pilot bread taken over from the military authorities be supplied next winter for the children's mid-day meal.\n\nWm.

Hennessy\nEDUCATION\n\nDay School on Redstone Meadows Reserve closed at the end of March as Father Hennessy has to resume his Missionary work on the other Reserves. Good progress is being made here considering school is open for only five months and the Agent was particularly impressed with the drawings done by these children who took part in the Tuberculosis poster competition and also in the one sponsored by the Department of National Health and Welfare on foods. It was noted that the water supply on this reserve and school is bad, especially in the spring when the spring run-off from the surrounding horse and cattle corrals must pollute the drinking water. The Indians were asked to dig two wells for the village and another for the school and no doubt the Department will agree to provide the necessary lumber for lumber for cribbing and perhaps two pumps so that the well can be closed in.\n\nWm.

Vancouver, plus freight and erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses;\n\nThat it is considered that the provision of this school is a pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above recited and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted for the provision of this building as outlined above, this being the only arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried to completion in order that the building will be available for use by the time the next school term commences.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nREF SIGNALS MESSAGE JUNE 30TH PLEASE ARRANGE FOR ISSUANCE PURCHASE ORDER COVERING FOUR PREFABRICATED ONE ROOM SCHOOLS FOR REDSTONE KLEMTU STONY CREEK AND NE\u0160KAINLITH SUBJECT TO ISSUANCE OF SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS BY THIS OFFICE STOP AIRMAILING YOU REGARDING PROPOSED SCHOOL NORTH THOMPSON AND OTHER SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION\n\nWS ARNEIL INDIAN COMMISSIONER\nREF SIGNALS MESSAGE ARRANGE FOR ISSUANCE PURCHASE ORDER COVERING 4 PRE-FABRICATED ONE ROOM SCHOOLS FOR REDSTONE, KLEMTU, STONEY CREEK AND NESKAINTLITH SUBJECT TO ISSUANCE OF SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS BY THIS OFFICE STOP AIR MAILING YOU REGARDING PROPOSED SCHOOL NORTH THOMPSON AND OTHER SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION.\n\nW.S.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: New School - Redstone\n\nAttached is a tender on the basement for new school at Redstone Meadows from Mr. George Taylor and Mr. Vogelaar of Williams Lake.\n\nThese contractors have not had any experience with pre-fabricated buildings and for that reason did not wish to contract for erection of the building.\n\nI suggested that the concrete part of the basement only come to one foot above ground level as this would save on cement and freight which costs \u00a325.00 per ton from Williams Lake. Moreover it will make a more comfortable basement which can be used as a Community Centre and manual training room.\n\nThe price seems quite high but freight is a large item and it is difficult to get a contractor to go out to these isolated locations.\n\nThe wages mentioned are presumably the union rates but you could check on this at Vancouver.\n\nMessrs Taylor and Vogelaar, one of whom will be going out as foreman carpenter are good workers and are at present building an addition to the Bank of Montreal here.\n\nShould this tender and arrangements be considered satisfactory I will take these men out to mark out the foundation for excavation at once.\n\nWm.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\nDecember 2nd, 1948.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: New School - Redstone.\n\nIn connection with the construction of the new school at Redstone Meadows, I received an accountable advance of $1500.00.\n\nThis school is finished and the carpenters have returned to Williams Lake and I find that the wages amount to $1846.02, to date.\n\nIt will therefore be appreciated if the Department will air mail another advance of $600.00 which will take care of the wages to date and also provide wages for the installation of furnace, construction of two outside toilets and putting school desks on 1 x 4's.\n\nIf it is proposed to put in a pressure water system and plumbing an additional amount will be required but it might be well to leave this work until spring in view of the winter conditions now prevailing.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: New School - Redstone\n\nThe expenditure covered by Williams Lake Agency voucher No. 659 attached, and as explained in Supt. Christie's letter of November 25th enclosed, obviously was necessary, but it is questionable whether the entire amount expended, $198.25, is properly chargeable to the Education Vote.\n\nI would suggest that if funds are available approximately half the amount should be charged to the Agency's Vote 511-13-492 and the remainder to Vote 516. The road upon which the funds were expended, in addition to providing access to the school, will also serve the Indians of the Band.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nWilliams Lake, B. C.\nNovember 25, 1948.\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B. C.\n\nIn explanation of the attached Voucher which should have had the Department's authorization, I would submit the following information.\n\nThere is 22 miles of road into Redstone Meadows Indian Day School which has been entirely constructed by the Indians with a little assistance from the Department in 1942 amounting to about $200.00 for food. Since all the work was done with horses and hand labour it was only possible to do a minimum of work and since there are no white settlers living on this road, no assistance was provided by the Provincial Government.\n\nThe excessive rains this summer added to the difficulties of transporting materials for the construction of the new school and the first two truckloads got mired, one of them breaking an axle about six miles from their destination in crossing the edge of a meadow and the freight including 350 sacks of cement had to be unloaded.\n\nSomething had to be done in a hurry and I contacted Mr. Knoll who was busy haying. He very kindly took his bulldozer about twelve miles across country and bulldozed a road around this meadow, also fixing up some other bad holes near the school.\n\nHe spent 20 hours travelling back and forward and half of this time was charged to Taylor & Vogelaar for whom he also excavated the basement of the school.\n\nThis account should be charged to improvement to roads and I trust will meet with your approval.\n\nWm.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nRe: Alexis Creek Indian Day School - Redstone Meadows\n\nEnclosed herewith is credit voucher # 99 for wages paid in connection with the construction of the new school at Redstone Meadows.\n\nI regret the delay in forwarding this Voucher and I might add that I am recently in receipt of a letter from Superintendent of Education, Mr Neary in this connection.\n\nAs you may recall this school was practically completed by November 27th but unfortunately the workmen ran short of siding. When the siding came I made up a load with school desks, shiplap for toilets and two tons of grain for the Indians, trucking of the latter to be paid from the appropriation for that purpose.\n\nI had also arranged to take Mr Taylor in the same day to finish the school and set up the desks but he excused himself at the last moment. Subsequently I had to get his partner to go in Mr Vogelaar and I had him set up the desks on 1\" x 4\", all the school-room floor and finish the siding. It appears however that Mr Taylor did not estimate correctly the amount of siding that was short and about 160f.b.m. is still required. I do not propose to hire a carpenter for the balance of this work however which can be done in a short time with Indian help.\n\nCompletion of the heating system by Mr Schwab of Mitchell Brothers is still awaited but this should not take very long. With the recent heavy snowfall and drifted roads it may be difficult to get into Redstone Meadows for a few weeks in view of the fact that there is 22 miles of this road which is not snow-plowed.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding expenditures for wages in connection with the construction of the new day School at Redstone Meadows, a credit Vr. #99 has been forwarded to the Indian Commissioner with pay lists amounting to $1364.53.\n\nI received two advances amounting in all to $2100.00 and I have now submitted credit vouchers amounting to $1930.09 which leaves a balance unexpended amounting to $169.91.\n\nSome difficulty has been experienced in getting this school completed although it was practically finished in November. Unfortunately however there was a shortage of material in connection with the heating system and also in the material supplied by Pre-fabricated Buildings Ltd.\n\nI am still awaiting completion of the heating system which is being done by Mitchell Brothers man at present working on the Anaham Indian Day School. The recent heavy snowfall may further delay this work as it is difficult to get into the meadows now with a motor vehicle and tradesmen do not appreciate travelling by sleigh any more.\n\nHowever, I put on a National Film Board show in the new school at Redstone Meadows on Xmas week and found the temporary heating arrangements quite comfortable, and I can assure the Department that they have got a very good and suitable building.\n\nWm. Christie,\nIndian Superintendent.\n23rd February, 1949.\n\nMr. W. Christie,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th instant enclosing Credit Voucher No. 99 in connection with the Redstone Meadows (Alexis Creek) Indian Day School.\n\nWe hope that you can arrange to have the heating system completely installed before the end of March so that it will not be necessary to expend any funds from the 1949 - 50 appropriation in connection with the completion of this school.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

You will recall that this matter was briefly discussed with you when you visited this office some weeks ago.\n\nFollowing representations dating back to August last, Mr. R. Nelson of Nelson Brothers, visited this office on Wednesday when this subject was reviewed. I assured Mr. Nelson that I felt the Department would not hesitate to provide the necessary equipment and authorize the appointment of a teacher once suitable accommodation could be secured. Mr. Nelson advised that a suitable building was not available at the present time but that the Company had under consideration plans which if carried out would make available early in the New Year a building that could be used for school purposes until better arrangements could be made. He promised to advise me more definitely in this connection at an early date and when this information is received here you will be further advised. In the meantime the Department is being asked to authorize the employment of a teacher and the purchase of blackboards and other equipment so that necessary action may be taken once we are assured that a suitable building will be made available.\n\nWhen Inspector Thorsteinsson was here he intimated that he might be able to assist us in securing a qualified teacher to operate the school. Please discuss this point with him and let me have the necessary particulars in order that the matter may be referred to the Department. As the Indians concerned belong to various Protestant bodies I should say that the Department would be in a position to make an appointment without the necessity of securing the usual Church nomination.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nDecember 1, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nHave just returned from Fort Edward, after conferring with Mr. Robbins, Manager of Nelson Brothers' Cannery relative to school facilities for Indian children at that place. I gathered that the Commissioner had discussed the matter with Mr. Richard Nelson.\n\nMr. Robbins will make it feasible for the Chinese dining-room to be converted into a room for school purposes. It is forty feet long and twelve feet wide, with a good heater, electric light, and four flush toilets, for which partitions will be erected so that two will be in each room. The Company will provide the coal and light.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to provide a teacher, this building would be available the first of January. Not less than forty desks will be required. The desks should be ten large, twenty medium, and ten small. Approximately thirty lineal feet of blackboard will be required.\n\nThe building mentioned above will be used up to April 1st, after which date a building now used by the white people as a dining-room will be available, unless we can secure one of the American buildings near the cannery site.\n\nI hope to be in Vancouver on the 15th, and will explain the building situation then.\n\nJ.G./k.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nFor some time the question of providing educational facilities for the children of Indians employed at the Fort Edward Cannery has been under consideration with Nelson Brothers who own and operate the plant. The matter has progressed to the stage where the Company has accepted responsibility for providing the necessary classroom accommodation which will be in readiness by January 1st. There are at present thirty Indian children of school age available to attend with a possibility of twenty more after the new year.\n\nIt is considered that advantage should be taken of the offer made by the Company and in order to avoid undue delay in getting the school started I should appreciate authority to purchase the necessary desks, blackboards, teacher's desk and chair and other items of equipment necessary in a classroom. There are at the moment ten or twelve complete desks surplus to requirements at the Pemberton Indian Day School and it is my intention to send these to Fort Edward unless the Department instructs otherwise.\n\nIt is doubtful if a nomination is necessary in this case as the Indians employed at Fort Edward belong to various religious denominations and I would, therefore, suggest that an appointment be made without reference to the Church once the services of a properly qualified teacher can be secured.\n\nCopies of correspondence in connection with this matter are enclosed for your information.\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDecember 18, 1944.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT there are thirty (30) Indian children of school age residing near the Port Edward Cannery, Skeena Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided;\n\nTHAT funds are available in Vote 165, 1944-45, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school at Port Edward.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that a day school be established at Port Edward, Skeena Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 92, 1887, to be known as \"The Port Edward Indian Day School\".\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to providing educational facilities for the children of Indians employed at the Port Edward Cannery. It is noted that Nelson Brothers are prepared to provide a building for classroom purposes. You do not mention any living quarters for the teacher, but presumably these are available.\n\nIn order to permit our paying salary for a teacher at this point it will be necessary for us to establish the school as required under Section 9A of the Indian Act. We have made application for the necessary Order-in-Council and I am hopeful that this will be passed in the near future. Until this is done we cannot definitely approve the opening of the school. However, in the meantime I should appreciate your making inquiries with a view to securing a qualified teacher to take charge of the school and I would also like you to let me know what salary you consider we should allow in the event of the school being opened.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, December 12, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay has brought to our attention the necessity of providing educational facilities for the children of Indians employed at the Port Edward Cannery, Skeena Agency, British Columbia. This cannery is operated by Nelson Brothers, who are prepared to provide a building for classroom purposes. This building is stated to be 40 ft. long, 12 ft. wide, heated, lighted by electricity and with four flush toilets available. The Company is prepared to supply this building and heat it free of cost.\n\nWe would have to supply a few desks, blackboards and other small items of classroom equipment as well as pay the salary of the teacher.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay and Agent Gillett strongly recommend that the offer be accepted and that the school be placed in operation on January 1, 1945. In order to permit us to do so, an Order-in-Council will be necessary, establishing the school, as required under Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act. I enclose Memorandum to Council, which, I hope, meets with your approval.\n\nActing Director.\n\nEncl.\nAT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA\n\nTUESDAY, the 19th day of DECEMBER, 1944\n\nPRESENT:\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nWHEREAS the Minister of Mines and Resources reports that there are thirty (30) Indian children of school age residing near the Port Edward Cannery, Skeena Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia, for whom at present no educational facilities are provided; and\n\nThat funds are available in Vote 165, 1944-45, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for the establishment of a day school at Port Edward;\n\nTHEREFORE, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, and pursuant to the provisions of Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, Chapter 98, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is pleased to order that a day school be and it is hereby established at Port Edward, Skeena Indian Agency, to be known as \"The Port Edward Indian Day School\".\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant and my reply of the 15th instant, we have now secured the necessary Order-in-Council establishing a school at the Port Edward Cannery. In subsequent correspondence this school should be referred to as \"The Port Edward Indian Day School.\"\n\nYou may purchase the pupils' desks, blackboards, teacher's desk and chair and other items of equipment that are necessary. As the end of the fiscal year is approaching our finances have been nearly all allocated and it would, therefore, be appreciated if you would keep the expenditures as low as possible. I note that there are ten or twelve desks surplus to requirements at the Pemberton Indian Day School which can be transferred to the Port Edward School.\n\nI presume that you will advise me later regarding the name and qualifications of the teacher secured. At that time you should make a recommendation regarding the salary that you consider should be allowed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1944.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the enclosed letter regarding the Port Edward School, I would appreciate your advising the post office address and also the freight and express address of this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M.

Gillett, Indian Agent,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like you to consider this as an application for the position of school teacher for a vacancy at the beginning of the school term in January.\n\nI hold a B.C. Second class certificate, had eight years experience in B.C. schools before I married, and later, due to illness of my husband, did substitute work, totalling about three terms. Due to lack of pupils we are unable to secure a school here, and our two children are enrolled with the Correspondence Course.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you about possible vacancies especially in the district near Alice Arm.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6425, file 873-1, part 1)\nAlice Arm, B.C.\nDec. 16, 1945\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett,\n\nThank you for your letter of Nov. 23rd, with details concerning the Greenville school. I would not have been able to accept a position before Jan., so you can definitely count Greenville out as far as I'm concerned, as I understand transportation is uncertain then.\n\nI would be interested in a position at Pt. Edward, so would be pleased to have word from you about when you expect to have it established, etc., at any time during the term would suit me. I can let you know about definite plans later on.\n\nThanking you for your letter.\n\nSincerely, (Mrs) Emma Leake\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 168-38-1\n\nI have your letter of December 28th advising that an Order-in-Council has been secured establishing a school at the Port Edward Cannery, to be known as the Port Edward Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Gillett has been successful in securing a teacher for this School and I enclose herewith letters dated November 18th and December 16th from Mrs. Mina Leake from which it will be noted that she holds a B.C. second class certificate and is prepared to accept the position as teacher. I would recommend approval of Mrs. Leake's appointment at a salary of $105.00 a month and will advise you in due course of the date that she assumes her duties. In recommending this salary I have in mind that the teacher will secure accommodation for herself at Port Edward.\n\nWith reference to the supply of desks, blackboards and other items of equipment, I may say that Mr. Indian Agent Daunt has recently advised that there are 33 desks at the Katzie School which could be transferred in addition to the 12 at the Pemberton School. The Katzie School has been closed for some years and it is not anticipated that it will be reopened owing to the lack of sufficient pupils.\n\nI am today writing to Mr. Indian Agent Gillett requesting that he advise you of the post office address and also the freight and express address of the School.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, advising that you have secured Mrs. Mina Leake as teacher of the Fort Edward Day School. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $105 a month, on the understanding that the teacher secures her own accommodation at Fort Edward.\n\nIt is noted that the desks, blackboard and other items of equipment can be transferred from Indian day schools which are not open at the present time.\n\nMrs. Leake should complete and return the usual forms as soon as she begins duties.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nREPORT ON SKEENA RIVER AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nWe have been endeavouring to have some understanding with the management of the Port Edward Cannery with reference to providing a school building. It looks now as if this will be provided in time to have schools open 1st of January if approved by the Department.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 168-38-1\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of January 5th approving of the appointment of Mrs. Mina Leake as teacher at the Port Edward Indian Day School. Mrs. Leake subsequently advised that she would be unable to accept the position and in the absence of any other suitable teacher I would like to recommend that Captain E.L. Bailey, teacher of the Kitselas Indian Day School, be transferred to Port Edward on a temporary basis until such time as we can secure a qualified teacher.\n\nI have discussed this matter with the Divisional Commander of the Salvation Army who has secured authority for Captain Bailey's transfer from his National Headquarters. I may say that this transfer is considered advisable not only for the purpose of securing a teacher for the Port Edward School but in order that we may close the Kitselas School where the enrollment has fallen below five.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, February 2, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you advise that Mrs. Mina Leake refused the appointment as teacher of the Port Edward School.\n\nI also note your recommendation that Captain E. L. Bailey, teacher of the Kitselas School, be transferred to Port Edward. The Department approves this transfer, and we understand that the Kitselas School will be closed, owing to lack of attendance. As you are aware, Miss Bailey has been paid $90.00 a teaching month at Kitselas. Do you recommend that she be continued at the same salary or that she be allowed the salary promised for Mrs. Mina Leake, namely $105.00 a month?\n\nPlease let me know the exact date on which Miss Bailey transfers from Kitselas to Port Edward, in order that we may adjust the paylist.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYour File 168-38-1\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of February 2nd regarding the transfer of Captain E.L. Bailey, teacher of the Kitselas School, to the Port Edward Indian Day School, as Captain Bailey will be required to provide her own accommodation at Port Edward I would recommend that salary be allowed her at the rate of $105.00 a month as was authorized for Mrs. Mina Leake.\n\nI will advise you in due course of the date Captain Bailey transfers from Kitselas to Port Edward.\n\nD.M.

It is noted that she took charge of the Port Edward School on February 12. Salary will be allowed her from that date at the rate of $105.00 a teaching month.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, February 22, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Port Edward Indian Day School, No. 873.\nRe: Kitselas Indian Day School, No. 823.\n\nPlease note that the Department has transferred Captain E. L. Bailey from the Kitselas School (No. 823) to the Port Edward School (No. 873). Captain Bailey taught at the Kitselas School from February 1 to 11, both dates inclusive, at the rate of $80.00 a month. She was in charge of the Port Edward School from February 12 to February 28, 1945, both dates inclusive, at a salary of $105.00 a month. This is a new school, established by P.C. 3362, dated December 19, 1944.\n\nI enclose copy of letter authorizing the employment of Captain Bailey at the Port Edward School at the rate mentioned above. You should continue paying her at the rate of $105 as teacher of the Port Edward School until you hear further from this Branch.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nREPORT ON NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY FOR THE YEAR ENDING 1944-45.\n\nSchools: Three day schools have been operated throughout the year, viz: Pemberton, Chehalis and Skwah. The fourth school at Katzie Reserve has remained closed, and the desks have been shipped to the Skeen Agency.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\nTraining.\n\nIn February a school was established at Port Edward, at which place there are a number of Indians employed in a fish cannery. It is functioning very satisfactorily and looks as if it will be a permanent affair.\n\nGwinaha has not a teacher, and the Kitselas teacher was transferred to Port Edward, as the attendance at Kitselas had dwindled to three.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nMay 28, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver\n\nI wish to advise that the Indian Day School at Port Edward had to be closed on May 18th as Nelson Bros. required the building which we were using for a school, as a dining room for some Chinese workers who had recently arrived.\n\nWe had hoped to have secured an unoccupied building belonging to the American Army and were in correspondence with the authorities concerned. Up to the 10th of May it appeared that we would be successful but, although the majority of the army had evacuated, plans now have been changed and all available buildings will again be occupied.\n\nMiss Bailey is at present in Prince Rupert and she believes that she will be assigned other duties by the church authorities, in which case I take it, we will not be responsible for her salary after the end of May. She has no intention, however, of teaching in September. We will have her submit a resignation to this effect.\n\nThe school material has been stored at Port Edward and some arrangements will be made so that we have a building for school purposes in September.\n\nReports on the school are attached.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG:F\nAtt'd-reports\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of May 28th from which it will be noted that the temporary day school at Fort Edward was closed on May 16th due to the Cannery requiring the building which had been used for a school room.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Gillett requesting that he secure Miss Bailey's resignation effective May 31st and would recommend that she be paid salary up to and including that date.\n\nD.

Cannery site.\n\nThe Special Commissioner for Defence Projects in Northwest Canada, Edmonton, writes as follows:\n\n\"As it will be necessary for your Department to arrange the details of the transfer at such time as the area is declared surplus, it is suggested that you submit the matter to your headquarters in Ottawa for attention. If a building is urgently required for school use, the Department may be prepared to make immediate provision through other channels\".\n\nI consider that the building is urgently required as the one provided by Nelson Bros. is not satisfactory.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of the 11th instant advising that he was informed that the United States Army buildings at Port Edward near Prince Rupert would soon be declared surplus and that he made application for one of these described as T-1409 but was informed by the Special Commissioner for Defence Projects in Northwest Canada, Edmonton, that it will be necessary for the matter to be handled through your office.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Gillett asking him to furnish you with full details of the building by air mail in order that you can give the matter consideration.\n\nThe building in question is required for use as an Indian Day School at Port Edward as that which was formerly occupied for this purpose was taken back by the Cannery for use as a dining room for Chinese employees.\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nSept. 11, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nRe: Teacher for Port Edward Indian Day School\n\nIt is not possible to secure a qualified teacher for the above school. I recommend that Miss Olive Wishart be appointed.\n\nMiss Wishart has completed four years high school. Last year she helped her sister at Metlakatla and during the summer took a course at the Summer School in Victoria.\n\nShe has ability and is capable of leadership. I feel certain that she would have good control in the school.\n\nPending the possibility of securing one of the United States Army buildings, Nelson Bros. will allow us to use the building we had last year. This latter will be available some time in October.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG:f\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of September 11th wherein he recommends that Miss Olive Wishart be appointed for the position of teacher at the Port Edward Indian Day School.\n\nOn the date of the Provincial School Inspector's visit to this school in May of last year there were 45 pupils enrolled and it is thought that the enrollment will not be much less this year.\n\nMiss Wishart, although not a qualified teacher, is apparently the best available and her appointment is recommended for approval.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, October 3, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 26th ultimo, the Department approves the\nappointment of Miss Olive Wishart as teacher\nof the Port Edward School, at a salary of $105.00\na teaching month.\n\nI presume that miss Wishart will\nbe prepared to begin duties in the near future,\nand as soon as she does so, you should have her\nprepare and forward to this office the usual\nforms.\n\nFor Deputy Minister\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nOct. 11, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nYour file 213-8-2655\n\nWith reference to your letter of Oct. 2nd, requesting more details as to pupilage etc. for the Fort Edward school, I wish to advise that there are 61 children their from the following Bands:\n\n- Kincolith - 9\n- Fort Simpson - 8\n- Nassett - 13\n- Skidegate - 1\n\nThe parents of these children state that they will be remaining there from now until the next salmon season. There will be a large increase in pupils during the herring season which is usually from December to March. It is not likely that the canning of herring will continue after this year if the food supply in Europe improves. However, according to information given by the management of the cannery, there will be at least 20 children there continually even if the herring cannery does not operate and during March each year, cannery workers are taken on for repair work; this will mean an increase in pupilage. I might point out that the B.C. Packers have a reduction plant at Fort Edward and some of the Indians are employed by them. This plant will continue to operate even if the canning of herring is discontinued in 1947.\n\nMy opinion is that a school will always be needed at Port Edward as long as the salmon industry continues.\n\nAt present nothing can be done towards securing a lease on the land on which the building stands because the final transfer through the War Assets Board has not yet been completed. It is the intention of the Nelson Brothers Cannery to apply for a lease of land which would include the\nschool site. It appears there is no doubt that the cannery people will take the land as soon as it can be arranged. They in turn will lease Lot #10 to our department at a very nominal rate, so that we will have complete control of the building and the lot.\n\nIn the meantime I would recommend that we use the same building we used last year, namely the Chinese workers dining room. This is available now and before the salmon season opens next year it is possible that the building and lot now belonging to the U.S. Army, could be transferred to our department.\n\nIn a previous letter we recommended Miss Olive Wishart as teacher for the Port Edward school. She is still available and I consider her quite capable of handling the school.\n\nI would appreciate an early reply so that we can open the school with the 31 children now there.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nFurther to my letter of October 2nd in connection with the proposed acquisition of a United States Army building at Port Edward for use as a classroom, I enclose Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of October 11th from which it will be noted that Nelson Brothers Cannery have a suitable building available and that it is the intention of Nelson Brothers Cannery to apply for lease of the land which would include the Army buildings and that they are prepared to lease the school site to the Department at a very nominal rate.\n\nI have pointed out to Mr. Indian Agent Gillett that the Port Edward Indian Day School was established by Order-in-Council and that the Department has approved the appointment of Miss Olive Wishart as teacher and, consequently, no further authority is required to open the school immediately.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 29th October, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of October 2nd and 16th in connection with securing a building for classroom purposes at the Port Edward Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in Indian Agent Gillett's letter to the effect that the same building as used last year can be secured, it is quite in order to open the school immediately.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of October 3rd, and you should have her complete the necessary forms and forward them to this office at the earliest possible date. We require these forms before payment of salary can be made.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nNovember 5, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 3rd, we enclose forms C.T.256 and T.D.1, in triplicate, on behalf of Miss Olive Wishart, who began her duties as teacher of the Fort Edward Bay School on the 16th of October.\n\nIn spite of the fact that we instructed Miss Wishart to return all forms to our office, she forwarded the questionnaire direct to Ottawa.\n\nJ.

Report dated February 6, 1947.\n\nFile:168-38-1\n\nGreater emphasis should be given to silent reading with simple tests to ensure that the pupils have understood the passages read. The need for vocabulary building is very evident both for reading and language purposes.\n\nThe one grade 7 pupil is attempting work far too difficult for her. She should be given instruction in the basic subjects of reading, language, and arithmetic at a grade five level.\n\nThe remainder of the class is fairly well graded and seems to be making fair progress.\n\nThe pupils are not clean and though this may be partly due to the employment of the mothers in the plant, the teacher could make a considerable contribution by insisting that the pupils wash either before they come to school or when they arrive.\n\nDiscipline in the school is not as good as it should be.\nOttawa, February 25th, 1947.\n\nMr. F.E.

INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT ANFIELD DATED APRIL 11, 1949\n\n\"Negotiations are in hand to have Indian pupils educated at Port Edward. If successful, it will be possible to close our Indian Day School at the cannery. Similar action is suggested for the Sunnyside Cannery school in the year 1950.\"\n\n(Original on file 75-168)\n\n28-4-49.\nI have had considerable discussion with the School Board Representative at Port Edward and also with the Prince Rupert District School Board. As a result of the last meeting, the Board have agreed in principle that they will have to accept responsibility for the education of Indians in the Port Edward Area. It is, therefore, recommended that the Department give immediate consideration to closing the Port Edward Indian Day School as from June 30th, this year.\n\nIn reply to a direct question, I informed the School Board that I would be prepared to recommend that the present equipment at the Day School and teacherge at Port Edward be rented to the Prince Rupert School Board for a nominal sum. It is likely that the number of Indians attending this School will be 75% of the enrollment. As the Indians situated in the Port Edward area do not pay rent, it is presumed that the Department may consent to the payment of per capita costs of education in the white school district.\n\nYour further advice and instructions regarding the recommendation contained herein will be appreciated.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Port Edward Indian Day School\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter from Mr. Superintendent Anfield recommending the closing of the above-mentioned school. It will be recalled that this school is located on cannery property within the Prince Rupert School District. It is doubtful if the Department should continue the operation of an Indian school within the confines of a provincial School District.\n\nThis matter was discussed by Inspector Davey with Mr. Anfield and later with the Port Edward Representative on the School Board. I am in agreement with Mr. Anfield and Inspector Davey that the Department should close the Port Edward School, providing the School District is prepared to admit our children on the basis outlined in Mr. Anfield's letter.\n\nI shall appreciate receiving the Department's instructions as to whether I should proceed with negotiations with the School Board.\n\nW.S. Arneil\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nPORT EDWARD Indian Day School, B. C.\n\nYou are well aware of local conditions involved in the operation of this school. I understand that for some time negotiations have been proceeding for the closing of this school as was done at Port Essington. You will find hereunder an outline of the negotiations as they have proceeded to date.\n\nIn view of the success of the Port Essington experiment, I would recommend that the Prince Rupert School District be approached concerning an agreement for the education of these Indian children. If satisfactory arrangements can be completed, then I would recommend that the Port Edward Indian Day School be closed.\n\nAs you are aware, we have never been able to obtain the services of particularly satisfactory teachers at this school and it was only in September of this academic year that our School Inspector was able to obtain qualified teachers. We will naturally be able to use the services of these teachers in other day schools in British Columbia, if so recommended by Mr. Arneil.\n\nBernard F.

The locality, dimensions and improvements required are as follows:\n\n1. The accompanying sketch will show the relation of the building to the cannery property and the Indian homes. The land on which the building stands belongs to the provincial government.\n\n2. The building is 80 ft. long and 30 ft. wide with 9 ft. walls, peak roof, wood construction, outside walls shiplap and heavy tarred paper with battens covering the seams. The roof is shiplap with heavy wartime roofing. It has double flooring, double doors in end and one on the side. There is a suitable playground in front 100' x 60'.\n\n3. Improvements: The building needs lining, and I would suggest that 40 ft. be partitioned off for the school room. The following material will be required:\n\n- 2,800 sq. ft. of Domacona @ $60.00 per M = $168.00\n- 1,000 ft. Shiplap @ $59.00 per M = $59.00\n- 1,000 ft. 2\" x 4\" @ $59.00 per M = $59.00\n- 20 lb. assorted nails @ .12\u00a2 = $2.40\n\nTotal ........... $288.90\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's air mail letter of September 22nd to the Department, a copy of which has been received at this office, in connection with the proposed acquisition of a U.S. Army building at Port Edward for use as a schoolroom.\n\nIt is not considered that Mr. Gillett has given us sufficient details in this matter, particularly the basis under which the building could be used for school purposes. It would appear that we should be assured of tenure of the building for a reasonable length of time before undertaking improvements amounting to $450.00 and I am, therefore, writing to Mr. Gillett asking that he take the matter up with the United States Army authorities in Prince Rupert and that he ascertain under what arrangements the land on which the building stands is in use by the U.S. Army. I am also asking Mr. Gillett to supply further information with respect to the available pupilage, and the possibility of maintaining a fair attendance at the school for a reasonable length of time. It is recommended that no action be taken pending receipt of this information from Mr. Gillett.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to refer to my letter of September 27th in connection with the proposed acquisition of a U.S. Army building at Port Edward for use as a school room. I regret that on writing at that time I had not the complete file before me and, consequently, was not aware that Mr. Gillett had already advised that negotiations for the building should be carried out by the Department and the Special Commissioner for Defence Projects in Northwest Canada, Edmonton.\n\nIt is considered that enquiries should be made as to the possibility of securing a transfer of the building but that no definite action should be taken until Mr. Gillett supplies further information regarding the available pupilage and the prospect of maintaining a fair attendance at the school.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 29th October, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of October 2nd and 16th in connection with securing a building for classroom purposes at the Port Edward Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in Indian Agent Gillett's letter to the effect that the same building as used last year can be secured, it is quite in order to open the school immediately.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of October 3rd, and you should have her complete the necessary forms and forward them to this office at the earliest possible date.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nFort Edward School - Prince Rupert Agency\n\nAn inspection of the above named Indian Day School (seasonal) was made with Indian Agent Gillett on April 3rd. There were twenty-three pupils present in grades from two and up. In the forenoon there had been an attendance of twenty-nine primary children. Some represented included Fort Simpson, Kitimat, Greenville and Fort Nelson of Massicotte Agency, Bennett of Upper Charlotte Agency, and Kitimat of the Bella Coola Agency. Miss O. Plummer, the teacher at this school and bearing in mind her lack of training, is making a very fair effort. Health of the pupils appeared satisfactory, though cases of scabies were noticed. An age grade survey was made and the class visited had a grade age retardation score of about 2.5 years.\n\nThe physical plant of this temporary school is poor, the Cannery Manager, Mr. Robbings, has informed the Agent that he will require the building shortly for quarters as a Chinese bunk house. Some twelve Chinese have already occupied one end of the building.\n\nMr. Robbings has now taken over by purchase from the Cariboo Corporation and Dept. of Veterans Affairs a building 100 ft. x 80 ft. and most suitable for a two room school, and five room teacherage. Nelson Bros., Ltd., operators of this cannery, are securing the site of these buildings from the Province. Site and building are immediately adjacent to Nelson Bros. property at Fort Edwards and easily accessible from the Indian houses.\n\nThis building was inspected carefully and is considered suitable for conversion into a two room school and teacherage adjacent. It has fair playground space and is safely removed from the railroad tracks. Elevation, lighting and drainage all are satisfactory. Other conditions were discussed with Mr. Robbings who is anxious to cooperate in the maintenance of this school. The following plan was conceived and is placed before the Department for immediate consideration, it being urgent that the present premises be vacated and the school carried on with facilities of location as possible.\n\nNelson Bros., Ltd., by the Manager, agree to:\n\n(a) Convert the building herein mentioned to a two room school and a five room teacherage, in accordance with standard school practice and to follow, as far as material and labour will permit, a sketch plan to be submitted by the Agent.\n\n(b) Provide electric light, water and sewerage, but not fuel, which will however be made available by the company and charged to the Dept.\n\n(c) Maintain and repair said building as a school, and in the year 1947 put thereon a shingle roof at the expense of the company.\n\n(d) Move at company expense the equipment and material now used in the present school and install same in the new school building.\n\n(e) Utilize in said building the linings, partitions, toilets, wash basins and heaters to be salvaged from the Dundas Pt. barracks building (naval barracks turned over to the Department) and to make available snow and boat for moving said material to Fort Edwards when available.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6425, file 873-5, part 1)\nThe Department by the Agent, to pay a monthly rent of $25.00 for said building completed and occupied as a school from date of occupancy, and in addition will:\n\n(a) Take down and salvage a 70 ft. x 18 ft. building at Sundan Pt., load on a scow and unload scow at Fort Edwards all usable material including especially wall board, lumber, toilets, heaters and plumbing, electrical fixtures and make same available to Nelson Bros. for incorporation in the projected school building at Fort Edwards. Estimated value of this material: $1100.00 all of which has been given free to the Department by War Assets Committee.\n\n(b) To pay for dismantling this building at Sundan Pt., for loading onto scow and unloading same at Fort Edwards wharf; for which purpose it is estimated a sum of $350.00 will be required. If granted, an accountable advance for this sum to be paid into the Nanaimo Indian Agency Trust Account immediately so wages can be met.\n\n(c) The Department to supply school equipment required, including desks, blackboards and school supplies, same to revert to the Dept. if school is closed.\n\n(d) The Department to pay for fuel and teachers salaries.\n\n(e) The Department to provide two teachers at opening of new term in September.\n\nIf this plan is carried through there will be available a most suitable two room school and teacherage at a straight rental. If economic conditions change so that the school need not be maintained, the Department will only be out the $350.00 spent on wages dismantling the building at Sundan Pt., the material in which cost the department nothing. The chief reason for moving this material is shortage of same and inability of the agency to purchase in the open market. In any case, the cost is only that of wages, estimated at $350.00 and it will cost much more than this for the company to shingle the building next year.\n\nIn view of all these considerations, it is considered much better for the Department to rent them to try and acquire by purchase and later maintain a building of its own at this plant.\n\nIt is recommended that the plan as outlined be accepted as soon as possible; that the agent be notified of approval or otherwise at Prince Rupert; and that if approved, an accountable cheque for $350.00 be forwarded forthwith by airmail.\n\nF.

Agency Office, Prince Rupert.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, April 26, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nIndian Agent Anfield has forwarded to\nthis office a copy of his letter to you of April 6,\nwith reference to the Port Edward School. I am not\ntaking any action on this letter until I hear from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nApril 23rd, 1946.\n\nF. E. Anfield, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of April 6th in connection with the Port Edward Indian Day School building.\n\nIn reviewing our file it is noted that the original proposal in connection with this building was that the Department acquire it and equip it for school purposes. This proposal was subsequently amended in that Nelson Brothers would acquire the building and lease it to us for a nominal amount as they apparently were interested in acquiring the land on which the building was situated. It now appears that Nelson Brothers have acquired the building and it is proposed that the people of Canada give them materials valued at $1100 and labour to the extent of $250.00 and in addition pay them $25.00 a month rent which proposal in my opinion could not be considered particularly in view of the fact that there will be nothing to prevent Nelson Brothers forcing us to vacate the building should they require it for their own purposes or in the event the Cannery was closed in which case we would have no claims on the $1350.00 invested.\n\nI may say that in 1944 I had an opportunity of discussing this matter with the Manager of Nelson Brothers and at that time the Company intimated that they would be prepared to provide us with a building without cost if we would equip it and operate it as a school for Indian children. It is a considerable departure to the proposal now before us. I would suggest that you discuss the matter further with the Manager of Nelson Brothers at the earliest opportunity and endeavour to obtain a more reasonable proposal from them.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 168-38-5\n\nI have your letter of April 26th and note that you have received from Mr. Anfield a copy of his letter to me of April 6th regarding the Fort Edward Indian Day School.\n\nThe proposals submitted by Mr. Anfield were given attention here and a reply forwarded to him on April 23rd, a copy of which is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nIt seemed to me most unreasonable to expect this Department to furnish material and labour to the extent suggested by Mr. Anfield and at the same time require us to pay a rental of $25.00 per month for the building without any security as to tenure. However I have just discussed the whole matter with Mr. Indian Agent Gillett who is quite familiar with the situation and Mr. Robbins, Manager of Nelson Brothers Cannery, and find that the value of the building at Dundas Point, including the equipment therein, turned over to us by the Department of Defence, is very little more than $200.00 based on the prices secured for similar Army camp buildings in the area. Under these circumstances I should say the proposal submitted by Mr. Anfield is fair and this is also Mr. Gillett's opinion.\n\nThe Company will give us whatever agreement we require with respect to tenure of the building. In this case I should say it would be sufficient if we are given a written statement to the effect that we could have the use of the building for school purposes so long as we\nrequire it.\n\nThe rental of $25.00 a month may appear high but not when the Company is to provide electric light, water and sewerage and fully maintain these services and the building without cost to the Department.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the Department approve of the arrangement suggested and would appreciate a decision by air mail in order that, if the plan is endorsed, the Company may proceed to carry out the alterations to the building at Port Edward to be used for an Indian Day School and teacher's residence.\n\nEnclosure\n\nD.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe Department recently gave authority to buy sugar and cocoa for school lunches at the Day Schools of this Agency. It was my plan that the children should themselves supply the canned milk for these hot drinks on a rotational basis, each child bringing one or two cans once a month. Most of the schools have accepted this plan and are glad to conform.\n\nHowever, we have had a bad year fishing and on the Naas in particular whooping cough is prevalent in many homes. Reports from Aiyansh in particular are that there will be hardship this winter and that the children are under-nourished. Similar reports are to hand from Greenville. The teachers are willing to co-operate in these recess lunches, and authority is requested to purchase 6 cases of canned milk, Pacific tall, @ $7.50 per case from local stores in Aiyansh and Greenville to supplement what the children may bring in. The retail price in Prince Rupert is $.20 and freight and handling charges up the Naas River are $.30 per case. I can wire or radio the teachers concerned if the authority to buy is authorized.\n\nI have discussed this with Dr. Macdonald and he states that anything that can be done to maintain health standards in these two villages in particular should be done, as the whooping cough will take quite a toll in both places. It should be stated that there will be little or no employment for the natives resident in either of these villages this winter, apart from trapping, the market for which is a very uncertain quantity at this time.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nYour File 168-38-5 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of Oct. 3rd approving an expenditure of $79.00 for the purpose of supplying a hot drink for the pupils of the various schools in the Skeena River Agency, I am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of November 19th wherein he requests authority for an expenditure of a further amount of $45.00 for the purchase of canned milk for the reason stated. The total expenditure involved is not large and I would recommend that authority be granted for the purchase of six cases of canned milk.\n\nD. M.

She does not appear to be as able to handle this school as successfully as Kiteles. The larger number of children as well as the type of pupil in the higher grades appears to have a bearing on the situation.\n\nThe low attendance recorded is due to the fact that Grades I and II meet in the afternoon, leaving only 8 pupils for the morning session. I shall visit the Grades I and II at a later date.\n\nThis school is housed in temporary quarters and conducted by a fairly weak teacher. In spite of this the establishment of this school in its present location and the selection of the teacher were the very best arrangements under the circumstances.\n\nThe four pupils in attendance are bright boys and should, with application, do very well.\n\nB. Thorsteinsson, Inspector of Schools\n\nONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Provincial School Inspector Thorsteinsson's report covering his inspection of the Port Edward Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware this school was recently closed due to the fact that the Cannery required the building to house their employees. In the event that it is re-opened at some later date I am of the opinion that it would be well to secure the services of a stronger teacher if possible.\n\nD. M.

Requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, etc., should be the subject of separate communications.\n\nMiss Wishart has three groups within Grade I. Of the 31 children present, 7 were 6 yrs of age; 4 were 7 yrs. of age; 8 were 8 yrs. of age; 8 were 9 yrs. of age; 3 were 10 yrs. of age and 1 was 11 yrs. of age. This gives a grade average of 7.6 yrs. for this group.\n\nDistribution by Agencies: Skeena River - 17; Queen Charlotte Is. - 10; Babine - 4.\n\nThe teacher (untrained) has made considerable improvement since I last visited this School. Control is fairly good, but a shortage of pencils and scribblers makes it difficult to keep the children busy. School Bulletin No. 1 was noted. The teacher had not submitted her requisition and was advised to do so at once.\n\nIn general, the work of the room is satisfactory, but more time should obviously be spent by the teacher in preparation of lessons.\n\nThere is a need of a separate exit for this room; cloakroom with hooks for clothing; and more toilet facilities. These matters will be taken up with Nelson Bros. Ltd. from whom the building is rented.\n\nAgency Skeena River #168 Indian Agent\n\nForm No. IA. 407 R. 2018\nAGENTS REPORT\n\nRespecting Port Edward Cannery (Division II) Indian Day School\nfor the month November 1946\n\nName of Teacher Mrs. L.

Requests for supplies, repairs to buildings, etc., should be the subject of separate communications.\n\nThe teacher is experienced and the work of the room appears satisfactory. No desks have yet arrived and the pupils work at tables, and sit on unbacked benches. There is a happy atmosphere in the room and the youngsters appear interested in their work.\n\nGrades in the room are II to VIII inclusive, and the age grade averages are as follows:\nGr. II - 12.3 yrs; Gr. III - 9.3 yrs; Gr. IV - 11.3 yrs; Gr. V - 12 yrs; Gr. VI - 13 yrs; Gr. VII - no pupils; Gr.

The need for vocabulary building is very evident both for reading and language purposes.\n\nThe one grade 7 pupil is attempting work far too difficult for her. She should be given instruction in the basic subjects of reading, language, and arithmetic at a grade five level.\n\nThe remainder of the class is fairly well graded and seems to be making fair progress.\n\nThe pupils are not clean and though this may be partly due to the employment of the mothers in the plant, the teacher could make a considerable contribution by insisting that the pupils wash either before they come to school or when they arrive.\n\nDiscipline in the school is not as good as it should be.\n\nR.F.

Davey's reports covering his inspections of the Port Edward and Metlakatla Indian Day Schools.\n\nWith reference to the Port Edward School Mr. Davey informs me that the second teacher, Miss Olive Wishart, was sick on the occasion of his visit, and consequently there is no report on her work.\n\nThe services of Mrs. Lucy Wishart apparently are not altogether satisfactory, but possibly the Inspector's visit will have been of some help to her and it is hoped there will be some improvement before the next inspection.\n\nMr. Davey's comments with respect to the Metlakatla School building and teacherage are noted and no doubt will be subject of a report from Mr. Indian Agent Anfield, who included an amount of $3500.00 in his 1947-48 estimates for construction of a one roomed school with teacher's residence at this point.\n\nD.

Miss Wishart is neither physically nor technically capable of handling this group but she should be credited with a good effort. Of the pupilage present, 8 were from Queen Charlotte Is. Agency, 15 from Skeena Agency and the balance from Babine Agency. Some of the children were unclean, but this is understandable when it is noted that the cannery is working 18 hrs. a day on herring.

During the summer new back porches and new shingled roof have been added to this building and a new oil burning range installed in the teacherage. It is my opinion that this school will be crowded to capacity and consideration will have to be given to a third room, as many Indians are being employed by the new Celanese Company adjacent to this cannery.\n\nAgency SKEENA RIVER\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. IA. 407\nR. 2018\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting Port Edward Junior Room Indian Day School\nfor the month September 1947\n\nName of Teacher Mrs. Olive DeKergarow Is Register properly kept?

She was formerly Olive Wishart, daughter of the senior teacher of this school. The children seem happy and attentive and the teacher informed me that they have been attending very well. A large number of them are beginners. During the last month all the children were inoculated for diphtheria, this disease being prevalent in this area. It is my opinion that the children at this school should be given hot lunches, with cocoa and biscuits at recess time, as many of them come to school without worthwhile breakfasts. Requisition for the materials of these lunches will be forwarded to the Department shortly.\n\nAgency SKEENA RIVER AGENCY\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. LA. 407\nR. 2018\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting Port Edward (Senior room) Indian Day School\nfor the month January 1948.\n\nName of Teacher Duncan deKergommeaux Is Register properly kept?

Mr. deKergommeaux has a very pleasant personality and certainly has control of the children. He lacks training but is making a good effort and the children's response is most satisfactory.\n\nThe condition of the school toilets was, however, a disgrace and representations are being made to Nelson Bros., owners of the building, in this regard. The toilets are used by other than the school children and this apparently creates a difficult problem. Of the 4 toilets at the school, 3 were stuffed up and overflowing and the other one was in a disgusting condition.\n\nAgency Skeena River #168.\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. LA. 407\nR. 2018\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting Port Edward (Junior room) Indian Day School\nfor the month January 1948.\n\nName of Teacher: Mrs. Olive deKergommeaux\nIs Register properly kept?

Mrs. deKergommeaux's work shows lack of Normal School training but she is a conscientious worker and has the regard and interest of her pupils.\n\nAgency: Skeena River #168\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. I.A. 407\nR. 2018\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith copies of Mr. District School Inspector Davey's reports covering his inspection of the Port Edward Indian Day School on April 13th, for your information.\n\nEW Encl.\n\nW.

Part of this difficulty could be overcome I believe if the teacher would be firmer and more consistent in her handling of this matter. Discipline in the class-room also suffers from this lack of firmness and a consistent policy. There is an opportunity for the teacher to give some much needed instruction in the observance of the common rules of courtesy and good manners. In general the cleanliness of the pupils was improved over last year but there is still room for considerable improvement.\n\nThe teacher has prepared a time-table which is posted. This should be improved by the inclusion of phonics for those pupils who have completed the pre-primer. The number work of the class appeared to be good. More attention should be paid to comprehension in the reading work. The language work appeared to be fair.\n\nThere is no evidence of shyness and the pupils responded to the instruction of the teacher. If the pupils were taught to work in an orderly manner the work of Mrs. de Kergommeaux would be much more effective.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\n(Use reverse if necessary\u2014This end to be the top)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Discipline in the senior room is good and there has been a marked improvement in this respect in the junior room also. The pupils were clean and well dressed.\n\nMore attention should be paid to comprehension in the reading work and the importance of silent reading should not be over-looked. Drill work should be given in the fundamentals of arithmetic to ensure that skills once learned are maintained, as well as to ensure that the skills have been thoroughly taught.\n\nSome handicraft work has been undertaken which has interested the pupils. This work could be used to effectively motivate the language work of the class.\n\nAttendance at this school is something of a problem complicated by a continually fluctuating population due to the intermittent operation of the cannery and fish reduction plant.\n\nThe lavatories and school in general were clean.\n\nInspector of Schools\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER\n\n(Use reverse if necessary\u2014This end to be the top)\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting Fort Edward (Senior room) Indian Day School\nfor the month June 1948.\n\nName of Teacher: Duncan deKergommeaux\nNumber on Roll: 24\nNumber that should attend: 24\nAverage Attendance: 8\nPunctuality: Good\nDiscipline: Good\n\nIs Register properly kept?

These children come from four or five different Agencies and from about eight different schools. In the class room there are five distinct divisions of Grade 1. The reading effort by these children was quite fair and they are getting good training in the use of the number primers. The room is not so tidy as it might be but Indian children in this age group are difficult to discipline and to teach at the same time. Miss Clark allows them considerable freedom but I think she is on the right track.

The prices quoted by the agent are thought to be rather high, however I have no doubt that the items could be secured in Vancouver at much less cost.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nApplication is made to purchase an oil burning range for the Port Edward Indian Day School teacherage. Attached please find a bid on a suitable range which is immediately available at Port Simpson from the Hudson's Bay Company. They have only the one range and I understand that one account of the impending oil shortage no more are to be released for sale.\n\nThe Manager at the Nelson Bros. plant has given assurance that he will supply all needed fuel oil for this stove.\n\nThe teachers at this school have struggled all last year with an old army stove which was brought over from one of the army establishments turned over to us after the war. It has given very poor service and an examination made of it recently shows that it is pretty well burned through. The ladies have been unable to use the oven at all for the past few months.\n\nMy reason for wishing to buy this teacherage an oil stove is the need for steady heat in the teacherage which is an old army hut well up off the ground. The construction is at the best of a very kind, the place is drafty and last winter these ladies suffered so much from cold that they nearly quit their jobs.\n\nAn oil heater has been installed in the living room and with the strongly recommended installation of this range in the kitchen, living conditions will be such as to induce these ladies to stay with the work. At least they will have steady heat in their home. As the Hudson's Bay Company can only hold this range for a limited time, the Department's instructions will be appreciated as soon as possible.\n\nF.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo,\nin further reference to your communication of\nJune 2, with regard to the establishment of an\nIndian day school at Sunnyside.\n\nWe are endeavouring to secure the\nnecessary Order-in-Council establishing this\nschool, and as soon as it is obtained you will\nbe advised.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of September 8th in connection with the proposed establishment of an Indian Day School at Sunnyside. This proposal was brought to the Department's attention in June of this year, reference Mr. Phelan's letter 168-38-1 of June 8th, but it was not considered advisable to put the school in operation for the remaining few weeks of the academic year.\n\nThe situation apparently has changed somewhat, and it would appear that there may be thirty children available during the ten months of the school year in view of which it is considered that it would be advisable to establish a school at this point. The Church building referred to is 30' x 40' and would meet our requirements for a school room. The only cost to the Department would be a monthly rental of $10.00, in addition to the cost of the necessary equipment. We are having some difficulty in securing school desks at the present time but Mr. Gillett in a recent communication advised that there were a large number of suitable tables belonging to various forces in Prince Rupert which could be purchased for $3.00 each with suitable chairs at $1.00 each, and if we are unsuccessful in securing desks these tables might meet the requirements in the meantime.\n\nIt is recommended that the necessary Order-in-Council be secured for the establishment of a school at this point and that authority be granted for purchase of a heater, blackboard, chalk trough and the necessary desks.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nKT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC IC, Volume 6425, file 874-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nSept 8, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nThe management of the B.C. Packers Plant at Sunnyside and the Indians have requested that we have a school established there.\n\nI have made a check-up and find that there will be at least 20 children staying at Sunnyside during the fall and winter. There will also be 10 children at Cassiar Cannery, about 20 minutes walk from Sunnyside, who would attend the school. There will be a large increase in attendance during the months of April and May.\n\nThe B.C. Packers will, at their own expense, put the building of the United Church in good shape; lining it inside with shiplap, shingling the outside, laying a second floor and installing windows. They will clear the trees away from the building, supply coal and light free and also supply a teachers' residence which will include a kitchen range, bed, chairs, table and cooking utensils complete with crockery. The rent of the building will be $10.00 per month payable to the United Church.\n\nWe will need to purchase the following:\n\n- 1 heater - $50.00\n- 4 pcs Hyloplate Blackboard Gr 4x8 @ .40\u00a2 sq ft-$51.20\n- 4 pcs Chalk Trough 6' (32 lin. ft) @ .10\u00a2 l.ft- $3.20\n\nDesks\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Complete single standard desks | 12 | $5 | $60 |\n| 10 \"        |          | $4         | $40   |\n| 8 \"         |          | $6         | $48   |\n| 4 rears     |          | $5         | $20   |\n| 4 fronts    |          | $3         | $12   |\n\nOnce this school is established it will be a permanent affair. The B.C. Packers have transferred their plant from\nClaxton and amalgamated with the Sunnyside plant. This winter there will be considerable construction carried on and in the following years there will be sufficient Indians there in connection with cannery repairs and boat work to warrant keeping the school open for the ten teaching months.\n\nI do not consider it necessary to have one of the church authorities nominate a teacher because the children attending the school will be from various Bands and Agencies, chiefly; Port Simpson (United Church), Aiyansh (Anglican), Kitwanga (Anglican) and Skeena Crossing (Salvation Army).\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 8, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing correspondence with reference to the proposed establishment of a school at the Sunnyside Cannery.\n\nI discussed this matter with the Acting Director this morning, and, in view of the fact that the school would only be in operation for a very short time, it is not considered advisable to open it this year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of April 28th, copy of my reply of May 9th, and a subsequent report from Mr. Gillett in connection with the proposed establishment of a temporary school at the Sunnyside Cannery. It will be noted that there are 41 children available, and that Mr. Gillett anticipates an average attendance of at least 30 should this school be established.\n\nThe cost of establishing this school is comparatively small, and as a number of these children have already missed a great deal of schooling this year it is considered that it would be advisable to open the school as soon as possible and continue until the 15th of August. It is understood that the establishment of the school will require an Order in Council, but if the proposal meets with the Department's approval it would be appreciated if you would advise if it will be in order to have Mr. Gillett make the necessary arrangements for the opening of the school on June 15th.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nApril 28, 1945.\n\nMjr. D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER\n\nWhen at Sunnyside Cannery recently I found that there were thirty children of school age there from the various villages and agencies, the majority of which were from Port Simpson.\n\nAt Sunnyside there is a church building 30' x 40', the property of the United Church which at present is not in use. If this could be secured it would be suitable for a temporary school. The lighting is poor and the walls constructed of siding only; no inside lining. The lighting could be improved by cutting down the trees and the stove already in the building would be sufficient to keep the building warm enough for this time of year.\n\nWould the department consider transferring the teacher from the junior room at Port Simpson to Sunnyside? The attendance at Port Simpson has reached the stage now where one teacher could manage the children. The average attendance for March was 30.07 and for April, up to the 27th, 31 and is gradually declining as the people move away.\n\nDesks could be transferred from Port Simpson but we would need a blackboard, 4 pieces 4' x 8'.\n\nThere is a small building near the church which could be used for the teacher. I have spoken to Miss Ayser and she is willing to make the transfer if authorized.\n\nIf the department approves of having a temporary school at Sunnyside, may I suggest that consideration be given to the idea of having it continue until at least the end of July. In this case it might be advisable to appoint a teacher for Sunnyside and not to make a transfer from Port Simpson. Would Mrs. Kathleen Gray consider being appointed?\n\nJG:JP\nc.c. to Mr. Bunt\n\nIndian Agent.\nMay 9th, 1945.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq., Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nThe Reverend Wilding called here regarding the use of the United Church and dwelling as a school and teacher's quarters, and while he was perfectly agreeable to its use for this purpose, subject to services in the church out of school hours, he was unable to decide on a rental, consequently I asked him to discuss this and other details of occupation with you when he is in Prince Rupert, about May 25th.\n\nIn order that this matter may be placed before the Department I would request a detailed report showing what equipment and furnishings are required, with approximate cost if you are not able to secure local quotations. Also a survey of the Indian children at Sunnyside who would attend, their Reserves and religion. If furnishings are required for the dwelling, they should be listed. Possibly you could arrange with Mr. Anfield to take over the desks and blackboard in the old school house at Kitimaat if he has not already transferred them for the new classroom at Bella Coola.\n\nPresuming that the children have already missed a great deal of their school work for the year it might be considered expedient to carry on the school until the end of July as suggested. You should advise if the children will be at the cannery when schools reopen in September. It will be difficult to get authorization of this project and all furnishings etc., completed by the end of the month and the Department may not feel that part of June and July, say six weeks, would justify the expense. However, on hearing from you further I will take the matter up with the Department.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n(COPY)\nPRINCE RUPERT, B. C.,\nMay 29th, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., VANCOUVER.\n\nYour File O-11-2, May 9, 1945.\n\nWith reference to the proposed establishment of a temporary school at Sunnyside Cannery, an estimate of the approximate cost involved would be as follows:\n\nRent for Church building and small residence @ $25.00 per month, from June 15th to August 15th, $50.00\n\nTransportation of desks, blackboard and school material from Port Edward to Sunnyside, transportation of teacher with her belongings from Port Simpson School, and return of same in the Fall, $50.00\n\nCutting trees down to allow light in the building, $24.00\n\nFuel will be supplied by the Cannery. free\n\n$124.00.\n\nNow that Port Edward School is closed, I would recommend that all the equipment, including blackboard, be transferred to Sunnyside and that Miss Keyser take charge of the school. Miss Currie can combine the two rooms at Fort Simpson, as there will be less than thirty children there.\n\nAs it is not likely that the authorization can be secured before the 15th of June, I would suggest that the school open on that date and continue until the 15th of August. Miss Keyser is willing to teach up to that time. This would be advisable, as a number of children at Sunnyside have already missed several months of schooling. Some of the\n\n(over)\nchildren will still be at Sunnyside when school reopens, but the majority will be in their respective villages by October.\n\nThere should be an average attendance of at least thirty children at Sunnyside. At present there are 41 children there, made up as follows:\n\n| From          | Church                  |\n|---------------|-------------------------|\n| Port Simpson  | United Church           |\n| Kispiox       |                         |\n| Aiyansh       | Church of England       |\n| Kincolith     |                         |\n\nJ.

They intend to clear the trees away from the building, supply coal and light free and also supply a furnished teacher's residence.\n\nWe will have to pay the teacher's salary and supply some classroom equipment, such as desks, but the latter will not have to be purchased, as there are desks available from other schools in the agency.\n\nIn view of the number of children who are not receiving education, I feel that we should accept the Indian Commissioner's recommendation, and I enclose Memorandum to Council, as required by Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act.\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector\n\nPP\nOttawa, October 24, 1945.\n\nB.C.

M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo and my reply of the 10th instant, in connection with the establishment of an Indian day school at Sunnyside, I wish to advise you that P.C. 6545 dated October 16, 1945, has been received, establishing this school, to be known as \"The Sunnyside Indian Day School\".\n\nYou may purchase a heater, blackboard and chalk trough and necessary desks or tables and chairs, as mentioned in your letter.\n\nPossibly you have already obtained a teacher. If so, you should have her complete the necessary forms and return same to this office. At the same time I would appreciate a recommendation from you regarding the salary which you consider we should allow her.\n\nIt is understood that we will allow $10.00 a month for the rental of the building to be used for classroom purposes. It is also noted from Agent Gillett's letter of September 8 that the B.C. Packers intend to put the building in good shape at no cost to the Department; clear the trees away from the building; supply coal and light free and also supply a teacher's residence, including the necessary furnishings, for this particular building.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nNovember 5, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver\n\nRe: Teacher for Sunnyside School\n\nI wish to recommend Miss Emma Schmidt as teacher for the above school.\n\nMiss Schmidt is 27 years old and passed her matriculation in Alberta. She gave assistance last year to her sister at Greenville. She has a personality that will command respect and insure good discipline. She is available now and can commence her duties as soon as she is notified.\n\nThe B.C. Packers have made the necessary improvements on the building and the school can be opened as soon as a teacher is appointed.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of October 29th (File 168-39-1) in connection with the establishment of an Indian Day School at Sunnyside, and in particular to the appointment of a teacher, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of November 5th recommending that Miss Emma Schmidt be appointed as teacher.\n\nMiss Schmidt is apparently favourably known to Mr. Gillett and in view of the difficulty of securing the services of a certificated teacher I would recommend her temporary appointment for the balance of the current academic year at a salary of $105.00 a teaching month. This salary is the same as is paid at the Fort Edward Indian Day School and is considered reasonable inasmuch as the Department is not called upon to provide accommodation for the teacher.\n\nD. M MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n- EW\nEncl.\nAIRMAL\n\nOttawa, November 19, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O.
