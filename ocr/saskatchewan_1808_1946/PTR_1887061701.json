Brown, 10 Princess Street, where advices are given and orders taken.\n\nNEW YORK.\n\nFRIDAY, JUNE 17, 1887.\n\nRECENT CRIME AND THE PUBLIC SECURITY.\n\nOur readers cannot fail to have been shocked by the number and atrocity of the murders perpetrated in the Territories quite recently, and it is gratifying to see that the police has been working hard, a want of success in tracing up and speedily capturing the perpetrators of these deeds of blood. In such a large and thinly populated country as ours there is little wonder if evil-doers should now and then succeed in escaping the hands of justice for a time, but we cannot and do not deny that the police authorities (who are fully alive to the absolute necessity of putting forth their utmost exertions) will be quickly successful in capturing every suspect who offers the guilty to swift and condign punishment.\n\nIt always happens that when any great crime, such as murder, occurs in a neighborhood, a natural horror at the thought of the fate of the victim causes a kind of reverie to pass through the people, and a sort of restless anxiety takes hold of possession of them till the perpetra tors are kept to the full, safe custody and amenable to the outraged feelings of the country. But when it happens that delays in tracing out and capturing the criminals take place, as they often do, the same restless anxiety becomes intensified, and not unfrequently the disappointment finds vent in grumbling at some one or other\u2014generally at the police\u2014as though our course are always on hand and chief in all matters occurring.\n\nWe forget to see in the correspondence of more than one of our contemporaries that the North West Mounted Police are coming in for some criticism at present for inactivity and so forth, in their failure to succeed in making captures in connection with the murders we have referred to. It is absurd, however, to utter wholesale complaints against the Force because in some isolated instances individuals of them have failed to do what the public certainly longs for, but what may be very difficult or almost impossible of execution for all that. We never sympathise with these wholesale charges against the Force, for we do not think them at all well founded. If the police could only able to realise the difficulties the Police have often to contend with in following up a clue or trail, they would be more lenient in their criticism for they would somehow find the fault was not so much in the incapacity of the Police as in their own impatience and want of knowledge.\n\nAs we have said, we hope and trust the authorities will speedily have all these criminals in custody. In fact this is doubly called for, not only to satisfy the ends of justice, but also to prevent the growing of crimes which have already been committed and growing, especially in the outlying settlements. Confidence requires to be restored and maintained, and something especially requires to be done for the security of the lives of the public and the mails over the long and almost unprotected route from here to the railway. Whether this may be best accomplished by a strengthening of the police patrols and stations or otherwise is for those in power to decide, but whatever arrangements are to be made should be thoroughly efficient and should be organized at once.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nIt must be distinctly understood that we do not undertake responsibility for the publication of communications, but will do our best in full, not necessarily for publication.\n\n\"SEED GRAIN\"\n\nTo the Editor of the Times,\n\nSir,\u2014In a letter on the above subject in the columns of the 16th inst., in which Mr. McTaggart of the Dominion Land Co. Ltd., spoke, I would like to be considered by the police committee to treat his remarks as a challenge to anyone who might be interested in the question of the seed grain committee of the Local Agricultural Society.\n\nThis is a joke. It does not belong to the ordinary either, for there is here a sort of prejudice in the question, and a tendency in approaching the characteristic of the worthy author. This letter brings Mr. McTaggart before the public as a man of small size and of small pipe. It may happen to strike some of them, as he would have felt it did me, that he was a man of small size and heavy build, but there is really no accounting for taste and his appearance has at least an air of effect of novelty.\n\nThere is indeed nothing to say that Mr. McTaggart is not entitled to the seed grain committee's expenses, but he should forgive his intentions in that line of sympathy with Mr. McTaggart, should not again make use of the heavy pipe. It is possible and stale from age, and Mr. McTaggart is not likely to be tempted by the temptation to make a spectacle when he sees it in print and thinks how easily one might resort in a similar case. He should not be encouraged one lot of oats to be bought from a settler. Now what are the facts? Mr. McTaggart says that the local government should buy any seed grain of suitable quality that might be offered for sale, but he does not say why he adverted to that effect. There was no expectation that a large quantity would be bought, but there was a possibility there in asking so much to be sent from outside. In point of fact only three samples were submitted to the committee. They passed as two of the oat samples and as these were not bought, Mr. McTaggart's local town who held the bulk and withdrew his sample before it was reported on, was not asked to purchase a well known farmer, and was quite good in quality but a little deficient in colour. Mr. McTaggart does not mention this therefore in recommending it, directed attention to that fact, and that what Mr. McTaggart had to say on the subject was not a sample. But whether the recommendation was feasible or feasible there was surely nothing ridiculous in the matter, certainly nothing to justify absurd and mean jokes.\n\nH.M. (signature)\n\nI am writing this in ignorance of the details upon which the committee acted but I learn from this, that supposing he had written a recommendation as he thought it would not have been communicated even sooner if it had been, in that case, up to the mark in regard to the quality, he would have passed the whole without exception had it been written in that way. It was the half of the committee that few samples were sent in. All they had to do was to select the best sample to report as a recommendation. Mr. McTaggart himself had before them. He smears the committee \"of the utmost contempt\" of absolutity honestly, but says, but is honest for him in his anxiety to elucidate what he believes is a point against the committee to properly represent the quantity as \"about fifty bushels,\" whereas in reality it was a good deal less than that figure. This may be a small matter, but he should have been particularly careful to make sure of things which are misleading while he meant, in almost his next paragraph, to charge the committee with making a statement in the same spirit. The statement namely that more farmers had been refused on the barley, while they were actually undertaking a quality still retained on hand in store.\n\nThis is more serious than the honesty of the committee in the matter already handled. I do not know why she in saying the paragraph he quotes is \"not altogether fair,\" she does not say that any of the oats and barley were left over, but all events he \"exchanges the seed amongst the farmers,\" and that he is one single farmer who was refused oats or barley for seed purposes, and who had been refused for the last five years for the purpose of sowing. This challenge may likely enough be taken up by other parties, but it is not likely that Mr. McTaggart will. Whether he refused any grain to Mr. John C. McNevin (241) Whether on the 1st July, 1886, he might then have the grain he had previously asked for and been refused? (25) Whether he refused any grain to Mr. McTaggart himself. The seed grain committee are prepared to justify all actions they take, and they say that they have ever made and they believe, more over than this, if they think proper, to give the farmers the opportunity in which seed grain matters were concerned this last winter, without of necessity, having to go back to the committee for just or deduction of duty to either Mr. McTaggart or any seed grower individually. Mr. McTaggart is asked to state and for ought the committee know to the contrary he may have had rightly tied up seed grain, but he has left no record of action. The committee have no means of knowing about this\u2014but since he has stated it, and he has stated it, he will not object to have this reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWM.
