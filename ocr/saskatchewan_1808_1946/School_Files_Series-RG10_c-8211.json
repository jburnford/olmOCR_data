It has certainly been increased at an opportune moment. The present high cost of living and advance in cotton goods also, have made me wonder how I could continue instruction in Domestic Science and Needlework in order to make the lessons interesting. The Pama Indians, like many more people, are always wanting something new, otherwise they lose interest.\n\nI hear Mr. Abraham is inspecting the gardens this week. I gave him a list of the pupils who were competing in the Home Garden Scheme. Mr. Abraham kindly consented to inspect for me the gardens in connection with the Women's Institute. Last year we had 14 who took advantage of the seed distributed by the Ontario\n\nIndian Affairs.

The judge sent me a very complimentary letter in reference to the competitors. This year I asked for 4 parcels of seed. As we have been requested to curtail expenses of a judge wherever possible, I thought Mr. Abraham could inspect the gardens for the women's Institute also.\n\nI see no reason why we should not have a Fall Fair this year. Home Garden produce can be exhibited, and the girls have their needlework. They can also have an exhibit of baking and canned fruit.\n\nI would esteem it a very great favour if arrangements could be made for Mr. Abraham to be present. October will be the best month I think.

I enumerated the important subjects I had added to the curriculum of the school, and as instructor of those, in addition to the ordinary subjects, I asked to be placed on an equal footing with Miss Mc Bain. This request I understood was granted, when my salary was made equal with hers. I am so accustomed to the Departmental work of the English schools that such a position offers no difficulties; without any intentional disrespect to Miss Mc Bain, she evidently finds it difficult to co-operate. I can understand her position, for she has been here so many years. Therefore, as the latter arrival, I think it better to resign. Lack of co-operation will only cause regrettable trouble here.\n\nI have, to the best of my ability, faithfully served the department for nearly four years, and I hope, given satisfaction. The agent and the former pastor, the Rev. John Nelson, can verify my statements in reference to my work.\nOn the whole, I have enjoyed my experience as a teacher on an Indian Reserve. In spite of its many difficulties, there has been a fascination, not only in the school work, but that of the community also.\n\nStrictly accept three months notice, dating from October 1st.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRuth Waite\n\nMr. M.

The Truant Officer has been after these boys and took them to school, but never would disappear.

D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. W. Myers, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAtherley, Ont.\nExtract from report of R. A. Hutchison, Public school Inspector, dated October 20, 1917, on the Rama Indian Day School. Original on 152199/6.\n\nThere is some friction between Miss McBain and Miss Waite. It seems that Miss Waite has been assuming that she is the head of the school for two reasons,- First, because she teaches the senior room and Second, because she holds a higher certificate than Miss McBain. Of course, Miss McBain should be considered the head for many reasons, but chiefly because she stuck to her work when the conditions were not as pleasant as they are now. Now these girls are both doing good work and it is too bad that they cannot get along. You know, it is doubtful whether any two girls will get along for any length of time, living the secluded life that they do. The trouble is that they get too much of each other. I understand that Miss Waite's resignation has been accepted by your Department and it is well.\nIndian Ed. Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Miss McBain informed me of the vacancy in the Rama school to take place at Xmas & asked me if I could suggest some person to fill it, my mind turned at once to Miss Erica Martin of Newport who is now making application for the position. I have personally known her & the whole family for fifteen years & have watched her during these years as she has grown up from a young girl. I have no hesitation in saying I do not know any person whom I think will fill the position better than she. She is one of the most conscientious & thorough-going workers I know of. She has a kindly disposition, cheerful spirit & delightful earnestness. Her moral & christian character is deep rooted & unyielding. To uplift & direct her pupils morally, intellectually & spiritually will be her greatest joy & she will shrink nothing too hard to attain that end. She will do it by love, patience & perseverance. The influence & training of her parental home is of the highest order & I feel sure she will make good in the school. While she has met many normal\nin middle school training or had experience in conducting a school, yet she is not a stranger to the latest methods of teaching & I conscientiously feel she is fully qualified for this school & will give a good account of herself.\n\nI most heartily recommend her to your favourable consideration & trust you will give her a trial until Midsummer at least & I think by that time you will wish to keep her in the position for she will far more than fill the recommendation I have given her. I have every confidence in her.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGeorge Carpenter\nMissionary at Rama\nNewport, Ont.,\nNov. 21, 1917\n\nMiss Eva McBain\nRama, Ont.\n\nDear Miss McBain,\n\nHaving heard from Mr. Carpenter that an assistant teacher will be required in the Rama school, I make application on his recommendation for the position, at a salary of five hundred dollars per annum. I have attended the Collegiate Institute at Brant-\nfor four years, have taken a course in Domestic Science, also have had some training in nursing. If I am granted the position, will do my best to give satisfaction in the work allotted to me. If a recommendation is necessary Mr. Carpenter will give one.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGrace Martin\nR.R. #2\nAthlone Nov. 28-97\n\nDear Mr. Benson,\n\nThe enclosed letters explain themselves.

She told me that she was too busy and did not want to be bothered, so I left her at that - no use in talking to her.\n\nThere is no lead pencils for the senior room.

Miss Ahner acted very strange when I entered her class room. She just walked out and went outside. She would not speak. I just left it that way as I thought it was not prudent to cause any commotion on account of the school children.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nActing Deputy and Secretary\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOur school which is a two-room country school and a credit to the Reserve and to the Indian Department which built it, has been left of late to the care of a half-hearted teacher. It is impossible for one teacher to properly conduct a two-room school if there is a good average attendance of pupils. In this case however, the attendance is small compared with what it should be. But there being no school board and no trouble with the system of operation, very poor, and certainly calls on the Agent and the Council to make some representations to the Indian Department so as shall bring forth an improvement.\n\nSurely the Indian children are worthy of a better education, and surely the Indian Department is under obligation to see that the school is kept in proper repair, provide staff of teachers and also that other arrangements are made to bring forth greater efficiency in the education of Indian children on this Reserve.\nDear Miss Mrs Bain,\n\nWe were in the junior room for two weeks. Miss Asher taught us the first day we were there we did not like it. She told us to sit still with our hands folded. We did not do anything all day. She did not give us any lessons in the morning or in the afternoon. She would not allow us even to sharpen our pencils if they were broken. If she saw us putting our hands on top of the desk, she would slap our finger with a ruler. We did not read. I only read my lesson twice. Later she told us to multiply by multiplying by four. They are too easy, and she taught us how to write 123 and so on, as if we were babies. One day, she told us to come into the room to get all our books. We did so. It was on her desk. We all sat down there. She did not give us any lessons in them. I took some scraps of paper out of my desk. I did not like my desk being untidy so I tidy it up a bit. She made me put them scraps where I got them. And so, I was afraid of her she was cross. She used to say she was the same with children. But she does not treat them nicely. She used to kiss the little ones but not now. We asked her one day to go out for recess. She did not listen to us. If we don't get a new teacher I won't go into her room. I would rather stay here. I would be very glad if she leaves the school. She does not like Miss Carpenter or any body. I used to think she was a kind woman. But I don't.\n\nYours sincerely,\nCora Shelley\nI thought I would write this letter to you. When I was in the junior Room Miss Shore did teach us anything just singing and playing and telling us stories and playing we had Arithmetic once in a while and reading we also. She was half crazy and she fought for little James Hepburn she was mad all the time I guess that's all I know of her.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She used to put numbers on the board such as 12345 and so on, and she'd make us count the numbers. We just sat there with our hands behind our backs and did not read except once. When we asked her to let us out she would sit down only she would not let us sharpen our pencils. We when we broke our pencils she had to get so mad that her neck was all red. Every time we turn our head just a bit she'd come and chase us, and when we counted one line of numbers she'd make us stand for 20 minutes. We used to cut papers and she'd make some of the girls play after school. When any body came in late she would make them stand against the wall for some minutes before they went and sit down. This is all I could remember.\n\nYour sincerely,\nMary Hunter\nDear Miss me Bain,\n\nI thought I would write this short letter tell you how we were in the junior room. We didn't have anything just reading two or three times and I think we just had once arithmetic and singing songs and learning them that all I could write I don't know anymore.\n\nYour truly,\nHilda S. Hache.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herein ten new Roman scholars of the Roma Indian school, copies of their work done in Miss Athies' room.\n\nI find, in reading over what the pupil has written, it is facts.\n\nShe has lost all that lovable disposition when she first came. She appears to me that she is trying to make herself hateful, and is successful. I do not understand her action. She has quit speaking.\n\nAs to Miss English she would be very pleased to assist at any time, if cause should arise she was needed, so she is anxious to earn some money. There is too much worry in it with Miss Athies.\n\nMr. Hall of the Packet told me himself that Rev.

Bain with the Teacher report for 1918.\n\nAs there are some questions to be answered by the second teacher, Miss Ahner decline to answer these questions. I asked her for the register of school and was also refused.\n\nMiss M. Bain sent one of her pupils with a note kindly asking her for her for school register. Miss Ahner came to Miss M.

(RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMR. SCOTT,\n\nMiss Ahner, who was appointed temporarily to replace Miss McBain at the Rama Indian School, has proved to be a failure.\n\nBefore I visited this school in December, last, she had antagonised Miss Fawley, the assistant teacher. The Methodist Missionary informed me that he would have nothing to do with her. When Miss Fawley left the school Mrs. English replaced her, but she was unable to get along with Miss Ahner and left. Miss McBain, although not fully recovered, stepped into the breach, and is still in charge of the school, but she declined to occupy her former quarters there, as she said it would be impossible to get along with Miss Ahner. She is living at Longford Mills and walks back and forth from the school.\n\nMiss Ahner has declined to have anything to do with Mr. Myers, our Agent, and he forwarded a letter he received from her, which reads as follows,- \"Would you be good enough not come into my class-room. I do not require you there, nor in any part of my school home\". Miss Ahner was told that Mr. Myers was only carrying out his instructions in visiting the school and she was requested to bear this in mind when Mr. Myers has occasion to again visit this school.\n\nThere is another letter in from Mr. Myers dated the 26th of this month, which speaks for itself, and I have also received one from him with letters from the children giving their version of the way Miss Ahner conducts the class, and some of them are quite intelligent enough to form an opinion.\n\nI think it would be in the best interests of this school to get rid of Miss Ahner as soon as possible, as\nas she is not amenable to reason or advice.\n\nMr. Myers states that Mrs. English is available until a permanent teacher can be obtained.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department considers that every opportunity has been afforded Miss Ahner to prove her fitness for the position without any satisfactory results and the only course open is to replace her by a teacher who will be amenable to reason and advice.\n\nA cheque for $150.00, being Miss Ahner's salary in full for this quarter, will be sent you tomorrow.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that Miss Ahner vacates the premises without any delay and you may appoint Mrs. English to take charge temporarily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

It isn't just to warn me. I do not wish to leave. I have done my duty well here and have worked under very hard conditions constantly. I wish to remain here for the time that I am sent.

He only would make Department give an answer.\n\nI am of the opinion that Councillor Simcoe will write His Excellency the Governor General.

The Chief and myself interviewed her this morning in regard to the Department instructions in dispensing with her services as teacher. Miss Ahner was very angry she stood up to talk against myself after reading the paragraph in Parker's newspaper. Ouchie she was under the impression I was against her and in writing Mr. Carpenter I could not see how she got mixed up on that.\n\nMiss Ahner has her loveable mood on to such an extent and between crying and kissing her children this thing is quite a problem. I told her I had her cheque for March month salary included in cheque, she said that was very nice but the joy of being with her children was more than money to her.\n\nThe whole cry is she wants to stay her time out, there will be no trouble & will go down tomorrow and consult with chief York about further steps.\n\nJ.D.

She talked him out of it and said to wait till she heard from the Department. It is impossible to do anything with her, face to face her pleading and flow language is too much for anyone to be harsh with her.\n\nI consulted Miss McLean and we have came to the conclusion that probably it would be better for the Department to let her teach the quarter out and dispense with her by request letter before the end of the quarter with cheque enclosed.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nW.

Now the warriors feeling the necessity for something to be done to improve conditions in connection with the school, have taken up the matter and last week are circulating a petition among the parents, petitioning the Department to reconsider their decision and grant the request. They feel that a school board would make the school work under special rules and regulations and in close touch with the Department would tend to improve conditions, make the school more efficient and attain results more in harmony with the amount of expenditure the Department is annually making on their behalf.\nAthabasca March 17th 1919\n\nIn reply to above number and date of letter, I beg to report as follows:\n\nMiss Athans, our teacher, received her notice on Friday last, March 7th, and she packed up her belongings on Saturday, and left here on Monday morning on the 8 o'clock A.M. train from Longford for Toronto.\n\nMiss Athans left her class room in very nice order, and numerous other little fixtures that she adorned the rooms with, which looked very neat and trim.\n\nI also found the residence part of the school in the same way.\n\nI did not see her since Department sent her notice to vacate.\n\nI have her cheque here yet I suppose she will write me to forward it to her.

Original on 160370-25F. ONTARIO\n\nREMARKS.-\n\nEverything in the school is in such an unsettled state that it is almost impossible to make a report on the work. The parents do not seem to have any control over their children and allow them to run the roads at night until all hours, consequently the pupils are unable to concentrate their minds on their work and we do not have the results we should. We hoped to have reached the mothers through our Women's Institute but the missionary's wife, who was appointed president of the society last fall after the teacher left, has failed to \"carry on\" the work. We regret this very much as these meetings were the only opportunity we had for securing any kind of co-operation between the school and home and until we have this harmony, the school work is bound to be a failure.\n\nEva M.

In due time he reported and refused to appoint such a board. A short time after Mr. Benson of the Dept. was here on school matters and made the statement that you had no objection to a school board if it would do its work. We are, therefore, sending you this petition asking you to reconsider and grant the request of the council which is also our request, and give us a school board with definite rules and regulations for its operation; also setting forth what authority it shall have in school matters.\n\nWe are very anxious to have our school on a par with the schools around us which are supplied with properly certificated teachers. We feel it would be an advantage to have a properly constituted board here to keep in close touch with the affairs of the school, and to co-operate with you in making the school more efficient in order to attain larger results for the money you are annually spending on our behalf. We have learned that at a conference of Missionaries to Indians with missionary officials at Muncey nearly two years ago, progress was reported in every Indian school in the Province except Rama, and the school is not as efficient as it was then.\n\nOther Indian schools are passing pupils through the entrance examination to the High School, but none are going up from this school or have ever done so.

Both in the school room and in the school house things had been left in a very bad condition\u2014an environment impossible for me to live in and to do my work in the spirit with which I came to work and as I have been accustomed to do. I set a high standard and I was reaching my goal with these little Indian children\u2014they responded as I have never found children to respond before.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI taught two children with the same care and manner\nwith which I taught the children of the Members of Parliament at\nthe Ottawa Model School. When it was my privilege to teach there\nat the beginning of my professional career, and in which manner\nI have ever since taught our children here in Toronto,\u2014and I say\nit proudly, that no white child could beat those little Indians\nI found them possessed with wonderful minds and souls, and of\ngreat ability. They were most responsive. I taught my work\naccording to the very latest and finest Educational Principles.\nMrs. Scott, my classroom at the Pauke Indian School was\nlike a \"Model School.\" If any of my friends, my inspectors,\nor teachers who trained me, had they come to it, they would have\nmarvelled at my work there, and the spirit that breathes in\nmy classroom.\n\nWhy did he inspector of the district, or of the\ndepartment, whose duty it is to call, come? Inspector\nRobinson called early in the morning, after my arrival at the\nschool. (The class had been dismissed owing to illness).\nI spoke with him concerning my work\u2014and he seemed greatly\ninterested. I pointed out things to him that I wished to do, and\nideas for the children I intended to make real with these children.\nHe kindly smiled and said he feared I would disappoint\nmyself\u2014I must remember they were \"just Indians\"\u2014I\nspoke further of my work and interests and he became especially\nsympathetic and very much interested. I asked him when his time\nwould be to make his next professional call, when children\nI tried to be there and to see my results - he said, it would probably be the first or second week of January. He seemed exceedingly kind and sympathetic and interested towards my work. But the Inspector did not come. Why? I asked why?\n\nThere were such disturbing troubles caused towards me, very distressing and disturbing towards my work. People there, (not Indians) presumed to criticize my work who knew nothing of what I was doing, and were utterly incapable of judging her or my work. Why did not an Inspector call? Surely at a time of disturbance it is his duty to come and inspect and to pass his judgment and to give me his protection towards my work which I merited. My classroom was open to inspection, I was ready to welcome any Inspector, or any \"qualified\" Educational Professional. My classroom and my children were a gem of achievement. I have always loved my pupils and been very successful, but I learnt to love those \"little wild flowers\" best of all. I was exceedingly proud of them. My work and my children and my classroom were perfect.\n\nI am not a \"Visionary\" Teacher. I am exceedingly practical, but I have \"Visions\" and I know how to make the child realize them, need to lift him up to those heights - through the strength that God has put into himself.\n\n\"I do Honor and Justice to the nature of a child\" - that is my motto in child training. I deserved the appreciation of the Department and their appreciation and I merited\nwell earned 'hurts' and not blame, and such treatment as was served out to me. I feel hurt to the heart, my professional honor has been hurt. I feel it very keenly.\n\nI am not trying to cast reflection on any person nor on any teacher there with me at the time, or who worked there before me.\n\nUp to nearly Christmas time I had also to be caretaker. Shovel in all that heavy coal, and look after the heating of the furnace\u2014and for the little private room. The agent informed me that that had to be done by the teachers. The other lady teacher (Miss Hawley) very wisely refused. He said he could have her dismissed for refusal to obey him\u2014and I found him out later he seemed very keen to have a teacher \"obey him\" or arrange for her dismissal. I found this man absolutely false. What he said to my face and what he did behind my back were two different things. Why should a man like that be allowed to torture or worry a teacher? He was a person too ignorant to know my work. He became a perfect nuisance and most offensive.\n\nThe Indian master who came to my classroom all feet and deeply appreciated all I did for the children. When Mr. Benson from the Department made his visit to the school building he very kindly said to me that I showed he \"good to myself.\" I thought and felt that\nIt was a very kindly remark\u2014but I had not come here to be \"good to myself.\" I came there to be good to the Indian children through my work with them. I can only be happy when I feel success in crowning my efforts, in endeavoring to teach a child in the most beautiful way.\n\nThe more I did for those children in the care of planning and preparing of my work, the more wonderful and quick was their progress and growth. I simply marvelled at them, each and all. It was all a great surprise to me because I had been told by those who had been, and those who are at the school that what I wished to realize was impossible\u2014they were Indians, and I would be greatly disappointed. I realized all I expected from those children and more. I went there with the love for the lot of my work. I am a teacher of high professional standing and achievement. I had planned my work carefully until \"June,\" as the department had asked me to do.\n\nThe hardest part of the work I had to do, in those few months that I was there. It was like ploughing a hard hard field, freeing it of all stone & debris, and sowing the seed. Why was I not allowed to go on with my work and to help towards its growth and rich bearing? and allowed to see the harvest? I surely deserved that. It was my right position privilege. My work was to be till June\u2014for that my plans were made. Why was I literally thrown out?\nWhy did no inspectors come to see what I was doing? I am hurt to the heart.\n\nI have a deep feeling of professional honor. I upheld and protected the teacher whose class I had taken. I also thought of her while at this hard work with these Indian children, so that when she would be able to return to her work in the fall she might find it easier to go on because I had given a \"good lift.\" No one could have come to take charge of the classroom with a better spirit of \"good will\" than I had towards the teacher whose class was just into my charge until the end of June.\n\nI was very kind to the Indian people\u2014my heart went out towards them. I had never known nor lived nor worked with Indians before\u2014but after a very short while I felt like a \"sister\" in their midst.\n\nI had to do so much in the school building to make myself reasonably comfortable\u2014it took much of my strength\u2014the others there simply \"grumbled\" but I \"dug in\" and did the work. I was never used to anything quite so hard. The \"home\" had been stripped of everything to make the new comers' sojourn easier.\n\nIn order to come to do my work here until June I had to close my home and incur a great number of extra expenses, quite heavy ones... and...\nThe necessary personal needs with me for that time involved a heavy outlay of money, especially for that purpose.\n\nIn order to do the work I did and had planned to accomplish, I had to buy much for the children from my own money\u2014much that I brought with me and some things that I bought afterwards.\n\nAt Christmas time I made a Christmas tree, all of course from my own pocket. I did not want my little Indian children to miss their classroom \"Christmas Day.\" Later I was told that the Department allows ten dollars towards a Christmas tree. When I spoke of a Christmas tree celebration & closing to the agent, he shook his head \"no, no, don't do it. You are doing too much already, too much, too much. You are too good for this place, don't do anything. You are doing too much.\" His attitude and remarks and manner were perfectly ridiculous. He simply tried to dampen any wish I had towards beautiful work. He told me nothing of the fact that the Department allowed \"ten dollars\" towards a Christmas tree.\n\nI had a Christmas tree\u2014a beautiful closing\u2014the parents all came. It was a joyful morning\u2014but I had to do it all myself\u2014with my own money. Why shouldn't my children have a Christmas tree? Doesn't God send us Christmas? Isn't it the greatest gift for the children? I wanted to cost of my\nI spent a great deal of money, too much I gave away,\nmuch I left behind, apart from the travel bill, the\ndepartment paid me off things I had purchased here\nfor my coming. Had I not done so, the \"children's\" and\n\"my time\" would have been \"wasted.\" I simply found\nnothing there to work with when I came. It was like a\n\"desert,\" educationally. It was starved out. What I\nhad brought was so necessary. Nothing was sent\nme by the department until a day or so of Christmas\nor then so little. Those Indian children are so\nworthy of the most careful education as the best of\nwhite children\u2014they respond marvellously and each\nand all could become one of Canada's greatest and\nmost useful assets. (I am speaking very honestly,\nand carefully.) They more than reached my expectations,\nbut one must work with them with unlimited strength\nand joy and dare not to be meddles with by\nthose who have no knowledge of what modern\nEducation means.\n\nDear Mr. Scott, owing to my hasty departure\nwhich was almost forced upon me so that there\nwere some criminal I had to flee for my life; I was\nquite unable to pack my things carefully,\nconsequently several pieces of my best china became\nwith my broken valuable pieces very dear to me which I had brought in purpose because they were so pretty to use in extending hospitality towards visiting Indian mothers. I wished to lead with those Indian children & Indian People an \"Ideal Year\" of life, work, and love to give myself all and all to them in a Christ-like manner of service and work as a teacher according to our highest standards of educational proficiency. I stopped at nothing, counted no cost. I lived a life of self-sacrifice and was glad in heart. I sought nor desired no \"White man's Company.\"\n\nI also gave the children of my room & also of the Senior class when they became for two weeks my pupils, every lunch hour their cup of hot tea with milk sugar. For the winter there was very cold and many many a time had them come into my dining-room and shared my dinner with their little ones. I love to live and to do these things, but I gave my substance my strength. I gave it gladly. But for this did not deserve such treatment as was served out to me through the Letter from Ottawa.\n\nI enjoyed the company of the Indian Mothers, as they would gather around me when school time was over or in the evenings. I spoke with them of what I knew was helpful to them, and what I could feel they needed. I taught them the \"Mother Plays.\"\nAs we use them in our Educational work here in Toronto, and in our Normal School Training Department, the spirit of the true educational thought as it is begun in the kindergarten\u2014this golden thread running like God's Spirit of Life through the entire school life of a child\u2014if the teacher can only feel it and grasp it, and know how to make it practical and adjust it rightly to our prescribed curriculum. It is the golden thread upon which bead by bead according to the child's age and need the curriculum studies of our Educational Course places & can be strung, making the lovely necklace that will adorn the child, give him joy, gladness for his school education through his own joyful & glad & purposeful activity. Every child can feel the spirit of it, for it also is \"life giving,\" and if the teacher understands it rightly herself & has it within her it becomes as it were her power to feel the child's pulse\u2014to know whether the child's growth is correct.\n\nI painted the clear white band of a kindergarten circle on the floor space in front of my classroom. I used it for so much of my work\u2014a absolutely appropriate necessary to the needs of the age of these children of that grade according to the curriculum. Course of study as laid down by the Educational Department, and exceedingly helpful and necessary in the most practical sense of the word\u2014for all their lessons. A skillful teacher knows how\nto adapt and to use the modern devices that are based on the great fundamental principles of education as true as the laws of God. Why was I allowed to be so slightingly spoken of by people evidently of that community or close by, who have no understanding of this work? It was published in one of the Bielle papers. That I was called a \"Kinderartner\" that was beautiful, though I am very sorry to say I am not a trained full fledged Kinderartner; though I have been one in spirit all of my teaching days. I just hold a Kinderarten Primary Certificate issued recently by the Department. I am a qualified experienced Second class Certificate Professional Ontario Teacher also holding Senior Matriculation and First Year University Standing\u2014my discipline\u2014the manners in and out of school of my Indian pupils was perfect\u2014beautiful\u2014I used no strap. The Indian Chief did not require it! They work with my pupils & all that they did & the manner of their life was spiritually perfect. Why should a public paper be allowed to make untruthful statements about me? Where was the Inspector whose duty surely it was to call & prevent & challenge such insults? Those statements were as false as why did not the Inspector come to see my work? It was surely getting high time.\nHow I wished I had welcomed him! A day with my class, as I had arranged my work, I knew, would have been a day of joy for him to have carried away with him in his heart forever. I am not given to praising my work or myself but in this case it has become necessary to speak up for myself.\n\nWhen the agent would call, all he would say, with his hands raised up\u2014\u201cYou are too good for this place! Too good for this place!\u201d I have never heard such nonsense, or have I even been spoken to in such an absurd manner, or he would even persist to most unpleasant flattery\u2014the man became positively peevish\u2014he disturbed me with his very appearance at the door. The holiness & sacredness of the Spirit of Goodness & Truth & joy of High Labour that breathed into life from my children. I tried very hard to be patient and considerate and civil towards him but it became finally impossible\u2014he persisted so in coming when there was absolutely nothing for him to come for and even intruded his self into the short spaces of time that were surely my own. When the children were not here, my own free time that I needed so for a little rest & reflection for my work & by needs there.\n\nI needed the Inspector. I looked for him day by day. I needed him for my peace & my protection again.\nThe strange disturbance which was making my work so unnecessarily hard for me.\n\nThe agent positively discouraged all my endeavors\u2014\nhe was a hindrance and no help. He is a false man, as\nI found him. I am not saying this, Mr. Scott,\nthat you or anyone of the department or elsewhere\nshould be led to hold a different opinion of him\nthan you do. Whatever opinion that may be, or to\ninfluence anyone against him, but, as far as\nI was concerned, for I must tell the truth, as I found\nhim towards me, he was false & wicked. He did\nnot turn out to be what he had pretended he was.\n\nThen after Christmas time the older pupils of the\nSenior Class were left without a teacher. I took them all\nin. What else could I do? I adopted the whole\nfamily. I found the double class-room work very\nunexpectedly easy\u2014a little hard at first but soon\nI became rewarded with the glorious spirit of\nco-operation, good-will & hard work with which the\nchildren responded. I managed beautifully, but it\nsimply took double strength out of me to do it all.\nAnd at the time I had a very heavy cold too,\nbut the children and the work offered no difficulty\nthat I could not meet. The class-room and the work\nwas wonderful, and the Spirit so peaceful and perfect.\n\nI met all difficulties that arose and undertook to do all the work that fell for me to do, no matter how hard or under what trying circumstances.\n\nWhy did the Inspector not come then? He knew the marvels at my classroom work and at those children. Ah! wasn't I proud of those \"little\" and \"big\" Indian children, they were simply perfect. I could feel pages of an educational journal of my work with them, and of the flashes of glorious spirit that glowed gleams from the soul of children when taught as I taught that huge multitude, that room filled. (for they are so numerous) their swarthy faces and beautiful trusting black eyes that looked into your very soul to see if you are true and then when they feel it give themselves in very truth of soul & trust back to me to guide and to help them on. Soon feet, at the end of that second week rewarded for the hard part of the task as it was at first. I felt like one carried on the high crest of a wave, with all the joy of perfect fellowship\u2014a wave, the strength of its waters and its depth meant either \"carry you\" or \"drown you\", but they \"carried\" me. God bless those dear souls as I felt them that end of the two weeks. I could have managed the whole mass successfully very conscientiously in all their work with joy of labour until the end of June!\nThe Indian gives you a sympathy which becomes\nmore strength in labor with him. \u2014 this sympathy which\nhe gives you through his feeling of perfect trust, after he\nhas treated you well, and which we should hold so sacred\n& value so highly, for it is the link whereby we can give him\nthe help for which purpose we come to serve him.\n\nI simply cite these things Mr Scott, to show you\nthat I feel the Department has not done right toward\nme. I feel that further recompensation is coming\nto me. I feel at least that the Department showed\nit is to pay me my salary until the end of June,\nthe time for which I was engaged, for it was till\nthe end of June that I came prepared to do service\nat the Rama Indian School.\n\nI gave \"pure gold\" in service \u2014 I served my\ngovernment with an overflowing measure.\nThis would be at least the Department owes so far\nme to compensate in a measure for the terrible\nnervous shock that I sustained from the manner in\nwhich I was so abruptly & so rudely driven out.\nI have suffered fearfully. I am still suffering great\nnervous discomfort. \u2014 I hope that some permanent\nnervous trouble or resulting organic trouble won't\nsettle upon me. It would be very hard for me to have\nto meet for I stand entirely alone in this world. and\nIf means are very limited at present,\nand as I paid I incurred special expenses which\nwere quite heavy in arranging to come and work as I\nhad planned for until June. All was spent for the\nbenefit of my work in service for the Indian children.\nI also think that the ten dollar allowance towards the\nChristmas tree should come to me, as well as two weeks\nsalary for taking charge of the Senior Class, as well\nas my own when these children were left without a teacher.\nI did the double work.\n\nI take things to heart. I came to work with such\npure, noble, high purpose of achievement and because\nmy work was very successful. It was a great\ndisappointment to me as I was doing my utmost\nfor these Indian children. Why this sudden\ndismissal when I was doing excellent work?\n\nI have entered fully into the spirit & details of my work\nwhile at the Rama Indian School, so that I might see\nfor yourself how unjustly I was treated certainly feel that\nmy salary until June, for the time that I was employed, should\nbe sent to me.\n\nThat is why I have addressed myself to you, as the head of\nthe Department, & I feel that I deserve your sympathy &\nunderstanding.\n\nI feel the Department was wrongly informed about me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGertrude Shiner.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have written at length and have tried to show you just how things were for me at Pama and also to show you, as in a mirror, my work with the Indian children and their parents. My work and my life there, for its very short sojourn, and the beauty of its place, and of its people, was to me like a very beautiful poem that I have folded away in my heart, - never to be forgotten.\n\nI ask you to be so kind to have the patience to read my discourse, as it is truthfully rendered - for I would like to feel that at least some one at the Department of Indian Affairs showed understanding me rightly and since you are the gentleman at the head of the Department I would appreciate this very highly - that is why I have addressed myself to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGertrude Atner.\nJune 27, 1919.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th May to which I would have made reply sooner but that I was waiting for certain information from the agent.\n\nI have considered your representations carefully and I regret that I cannot comply with your request with regard to the payment of salary for any length of time after your duties as teacher at Rama ceased. I have, however, issued instructions that you should be reimbursed for the money expended for prizes last Christmas. Unfortunately, however, the letter was addressed to General Delivery, Toronto. If you have not received it will you kindly make enquiry.\n\nI appreciate the fact that you were earnest in your efforts and I am sorry that there should have been any friction between yourself and other employees of the Department while you were engaged at Rama. The matter, however, must now be considered closed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMiss Gertrude Ahnker,\n1 Bain Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMr Benson,\n\nMight we consider the payment of the salary money and thus soothe the wounded feelings.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She has been attending the Indian dances etc., etc.\n\nTeachers for this position should have a certain stability of character that comes with age. Young girls should not be engaged.\n\nAs far as I have been able to learn, the Minister, Mr. Carpenter is not trying to make himself very agreeable to the teachers. He apparently spends most of his time trying to make trouble for the teachers. His idea is that the school should be in charge of a Local School Board with the Minister as Chairman. I am enclosing a cutting from one of the Grizilla papers, written by him. Something should be done to make this gentleman attend to his own affairs.\n\nTeachers' salaries are steadily advancing and you will very likely have to pay more money for competent teachers.\n\nIt is a distinct loss to the school that Miss McEain is leaving.\n\nRAMA RESERVE\n\nMr. Frank Shilling is in Midland this week attending the district meeting of the Ontario Orphanage.\n\nMr. McPrae has gone back to the Longford woods with his brother, who had taken a contract with the Standard Lumber Company at Longford.\n\nMr. Andrew Young of Rama Reserve and Miss Martha Pawie of Shawanaga Reserve were united in marriage at Rama Reserve today, Friday, Oct. 1919, by the Rev. George Carpenter.\n\nThe school which is a two-room country school and a credit to the Reserve and to the Indian Department which has always been of late in the care of a Kindergarten teacher. It is impossible for one teacher to properly look after a two-room school. If there is a good average attendance of pupils, in this case, however, the attendance is not consistent with what it should be. But there being no school board and no school officer, the system of operation is very poor, and certainly calls on the Agent and the Inspector for immediate suggestions to the Indian Department as they bring forth an improvement.\n\nSurely the children of Rama Reserve are worthy of a proper education, and surely the Indian Department is under obligation to see that the school is equipped with a proper staff of teaching personnel. The present arrangements are made to bring forth greater efficiency in the education of Indian children on this Reserve.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report to Department that I have secured Mr. and Mrs. Gilmore as teachers for the Rama Indian Day School (them being husband and wife) it appears to me as being in future a great deal less friction and annoyance by our missionary against our teachers. They are both qualified teachers and they will be at the school 7 days in the week which will keep things in order and on depressing around its school house, and School Yard.\n\nTo secure Mr. and Mrs. Gilmore it was necessary to raise the salary's $100.00 for Mr. Gilmore and $60.00 for Mrs. Gilmore. They were highly recommended by J. S. Hart M.R.P. for Simcoe.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory to Department.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Myers,\nAtherley-Butt,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs I understand you have charge of Indian affairs for Palma Reserve, I write to ask for some information regarding school attendance for children of school age. I am a keen part-time Indian family by the name of Wesley who lived in a one-room house about the centre of the most thickly populated part of \"Dundee Park\" which is\non the south side of Burrie Road. The neighbors have been kind and friendly to them, but so there are three children of school age (twelve, ten, and eight) receiving no book education. We believe I for one feel that we cannot let such continuance longer without doing something to improve matters. Please let me know if they are supposed to live on the Reserve and attend the school especially provided for them or they be compelled to?\n\nWe have made no inquiries, but you could tell us if there is any law to prevent their attendance from our country Public Schools. I fear even tho' they could attend school in Orillia they would have no chance as the schools are so crowded that several children from Dundas Park who started to attend for the first time were sent home as there were not seats for them. Do not feel responsible for those children as their parents are quite capable of giving them instruction, but it seems different with the Wesley. They are bright children and for their own and their country's sake should not be neglected.\n\nI am only sorry it has not been\nattended to before this.\nWould be pleased to receive\nwhat information you can\ngive at an early date.\nYours truly,\nEdith Dunham.\n\nMrs J.B. Dunham.\nBox 508.\nGriffin - Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herein a letter I received from a lady in Ouelia in regard to an Indian family by the name of John Wesley who belong to the Rama Indian Reservation. I beg to say this man has not resided on the Reserve for over twenty years. He went to Christian Island when a young man and married there and lived on the Island for years with his wife people. They left the Island some years ago and have been living out in white community. Kindly instruct what can be done in this case.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Dunham, Orillia, regarding the children of an Indian family named Wesley of Rama Reserve, who have been for some time residing in the town of Orillia.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as this family does not reside on a reserve, the Department has no authority to compel them to attend school. It is considered that the school authorities of the town of Orillia can exercise the same authority to compel the children of this family to attend school as in the case of white children.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChas.

It is in reference to my claim for salary until June, for the time that I was engaged, also the salary for the two weeks that I had charge of the Senior Pupils\u2014this is coming to me. I did this extra work, and there was no necessity for my dismissal. I did not clash with the other employees of the Department\u2014they made my days bitter too. I found it sometimes almost beyond my power to hold my own\u2014but I had to. It was a struggle for me to have the right to be left alone to do my work and my duties as they arose\u2014and allowed to attend to my own business.\n\nI did not clash with them. I did not cause friction. My salary for the two weeks that I had charge of the Senior Pupils is what I ask for\u2014I did the work\u2014also for the last quarter, the end of the time for which I was engaged. I did nothing to merit dismissal.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nEthel Ather.\nOctober 2, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, claiming a balance of salary due you for the period you taught at the Rama Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you were paid in full for your services.

If good teachers are secured to take charge after the summer holidays, the present truant officer should see that all the children attend regularly and you should inform the parents that the compulsory regulations will be enforced. If the present truant officer does not perform his duties satisfactorily another man should be appointed in his place. The Department will be pleased to have a report from you as to what action you consider should be taken to compel the parents to send their children regularly to school and also whether you consider the present truant officer performs his duties satisfactorily. There is a good school building at Rama, splendidly equipped, and considerable money is spent each year on salaries of teachers and in the maintenance of the school, and the Indian parents should appreciate the advantages provided and see that their children avail themselves of the opportunities offered for an education.\n\nI have to request that you will also be good enough to state whether you have been able to obtain the services of qualified teachers, to begin duties after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. W. Myers, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAtherley, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above number and date of letter.\n\nI beg to report as follows:\n\nOwing to the illness of the junior room teacher, the children did not talk to Mr. Gilmore. The principal was a very reserved man. The parents had the same sentiment and the school officers had very poor encouragement.\n\nBy making an example of the parents that school must be attended by their children will have effect on them. I am of the opinion that lady teachers are the best for this school. In case of illness there always a chance of getting a female teacher to help out.\n\nIt appears the salary is low according to other sections. On my own school section they are offering for a qualified teacher $12 thousand dollars. I also think there should be an advertisement for Rama Indian Day School for teachers stating the salary. I don't think that it is necessary to have a qualified teacher for the junior room. I have not as yet received any application for the school.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. W.

The attention of Dr. Kilpan was called to the fact some weeks ago, and that several children were attending school with their bodies covered with itch. Miss Cowan, our junior teacher has contracted the disease from the children. The council considered the matter at their last meeting and the Truant Officer was commissioned to visit each home and endeavor to get it cleaned up. From past experience I am of the opinion that the matter will drop there.\n\nI would suggest that you deal with the matter with a firm hand.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-1, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Carney, Indian agent for Rama Reserve, has informed me that you have forbidden me to take any of the school time of Rama school for Religious Education. I can hardly believe you would give such a decision if you knew the facts and the present need of the community. I would like you to examine the products of your school at Rama for the generation that has recently passed through the school; it is sufficient to say that the moral and intellectual standard of the young men is very low. We have organized a community club where we are trying to pave the way for better things. We cannot get our young men to hold up their heads where they stand and smoke cigarettes, and we can get them interested...\nin nothing better. We can however get a \ngrip upon the boys and girls in the school. \nThey are a lively lot and are bent \nand soul into any community work. \nThis is our growing crop. Now is it your \ndecision that they grow to be like their \nolder brothers, or can we grow a better \ncrop of useful men and women with \nclean lives? This is the work I am \ntrying to do. If I mistake not, the \nschool act gives me the privilege of \nentering the school and spending \na half hour a week in religious \ninstruction. I am doing that now at \nLongford Public School and spend half \nan hour in each class room each \nFriday. I claim the same privilege \nfor the Ruma School.\n\nFurther, I organized the Boys of the \nRuma School into the \"Trail Ranger\" \norganization and Mrs. McIntyre has \norganized the girls into Canadian \nGirls in Training. You need only turn \nto the Manual of each of these organizations.\nto know what work they cover. The following is part of the program for the girls' classes:\n\n**Intellectual**\n1. School\n2. Workcraft\n3. Collections and Observations\n4. Handicraft\n5. Speaking and Home Reading\n6. Study of Beginnings of Life\n\n**Physical**\n1. Health and Strength\n2. Campcraft\n3. Team games\n4. Group games\n5. Swimming\n6. Athletics\n\n**Devotional**\n1. Church Worship\n2. Church school\n3. Mid-week Bible Discussions\n4. Daily Devotions\n5. Study of Great Christian Leaders\n6. Church Training\n\n**Social Program**\n1. Home helpfulness\n2. Helping others\n3. The clean hand\n4. Observing vocation\n5. Loyalty\n6. Study of Heroes of Service\n\nThe above program is not in opposition to school work. I am working for the good of the school. The school interest\nis more easily kept up. This is all carried on with the hearty cooperation of Miss Bowman the teacher. It was highly commended by the Public School Inspector upon his last visit, and received the approval of Mr. P.M. Abraham.\n\nIt is unreasonable to ask me to take this work out of school hours. The children are much more responsive when they are not weary. They should have their Saturdays free.\n\nWe have been taking the time from last recess on Wednesdays until 4 o'clock. By allowing no recess we get from 2:30 until 4 p.m. I will be glad to hear from you. If you are still inclined to adhere to your decision to the Indian Agent, I would like you to submit the matter to Mr. Abraham for his report.\n\nI have another matter in the following letter to which I wish to call your attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nMissionary.\nOttawa, Nov. 29, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your communication of the 23rd instant, referring to the activities in connection with the Rama Indian Day School and your disappointment in the departmental ruling, as explained to you by Mr. Agent Myers.\n\nI have noted carefully the nature of the work that you and Mrs. McKenzie have been doing, and I am convinced that it would be in the interests of our Indian work if you were allowed to carry on with this activity. The danger in a missionary attending an Indian day school for the purpose of giving instruction during school hours is that the teacher and agent will feel that interference in the work is the result. One of your predecessors, a missionary at the Rama reserve, caused the Department of Indian Affairs no end of trouble, by tactless officiousness and continual \"butting-in\".\n\nI have to inform you that the School Act for Ontario cannot give you the privilege of entering an Indian school for the purpose of religious, or any other instruction because the Indian day schools are managed by the Dominion Government at Ottawa.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department is writing to Mr. Agent Myers, rescinding the order under our letter of November 12th. Since that communication, the Department has undergone a change of mind, following a careful perusal of your letter, and after ascertaining that the vast majority of the Indian band at Rama are adherents of the Methodist Church, to which organization you belong.\n\nI trust that you and your wife will carry on the work that you have begun and will take special care to see that no friction with Department employees takes place.\n\nConcerning your second letter, referring to the skin disease on the Rama reserve, I have to inform you that the Department has taken action, and, if results are not speedily obtained, they will again insist on careful treatment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nReverend C. W. McKenzie,\nR.R.#2,\nAtherley, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have to refer again to your letter of the 17th instant, concerning the activities of the Reverend McKenzie, who is a missionary on the Rama reserve, and who has been conducting classes during school hours on Wednesday afternoon from 2:30 to 4 o'clock, in the Rama Indian Day School.\n\nInformation is to hand concerning this work that Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie are doing; I understand now that it is \"Boy Scout and Girl Guide\" in character and that it might be a loss if we asked the missionary to cease his efforts on behalf of the children. Practically all the band are adherents of the Church which Mr. McKenzie serves and, as you did not intimate in your letter of the 17th instant that you were not in favour of this work, the Department rescinds its order of November 21st, under this file number.\n\nWill you inform the Reverend Mr. McKenzie that he has the Department's permission to continue this work, and that we regret our communication of the 21st instant. He and his wife may, if both you and the teachers are willing, use the hours from 2:30 to 4 o'clock on Wednesday for instruction along the lines that they have been following in the past.\n\nI would be glad if you would make sure that Miss Bowman is in favour of this work on the part of the missionary and his wife, and let us know at your first opportunity the results of the action that you will take, following this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The boys and girls are interested in their meetings, and are learning to take their places well. They get Bible instruction as well. The boys and girls meet separately for a short time, and then meet together for Bible study.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above number and date I beg to say that I reported to the Department, as Miss Bowman said they were meeting for Manual Training and Bible study.\n\nAnd by me reporting the meeting that was held in the school to the Department without any permission given by the Department for these meetings. I thought it was my duty as Agent to inform the Department of the fact. If I made a mistake in so doing, I was under the impression it was right for me to do so.\n\nI visited the School yesterday and informed Miss Bowman that Manual Training and Bible Study was a wrong disruption of these meetings. I asked her if these meetings were Boy Scout and Girl Guide Miss Bowman said no. I asked her to write down what the meetings meant, that I had no knowledge about them. I enclose Miss Bowman version of these meetings.\n\nAs to my own action, whatever the Department wishes I will be pleased to carry out in the best interest of the scholars.\n\nJ.D.

There are plenty of teachers in Ontario who are Normal trained and experienced. I suggest that two experience Normal trained teachers be appointed for the reopening of school in September. These Indians all talk English or nearly all do, I cannot see why they should not have a training similar to the Ontario Public Schools.\n\nI have no further suggestions to make beyond those which I made in my last report, and what I have made re qualified teachers for the Fall term. With the over supply now in the province, there should be no difficulty in supplying trained experienced teachers.\nOttawa, March 29th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, who recently visited the Rama Indian Day School, states in his report that he understands both teachers intend to give up their duties at midsummer.

I have inquired into Miss Lee's character and qualifications. She bears an excellent character but under her qualifications and in view of fact that a qualified teacher is required, and further she is not capable of teaching music or playing the organ, and as Miss Stickle does not play or teach music, I consider that at least one of the teachers appointed should be capable of teaching or playing music.

In discussing the school work Mrs. Stickle mentioned that stress was laid on the work of Household Science and pointed out that if this work was to be properly carried on a sewing machine should be provided for the School. As I inferred from Mrs. Stickle that she is very capable in the line and no doubt a great benefit would be derived by having a sewing machine in the School I moved therefore recommend the purchase of one.\n\nMrs. Stickle also informed me that her agreement so that all supplies are furnished excepting food.

It seemed to be a general agreement with the agent, Miss Stickle and all others concerned that it would be best to seek for a teacher who can play the organ and can teach vocal singing.\n\nMiss Laura Irving of Orillia is making application to you for the position.

This teacher has special training in music, both instrumental and vocal.

It is true that the Department is particularly interested in household science, but I am not prepared to authorize the supplying of a sewing machine at the present time. Later, after the work is well under way, if this equipment appears to be urgently needed, you may again bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nThere is no change of policy in connection with what should be supplied to the teachers at this school, but I wish to make Mrs. Stickle feel as comfortable as possible. In my offer to her, I stated that the necessary furniture and equipment, with the exception of linens, etc., was provided. I mentioned that fuel was supplied by the Department and a janitor employed. I consider that the teachers should continue to pay the electric light charges and supply the smallware, etc. necessary.\n\nWith reference to the time table and course of studies to be followed, you may inform Mrs. Stickle that the Department wishes her to be guided by the curriculum prescribed by the Ontario Department of Education. She should give the practical work particular emphasis and should endeavour to correlate classroom exercises with the activities of the children's homes and environment. You might refer Mrs. Stickle to the advice and instructions printed on the covers of the classroom register.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S.

Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe the Rama School situation as you suggested in your letter of the 17th inst., I went up to Rama to look into conditions. While there, I canvassed the outlook pretty thoroughly with the agent Mr. Anderson, Rev. Mr. McKenzie and the junior teacher. We all agreed that the new junior teacher should supplement with her qualifications what I lack as principal and senior teacher.\n\nWith that in mind, I interviewed Miss Florence Lee yesterday (Tuesday) and find that she has no musical training\u2014neither sings nor plays, and I consider these absolutely essential in the assistant, for I do neither, and the children must have the benefit of both not only because they are fond of both, but for the benefit accruing. Hence, if for no other reason, I should\nbe glad if someone, with professional training and a good singer and player could be found for the junior position. Yesterday I had a letter from Rev. Mr. McKenzie saying that Miss George was applying. She is a trained musician, also I understand a trained teacher and a splendid type. If you could arrange for me to see her before definitely selecting her, I should appreciate it very much. I fancy she would be much better for the position than Miss Lee and Miss Lee has had no experience and only a Model School training, also she would be very near her own home, which last from many years' experience I have found is not apt to work out well, except perhaps in a large city.\n\nNow as to the school and equipments\u2014The living rooms seemed bright, comfortable and very clean. The building needs painting to preserve it as well as to beautify it. Inside, the school rooms must be cleaned and redecorated, with some small repairs sought to be done early in vacation.\nThat everything will be in shape for opening your Cottage Household Service and Manual arts\u2014but I found absolutely no equipment for either. The Department will supply a few requisites as a start we can do good work I believe. I asked Mr Anderson for a Sewing Machine and trust you can get it. An outfit of thread, needles, scissors, crochet hooks, knitting needles, wool, a little cotton goods for practice work &c not costing a great deal, but I feel value to us, would be essential. Gradually I would get here to make up their own materials. If I knew about how much could be spent I should place more suitably. Of course\u2014complete inventory would be kept.\n\nFor Manual arts\u2014we can do not so much except in the gardening line, if partly the grounds can be prepared for a School garden. With knees, pictures, backboards &c\u2014we can do a lot of modelling and repair work. Anything else would require a special equipment in another room to be kept securely locked.\nbetween classes.\n\nIf I can show pretty definitely what I am counting, I fancy we can get results. Incidentally gardening and poultry raising are hobbies of mine.\n\nTrusting that you can supply the articles requested, also put building and grounds in shape and have this fall a small corner of the grounds prepared for a garden in the spring, and that Miss Derry is the assistant we need.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nM. W. A. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-1, part 2)\nOttawa, June 25, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant and I note that you have visited the Rama Indian Day School. I have written to Mr. Indian Agent Anderson, asking him to get in touch with Miss Laura Ivory, of Orillia, who has applied for the junior room, and make a recommendation. The Rev. Mr. McKenzie, of Longford Mills, has already advised her appointment. It might be difficult for you to have an interview with this applicant, unless you are to be in Rama again in the immediate future. If you consider it necessary that you see her before a decision is reached, if you will so inform me I will see what can be done. If I do not hear from you in a few days, I will make the appointment if our agent recommends her.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Anderson, concerning repairs to the school and painting, etc. The Department will allow reasonable expenditure for equipment to be used in the teaching of sewing, darning, etc. You should requisition to Mr. Anderson for what you consider necessary at the outset. I cannot authorize a sewing machine for a day school, until I am absolutely convinced of its necessity. You might also ask Mr. Anderson to arrange for the preparation of a small corner of the grounds for garden purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. Jean Stickle,\n92 Wellesley St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n92 Wellesley St.\nToronto June 26/26\n\nThe Dept. of Education\nDepartment of Native Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of June 25th in regard to my request for an interview with Miss Dow. I wished it more for the making tentative plans for next fall. I am sure from what I have heard of her she will be attended for the primary room and that between us we can do good work there. Her appointment will be satisfactory so far as I am concerned.\n\nI am anxious about the sewing machine for we all thought that teaching the older girls to make their own clothes might hold them in school longer, especially if it were a sort of reward for good standing in the other work. The requisition for a small initial supply of sewing materials will go forward to Mr. Anderson shortly.\n\nAs I should like to take up residence\nat the School about Aug. 20th to 25th, I trust\nthe building can be ready by that time.\nThanking you for your consideration, I\nam\n\nYours Truly\n(Mrs. W.A.)

I have been greatly troubled these past few weeks about myself. I thought I had got myself into serious trouble through some foolish prank of mine & thought it best to leave school. I was going away for good last week. I was...\nmoney this spring. I also would like to ask you what prepared to go, but as Miss Story I could do about this affair took sick I had to go on between Miss Story & I. You will no doubt call me into town next. And was fool. But I am going to give away Thursday. However you the straight facts. While here I found out that love Miss Story very dearly my fears had been groundless. I love her as a sister's pal so now I am undecided as I do not wish to give her up to what to do. Being her entirely. But would like to quit from any trouble I would this nonsense of seeing each other all the time. Chiefly for her sake. But I can't pound it in again on the other hand her head. I see now what a fool I have been for giving into trapping, as that is the only way I know how to get money. The honest way I know of getting not wish to impress upon you rich quick & I will be seeing\nmind that she is nothing to me because she is a bird of prey who has stolen her nest at times my footsteps into the narrow way but I guess she hopes that you think it would be better if I dropped her entirely? I really think it would do me a lot of good to get away for a few weeks. That, if you could take me back, welcome! Study like a madman. However if you think differently & if I take back my last chance it will be all right. But write little me what you think would be best. I trust you will keep this to yourself. Possibly know what the trouble was and miss every cold and meet.\n\nAbout it. Maybe you will think this is one big lie, but write. Tell me if it so.

The handiwork of the school reflects credit on the staff of two teachers, Mrs. Stickels and Miss Edith Wilcox.

There are quite a few large boys and girls in the Senior room. Miss McKinnon certainly cannot handle the senior room. I can see already that it will not be long until the pupils get away from Miss McKinnon's control. If Miss Willox can control the senior room that would give the solution as Miss McKinnon would likely be able to get along all right in the Junior room. In advertising you might not get any one better. At present I do not know of a strong teacher out of a position. If Mrs. Stickle had resigned in June we could have easily obtained a strong teacher. Have a talk with Miss Willox. Let her know what I have said about the big boys and girls in the Senior room. It is going to require firmness and at the same time judgment to handle them. If Miss Willox feels confident that she can be master of situation then the arrangement with Miss Willox in the Senior room and Miss McKinnon in the Junior room might be tried till Christmas, and if it is satisfactory it could be continued. You may make use of this letter in making any recommendation to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R. Ferguson.\nI.F.S.

Ferguson for his opinion, and also the appointing of Miss Ruby McKinnon (who has been in charge of the Senior) to the junior room.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Mr. Ferguson's letter dealing with the matter.\n\nI have interviewed both Miss Wilcox & Miss McKinnon and have arranged that Miss Wilcox takes over the senior room & Miss McKinnon the junior room from this date.\n\nI have no doubt that Miss Wilcox will make a success in the senior room and Miss McKinnon will get along in the junior room straight. This is Miss McKinnon first school and her graduation at the Toronto Normal School May 1917-18. She a second class certificate and also Physical training certificate.\n\nI advised Miss McKinnon that proceeded her work.\nLongford Hall\nOct 15, 1928\n\nwas not satisfactory her engagement would terminate by giving her one month notice, and if she was not satisfied we would expect one month notice before leaving from her.\n\nI was going to leave Miss Shibley for she was a very capable teacher, but I have no doubt from the arrangement now made that good results will follow.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRama Bandon River\n\nTo Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nV.S.\n\nThe Salary Miss McKenna is to receive is $600 per teaching month.\nOttawa, October 23, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, relative to the appointment of a junior teacher for the Rama Indian Day School and enclosing an application from Miss Ruby McKinnon for the position, together with a communication from Mr. T.

Her retention in the position will depend entirely upon the success with which she meets in her work.

In this connection I have to say that, owing to our funds being entirely assigned, the Department is not prepared at the present time to consider a further increase in Miss Willox's salary.

My wife is an ex-teacher, and taught for several years. I taught six years in Barrie. We have conceived the idea that this school would be very suitable for a man and wife. We have no children living.\n\nWe both take an active interest in Sunday School work here in Barrie, and would be well fitted for this sort of work among the Indians. Also we have very fond of the Indians as a people.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. E. Carson\nOttawa, January 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, requesting to be informed as to the steps you should take in applying for the position as teacher of the Rama Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that insofar as the Department is aware it is the intention of the present teachers to remain for the balance of the school year. Their services are satisfactory, and they might desire to retain their positions for the school year 1930-31. There are, however, a number of other schools having partially furnished residences in connection therewith where the services of a married teacher might be required for the next school year. Certain of these schools are conducted under the auspices of one or other of the religious denominations associated with the Department in the education of Indian children, and we look to the authorities of these churches for the nomination of teachers. If you will inform the Department of the religious denomination to which you belong, you will be advised of the name of the church officer to whom you should forward an application. Your letter has been placed on our file and will receive consideration should a suitable opening occur for the services of a married teacher. The qualifications which you possess have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. E.

It is stated that you are a member of the United Church of Canada. As stated in our former letter, we look to the authorities of this church for the examination of teachers of Indian schools conducted under its auspices. You should apply to\n\nRev. Rev. B.

Three of them are anxious of being able to get away early in May to take positions in Manitoba.

This Department has no part in the preparation of the Entrance papers or in the arrangements made for the holding of the Entrance Examinations.

He agreed to take the matter up and see if arrangement could not be made for the pupils to write at home in their own school. He would only agree on condition that some responsible party present at the examinations, and I suggested Mr. McSue. I interviewed Mr. McSue and he was agreeable. The condition Mr. Ferguson stipulated was that he would be at no expense for the County.\n\nPrevious year accommodation was provided to convey the pupils of Rama Indian Day School to district where examinations are held. Provided arrangements are completed for the pupils to write at home. I would suggest that a fee be allowed Mr. McSue about the same as transportation would have cost.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs Agent\nRama Indian Reserve\n\nIndian Affairs.

The presiding officers do not receive their hotel expenses. They merely receive their fare to and from the centre along with their regular fees. Now it is too bad to drop this after all the work we have gone to. It does not matter to the Department of Indian Affairs who is the presiding officer. It is too late for me to take up this matter with that Department through the Department of Education for this year. I feel confident I could get a qualified officer to act for the regular fees without expenses, by explaining the circumstances. Then the County could pay for paper etc., as they would have to do if they wrote at Uptergrove. If this is satisfactory I shall go ahead and arrange for a centre this year at Rama. If it is not I shall have to explain to the Department the reason for dropping the proposal. There is only one thing that causes me to go to this trouble and that is sympathy with the Indian children. Please let me know at your earliest convenience if we are to go ahead with the above arrangements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.

I have to premise, and that the usual fee would be allowed him.\n\nFrom the enclosed letter you will note that Mr. Sasse cannot act as presiding officer, and to have another party preside will incur additional expense. That I have not your authority to incur, though there is a possibility from Mr. Ferguson's letter that he may be able to serve an officer at regular fee.

(RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 31, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letters concerning the two vacancies at the Rama Indian Day School. The Department has several applications for these posts. One is from Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Carson, of Box 401, Barrie, Ont. Mr. Carson is 38 years of age and has a second class certificate. His wife also is a teacher. They have no children and would like to take the two rooms. Mr. Carson and his wife are members of the United Church.\n\nThere is also an application from Mr. R. A. Gibson, who has taught for this Department before. He also is a member of the United Church. He has two children and he is desirous of securing a school so situated that the children can attend high school. He is very much interested in the Rama opening. He states that he and his wife would be willing to board the junior teacher. I am very much impressed by Mr. Gibson's application, but I doubt if there is room for a junior teacher in the residence if he and his wife and two children live there. Can a suitable boarding place be secured close to the school where the junior teacher if Mr. Gibson were appointed? If he were appointed and satisfactory arrangements can be made for the junior teacher's board, I am inclined to recommend Miss Gladys Swerdfeger, who has taught for the Department on the Tyendinaga Reserve. She would do very well in the junior room, as she is experienced and has a first class professional certificate.\n\nIf the Department appoints two young lady teachers to these vacancies, Miss Swerdfeger would be quite satisfactory for the senior room and it is possible that Miss Mary Smith, R. R. No. 1, Atherley, Ont., would do well in the junior room.\n\nThe Department is informing certain other teachers, who have applied, that their applications are not being considered, and I should be grateful if you would advise Mr. George Young, 356 Cheapside St., London, Ont., who wrote to you on the 15th instant, that other arrangements are being made for this school.\n\nAs you are acquainted with the situation, the Department would like to have your recommendation. Please give the filling of these positions careful consideration. Discuss the matter with the Rev. Mr. Snell if you think it advisable to do so and telegraph your recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. S.

Gibson's application, there is not sufficient accommodation provided to secure the appointment for himself, wife, two children and the junior teacher, and accommodation for the junior teacher could not be secured in the immediate vicinity of the School. And in addition provided his two children were to attend Ootlica High School which is the nearest to Rama Reserve they would require to leave by 6 A.M. by train leaving Roma Station at 6.30h each morning and returning leave Ootlica in evening at 7 P.M. and accommodation again to be made.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the parents of the candidates are unable to provide the cost of their transportation and board during the time they are writing the examinations, this Department would favourably consider payment of same. It is expected, however, that the candidates will arrange for their own expenses.

I cannot recommend that any action be taken in the matter, and it is to be regretted that any friction between the Teacher and members of Rama Band should occur. From investigation it would appear that it is nothing but strife between a few.\n\nI took the matter up with Miss Swindley the same teacher and enclose herewith her report.\n\nI have seen Miss Swindley since receiving her report and pointed out to her that I did not approve of these dancing in the Class Rooms, and had no objection to them having a party in their own quarters.\n\nThe record of the present Teacher is quite satisfactory which you are no doubt aware from the Inspector's report.

Attendance is very good and the pupils are making satisfactory progress. Both teachers are efficient and interested in the pupils. They take an active part in Church and Sunday School work among the young people. Chief Snack complained of the teachers having a social dance in the residence for their local white friends and asked that they be dismissed. I enquired into the whole matter and found there were no grounds for any such action. The teachers have been entertained in a very friendly way by the local white residents, in return they invited these friends to dinner in the school residence and had some dancing in one of the classrooms. There is nothing to seriously criticize in their action and I would recommend that no attention be paid to any further complaints from the band in this regard.

All the town schools and the majority of rural schools are taking it now as a regular subject.\n\nBesides having my A.T.C.M., I have taken a special course on teaching Vocal in schools given in Toronto, therefore am fully qualified.\n\nOur plan is to give a weekly lesson, thirty during the school year, which is all we can get in conveniently when we take into consideration holidays and examination time.\n\nSydney, Ontario\nAug. 28/36.\nI would teach the year for $200.\na room, of course the Government\ngave a grant of $30. besides a\nspecial grant of $30. for each room.\nI have not as yet received a\nnew syllabus but the grants\nwill no doubt be much the same\nas last year.\n\nI would be willing if you\nwish to assist the teachers in\ngiving concerts or some sort of\nentertainment to help defray the\nextra expense so you see the\nfinancial part of the proposition\nis of minor importance.\n\nI feel sure you would never\nregret having music as an extra\nsubject in your school as they learn\nSight-Singing, The Fundamentals of\nPiano-Playing, Ear-Training, Voice-\nTraining, Expression, Blending of\nVoices, Interpretation & Chorale Conducting\nand get a great deal of pleasure out\nof it all.\n\nThanking you in anticipation\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours to command,\n\n(Miss) Katheline McLean,\nHoney, Ont.\nLongford Mills, Ont\nSeptember 12th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter I received from Miss Katheline McLean of Udney, Ont., regarding teaching Vocal music in the Rama Indian Day School.

S. Anderson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 24th inst., Miss G. Swerdfeger, senior teacher at Rama Indian Day School, notified me that a number of the pupils had head lice.\n\nI arranged with Dr. W.E. Brown, for a solution for treatment, and further with Mrs. Annie Benson, of Rama Reserve, to visit the school and treat whichever pupils required it. After treating for several days, and overcoming the trouble, the worst case after being cleaned up, again returned to school with another lot of lice.\n\nIt was therefore evident that the other children in the home that Herbert Sawyer was coming from were infested, so I arranged with Dr. W.E. Brown, to have the other children at the home of the father Ben Sawyer, also cleaned up.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nAgent,\nRama Indian Reserve.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR F.

MacKinnon, effective July 1, 1942, and no further payment of salary should be made to her. I will advise you later regarding her successor.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJuly 25, 1942.\n\nEAD.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIn Mr. Pratt's memorandum of June 6, 1941, he suggested the employment of Mrs. J.G. MacKinnon as teacher of the senior room at the Rama Indian Day School for the academic year 1941-42. Mrs. MacKinnon was employed and her services were satisfactory, but she has now advised us that she does not intend to resume duties during the academic year 1942-43.\n\nUnder these circumstances it will be necessary to secure another teacher. A Protestant, female teacher, holding Ontario certificates, should be secured, if possible. The school will re-open on October 1, 1942. There are two classrooms in this school and living quarters are provided for both teachers. Salary will be allowed the new teacher at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. As you know, the academic year is for a period of nine months.\n\nI should appreciate your advising what action should be taken to secure a teacher for this school.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAug. 13, 1942\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRama Indian Day School.\nre- Teacher of Senior room.\nI.A. File 24-1-1.\n\nI return, herewith, memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs, July 23, regarding the appointment of a teacher of the senior room at the Rama Indian Day School, to replace Mrs. MacKinnon.\n\nThere would seem to be difficulty in locating a suitable teacher as replacement. I understand the School Inspector has no one in view. If the department is not aware of anyone, probably it would be just as well to advertise the position.\n\nYou might advise this office of the action being taken.\n\nW.G. Bethune\nAsst. Private Secretary.\n\nEnc.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nPlease advise.\nOttawa, August 17, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nConsiderable difficulty has been experienced in securing a teacher for the senior room of the Rama Indian Day School. The information at our disposal indicates that the School Inspector for the district has not at the moment anyone that he would recommend for the position.\n\nThe suggestion has been made that we might advertise for a teacher in the papers published in the district. You might at your convenience let us have any comments you may care to offer on this suggestion. We naturally hesitate to incur the expense of advertising if there are no teachers in the district.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. H. J. Featherstone,\nIndian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReference: 24-I-I\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 17th in regard to advertising for a teacher for the senior room of Rama Indian Day School, I would advise that an add in the Globe and Mail, Toronto would be the most likely to get results. Teachers looking for positions, keep their eye on this paper.\n\nThere are one or two things that it may not be out of place to bring to your attention at this time, in regard to the school. I have had reason to believe, in the past, that the R.C.M.P. had had some intimation from the Department to be very slow about taking action against Indian parents for neglecting to send their children regularly to school. Right now, the Indian is sitting on top of the world and is more hard boiled than before. The teacher finds it hard to get the Indian children to cover the work and when the attendance is poor it is that much more discouraging. In my opinion an example might be made of some, with benefit.\n\nThe second, is the appointing of a teacher to take the senior room and who is therefor regarded as the senior teacher in the school, who is junior in experience and who holds a lower certificate than the junior room teacher. This was done last year and does not tend to make things run smoother between the teachers.\n\nThese are two things that occur to me and are offered for what they may be worth.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It might be advisable for you to discuss the attendance at this school with the members of the Rama Council and inform them that, unless the attendance at the school can be improved, you will recommend that action be taken under Section 10 (paragraph 4) of the Indian Act.\n\nI am disposed to think that you might advertise the position, as you suggest, in the Globe and Mail. Salary will be allowed the senior teacher at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month, plus the existing cost-of-living bonus, which amounts to approximately 17%. You should send forward a clipping taken from the paper with a voucher covering the cost of this advertisement.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. H. J.

Duties to commence October first. I am Protestant, Anglican, forty-six years of age - and before my marriage I had over ten years successful teaching experience, all in ungraded schools. I am a good disciplinarian and was always particularly successful with my Entrance classes. Last year I resumed the work of teaching to fill in where teachers were needed. I was\nat S.S. #3 Forts, Mackinac from October until June, being given a permit by the Department of Education, which same permit would be granted me for whatever school engaged my services this year. I had the Third Class Certificate renewed at Brockville summer schools and taught over ten years.\n\nFor many years I lived very near the Roma Reserve and although I cannot speak the Indian language, I am familiar with the life of the Indian people and understand their attitude and difficulties.

I have no children, and am free to go anywhere. I had accepted a position here as teacher, but the day before school opened here Sept. 1st, the school Board notified me on account of being an Ontario trained teacher I wouldn't be able to accept the\nposition, and on account of it being so late in the season, I haven't as yet secured another school.\n\nI am the holder of a Permanent Second Class certificate no. 40721, also an Agricultural certificate no. 11851.

In that letter I suggested to you that you should send in an application for the vacancy then existing at the St. Clair School in the Sarnia Agency.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from the teacher who was appointed to the Rama vacancy in which she states that, owing to illness, she will not be in a position to report for duty on October 1, nor at any time in the immediate future. I have been wondering if you were still interested in this position. The salary at this school is, as you know, $95.00 a teaching month, plus cost-of-living bonus which, at this date, amounts to approximately 17%. The teacherage is attached to the school and is furnished. You would be expected to take a certain amount of your own linen, etc. Should you require additional information you could secure it from Mr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent, Longford Mills, Ont.\n\nYour immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated. In view of the fact that we intend, if at all possible, to open the school on October 1, would it be possible for you to wire your acceptance?\n\nYours truly,\n\nMrs. Annie J. Garry,\nR.R.

These reports indicate that Miss McNeice is a hard-working, conscientious teacher and one who has been interested, not only in her classroom work, but in the general welfare of the Indians on the reserve. The Inspector recommended the promotion of Miss McNeice from the junior to the senior room in his report dated March 26, 1941. However, the officials of this Department found it impossible to make this promotion, owing to circumstances over which they had no control.\n\nWe received Miss McNeice's resignation with a great deal of regret, this year.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has just been drawn to my attention that Mrs. Olive I. Akiwenzie may have been appointed teacher in Sidney Bay Indian School, although I had definitely stated that I felt her academic and professional qualifications were not sufficient for this appointment.\n\nSome weeks ago the local agent, Mr. F.W. Tuffnell, wrote asking me to recommend a teacher for this school. I have been working on the matter ever since, but only a few days ago succeeded in making contact with a qualified teacher willing to live in the Reserve. On August 23rd Mr. Tuffnell sent me an application from Mrs. Akiwenzie, and asking for my recommendation in connection with it. My reply in part was as follows:\n\n\"I note that this applicant has had but three years in High School and has had no professional training whatsoever. In my white schools at the present time I have three teachers who hold temporary permits but each has attended Normal School having failed on examinations there. I am not prepared yet to recommend any person with lesser qualifications than these. In the meantime I think it best to wait another week or two. If by September 7th no suitable application has come in it might be necessary to consider seriously Mrs. Akiwenzie's letter. Today I was in touch with two teachers whom I thought might accept the position, and I purpose contacting several more this week.\"\n\nOn August 27th I wrote Mr. Tuffnell as follows:\n\n\"After writing a considerable number of letters and putting through a half dozen long distance telephone calls I think I have secured a suitable applicant for the position of teacher in Sidney Bay Indian School. Miss Anna MacDougall of Kincardine informs me that she has sent you a formal application and I do not hesitate to recommend that she be appointed.\"\nR.A. Hoey  \nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\n\n\"Miss MacDougall taught for 3\u00bd years in Haldimand County on a third class certificate which has since expired. She holds a B.A. degree from Queen's University and while securing this taught several summers in rural schools in the Prairie Provinces. She also took a short Normal Course at the Regina Normal School. During April, May and June of this year she supplied in a rural school in West Bruce under Inspector Geo. Dobson. Mr. Dobson informed me today that she had done quite satisfactory work.\"\n\nSince my letter of the 27th two fully qualified teachers listed below indicated to me that they would accept an appointment in Sidney Bay Indian School. There are:\n\nMrs. O. Farrow, Second Class Certificate, Wiarton, r.r. # 4.\n\nMrs. Ina Shaw, Second Class Certificate, Walkerton.\n\nIn view of these factors it appears to me that there was unnecessary haste in appointing an unqualified teacher. If the appointment by any chance has not been made I would urge that my recommendation of the 27th be followed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Game\nOttawa, September 10, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of September 3 and we appreciate very much the efforts that you have made to secure teachers for our schools. Mrs. Akiwenzie is an Indian and as the school is not a heavy one we felt that she could handle it for the current year at least. Her appointment has been made.\n\nI am very much interested in the statement in your letter, that Mrs. O. Farrow and Mrs. Ina Shaw are anxious to secure a school.\n\nWe have a two-room school on the Rama Indian reserve, 7 miles from Orillia. The attendance is approximately 25 pupils in each room and we have living accommodation for two persons, attached to the school. If the two ladies just mentioned would be interested in this school, we would be pleased to accept them. The Indians on the Rama reserve have never caused us any trouble, and as the school surroundings are good, I feel that the ladies mentioned should be interested.\n\nOne of them could be appointed principal and the other, assistant. You would be the best judge of who should be named principal. For the principal we would allow a salary of $95.00 a teaching month and for the assistant, $65.00 a teaching month. In each case they would receive, in addition, the cost-of-living bonus at the rate of 17%.\n\nI trust that you will find it possible to bring our offer to their attention. If they are\n\nJ. M. Game, Esq., B.A., B. Paed.,\nInspector of Public Schools,\nWalkerton, Ont.\n\np.t.o.\nwilling to accept, you could wire me, Collect, and you can authorize them to proceed to the school immediately.\n\nThe Indian agent is Mr. H.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of the 10th instant in which you state that two teachers are required for the Indian School on Rama Reserve, and that Mrs. Olive Farrow, r.r. # 4 Wiarton, and Mrs. Ina Shaw of Walkerton would be appointed if they applied.\n\nFollowing the receipt of your letter I telephoned to your Agent, Mr. H.J. Featherston, Longford Mills, in order to ascertain the size of the residence as both teachers have children who would accompany them. I then interviewed Mrs. Shaw and telephoned Mrs. Farrow. Neither teacher appeared to be interested in going so far from her present home. However, I gave each full particulars concerning the school, your name and address, and also the name and address of the Agent. I have had no further word from these ladies but it is barely possible that one or other may have sent in an application. Mrs. Farrow has an eight-year old girl while Mrs. Shaw has a two-year old boy and a seven-year old boy. The former has good qualifications as she has taught two years in an Indian School and five years on the Staff of the Public Schools in Sault Ste. Marie. She holds a second class certificate.\n\nI would not hesitate to recommend Mrs. Farrow as principal of your school. It would not appear advisable, however, to have two families of children in the residence, but one eight-year old girl would fit in satisfactorily. Possibly Miss Anna McDougall of Kincardine whom I recommended for the Sidney Bay School might be interested in the position of assistance in Rama School. I am sending her some information concerning the position. If I can be of further assistance I shall be pleased to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M. Game\nDear Mr. Game:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the action you have taken regarding our suggestion of engaging Mrs. Farrow and Mrs. Shaw as teachers at the Rama School. As you state in your letter, it would not be advisable to have two families of children in the residence. However, as you state, Mrs. Farrow would be acceptable and, if Miss McDougall would accept the assistant's position, we would be prepared to appoint her. We have not yet heard from Mrs. Farrow.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity of expressing our thanks for the assistance that you are giving in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.M. Game,\nInspector of Public Schools,\nWalkerton, Ont.\nSeptember Twenty-Second 1943\n\nR. A.

I have contacted these two ladies again advising them that you are willing to accept applications from them for the positions of principal and assistant in Rama Indian School. If they are not interested in going so far away from their homes there is nothing I can do, I suppose, to persuade them. I discussed the matter to some extent with Mr. Arneil today.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. M. Game\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThere is a possibility of our being able to secure the services of Rev. J. R. Hayward for Rama. Mr. Hayward is a Bachelor of Science and is, I understand, a certificated teacher, but of that I am going to make sure. In any case, he has taught around Elk Lake, where he is now, to the satisfaction of an Inspector. I do not know whether we can persuade the present incumbent at Rama to go to Elk Lake, but we can try - particularly if the school is still vacant.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Hayward would not do everything for Rama, as it would still leave one room vacant; but it might be better to try to work it with one teacher than to have none; and if we had a man who was competent to teach and preach, it might be possible to get another teacher to go in.\n\nI will be glad to hear from you as soon as possible whether there is a possibility of your appointing Mr. Hayward. Mr. Lyttle, our Superintendent of Missions, will be at Elk Lake - where Mr. Hayward is at present - at the end of the week, and will wire us to see if he can make the necessary move, provided the school at Rama is still open.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\nOttawa,\nSeptember 30, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th instant, I appreciate your co-operation in securing the services of Rev. J.H. Hayward and, if you can secure him, the Department is prepared to approve his appointment. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $95.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. Teacher's living quarters are attached to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo.

Hoig, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIf you have not already secured a teacher for the junior Department of the Rama Indian School near Orillia, I would like to apply for the position.\n\nMr. Game, J.P.S., of Walkerton, may have mentioned to you my qualifications. I taught for three and a half years in Haldimand County on a Third Class certificate which has expired. I hold a B.A. degree from Queen's University and while securing this taught several summers in rural schools in the Prairie Provinces. I also took a short Normal Course at the Regina Normal School. During April, May and June of this year, I supplied in a rural school in West Bruce under Inspector Geo. Dobson.\n\nOn account of never having taught in a graded school and having no recent professional training,\nI have hesitated to apply for the position. However, \"The Canadian Teacher\" and the aids to teaching sent out by the Dominion Teachers Service, Toronto, could be used as a guide in outlining the work. A course in Teacher Training could be taken later during the holidays.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nAnna MacDougall.\n\nAddress:\nMiss Anna MacDougall,\nKincardine,\n\"The Beach\" Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 3, 1943.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, applying for appointment as teacher of the Rama Indian Day School.\n\nWe have been attempting to secure two teachers for this school since the end of June, but we have been unsuccessful. Recently we requested the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada to secure teachers for it and we had a letter yesterday from the Associate Secretary in which he expressed the opinion that he could secure the services of Rev. J.R. Hayward as principal of the school. I am not certain if, in the event of Mr. Hayward accepting the position, he will wish to use the residence attached to the school, or if there is a mission house available for him. Consequently the appointment of a teacher for the junior room will depend to some extent on the appointment of the principal.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to Rev. Geo. Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, 299 Queen St. West, Toronto 2, Ont. I suggest that you also communicate with him and I feel that he will adjust the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Anna MacDougall,\nKincardine, Ont.\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI received today an application from Miss Anna MacDougall of Kincardine, Ont., for appointment as teacher of the junior room at the Rama Indian Day School. For your information I enclose copy of our reply to her and you will note that I have expressed the opinion that she should correspond with you. Possibly you have a mission house at Rama which would leave the living quarters at the school available for Miss MacDougall.\n\nI desire to take this opportunity of again expressing our appreciation of your assistance in securing teachers for the Rama School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have to report that no progress has been made in the matter of securing teachers for Rama Indian Day School in so far as this office is concerned.\n\nUnless the Department has someone in view, I would suggest that the matter be given some publicity through the press in the hope of attracting some married women who, possibly have not recently been teaching. The first step would necessarily be a paid advertisement.\n\nH.J. Featherston\nIndian Agent, Rama Agency.\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1943.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent, Longford Mills, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the Department has been in communication with the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada with a view to securing teachers for the Rama Indian Day School.

J. R. Hayward's appointment have fallen through - we cannot secure him for Rama. I am writing to Miss Anna MacDougall to say that we are referring her application again to you, under the circumstances, and that she will hear from you in due course. I do not know whether you want to appoint her alone.\n\nI am very sorry that our attempts to help you out have not met with success.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

R. Hayward for the position of missionary teacher at the Rama School.\n\nIn view of this fact, I have been wondering if you would be prepared to take over the junior room at Rama. Salary would be allowed you at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month, plus cost-of-living bonus. I may add that while we have not yet secured a teacher for the senior room at this school, an attempt will be made to fill that vacancy at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

My girlfriend and I, who have both completed five years of high school, feel that we, with the present shortage of teachers, are quite capable of helping out in this capacity.\n\nWe would like you\nto consider this as our application for the vacancies in Rama Indian Day School. If this application should meet with your approval, we will perform our duties to the best of our ability.\n\nWe anxiously await your reply.\n\n(Miss) Alice Franklin\n(Miss) Dolores Flavelle.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith the applications of Miss Alice Franklin and Miss Dolores Flavelle for the teaching positions in Rama Day School.\n\nI do not know anything about the applicants.\n\nH.J.

She has accepted the position and will reach the reserve in time to re-open the junior room on November 1. I feel that it is very desirable to have the senior room opened at the same time, if at all possible, and consequently I suggest that you engage either Miss Franklin or Miss Flavelle as a second teacher. If either one of them accepts then Miss MacDougall and the other teacher can mutually agree which one of them will be in charge of the school. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. I trust that you will find it possible to give this matter your immediate attention and that you will be successful in obtaining one of the two ladies mentioned as the second teacher.

As yet they have not given any intimation of their intention of giving up duties at the end of the current academic year and at the present time I hesitate to decide to make any change.\n\nWould it not be possible to defer a decision on this matter for a month or two? Possibly by that time we would be glad to accept your offer.\n\nYou are probably aware that teachers' living quarters are attached to the school. If a man were appointed teacher and intended to use part of the living quarters it would necessitate the second teacher rooming elsewhere. Possibly you have a mission house which could be used by the male teacher, in the event of such an appointment being made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 9, 1944.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent, Longford Mills, Ont.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would make inquiries with a view to ascertaining if Miss McDougal and Miss Franklin wish to continue as teachers of the Rama Indian Day School for the academic year 1944-45.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 9th, I would advise that Miss MacDougal likes the work at Rama Indian Day School and is satisfied to continue for another year. She intends to take a refresher course at midsummer.\n\nMiss Franklin is undecided. She, naturally, has found the work difficult.\n\nH.B. Featherston\nIndian Agent, Rama Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have to report that the discipline in the Rama Indian Day School has deteriorated to a point that some change will have to be made.\n\nBoth teachers made a good start last fall. For some weeks it has been apparent that all was not well in the senior room and I have given Miss Franklin my utmost support in an effort to rectify the situation. When the pupils started walking out of the room, I had the R.C.M.P. round them up and try and impress them. The police report to me that these big girls were so bold that they would even talk back to them. I have kept in close touch with the situation and on the evening of April 4th, Miss MacDougal phoned me asking me to come down before nine in the morning. In going into the matter with both teachers together I was informed that the situation in so far as the senior room was concerned, was completely out of hand, that the children would do nothing that they were told, were impudent, would go out of school or stay out as it suited them and the previous day, when the outside door was locked at recess, had smashed a panel out of the door.\n\nMiss MacDougal stated that Miss Franklin had done her best, that the children had rebelled against all authority and that they were not going to do anything that they were not actually compelled to do and so far as she was concerned, she was not going to lower herself to the point of fighting with them nor had she the physical strength to do so, pointing out that these girls were stronger than either of them. She stated that she had liked the work but under the circumstances that had arisen, she would not be back after Easter. We discussed various possibilities at considerable length as to what\ncould be done. I instructed the teachers to call school and if the situation got out of hand in the senior room to dismiss school at noon for the holidays. I had a talk with the senior room and tried to put some shame into them.\n\nThere is no trouble in the junior room, other than a reflection of the senior pupils's misconduct and Miss MacDougall, in my opinion is doing a good job. I encouraged her to continue and assured her that the present situation could not continue and would not be permitted to continue and some change would be made for after the holidays. Miss MacDougall agreed to continue with this understanding.\n\nMiss Franklin realizes that things can not continue without a change and thinks that if the following pupils were removed that possibly she could continue; Harvey Pavis, born Mar. 28, 1929; Joyce Martell, born Dec. 4, 1930; Shirley York, born June 27, 1930 and Geraldine Snache born July 6, 1931. I think it most unlikely that she could do so. I think that there is little to choose between these named and several others and that once control is lost it can seldom be regained. It will be noted that none of these girls are as yet fourteen and one is not thirteen. If these children are allowed to stay out of school, it will be only what they want to do and will, as well, have a bad effect. If they are sent to a residential school, I imagine, compulsion would be required. These are big husky girls, as big or bigger than the teacher.\n\nSince Miss Swerdfeger's time we have only had one teacher, Mrs. Mary MacKinnon, who could handle this room and I think it would be indeed a very exceptional woman who could now handle the job. It requires a man.\n\nI trust that I shall be advised in the matter before the end of the holidays otherwise I purpose not opening the senior room until some solution is worked out.\n\nH.J. Weatherston\nIndian Agent, Rama Agency.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nAs requested by telephone on April 10, I instructed Agent Featherston to come to Toronto on April 11. At that time Mr. Doucet and myself discussed very fully with him the situation that has arisen at the Rama School, due to the fact that Miss Franklin is apparently unable to control the pupils. It was quite evident from the report given to us by Mr. Featherston that it would be a waste of time for all parties concerned to allow Miss Franklin to return to this school. Two alternatives were suggested:\n\n1. Close the senior room for the balance of the current academic year. This would result in four or five pupils who are taking their entrance work losing their year and Agent Featherston was instructed to speak to Miss McDougal about the matter with a view to ascertaining if she would be prepared to teach these entrance pupils at least in addition to her regular class.\n\n2. Transfer Miss Daly from the Caughnawaga U.C. School to the Rama School until the end of June. At the present time the attendance at the Caughnawaga School has decreased considerably and Mr. Doucet feels that one teacher could handle the school for the balance of the current academic year. On file 5-5-1 there is a letter dated April 14 to Miss Daly requesting her to proceed to Rama.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1944.\n\nMr. H.J. Featherston, Indian Agent, Longford Mills, Ont.\n\nAs agreed with Mr. Phelan when you met him in Toronto on April 11, the Department wishes you to inform Miss Franklin that her services are no longer required at the Rama School. Our reason for taking this action is that she is apparently unable to maintain discipline in the school. She will be allowed salary for the month of April. A cheque for this month will be forwarded on April 30.\n\nWe are communicating with Miss Daly, a qualified teacher at present in charge of the Caughnawaga United Church School, with a view to obtaining her services for the Rama School for the balance of the current academic year. If we are successful in this regard, Miss Daly will proceed to Rama at an early date. We will notify you as soon as we have definite information.\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter of April 14 reached me on Saturday night and I am replying at the earliest opportunity. I am preparing to leave for Rama Tues. night, April 18. I expect to arrive in Orillia about 12 o'clock noon on Wednesday. How does one get to Rama from there? Will there be anyone to meet me, or what shall I do about getting to the Reserve? I am sorry I can't leave any sooner, but, as you will understand, there were many arrangements to complete before I could leave my present place of employment.\n\nI have been having the Treasury Dept. send my cheques directly to my bank in Montreal. I think, if it could be arranged, I would like them to continue to do so. Would it be possible for you to make\nthis arrangement for me or shall I write to the Treasury Dept. myself?\n\nI thank you for the increase in salary which will help to defray my extra expenses.\n\nI hope to be able to do some good at the new school, though in the few weeks left it will be difficult to pull the children up in their work if they have neglected it all year. However, I shall do my best to remedy the situation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nViola M.

Consideration will be given later to an increase in this amount when the Department is assured of the success with which she meets in the work as senior teacher.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a junior teacher, it is considered that it would not be necessary to advertise and that you should consult the public school inspector with a view to having him recommend a fully qualified teacher. We would allow salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month to a junior teacher having at least a second class certificate. Please consult the public school inspector at once with a view to the securing of a suitable teacher for the junior room.

(RL 10, Volume 6155, File 421-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir;-\n\nIn view of the fact that a new school building is likely to be erected at the Rama reserve, I would beg to make a suggestion for the guidance of our architect when drawing up the plans of the new building.\n\nIt would be a decided advantage if provision were made for rooms for the teachers who are to have charge of the school. For this purpose I would suggest that two bedrooms, a living room and a lean-to kitchen be provided for the use of the teachers. Miss Mc Bain, who has the school at present has a walk of at least two miles twice a day in order to get to her school and home again. There is no possible place on the reserve where she could obtain suitable lodgings. It is possible that her family may even move to Orillia in the near future, which would make it necessary for her to live at Atherly which is about four miles from the reserve. This would necessitate her using the train twice a day, and trains are not always on time.\n\nI might say that this suggestion is my own and not occasioned by any complaint of Miss Mc Bain's. Miss Mc Bain seems to be a very capable teacher and one who takes a personal interest in her work among the Indian children at Rama. She deserves some encouragement in her work, which is rather discouraging under the present circumstances. I trust that my suggestion will be given consideration, believing that it is to the interest of the department's work.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nInspector\n\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 22, 1912.\n\nReferring to Mr. Parker's letter of the 19th instant in which he suggests the advisability of providing accommodation for the teacher of the Rama School in the new building which it is proposed to erect next spring I beg to say that I am well acquainted with the locality and heartily endorse Mr. Parker's suggestion. The nearest place where a white teacher could obtain suitable board is Atherley, which is about four miles from the school site. It will not be possible to secure teachers if there is this distance to walk. Miss McBain is able to live at her home, which is about two miles from the school, but to reach there she has to travel over a very bad piece of road. Should her family move to Orillia, as it is their intention to do, she would be forced to live in Atherley. I would recommend that this matter be dealt with when the plans are being prepared for the new school.\n\nMartin Benson\nExtract from report of R. H. Walks, Inspector, on the Rama Indian School, dated October 1st, 1912. Original on 152199/6.\n\nI hope you will decide to erect a new school. Let me suggest that you follow the suggestions offered in \"Plans for Rural School Buildings\", a book issued by the Ontario Department of Education. There should be two class-rooms, cap rooms, teacher's room, basement for furnace, etc., proper heating, ventilation and lighting. In the class rooms the windows should be massed on one side admitting the light at the pupils' left, and the lower edges of the windows should be 4' to 4\u00bd' from the floor. This arrangement of windows permits the placing of blackboards at the front and the two other walls of the room. Much blackboard is needed for the junior pupils. The board should be placed low enough to be used by the smaller pupils. Single desks are best for cleanliness and discipline.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nTo M'Nabb Bros. Oulina\n\nDATE.

A large piece of hard board, such as is occasionally used to replace plastered walls, was painted on one side with a high-grade wall paint, three coat work. A similar sheet was papered on one side with a clean, new wall paper.\n\nThese test panels were placed where unsanitary conditions, such as those found in the vicinity of air were present. After a short period of exposure the panels were taken to the bacteriological laboratory, and a small section of the painted surface, about two inches square, and a similar section of the paper surface of similar size, were removed and used for making cultures. In each case the surface of the section under test was washed with 100 c.c. of distilled water. The washings, which dripped from the surface, were collected in a graduated flask. One c.c. of the washings was added to bouillon, admixed with bouillon and again with agar agar. The enormous development of bacteria in the bullion, treated with the washings from the wall covered surface, was sufficient evidence of the unsanitary condition of the wall paint, the washings from which gave a culture practically free from bacteria. The colonies of bacteria shown in the photograph made of the washings from wall paper further support these findings. It may be stated that the tests made from the washings of the wall paint showed a practical absence of bacteria, and were clear, as was the bouillon solution test of paint. The washings from the wall paper showed rapid development of bacteria both in the bouillon and agar tests.\n\nFrom the Conservation Standpoint.\u2014It would be of interest to sum up in figures the acreage and cordage of wood that annually is transformed into pulp for the manufacture of wall papers. Unfortunately there are no available statistics on this subject. It is clear, however, that from the standpoint of conservation the use of wall paints should take precedence over the use of wall paper.\n\nMaple Leaf Flat Wall Colors\n\nare oil paints which can be thinned with turpentine.

Presented by Henry A. Gardner, Assistant Director of the Institute of Industrial Research.\n\nThe proper decoration of the interior of dwellings and public buildings has become of even greater importance than the protection and decoration of exteriors. There is, moreover, an increased demand for more efficient and the production of more sanitary conditions than have prevailed in the past. Up until a few years ago, a great variety of wall papers of more or less pleasing appearance were almost exclusively used for the decoration of walls in the interior of buildings, and their application was commonly considered the most effective means of wall decoration. There seems to be no question, however, that the use of wall paper is steadily decreasing, and that the art of interior decoration is undergoing a change due to the almost universal use of paints.\n\nModern practice demands the maintenance of sanitary conditions for the benefit of the public welfare, and there is no doubt that from the standpoint of sanitation and hygiene, properly painted wall surfaces are far superior to papered walls. There is an abundance of evidence which shows that disease can easily be prevented and thus disease transmitted from wall papers. In the tenement houses which are common to larger cities, and to a lesser extent in the dwellings found in the smaller communities, where tenants are more or less transient, the continued maintenance of sanitary conditions presents a difficult problem. Infectious and epidemic illnesses generally leave behind bacilli of different types, which may find a culture medium in the fibers of wall papers represented by wall paper, backed up as they invariably must be by glue, starch, and other organic pastes. Occasionally the restriction of local boards of health provide in such events for proper fumigation, but too often no precautions are taken to destroy the disease germs which are caught in the crevices of the wall paper. As a rule, both tenant and landlord are oblivious to all conditions which cannot be readily seen or detected. Burning out is one of the most effective means of fumigation, will generally extinguishing and consequently fading of the delicate colors used in painting the designs upon wall paper. Washing of the paper with antiseptic solutions will destroy its adhesiveness to the plaster and often cause bulging and peeling deterioration.\n\nHospital Practice.\u2014In hospitals, where it is necessary to maintain sanitary conditions, the walls are invariably painted, and requirements should demand the use of paints which can be washed frequently, so that there will be no possibility of uncleanness. Information of a prominent surgeon connected with one of the large metropolitan hospitals substantiated the writer's findings regarding the greater sanitary advantages of paint and brought forth the information that in hospitals under construction provision had been made for the finishing of the walls so that a hard non-absorbent and washable surface might be obtained. The same authority stated that the common practice, in apartments and tenements of covering the old wall paper over, with a layer of new, each time a tenant moved in, should be condemned, and that from a hygienic standpoint the use of paints instead of paper should be advocated in all dwellings as well as public buildings.\n\nIf such conditions are maintained in hospitals, where special attention is paid to sanitation, it would appear that similar precautions should be equally as necessary in public buildings and in dwellings\u2014wherever, in fact, people congregate to live.\n\nDr. F. F. Geyer, Cornell University Medical College, New York City.\n\nSanitary Wall Paints.\u2014Cold water paints or kalsomines should not be used, as they often contain glue, casein, dextrine and other binders which are easily destroyed. Oil paints which are thinned with turpentine and other volatile spirits, are the only real sanitary paints to use. These have recently appeared in trade a number of wall paints composed of non-porous substances prepared in paints having valuable water-proofing and binding properties, and of a nature to produce the flat or semi-flat finish that has become so popular. Such paints produce a sanitary, water-proof surface which is free of dust and dirt. By their use it is possible to secure a more permanent and wider range of tints than can be obtained with wall paper, as they are produced in a myriad of shades, tints and solid colors; from which any color combination can be selected. On the border or on the body of walls decorated with such paints, attractive stencil designs, which bring out in relief the color combinations, may be applied.\n\nFor the decoration of chambers and living rooms, dull whites, light gray, light and cream tints, and ivory whites may be used, while in the library and other rooms richer and more solid colors, such as greens, reds and blues, may be harmoniously combined.\n\nDefects of Wall Paper.\u2014It recently occurred to the writer to investigate conditions which obtain in many apartment houses in the larger cities. Inspection of a number of such places, in which wall paper had been exclusively used on the walls showed generally bad conditions; bulging of the surfaces caused by dampness in the walls, which had loosened up the binder, the wall paper peeling off, and pieces of the paper from the ceilings, were frequently observed. In many cases a shabby appearance was shown, accompanied by an odor which suggested decomposition of the binder used on the paper. The writer was impressed with the fact that such conditions could easily be avoided by the very simple expedient of using properly manufactured wall paints, which are water-proof and washable.\n\nSamples of wall paper, which had been applied to plastered walls for a year or more, were obtained and examination under the microscope showed a most uncleanly surface. Cultures were made of these samples, and bacilli of\nWHY?\n\nCan you answer this question\u2014\"Why did you buy M. L. Paints rather than Somebody-else's?\"\n\nOur answer is simply this:\n\nM. L. Paint covers more surface to the gallon, costs less money per square foot of surface covered; and lasts longer and looks better than any other paint there is.\n\nThat is true of M. L. Paint because we not only use the best materials in the market of the paint-world sell\u2014the unsurpassed quality of White Lead and the quality of Oxide of Zinc; the best quality of coloring pigments, made by ourselves from the raw materials, and so much more of the finest Pure Raw Linseed Oil; but we put these together by processes improved beyond the knowledge of most paint makers, and with machinery not excelled anywhere.\n\nAnd to these ingredients, selected with the greatest care for quality, we add\u2014in the case of all our indoor and outdoor paints\u2014a special ingredient peculiar to the M. L. Brand.\n\nThis ingredient is the outcome of years of ceaseless study and experiment, expended freely with the purpose of improving M. L. Paints to the last degree of excellence. That study and experiment has been at our own expense, and not at the buyer's; and it has produced at last a uniform and unvarying quality in M. L. Paints which insures the buyer of these paints against the many paint-troubles he must suffer with other kinds.\n\nWith the addition of this ingredient, thoroughly incorporated with the other M. L. materials by special mechanical processes, any surface covered with our indoor and outdoor paints will resist the elements longer and preserve its fresh, new appearance better, than is otherwise possible.\n\nDurability is the last thing to consider in buying paints\u2014for the real measure of paint value depends upon the length of time that paint will endure. As the chief cost of painting is the labor involved, and not the price of the paint itself, it must be clear that any paint which\u2014like the M. L. Brand\u2014will last three years to another brand's two, is at least one-third cheaper in the long run.\n\nHints About Painting\n\nIf you use M. L. Paints and obey the directions here given, you cannot fail to get a painting job that will be thoroughly and lastingly satisfactory to you. And, moreover, you will get full value for what you spend in money or in labor, or both.\n\nPreferably, employ a practical painter to do any considerable painting. He knows more than you would learn unless you spend as much time learning as he has spent. His charges will be reasonable enough; and the job will be far better done than you could do it, at best. But, if for any reason you cannot hire a painter, these hints will help.\n\nStir the contents of M. L. cans thoroughly, and from bottom to top. Stir a good deal longer and harder than you think is necessary. Then pour the paint, after stirring, from one can to another at least eight times. Twelve times is better.\n\nBefore applying the heavy paint, use a good priming paint. You can't find a better kind than M. L. Primers. Never use an Ochre Primer. If you do, the after coats will crack, flake or blister,\u2014bound to do so.\n\nNever spread paint on a damp surface, nor on a frost-coated surface.\n\nNever spread paint on a greasy, sooty or smoked surface.\n\nDon't try to paint green lumber, nor lumber full of pitch.\n\nNever put a coat of paint on top of another coat which is not dry.\n\nAlways put the paint on thick and spread it out thin\u2014brush it in thoroughly,\u2014brush it in and brush it in again. This is the \"knack\" of the practical painter; and it is a knack well worth what he charges to use it.\n\nDon't thin M. L. Paint with anything but raw linseed oil\u2014and then only if it is pure, high grade oil, like that that is in M. L. Paint when you get it.\n\nUse\u2014one or all new work, at least\u2014a priming coat and two coats of paint. It pays far better in the long run than the two coats alone.\n\nMAPLE LEAF PAINT\n\nFOR INTERIOR FOR EXTERIOR\n\nTHE IMPERIAL VARNISH AND COLOR CO. LIMITED TORONTO CANADA WINNIPEG VANCOUVER\nFor Amateur Painters\n\nPaint, applied to any surface actually covers that surface with a coat of mail, metallic oxides, in technical parlance. This plating, or armor, protects the surface from the mechanical actions\u2014corrosion, or \"oxidation\"\u2014of the air, exposure and from the mechanical action (in the case of paint surfaces exposed to the weather) of the elements,\u2014rain, snow, chemical action, the attrition of dust, etc.\n\nEvery layer of this plating that is put on any surface\u2014every \"coat of paint,\" that is,\u2014of course increases the thickness of that armor.\n\nThis is the reason why a priming coat and even two coats of paint will always outlast two thick coats without any priming beneath,\u2014something it is usually hard to make the amateur painter understand. The oil in the priming fills the pores of the surface covered, and thus economizes the thin surface coats; and it leaves a thin film of metallic oxides on the surface which provides a good foundation for the thicker films that are on top of it.\n\nNow, the amount of resistance paint can offer to the destructive forces named depends upon what that paint is made of, how it is mixed, and how it is applied. The maker must answer for the first two factors, the user for the other one. If you do your own painting, you can safely answer for it if you follow the H. H. A. P. Painting principles another part of this booklet\u2014and do not endeavor to improve them.\n\nChoose M. L. Paint not because it looks alright. Any paint looks alright.\n\nChoose M. L. Paint not because its price compares with other brands. Any half-way decent paint costs about the same as M. L. Brand.\n\nChoose M. L. Paint not because of its covering power of 4.0 square feet, two coats, to the gallon. Some paints claim to cover more surface,\u2014but how long will the covering last?\n\nChoose M. L. Paint because it will do all any other paint does in beautifying; and fully a third more in protecting.\n\nHOW MUCH PAINT WILL IT TAKE?\n\nFor outside house-painting, to find the quantity of M. L. Paint needed for two coats over a priming coat\u2014Multiply the average height of the outer walls, from ground to cornice, in feet, by the distance around the building in feet. Divide the total number so obtained by 120, the number of square feet required to cover two coats.\n\nFor inside work: One quart of M. L. Paint is full finish, with two coats, both sides of any ordinary door, the frames of two windows, and all the rest of the woodwork of a well-sized room.\n\nFor floors: One quart of M. L. Special Floor Paint will put two coats on a floor 12x16 ft., or about 200 square ft. of area.\n\nFlaglaze, the ideal floor finish, will surface 500 square feet to the gallon with a brilliant, washable and wear-proof surface.\n\nColors marked thus (*) are Higher in Price.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have been recently advised in regard to your preparation of plans for the erection of a new School house at Ottawa, Ont. and request the privilege of bringing to your attention MAPLE LEAF PAINTS AND VARNISHES for the painting and finishing of this property.\n\nMAPLE LEAF PAINTS and VARNISHES are high grade finishes made of materials designed to give the best of service, not only in the way covering, but in preserving property and conserving its value for maximum length of time.\n\nThere is in your finishing and painting a real saving in time, labor, and the value of your property, if you use good high grade paints and varnishes - materials of quality such as the MAPLE LEAF BRAND - a quality that gives satisfactory service.\n\nIf you are not directly interested would you kindly place us in touch with your architect, contractor or painter to whom we might go in regard to this matter?\n\nFor your convenience we are enclosing a post card and would be glad to take this question up with you at your request, or with any other person to whom you have entrusted this work.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nTHE IMPERIAL VARNISH & COLOR COMPANY\n\nMAPLE LEAF PAINTS AND VARNISHES MAKE GOOD BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE GOOD.\n\nTHEY WEAR ON THE JOB, NOT OFF.\n| Times | Lines | Words | Total | Dollars | Cents |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|---------|-------|\n|       |      |       |       |         |       |\n\nIndian Affairs.

English.\nSunderland, July 14th, 1913.\n\nMr. McLain,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of letter 1521995 and the copies of plans and specifications sent to me under separate covers at the same time namely July 10th.\n\nWhen notified I shall be prepared to give attention to work to which I have been appointed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMoses Chambers\nSunderland.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSecretary -\n\nIt is represented that the Inspector of the work during the erection of the combined school-house and teacher's residence on the Rama Indian Reserve cannot properly inspect the foundation without being on the work every day to see that the proper proportion of cement is put in when the cement is mixed, but that when the foundation is completed, weekly visits will suffice. This appears to be reasonable, and unless there is some objection to it, may be acted upon favourably.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nIn reply to your letter of July 15th No. 1529995 re sinking of well for Kamal School we beg leave to quote the following price for digging & curving same as follows: We will dig a well approx. 4 ft. square & put in good plank curving down between 4 & 5 ft. deep - this is all the curving that is necessary as the ground is very soft stone & hard & gets harder as you go down hence the unnecessary pains & work of cribbing. We will put in a 2 ft. 6 in. to 3 ft. heavy tile in bottom of well when we reach water. We will furnish a first-class iron pump & the above mentioned tile for bottom of well for the sum of twenty-five dollars. We will do the digging for $8.00 three dollars a lin. ft. & our bird for five dollars $5.00 hoping this will be satisfactory & to hear from you at once.\n\nWe remain your truly,\n\nJ. & Kink & Son\n\nP.S.

They desire to use one inch as they claim that maple is not sawn in the one and a half thickness. Kindly advise me at once in the matter as the contractors are waiting for permission.\nto make the change,\n\nYours truly\n\nMoses Chambers\nInspector\nOttawa, September 16, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant in reference to the substitution of inch maple flooring instead of one and half at the Rama School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if it is not possible for the contractors to obtain inch and a half flooring inch flooring may be substituted, although it is not nearly so satisfactory, and a corresponding deduction must be made from the contract price. Inch and a half flooring is obtained in other places and the Department does not see any reason why it should not be obtained at Rama. Kindly advise what reduction will be allowed in the contract for this change.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

She asked me to write you and say if you would change the point mentioned for wainscoting to burlap. Now Mr. Benson it makes no difference to us which we put on as the burlap will cost almost as much now at the Vpoint as there are some changes we would have to make to be able to substitute burlap for the wainscoting. So should you decide to change it to burlap, would suggest you notify us at once! We either case as we shall about starting plastering and we would have to make a few changes till the plastering is done.\n\nI would suggest (if it may be allowed to do so.)

J. Link & Son, the contractors for the new school, amounting to $1285.00. Mr. Parker could settle the outstanding claims against Link and Son and pay the balance over to them and obtain their receipt for the money. Mr. Chambers, the inspector for the building, reported that one of the blackboards was broken and would be replaced and that the ground had not been levelled off to his satisfaction. Mr. Parker could retain enough from the contractors to cover the cost of levelling the ground and replacing the broken blackboard, if this has not already been done.\n\nOttawa, January 13, 1914.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to let you know that the Rama Shool on the reserve is in need of wood.

It is considerably more. He\nsuffered a severe injury to the head in his fall from the top of the\nbuilding to the basement and for several weeks his brain was in a con-\nfused state, so that it was impossible for him to give us a detailed\nstatement. He is now recovering it and it will go forward in a few\ndays.

J. Link & Son, I beg to report as follows.\n\nA meeting of the contractor and his creditors was held on Thursday evening, 22d inst. Those present were Mr. Link, contractor, and Messrs Gardner, Glenister and Pomeroy, creditors.\n\nThe account of S. Pomeroy for building material lumber etc. was accepted by Mr. Link at $318.81. An account of gardiner's for extra work amounting to $4.25 was also accepted. The accounts of Gardiner and Glenister for brickwork and of Gardiner for plastering were next taken up and considerable difficulty was met with in arranging a settlement.\n\nIt appears that the creditors had tendered on the work at the rate of $6.50 per M brick but had been under the impression that there would be 30,000 brick to lay. The kiln count of brick supplied to J. J. Link was 23,200 of which 935 brick were returned after the work was finished. It was finally agreed that the creditors would accept the payment for 23,000 brick and that Mr. Link would pay at the rate of $7.00 per M. This amounted to $161.00 and $5.00 for hauling scaffolding, making in all, $166.00 for the brickwork, $100.00 of which had already been paid.\n\nIn the account of Geo. Gardiner for plastering it will be seen by the tender that the price was 11\u00a2 per sq. yd. Mr. Gardiner wanted this changed to 12\u00a2.\n\nIn.\nIn view of their written tender and the decided objection of the contractor to make any change it was agreed to hold to the price of 11\u00a2. Mr Gardiner had also been under the impression that he had done 1000 sq. yds. of plastering and had asked an independent party to go to Rama and measure the work. The report of the man who measured the work is attached and shows 899 and 2/3 sq. yds. This amounted to $98.97 and was settled at $99.\n\nThese were the only accounts brought before me and payment was made the following day in accordance with the above arrangement. I attach receipt in full for $1265.00 from J. J. Link and Son. The keys were handed to me with the exception of one which was at Rama and for which I took an order from Mr. Link. The keys which I received I handed to Miss McBain, our teacher at Rama. Miss McBain informed me that school would open on the 24th.\n\nWith regard to the broken blackboard and levelling of ground around the school I beg to say that the blackboard has been replaced. So far as I could see the contractor had levelled the ground quite well. As it will be necessary to do considerable grading around the school grounds in the spring it seemed to me that nothing further could be done by the contractor and in any case he had levelled all the he was responsible for, i.e., the earth thrown out from the excavation. In this connection I might say that, from what I could learn from the teacher agent and others of the nature of the soil, it will be necessary to put a top on of gravel and sand in order to protect the floors. The soil is of a clay formation and very sticky.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is no other that costs so much to manufacture, the extra expenses being largely upon economy devices, which will commend themselves to everyone with any knowledge of heating.

Malcolm Lefevre\nDear sir in reply to your letter of the 16th inst,\nI wish to say that I am ready to the dwelling of the\nground at Rama School that you have been mis-\ninformed by the inspector as we levelled the ground\naccording to specifications and I can produce as\nmany witnesses as you want to prove that it has\nbeen done and done right.\n\nThe teacher Mr. McLean can tell you whether\nwe levelled it off or not also Mr. Tom McLeafl\nof 220 St. John St. Orillia as he is the man\nwho done the job and I can produce witness that\nwill prove my statement.\n\nNow Mr. McLean I will tell you why Mr.\nChambers has told you that and remember I\ncan prove every statement I make. He was\nangry at me simply because there was a few\nblinks in the dwelling after it was done and\nevery time he come around the job nearly over\nthere would be so trouble and every time he\ncome on the job under the influence of liquor\nhe would start to make trouble about these\nfew bumps which when the spring come will\ndirection as the land is heavy sticky clay and when wet is very lumpy also and I presume by the way Chambers used to talk he thought we ought to powder all the lumps and make a garden of the whole lot which as you are aware was not in our contract so now Mr. Leam I hope you will understand me when I say that we done the job according to specifications as we did and as regards the inspector who was overseeing the job of the Ramna school building he was no mechanic and did not apparently know anything about a building as others would ask him for information his answer invariably would be (well I don't know but the best way you can) how do you call that fair to a contractor to ask him to work under men of that caliber who admitted to me himself that he was a farmer and not a builder and then we are supposed to abide by his decision which we refuse to do so now Mr. Leam I hope you will rectify this at once and if Mr. Chambers wish to take his oath that the dwelling is not done I'll have him sworn and proved to be a pervert also before he is much older an then thing is only done\napparently through spite as if I was talking to you personally I could tell you some plain facts about your Inspector that would do him justice but not much good.\n\nhoping to have this adjusted at once as we don't want any trouble but we like to get what is our own.

You may perhaps understand that we make a specialty of heating and do no other business whatever, whereas in the case of the Gurney Company it is only a fraction of their business so that they content themselves with making furnaces of a size to be used in an everyday building, whereas we manufacture them sufficiently large to heat twelve-roomed school house or larger if more than one furnace be used.\nPEASE FOUNDRY COMPANY.\n\n- 2 -\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs:\n\nHoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience, we are\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nDJM/K.\n\nPEASE FOUNDRY CO LTD.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident,\nOttawa, March 5, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 22nd ultimo wherein you express surprise that this Department refuses to accept as satisfactory a furnace installed in the Rama School near Atherley, Ont., and to say in reply that, as you are fully aware, a Gurney furnace had been specified for the work at this point. The Contractor was asked to give an estimate for a different pattern of furnace by the same manufacturer, and was instructed that this furnace only, could be considered.\n\nWe are fully aware of the value of your hot air furnaces and place them as the equal of any of this class of heating apparatus manufactured. Notwithstanding this, we cannot allow the substitution of one make for another specified and tendered or, or allow any unauthorized change of contract, and as a business man you will readily admit that it would make no difference whether you would make your own and pay the account very decided objection to any substitution in the matter, and feel aggrieved, and with justice, for the wrong done you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The backbone of any country is largely dependent on the Health and Brain Energy of the Children.\n\nOur secondary aim is to show how and why this object can be attained more easily and more economically by the PEASE PATENTED SYSTEM of STEAM HEATING and VENTILATING than by any other means.\nAs to Ventilation.\n\nYou may have often heard the remark outside the Church door, \"Wasn't the sermon rather dull to-day?\" and perhaps you have assented. \"Dearly Beloved Brethren,\" examine yourselves and the church ventilation and see whether it was not your own brain that was \"dull,\" intoxicated by that most common of gaseous poisons known to science as \"carbon dioxide\" which is simply common air with its oxygen burnt out and replaced by particles of carbon.\n\nTry a Simple Experiment.\n\nTake a small piece of candle, less than an inch will do\u2014light it and set it on a plate. Note how well it burns. Now invert a common tumbler over it. It still burns brightly for a few seconds, then pales\u2014flickers\u2014dies\u2014not for the want of wick or wax, but for lack of oxygen. Now light again; cover again; let the flame sicken again; but before it dies remove the glass. See how quickly it lives again. It has good air instead or air vitiated by \"carbon dioxide.\"\n\nA Human Candle\n\nEvery pair of lungs is a human candle, but of many \"candle power.\" The pure air goes into the lungs as into the candle flame. There the oxygen is consumed with the waste elements of the human body which had been absorbed by the blood, and which consist, like the wick and wax of the candle, chiefly of carbon. If a constant supply of pure fresh air is not supplied, the human body would be like the candle under the tumbler\u2014weaken and gradually die.\n\nThe average adult inhales about 25 cubic feet of air per minute when at rest\u2014much more when active\u2014and exhales\nabout 6 cubic feet of carbon dioxide per hour, thus exhausting the vitality of at least 1500 cubic feet of air.\n\nIf more fresh air is not supplied, this leads to that form of smothering which the doctors call \"asphyxiation\"\u2014witness the \"Black Hole\" of Calcutta and the horrors of prisons a hundred years ago. If only partially replaced, it leads to a form of blood poisoning which dulls the intellect and energies and blocks the avenue from the preacher or teacher to the \"hearing ear and the understanding heart\" of the listener.\n\nNow if this is true\u2014and it is\u2014why don't half the people die when they go to Church or theatres or political meetings?\n\nBecause the meeting place is (like the tumbler covering the candle) full of fresh air when the people enter.\n\nBecause every time the door opens (that's where the man who comes in late is useful) it lets in just so much more air.\n\nBecause the windows are seldom tight and often open.\n\nBecause a healthy man may take a moderate dose of carbon dioxide\u2014just as of whisky or other poison\u2014without knowing what hurts him.\n\nBecause all modern churches, schools and other places of assembly possess some means of ventilation, even if crude and insufficient. That is why our forbears didn't all die before we were born.\n\nLessons Danger of Infection.\n\nBut there is another danger in lack of ventilation. The doctors tell us that nearly every human being, even the most healthy, carries in his mouth, throat, air passages and lungs, the germs of many diseases all alive and ready to work whenever they find inflamed or weak tissues to work on.\n\nThese germs (the Doctors call them \"bugs\") are more or less drawn in or thrown out with every breath.\n\nThe result is, in a crowded place of meeting, that there is a friendly interchange of microbes between you and your neighbors. You may have more diptheria germs than you\nknow what to do with; your neighbor may have a surplus of pneumonia seeds and another has a colony of measles or whooping cough embryos looking for situations. You exchange and carry your new roomers home, when if you can't feed them properly some of your family may perhaps be more hospitable.\n\nHow Ventilation Prevents Disease.\n\nComparisons have been carried out between schools well ventilated by mechanical means, and schools ventilated at haphazard or with no ventilation at all, which show that the average number of disease germs was only 17 per litre (or about 482 per cubic foot) in a well ventilated school, whereas in ordinary schools there were 152 disease germs per litre (or about 4307 per cubic foot).\n\nNow, how will ventilation help this? Because by a kind provision of nature\u2014carbon dioxide\u201d\u2014the breath exhaled\u2014is heavy from air and falls to the floor by slow degrees, taking with it most of the disease germs which are carried out of the body with it.\n\nIn all good systems of ventilation the foul air is carried away through gratings in or near the floor and thus the poisoned gases and disease germs are carried quickly below the nose or intake point of the breath.\n\nAs all good systems do this we claim no special advantage in this regard.\n\nBut foul air won't go out unless other air is brought in to replace it. If it did we'd be worse off than ever, for no air is worse than foul air.\n\nTherefore all modern heating systems for schools, etc., take in fresh air from the outside, warm it, and draw off the foul and exhausted air from the rooms, either by pressure or suction.\n\nSuction produces a vacuum (usually by means of a fan) drawing off the lower stratum of air and facilitating the entrance of pure, warm air higher up.\n\nBut the disadvantage of the suction system is that it draws the cold air into the rooms through every crack and crevice in windows, walls, and doors, thereby causing drafts.\nPressure Systems Safest.\n\nUnder the pressure or \"plenum\" system the fresh warm air enters the rooms about midway to the ceiling, thus forcing the cold air out at the exhaust ducts near the floor.\n\nUnder a well planned \"gravity\" system the warm air enters the room at a velocity of 100 to 300 feet per minute; that is with quite sufficient force to squeeze the lower cold air \"down and out.\"\n\nBut the most reliable system, especially in large buildings, is to force the warm air into the room by a fan or \"blower\" driven by electric or gas power at a velocity of from 200 to 400 feet per minute.\n\nIn either case the air pressure (except against a very strong wind) is from within to without so that there is little chance of drafts.\n\nOf course, under any good pressure system the windows should be kept closed tight, as all the fresh air necessary is admitted through the fresh air flues. It is sometimes difficult to get school and church caretakers to understand this.\n\nResponsibility of Modern Science.\n\nWith higher knowledge runs hand in hand greater responsibility. What our grandfathers did and were blameless for we may not do without adopting the philosophy of the man who thought he was not his \"brother's keeper.\"\n\nIf there is anything well established by modern science and understood by men of intelligence, it is the vital necessity of abundant fresh air supply in churches, schools and other places where people \"most do congregate.\"\n\nLet those in control of such places think well how they can best do their duty to the human lives dependent on their care.\n\nPease System Patented.\n\nSo far we have claimed nothing for our own patented system.\n\nAny good boiler with proper installation will heat and ventilate a building as well as ours\u2014but at a much higher cost.\nNote the name we give our Steam Heater and Ventilator\u2014\u201cECONOMY.\u201d\n\nIn the case of most steam boilers a large percentage of the incandescent gases go up the chimney flue, carrying \u201cDOLLARS\u201d with them. Every boiler must have \u201cmoney to burn\u201d in the shape of good fuel, but most of them don\u2019t burn, that is completely consume, half the \u201cdollars\u201d fed into them.\n\nIn an ordinary tubular boiler the gases caused by the combustion of the coal travel from the fire box underneath the boiler to the back\u2014then through the tubes of the boiler to the front and up the chimney which is located at the front\u2014consequently a lot of unspent heat goes up the chimney and is wasted.\n\nWith the Pease System these gases make the same double journey as in others, producing the same steam, but we make them do a third passage, viz., from the front to the back again through wide radiating wings running along each side of the boiler from eight to sixteen feet in length and from thirty to forty-two inches in depth and then up the chimney which is located at the back of the Pease boiler.\n\nThe gases at the entrance of these radiating wings are of a temperature from 100\u00b0 to 200\u00b0 higher than at their exit by the smoke pipe.\n\nThis heat is used to warm the fresh air, which is forced under the boiler and up between the fire-box and the radiators on the inside and between the radiators and the brick casing on the outside, through the warm air ducts into the school rooms, etc.\n\nAll this heat (and money) wasted in other systems is saved only by the Pease Patented Steam Heater and Ventilator.\n\nHow Much Saving?\n\nFrom all this it is plain that there is a saving in our system, but Church and School and Hospital Boards and owners of large halls, theatres, stores, factories, etc., will want to know \u201cHow Much?\u201d\n\nOur apparatus has been long enough on the market to enable us to give reliable and somewhat extensive statistics,\n**PEASE

year the figures in red are first shown.\n\nIn the case of St. George, Lorne Ave. and Wortley Road schools you will notice four rooms were added at the time the Pease system was installed.\n\nNotwithstanding this large increase in number of rooms, in the case of two schools the total cost of heating was materially reduced.\n\nSteam Lump used in the Pease plants cost from

in almost every case the Pease system superseded some other. The general average is higher than in London because as a rule the fuel cost per ton is higher, the exposure is greater, the caretakers receive lower salaries and devote their time less fully to the heating.\n\nToronto has not installed a sufficient number of our Steam Heaters and Ventilators to make a fair comparison, and where they are installed we have had to accept the \"layout\" of some antiquated system.\n\nWe may however mention that from the printed report of the superintendent of Buildings of Toronto Board of Education for 1910, page 88, it appears that the average cost per room of heating:\n\nAnnette St. School (12 rooms)\nCost per room with PEASE (Steam) Systems $21.60\nAverage of all Steam Heated Schools\nCost per room - - - - 43.86\nSaving per room by PEASE System - - - - 22.25\nThis may be owing partly to the superior skill and care of the Annette St. janitor but in a large measure, we think, to the more scientific construction of the PEASE APPARATUS.\n\nWe hope we have said enough to convince those interested that even if our system may not do its work any better than others (though we think it does) it certainly is more economical by almost 50 per cent. in London (the only City which has given it a thorough comparative test) and we believe by quite 30 per cent. in smaller towns.\n\nFurther evidence may be found in extracts from letters received by us and appended.\n**Public School, Lacombe, Alta.**\nHeated and ventilated by PEASE SYSTEM.\n\n**Alexandra School, Moose Jaw, Sask.**\nHeated and ventilated by PEASE SYSTEM.\n\n---\n\n### Partial List of Installations of Pease Economy Steam Heaters and Ventilators in Ontario.\n\n| Location                  | Quantity |\n|---------------------------|----------|\n| Sault Ste.

Since carrying out this test I feel confident for the Red Deer School and the High School for this City.\n\nFrom Secretary, Public School Board, Carlyle, Sask.\n\nThe Economy Steam Heater and Ventilator installed in our school is giving perfect satisfaction and is the most perfect heater and ventilator for public school buildings on the market today.\n\nFrom Secretary-Treasurer, Board of Education, Davidson, Sask.\n\nYour system has given perfect satisfaction. During cold snap in January, the thermometer registered from 40 to 60 degrees below. During this period the temperature in the rooms varied between 65 and 70 degrees during the school hours. The heating in all rooms is satisfactory no matter what the outside temperature might be. The ventilation is perfect. System installed has been in our school since 1907. Davidson School has four rooms and a teachers' room.\n\nFrom Chairman, Public School Board, Humboldt, Sask.\n\nHeating is generally satisfactory when outside temperature registers 20 degrees below. Ventilation is satisfactory. Fuel consumption is satisfactory.\n\nFrom Secretary, Public School Board, Red Deer, Alta.\n\nThe system installed by your Company has been very satisfactory. The lowest temperature was 36 degrees below zero. The Thermometer varied from 69 to 74 degrees in the different class rooms when the school opened at 9:30. No complaints about the ventilation.\n\nPage Twenty-three\nPEASE FOUNDRY COMPANY\n\nFrom Chairman,\nBoard of Education,\nWoodstock, Ont.\n\nPease Foundry Co., Limited,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nWith reference to the heating and ventilating systems installed in our new six and eight roomed school buildings by Mr. E. S. Coppins, Local Heating Contractor.\n\nThese systems have been given a thorough trial during last winter and we have also had an Architect make very exhaustive tests. It has been found that uniformed temperature can be attained at all times in all parts of building, also that the air can be changed in each separate class rooms at least three times per hour while the apparatus is being operated on ordinary systems, or between five and six times per hour when operated with the steel plate blowers and electric motors running. Although we are not in a position to furnish accurate data as to fuel cost per class room for a year's work, we have been demonstrated at work with the Pease Heaters and Ventilators, the fuel cost per class room is much lower than with other systems we have operated in past years. There is no question but that with the Pease apparatus it is possible to heat and properly ventilate a school building better and at a lower cost than with any other system that has been brought to our attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n(Signed) G. WHITELAW,\nChairman Board of Education.\n\nFrom Secretary,\nSchool Board,\nKemptville, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe the Pease Steam Heating systems installed in our High and Public Schools, would you think me giving the best of satisfaction in every respect? I cannot say anything in any way against them. They are the most economical, easily managed systems I know of.\n\nThis system saves in fuel over the other systems, and the fuel and buildings are better heated and ventilated and if the board were going to try another heating system it would be the Pease. What I have said is the voice of every member of the Board.\n\nHaving watched these systems closely for three years as it comes under my duties on the Board I can recommend them and know you will make no mistake in adopting it. All the Pease Company claim for them is nothing more than they will do.\n\nYours truly,\n(Signed) W. S. JOHNSON.\n\nP.S.

The prominent feature of the system is the thorough ventilation. There are no complaints of headache and that languid feeling so often experienced in schools.\n\nFrom Principal, High School, Barrie, Ont.\n\nHeating and ventilating system that you put in last Fall in the Barrie Collegiate Institute has proved satisfactory in every respect. For the first time in my experience in school teaching, I have been working in a building comfortably warm and at the same time delightfully sweet. No parched air, no draughts, no foul air. Moreover your steam heater is very easily managed and very economical.\n\nFrom Chairman, Public School, Weston, Ont.\n\nOur school Board installed a Pease Heating and Ventilating system (steam) and it is entirely satisfactory both as to heat and ventilation. Fuel account almost half what the old hot air system was. Have tried hot water but find steam more satisfactory.\n\nFrom Chairman, Public School, Picton, Ont.\n\nCost for fuel has been $25.00 per room for a full school term. Saving over the old system has been $700 for the two years. Our teachers are well pleased and that alone warrants us in speaking in the highest praise of your system.\n\nFrom Chair. and Sec., Public School, East Toronto, Ont.\n\nWe have experienced no difficulty in maintaining an even temperature at all times. The ventilation is also exceptionally good, netting a change of air in building of from three to five times per hour. The Pease Heater and Ventilator is certainly adapted for use in buildings where it is necessary to heat and ventilate at small fuel cost.\nFrom Secretary, Board of Education, London, Ont.\n\nThe heating and ventilating has been perfect so the Principal and teachers report while the cost has been about $21.00 per room for fuel. I can certainly say the system put in by the Pease Company is the most satisfactory in the schools.\n\nFrom Caretaker, High School, Walkerton, Ont.\n\nThe furnaces you placed in High School, Walkerton are giving every satisfaction.\n\nFrom Chairman, School Board, London, Ont.\n\nRe Pease system of heating and ventilating which the Board has adopted for several of the schools. Four years ago the Board built an addition of four rooms to what is called St. George School making it a sixteen room building and put in the system referred to for heating the new addition and four rooms of the old part. So satisfactory was the experience that the year following the whole school was heated by the Pease system, an additional boiler being put in. The following year the new Lorne Ave. School was built, a fourteen room school, and the system installed there. The Chesley Ave. School ten rooms was heated by hard coal furnaces, these were taken out and the Pease system put in. The saving in fuel which is quite an item, will in a very short time more than cover any additional cost that has been incurred in putting in the new plant. System easily managed and the heating and ventilating is as perfect as anything of the kind could possibly be.\n\nFrom Secretary, Public School Board, Hallospurp, Ont.\n\nThe Pease system has been most satisfactory this winter although the weather has been intensely cold, at times 35 degrees below zero.\n\nFrom Secretary, Board of Education, Barrie.\n\nMore satisfactory than other systems, especially as to ventilation and reduction in cost of fuel, with better results.\n\nFrom Secretary, High School Board, Lucan.\n\nVery much more satisfactory than other systems.\n\nFrom Secretary, Board of Education, Grimsby.\n\nYour heating system has worked entirely satisfactorily all through the extremely cold weather of the past six weeks and the Board consider it all it was recommended to be.\nPease \"Economy\" Furnaces\n\"700 Series\"\n\nPEASE FOUNDRY COMPANY\nLIMITED\nTORONTO\nPease Economy Furnaces\n\n\"700 Series\"\n\nPEASE FOUNDRY COMPANY LIMITED\n\nHead Office: Toronto Works: Brampton\n\nBranches:\nWinnipeg Vancouver Hamilton\nReputation\n\nWith an unblemished reputation of over thirty-six years in the manufacture of heating systems and producing the best Furnace in every way, we have not the slightest hesitation in recommending this booklet to your careful consideration, knowing that every time you install a \"PEASE\" Heating System you not only make a friend of your customer, but put out a big advertisement for your business.\n\nLet us help you with your heating problems if you have any trouble or difficulty whatever.

The construction of the \u201cEconomy\u201d Furnace is simplicity itself. Life long durability is practically secured by the extra heavy fire pot and other important castings, copper bearing steel radiator, and heavy boiler plate dome.\n\nDust Proof. The expansions on all parts subject to expansion from heat, guarantee absolute gas and dust-tight connections.\n\nCopper Bearing Steel. The Heat Radiator which has been a well-known and economical feature of the Pease \u201cEconomy\u201d Furnace for years is still retained, but the sides, which have to be of steel, in order to give the greatest radiation power possible, are now made of a special grade of copper bearing steel, which, as its name implies, contains a certain percentage of copper. This enables it to resist most successfully the corrosive action of the gases contained in the smoke. Tests made of this copper bearing steel during the past four years have conclusively shown that it resists the corrosive action of acid gases for from two to three times as long as the best of the ordinary steels used in furnace construction. While this copper bearing steel costs us considerably more than even the high grade material which we have heretofore used, we have convinced ourselves by expensive tests that it will give more lasting service than any other steel we could use.\n\nLarge Clean-out Doors. These are a wonderful improvement and convenience and are situated one on each side of the feed door\u2014thus enabling one to clean out the furnace in a few minutes at any time and without any trouble, by simply opening the doors and inserting the brush, no matter whether the fire is going or not.\n\nDomestic Water Heater. As so many people now like to have their Domestic water tank connected to the furnace instead of the kitchen range\u2014we have made provision for this in the Pease \u201c700 Series\u201d, so that at any time the connection can be made without taking down the furnace or drilling any holes. On the left hand side of the feed door, space is provided, with two holes, properly capped, in the casting for the flow and return pipes; this is one great advantage of a Pease \u201cEconomy\u201d \u201c700 Series\u201d Furnace.\n\nFirepot. Note the illustration of two firepots, (on Page 18) No. 1 shows the ordinary shape of Firepot as used in most furnaces. Although the fire is shaken in this pot, only the centre is fully cleared of the ashes. The sides of the firepot still remain clogged and coated with ashes, which, becoming wedged in, have no means of escape.\n\nThis coating of ashes on the sides of the firepot renders it impossible for it to give out the full amount of heat. Therefore, it is not efficient as heating surface.\n\nSectional view of Furnace through the center, from front to back. Note all the points specially marked.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RL 10, Volume 6155, File 421-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nPease \"Economy\" Furnaces\u2014\u201c700 Series\u201d\n\nCut No. 2 shows the Pease Economy \u201c700 Series\u201d firepot absolutely straight on the inside from the centre down while the upper part tapers slightly inwards from the centre upwards.\n\nIn this way the heat rays from the burning coal strike directly on the overhanging surfaces which gather and distribute every unit of heat possible; none is lost.\n\nThis firepot cleans itself easily and completely every time the grates are shaken and as there is no waste of heat, it is nearly 50% more efficient.\n\nThe Pease \u201cEconomy\u201d 700 Series firepot is on the same principle that has been so satisfactory and successful in all Pease \u201cEconomy\u201d Furnaces. It is made in two sections, which fit one on top of the other with a cup joint. This prevents cracking, which so often happens with other pipeless pots due to unequal expansion and contraction caused by the fire. The centre of the firepot receives the greatest heat, therefore, expands most\u2014our cup joint being right at this point allows for this, makes it absolutely gas proof, and insures longer life to the firepot.\n\nGrate Surface. The grate surface is the controlling factor in the heating capacity of any furnace. Any one with the most elementary knowledge of the principles of combustion knows that coal cannot burn properly unless the requisite quantity of air is admitted to promote combustion.\n\nIn a furnace, the best place to admit this air is through the grate, therefore, if the grate area is small the quantity of air supplied is necessarily correspondingly small, while if the grate area is large the amount of air admitted must also be large. (See also \u201cAir Blast\u201d Page 15.)\n\nThe heat supplied by a furnace represents the amount of heat contained in the quantity of coal burned, less whatever heat is necessary to promote a draft. If, however, air is not admitted in proper quantity, there is a considerable amount of unconsumed and unburned gas sent up the chimney. This represents just so much absolute loss in heat.\n\nIn the Pease \u201cEconomy\u201d 700 Series Furnace all this is eliminated. We claim to have a larger grate area, size for size, rating for rating than is supplied in any other furnace made in Canada.\n\nThat is to say, we supply more air to every pound of coal burned in a Pease Economy Furnace than in any other make. The large area of our grate allows the largest possible quantity of air to be admitted which is freely and evenly distributed through the coal. This gives a complete and equal supply of air. No coal, gases, etc., are left unburned, everything is used to produce the maximum amount of heat from the minimum amount of coal.\n\nThe saving made by this feature is very great indeed and alone forms one of the strongest features which has always made the \u201cPease\u201d Furnace the standard for economy in fuel.\nPease \"Economy\" Furnaces\u2014\u201c700 Series\u201d\n\nThe Rocking and Dumping Grate.\n\nThe \"PEASE\" rocking and dumping grate is far superior to ordinary grates for many reasons. It is most effective, yet very simple in construction. It provides the largest possible surface area because of special sockets in the ash-pit which give support to the grate bars.\n\nThe grate bars are extra heavy so as to withstand the great strain always placed on the grate in any furnace. It cannot be pushed out of position, will not break or bend, and is so deep in the ash-pit as to prevent even of a poker being passed over its entire surface at any time, if desired. Its simplicity of construction eliminates all superfluous cogs, bearings, etc. There is nothing to get out of order or warp. It is the most simple, durable, effective and convenient grate on the market.\n\nThe Vertical Shaker.\n\nConnected to the grate bars is a vertical shaker which enables one to shake the grates without stooping. When the fire requires to be dumped, simply pull the shaker out as far it will come. The grates are then in a vertical position, leaving wide openings, through which they clean themselves immediately without the use of a poker.\n\nDirect Draft Connection.\n\nAs will be seen from the cut, the smoke passes from the combustion chamber or dome of the furnace, through cast iron horns to the heat radiator, then through the radiator to the smoke pipe.\n\nThe horn at the back, leading direct to the chimney, is equipped with a damper so that when getting up a fire quickly the smoke need not go through the radiator at all, but by pulling the damper rod the large smoke horn is opened and the smoke passes DIRECT to the chimney.\n\nAfter the fire is nicely started the direct damper may be closed and the smoke goes through the radiator and all around the dome, thus utilizing all the heat it contains before reaching the chimney. This saves a lot of heat that otherwise would be wasted.\n\nDome or Combustion Chamber.\n\nThe Dome, which is extra large, is made of fine textured heavy wrought steel plate, and is absolutely impervious to gas under all temperatures. This is most important, as the dome receives the direct impact of the hot gases and flames arising from the firepot. Lighter or inferior material would in time be perforated by these fumes, and so let the gas escape to all parts of the house.\n\nThe large size of the combustion chamber is a very important factor in making more heat by causing the complete burning of all the gases released from the fuel, which in most furnaces escape up the chimney and are wasted.\n\nThe close grain and high finish of the metal in the \"Economy\" Dome permits the rapid and perfect transmission of the heat to the most satisfactory degree. The remaining products of combustion are forced to the front and down through the dome horns into the radiator, adding still further to the heat producing qualities of the Pease \"Economy\".\n\nAir Blast.\n\nAt the back of and just above the firepot is an ingenious device whereby a strong current of hot air enters the combustion chamber and mixes with the gases generated by the fire, insuring complete combustion. It has a sloping hood over its outlets to prevent it becoming clogged and it is connected to an opening in the outer casing.\n\nThe Base-ring and Ash-pit.\n\nThe base-ring and base are connected by radial arms, and cast in one piece of very heavy iron which gives tremendous strength. The ash pit, being all in one piece, cannot leak fine ashes into the air chamber which is the cause of the dust and dirt which accumulate in the house from ordinary furnaces. The ash pit is also fitted with a large door to facilitate the removal of ashes; also a separate slice door through which the grate may easily be attended to.\n\nThe Large Double Feed Doors.\n\nThe large double feed doors will be valued wherever wood is used exclusively or during the Spring or early Fall days when only a small amount of heat is required, because it enables the owner to use rough pieces that would otherwise be wasted. The lower door is fitted with a small wheel damper for admitting additional air when required.\n\nThe Water Pan.\n\nWater for evaporation is kept in the large water pan located in the outer casing just below the base of the firepot. The water keeps the air humid for perfect atmospheric conditions at all times. A water pan is not required to such an extent with this furnace as with others, as the large diameter of the casings allows the air to be warmed without being overheated and burned dry.\n\nThe Dampers and Regulators.\n\nThere are four dampers in the furnace to insure perfect regulation. The direct damper, located in the combustion chamber and the smoke pipe, is operated by a rod from the front of the furnace and is designed to be used only when starting the fire or when adding fresh fuel. When closed, it causes the products of combustion to be drawn into the radiator, thereby\ndelaying their escape into the chimney long enough to permit their heat to pass through the walls of the radiator into the surrounding air currents.\n\nAt the bottom of the smoke pipe is the check damper. This should always be placed on the pipe below the smoke collar of the furnace. In the ash pit door is the draft damper. Both these dampers may be regulated by chains leading from the nickel-plated Regulator which can be placed in any desired position on the floor above.\n\nBetween the feed and the ash-pit doors is the dust damper. This is opened when the grate is being shaken and by drawing the dust over the fire prevents it escaping into the cellar.\n\nThe Casings and Linings. The casings are double, the inner casing being of bright Tin, and the outer casing of heavy Best Cast Staples Iron. This double casing is very important as it has the effect of keeping the heat in the furnace\u2014the same as double windows keep your house warm. They are held in position by two steel rings and the base ring, and being of the same diameter from top to bottom, allow the air from the inlets to be distributed evenly over the radiating surfaces, reaching all the pipes leading from them.\n\nThe casings in the Pease \"Economy\" Furnaces are from 25 to 50 per cent larger in area, size for size, than those of any other furnace. This allows for a large volume of moderately warmed air instead of a comparatively small volume of parched hot air being delivered in the rooms.\n\nConservative Ratings. It has always been the policy of Pease Foundry Company, Limited, to give conservative estimates of the capacities of furnaces. Some people comparing our estimates with those of some other manufacturers, may fail to understand why some makers rate their furnaces having the same heating surface as the Pease No. 710 to do the work for which we have rated our furnaces as large as the No. 714. It is only necessary to say that the reasons that we have given in the preceding paragraphs prove that such estimates are made by men lacking in practical experience.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant No. 152199-5A and have to thank you for the conclusion to which you have come, which we think is not only generous but just. We would ask - and if you have no authority to grant it, we would ask it as a favor if you would direct us to the person who has such authority - we would ask that hereafter all heating apparatus made in Canada be placed on a par in your specifications, putting it thus - \"Gurney or equal\" - \"Pease Economy or equal\" - or any other name that your architects think advisable place first.\n\nWe send you a booklet describing our Heater and Ventilator which is invaluable for use in any building occupied by many persons and which saves from 25% to 50% of the fuel used in other steam heating. The reason why, we shall be pleased to explain to any of your architects or heating engineers.\n\nThanking you again, we are Dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident\n\nIndian Affairs.

As it is now about two years since the building was completed, it is reasonable to assume that any cracking of plaster that is likely to occur has taken place. I would recommend that the Agent be authorized to have the walls repaired where necessary and that they be tinted after being repaired. I think that the choice of color, for tinting, could be left to Miss McBain, the teacher.\n\nInspector Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 30, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, and in reply I beg to say that you may have the walls of the Rama School and teachers' living quarters repaired where necessary and tinted.

If the expenditure was authorized by the Department you should quote the official letter written you in the matter.\n\nIt is desired to point out that you should not, unless under most exceptional circumstances, incur expenditure without authority from the Department.

The fault, however, is entirely in the operation of the furnace and not with the apparatus, which is one of the best make of hot air furnaces on the market and of ample capacity, its guaranteed rating being 45,000 cu.ft. and the area of class-room 18,215 cu.ft. only. The total cubic area of building is 30,000 cu.ft., and as there is a kitchen range mentioned in operation, that should keep the living quarters fairly comfortable during the school hours, after which the heat from the furnace is available. You will see from this explanation that the guaranteed furnace capacity is 2\u00bd times the area of the class-rooms and at least double that of the class-rooms and halls, cloak-room, &c., and consequently any deficiency in heating is the result of improper attention to the furnace. It may be that the furnace requires cleaning out, as the flues will quickly choke up unless this is done every few weeks and thoroughly cleaned out once or twice a year to ensure\n\nMiss Ruth Waite,\nTeacher,\nRama Indian School,\nR.R.No.2 Atherley, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 25, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss Ruth Waite, the teacher at the Rama school, has written the Department stating that they have been unable to heat the building satisfactorily, and as the furnace installed is a No.316 Pease Economy, with a capacity of 45,000 cu. ft., and guaranteed to heat the building to 70 degrees when the temperature is at zero outside, the subcontractors who installed the furnace in the school are Phillips & Company, of Orillia, who should be requested to thoroughly clean out the furnace and demonstrate its fitness to meet the above requirement.\n\nThe caretaker of the school should also be on hand when this test is being made to ensure a thorough knowledge and proper working of the furnace, so that efficient heating may be maintained in the school. This should be done as soon as possible and the results reported by you to the Department.\n\nA copy of the letter to Miss Waite is inclosed herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas.W.Myers, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAtherley, Ont.\nI beg to explain to above number and date. The account of Messrs Macnab Bros., Miss Wallace (Nurse) informed me the upstairs was too cold for her and that she wanted a stove put up. As we had the old school stove on hand I had the same taken upstairs as there where no pipes which I enclosed new ones and coal scuttle ash pail T shovel and extra pail for slugs as to lanterns one was for the nurse which she had to have, the other was for teacher Miss Smith which was badly needed to go out building after dark, the other articles in bills was required on account of wear and breakage.\n\nThe cold weather set in and Ruma Rogers being away from Oulicka 7 miles these articles I had to drive after them and avoided any expense in buying up this equipment for the Nurse.\n\nDept letter 485083 Nov 24th 1916 request cooperation which I took as guidance.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. M. Leam\nActing Deputy and Secretary\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-5, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI thank the Department for the attention given to my letter which referred to the temperature of the school rooms. The sub-contractor will doubtless give some useful information.\n\nI also thank the Department for permission to attend the Social Congress which is to be held in Toronto.\n\nYours faithfully,\nRuth Waite\n\nMr. McLean\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above number and date, I beg to report as follows. Messrs Phillips & Co sent their man to investigate the Rama Indian school furnace last Friday. 27 Below zero and wind running 40 to 50 miles an hour, a North wind. We found the North room very cold, the South room very warm. The corridor was as cold as outside itself.\n\nThis school stands in a bleak place; the wind from the lake has a good sweep. The front of the school facing west and so there 3 entrances - south, west, north. It is impossible to keep the wind out with so many doors. The front entrance and north door is not used. As there is too much cold and wind coming in the corridor from these doors around the fans, the hot air pipes act as cold air pipes in the corridor under these circumstances, and no heat from that source. The corridor being as cold as the outside, the cold gets into the school room, and hot air pipes not carrying the heat what it should on account of this extreme cold and wind which is too heavy for the warm air, and as we have had a few very cold and windy days in January, we had the care taker of school with us and posted him thoroughly so to\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nRunning the furnace. I made another test with the Expert today on Tuesday afternoon. I understand how to run a furnace myself. The day was medium cold and a good wind running from the south-west inside of half an hour the room was summer heat and had to open the windows. The whole building was warm and comfortable.\n\nThe furnace works alright. The chimney has good draft and the Expert found everything satisfactory in regard to furnace being clean. The trouble is in the building too much cold and wind coming in the front. The only way is now to close up the front and north door away with them and only have the south entrance. This is the opinion of the Expert, as this will be trouble every cold snap and high wind.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\nChas. W. Myers\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6155, File 421-5, part 2)\nOttawa, February 13, 1917.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 7th instant in reference to the Rama school heating system, and in reply to inform you that the Department will authorize you to have strips placed around each of the doors to prevent wind entering between the doors and frames if the cold enters at these points. The north and west entrance doors may also be kept locked until the arrival of warm weather. It is the intention of the Department to have the building thoroughly inspected during the coming summer with a view to determining the exact condition of the heating and ventilating system, also the condition of the work in the building generally, so that defects, if any exist, may be remedied before next winter.\n\nWith reference to the operations of the furnace, if the outside air enters the building to the extent reported by you, the inside fresh air duct only should be used, which will enable you to heat the building more easily than if the outside duct is in operation.\n\nI have therefore, to request that you will have the furnace operated under these conditions and inform me of the results.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChas.

A.,\nChatham, Ont.\n\nThe agent says he could get no one to do the work at the estimate given. I would, therefore, recommend that the work be done by day labor, with Alder York as foreman. This drain is necessary to drain the garden, the lower part of the school grounds and carry the overflow from the pump, which at the present time flows into the basement.\n\nThe basement has water in it all the time. No provision was made for taking the water out by means of a trap in the floor, and a tile.\n\nThe water flows from the high ground back of the school into the basement, through the outside door leading to the basement. See plan.\n\nTo remedy this the door sill should be raised 6 inches to 1 ft. and clay packed in next to the wall of the school with gravel over the top. It would take about three loads of clay and 1 ton gravel. The whole job, raising the door, gravel and clay would cost about $5.00\n\nThis wet damp basement is a menace to health of both children and teachers.\nOn reply to above number and date of letter per above. Department instruction is carried out as to lowering school gates last year I ordered the gates to be lowered this man had no Auger to bore new holes in the post so he blocked the gates and made a good job of it so & let the matter stand that way. Gate way for team and wagon to enter by was taken out for this purpose when Mr. Abraham was up on his visit to Rama Reserve there were 2 gates blocked which he must have seen and it would be better to report the truth to Department. If he did not approve of the way that was done he could condemn the blocking and not say that the gates allowed the pigs to get in the school yard as no pigs could get in the way the gates were blocked.\n\nI am your obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. M. Leam & Co.\nActing Deputy and Secretary\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nIn reply to above number and date of letter & enclose my sketch of school yard drainage, and also for the basement of the school, the trouble of school basement is all surface water this must be raised with dirt next to wall about 2 ft and layer out then traveled over. The Porch that is over the outside of stairway that leads into the basement must be raised up and the cement foundation must be built up. I should think this would cost about $20.00. You will by my sketch that Mr. Abraham proposal of drainage of school is only 125 ft and the balance 575 is to benefit the next lot.\n\nAs to placing tile around the school yard to keep the water out of the basement & am of the opinion that this is a ridiculous proposal as heavy clay land will not let the water down to the tile all right for Sand. The surface will run to the lowest point every time and the School foundation is that point in this case and run down the stair way from the outside entrance.\n\nI am your obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

The cellar drain and bottom of road ditch being practically on a level, the result is that when road ditch is in flood the water flows back into basement to this level which at the time of my inspection was three-feet in depth. To remedy this it will be necessary to either provide a pressure flood gate valve on the present drain, or, to build a tank with drain connected to building from which water can be pumped when necessary providing this enters the school basement.\n\nOwing to the depth of water in the basement, no examination of the basement floor or wall surface could be made, but from due enquiry and careful examination of exterior walls and ground surrounding the building, I am of the opinion that the basement is in otherwise good condition.\n\nIn the rear of building it will be necessary to build concrete areas surrounding two of the basement windows, also to raise the wall of outside cellar entrance one-foot to provide satisfactory grade in rear, thus diverting surface water flow from building.\n\nThere\nThere is considerable repairing to the building required at this time, plastering being cracked and broken in each of the class-rooms, in cloak-room and passages, and also in living-room on upper floor. Interior woodwork is also broken in places and needs replacing; several door panels require repairs. There is a considerable space around the walls of kitchen floor which should be filled with cement to keep out the cold at this point. The exterior door and window frames should have the blind stiles removed and space filled with oakum or pitched felt before replacing to prevent cold entering the building there.\n\nThe porch over kitchen door is separated from the building and requires lifting and blocking up in front and securing to building.\n\nThe entire building (exterior and interior) should be repainted as the woodwork is very much in need of this, the original painting having been badly done (apparently only two coats instead of three specified) the wood having been left rough, without sand-papering, and visible through the paint.\n\nThe estimated cost of making these improvements is, approximately,\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 4 ft. x 12 ft. deep excavation for drain well | $20.00 |\n| Concrete curb with cement top              | 50.00  |\n| Connecting & drains to well 30 feet         | 15.00  |\n| Grading in rear                           | 20.00  |\n| Three concrete areas in rear               | 30.00  |\n| Interior plastering                       | 15.00  |\n| Repairs to woodwork, etc.                 | 35.00  |\n| Painting woodwork and tinting walls, etc.  | 150.00 |\n| Hardware, carting, etc.                   | 25.00  |\n\n$360.00\n\nThe cost may be somewhat reduced providing the repairs are done by the Band, under capable superintendence.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, April 25, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nPlans and specifications have been prepared for drainage system for the Rama Indian School, together with the necessary areas and grading required to ensure for the future a dry and airy basement. It is also intended to make any necessary repairs to the building at the same time, including the broken plastering and woodwork, filling in around kitchen-floor, around all window frames, and thorough painting of woodwork, inside and out.\n\nIt is proposed to have this work done as far as possible by members of the Band, such as carpenters, plasterers, painters, and concrete men; and if so, the rate of pay per day for each class, and the date when this labour can be most readily obtained.\n\nIt is thought that this work ought to proceed at the same time as the repairs to Council-hall, as the labour engaged can be more economically utilized in this way.\n\nOn receipt of the information requested, the matter will be given consideration, when you will be again communicated with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

The broken plaster in the interior should be carefully removed and all walls and ceilings thoroughly patched with wood fibre plaster in two coats. The damaged woodwork in interior should also be put in good repair. The porch over kitchen door should be braced up and firmly secured to building; also to raise and block up entrance to basement, raising the cement wall at least nine inches in height above the present grading. The existing doorway will necessarily be decreased in height and a new door necessary, and this will not then be of a stock size. A new door should be made of flooring or sheeting with cleats and braces on the inside.\n\nConcrete areas to rear windows are also to be built to the same level as basement entrance. A drain well is to be dug to the depth shown on the plan near fence in front of building, with drain emptying therein. The well to be formed of metal tanks with top and bottom removed set on end to the height required forming case for well.\nThe space between the tank and earth wall being filled with concrete and cement concrete, platform at surface with opening for pump. Bolts to be also fitted into concrete for bolting pump in position.\n\nThe ground in rear of school between building and pump and on right end of building, to be graded as shown on the plan, so that water will have free egress from the grounds without flooding the building. Sand and gravel should also be graded over the surface of the clay in the graded portions, to prevent the carrying of mud into the building. A field tile drain is to be sunk into the grade as shown from well to fence, so as to carry excess water from the well.\n\nIt is thought that all of this work except the carpentering and plastering can be done by the Indians under your supervision with the assistance of the carpenter employed. The material necessary being supplied by you as cheaply as possible.\n\nThe plastering work and carpentering work to be done either by day labour or by contract as you may best be able to arrange.\n\nEstimates should also be procured for the thorough sand-papering of the rough interior woodwork and painting of exterior and interior with one good coat of pure lead Linseed Oil, paint tinted to match existing work. Also the cleaning and tinting throughout the building with Alabastine in approved tints.\nThe estimates for the painting and tinting of walls to be submitted to the Department for approval before acceptance. The other work would be proceeded with as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant D. M. and Secretary.\n\nCharles W.

In fact the south side is wet along the entire width of the building. Nothing further appears to have been done but there four large iron drums outside at the back, also a few lengths of lumber and I believe the agent was around yesterday morning. Frank Shelling tells me that he and Mr. Myers are going to do the work between them.\n\nThere is no furnace coal whatever and only a little stove coal for the kitchen.

There are some repairs required to the closets and some cinders around these out buildings. There should be put some cinders around the school; this ground is very wet in the fall and spring & would think that 10 loads of cinders would fix up everything all right.\n\nThe teachers closet is combined in with the girls closet.\n\nEstimate cost would be $25.00 + $5.00\n\nThe same would be quite sanitary.

Myers\nIndian Agent\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Rama Indian School, dated September 20, 1921 - Original on 24-1-6\n\nThe grounds are rather rough and uneven. Organized play is good for the children. Just what you can do to improve the grounds or supply equipment is a matter for the Department and their representative on the reserve to decide. The rain beats in at the back of the boys' closet through the cracks and wets the seat. The door is off the girls' closet. The button on the outside of the door of closet is not long enough to hold it and it slaps in the wind. I would suggest that the closets should be scrubbed out every week if possible. I think that there should be a cup for each pupil and a place for each cup to be kept. A common cup on a reserve is a very dangerous source for spread of disease. The walls and ceilings of classrooms should be carefully cleaned at least once a year and paint used at least every second year.\n\nT. R. Ferguson,\n\nInspector.\nOTTAWA, November 5th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in his recent report on the inspection of the Rama Indian Day School, states that the closets at this school require some repairs. The rain beats in at the back of the boys' closet, and the door is off the girls' closet.\n\nI have to request that you will take immediate action in having these closets put in a good state of repair. Any work performed should be at the lowest possible cost to the Department.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that these closets be scrubbed out at frequent intervals. You might draw this to the attention of the caretaker, as it is considered that it is part of his duties to see that they are kept in a clean condition.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the school grounds are rough and uneven. It is too late this season to have any work done in levelling the ground, but I should be pleased if you would keep this matter in mind and early next spring furnish a report as to what you would advise should be done to put the grounds in good condition, and also state the probable cost of this work.\n\nThe Inspector further recommends that a drinking cup be supplied for each pupil in order to prevent contagion among the pupils. I would be pleased to have your views regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChas. W. Myers, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAtherley, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report to above number and date as follows.\n\nThe Public School Inspector reports the cause of the big storm we had here the rain would penetrate anything with this wind. However, the closets were not finished in the first place. They were not lined up inside which should have been done. I will have them attended to.\n\nI heard the closets thoroughly scrubbed when school opened, but owing to the fact that I placed new linings around their outside, trying to make the place sanitary and dry the block out of the cinders looked some, but now as the rain has washed these cinders there will be no more trouble as to trouble as to school ground being rough and uneven a great many school grounds are worse, at the same time it would make a big improvement to school yard to have it leveled up.\n\nAs to the individual drinking cups I could not see that would prevent catching as the cups that is at the well D'Gelbert's cup the fresh air is the thing as far as that concerned, no water is kept in school, and no plates are used. The homes is were this trouble started.\n\nI am your obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAss't Deputy and Secretary\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the fall it gets dark early in the afternoon and frequently this occurs at other times in the year. A light should also have been put in the back part of the basement as well as the one that was put near the furnace.\n\nThere is some plaster off the wall in the junior class-room near the door. This has probably been from the jarring of the door.\n\nT. R. Ferguson,\nInsp.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herein the account of A. R. Payne who supplied a new pump head for Rama Indian Day School.

If, after it has been cleaned, it is found that any other than minor repairs are required, you should furnish a report stating what is needed and the cost of the work.

February 13, 1925.\n\nThe classrooms are badly in need of fresh decorating. The electric wiring is in the building but not in the classrooms. This could be remedied with very little extra cost.\n\nT. R. Ferguson,\nInsp.\nOttawa, February 20, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Rama Indian Day School, states that the classrooms are in need of redecorating. He also states that the electric wiring is in the building but not in the classrooms, and that the wire could be installed in these rooms with very little extra cost.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish your views as to the need of having the interior of the classrooms redecorated. You should state the nature of the work you would recommend be done, and the approximate cost of the same. Please also report on the need of having the electric wiring installed in the classrooms. Except for a short period in the fall of the year when extra light may be required in the classrooms, the Department cannot see the need of having electric lighting installed therein. The information asked for regarding any painting, kalsomining or other redecorating which you recommend should be forwarded at an early date. If it is decided to authorize having the work done, it could be carried out when the school is closed for the summer holidays next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. S. Anderson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ont.\nReference No 24-1-5.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th inst. regarding re-decorating Kamsa Indian Day School and the installing of electric lights in the classrooms. Both these questions I have dealt up with you on previous occasions. The school certainly needs painting both inside and out. In 1923 I called for tenders and thus submitted for painting on outside & decorating & painting inside varnish from $270.00 to $310.00 but this price cannot be used now as I will have to call for new estimates which I propose doing in accordance with your letter of October 1st 1924 so that if it is decided to do the work it will be carried on during the summer holidays.\n\nIn accordance with your letter of 7th April 1924 you then decided that you did not consider the lights in the class room required. Most of the time during school hours the light is sufficient, but there are odd times when the pupils cannot see the word on the blackboard.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nLongfield House\nStiby, Oct 1925\n\nI will however secure an estimate of\ninstalling this light and submit them\nto you.\n\nYours truly,\nA.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6156, file 421-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the painting of the interior and exterior of the Rama Indian Day School building during the coming summer holidays. It is noted that you will obtain an estimate of the cost of having this work done.\n\nIn this connection it is considered that the amount required should be provided from the interest funds at the credit of the Band. After you have obtained an estimate of the cost, you should submit the matter to the Band in Council, and, if possible, obtain a resolution authorizing the Department to pay the expenditure incurred from the interest account at the credit of the Band. It is hoped that the Council will willingly consent to provide the funds. I might say that it is unlikely that the funds required to pay the cost of the painting could be provided from Parliamentary Appropriation, and in the event of the Indians refusing to provide the funds necessary this work would have to stand over.\n\nRegarding the extension of the electric light system to the classrooms, we will await your estimate of the cost involved before giving consideration to authorizing the work being done. This matter was only brought up on the recommendation of the Public School Inspector, as, owing to the period each day the classes are held, the Department is unable to see the necessity for providing electric light to carry on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

On my last visit to school it was rather mild and the work was very bad. The pupils entering school they cannot keep but only considerable into the School.\n\nThe crushed stone would have to be hauled from Longford and it should take two days for to haul sufficient at $5.00 per day in which time about 8 loads should be hauled at $10 per load.\n\nA new gate is also required at the entrance to the school grounds, the present one being past repair.\n\nA padlock is also required for teachers outdoor closet.\n\nMr. Johnson, one of the teachers has also requested that I secure for school grounds this spring a load of well rotted manure and a few loads of loam for the flower beds at the School.\n\nYour faithfully,\n\nA. J. Macdonald Agent\nRoma Indian Reserve\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, submitting an estimate of the cost of installing electric lights in the classrooms of the Rama Indian Day School, and also with reference to the painting of the school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the installation of two lights in front of each blackboard in each classroom with suitable shades or reflectors, also for the installation of a switch for each room as required. It is noted that you estimate the cost of this work to be approximately $35, and this amount should, if possible, not be exceeded. When the work has been completed, you should furnish properly certified vouchers covering the cost.\n\nWith reference to obtaining prices for the painting of the interior and exterior of the school building, I beg to say that if tenders are called it would be necessary to submit the same to His Excellency the Governor General In Council for approval. We would prefer that you obtain an estimate from a reliable painter of the cost of the material required, such as paint, oils, etc., and a separate estimate for the labour in doing the painting. Another arrangement that would be satisfactory would be for you to purchase the material after obtaining competitive prices, and arrange for the labour under a competent foreman, keeping time sheets for the men engaged. Please forward the estimate of the cost of the material and labour, and state which of the above arrangements you prefer for having the work done. It will be necessary to prepare a brief specification of the amount of painting to be done, and I shall also be pleased to have this information.\n\nThe question of authorizing the work during the coming summer holidays will depend entirely upon obtaining a resolution from the Band in Council to authorize the Department to pay the expenditure required from the interest account at the credit of the Band, and you should, after ascertaining what the cost will be, endeavour to obtain this resolution for the amount required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. S. Anderson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLongford Mills, Ont.\nOttawa, March 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, recommending that crushed stone be secured and placed on the walks and approaches to the Rama Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, when weather conditions permit, you may arrange to obtain the quantity of crushed stone required and have it hauled from Longford and placed on the walks and approaches. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred for the purpose, and you will see that this work is satisfactorily carried out and the walks left in a neat and finished condition.\n\nYou may also purchase and have installed a gate at the entrance to the school grounds, also a padlock for the teacher's outdoor closet.\n\nThe Department will also approve of the purchase of a load of well rotted manure and a few loads of loam for the flower beds on the school grounds.\n\nYou should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, showing the expenditure incurred for each of the above services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

See 1925A-1F, ONTARIO.\n\nSTATE OF BUILDING,\n\nQuarry Stone... Building needs plastering in places and decorating.\n\nWanda Bowman,\nTeacher\nUpon my last visit to the Roma Indian Day School, I noticed that the floor in the class rooms required cleaning and I gave instructions to the caretaker to have this work done during the Easter Holiday. As a great benefit is derived from the polish of the floors, I would recommend that the work be done quarterly, before the floor were oiled; the dust in the class rooms at time of sweeping was very bad getting up onto the teacher's shoes at each sweep.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.S. Robinson Agent\nRoma Indian Reserve\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nA few boards are required for repairing coal bins in Roma Indian Days School.\n\nYours truly,\nM.J. Macdonald\nAgent\nRoma Indian Reserve\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 16th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that the action taken by you in having the caretaker of the Rama Indian Day School oil the floors of the school building during the Easter holidays is approved. The Department is not prepared to authorize having the floors oiled quarterly. It is considered that twice a year - once during the spring and once during the fall - would be sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAasst.

The hardwood floors have heaved. Now with the fire on these will go back in place except up the centre of one class room where the floor has heaved so high that I do not think that it will go back in place. Some of the boards may have to be replaced. The kitchen range is in bad condition. The front grate is burned through and the bricks are again broken. This requires attention before the severe weather sets in. I am pleased to see that base balls, bats and footballs have been provided for the smaller children. It would not be much trouble to provide these.\n| DATE | AMOUNT |\n|------|--------|\n|      |        |\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No. dated\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If any new parts are required, you should obtain same from the manufacturer of the desks. It is thought that you can obtain the manufacturer's name from the desks, and you should furnish full particulars as to any parts required, giving sizes, etc. If, however, no extra parts are required, you should have the desks requiring attention gone over and placed in good condition.\n\nYou may also purchase and have installed two door locks - one for door leading into senior classroom and one for door leading into school on south side. It is considered that the teacher should see that better care is taken of the door locks and furniture at this school, as recently there has been considerable expense in making minor repairs.\n\nNo unnecessary expense should be incurred in the repairing of the desks and in the furnishing of the locks, and, when the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Later, after the work is well under way, if this equipment appears to be urgently needed, you may again bring the matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nThere is no change of policy in connection with what should be supplied to the teachers at this school, but I wish to make Mrs. Stickle feel as comfortable as possible. In my offer to her, I stated that the necessary furniture and equipment, with the exception of linens, etc., was provided. I mentioned that fuel was supplied by the Department and a janitor employed. I consider that the teachers should continue to pay the electric light charges and supply the smallware, etc., necessary.\n\nWith reference to the time table and course of studies to be followed, you may inform Mrs. Stickle that the Department wishes her to be guided by the curriculum prescribed by the Ontario Department of Education. She should give the practical work particular emphasis and should endeavour to correlate classroom exercises with the activities of the children's homes and environment. You might refer Mrs. Stickle to the advice and instructions printed on the covers of the classroom register.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S.

Screen 28x31 .30/\n1 lt. 12x14 Glass .12/\n2 Mortise Lock Sets 1.00 3.00/\n\n$3.62\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile at the Rama Reserve this week, I noticed that the school needs painting very badly. The outside weed trimmings are deteriorating very rapidly. This school should have been painted four or five years ago. I asked the agent about it, and he stated that the Indian Council would not pass any resolution. I beg to recommend that funds of the band be used, and the school painted. The metal capping on the belfry and chimneys should also be painted as they are rusting badly.\n\nThe agent also informed me that he had a letter of instructions from the Department stating that he was to prepare for a school garden. In this connection I wish to point out that the soil in the school yard is not suitable for a garden. We tried our best to have a garden and make a success of it this last number of years, but the ground is very hard tough clay. One end of it is very wet and low, and before anything could be done a tile drain would have to be put in. I surveyed for this tile drain a number of years ago, but it was not put in. I do not think that the idea of having a garden at the school is practical. The school children have been having their gardens at home, and the produce has been exhibited at the fair. The big problem with the school garden is that during the summer holidays, when the children are not at school and the teachers are not on the Reserve, the garden goes to weeds and not only that but it is a disgrace, setting a very poor example for the children.\n\nI beg to recommend that the children continue on the basis of their home plot, rather than a school garden.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Ind. Aff.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nR.H. ABRAHAM,\nAGR. REP., DEPT. OF IND. AFF.\nOttawa, July 31, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 10th instant, relative to the painting and decorating of the Rams Indian Day School. Mr. R. H. Abraham, Agricultural Representative of the Department, who recently visited the Rams reserve, strongly recommends that this work be carried out this summer. He discussed this matter with you and states that you informed him the Indian Council would not provide the funds for the purpose. I have to request that you will carry out the instructions contained in the above mentioned letter, prepare brief specifications of the painting, etc., which you consider should be done and obtain quotations from a number of responsible painters for performing the work. When these quotations have been received, you should forward same to the Department for consideration. I may say that the Department will provide the amount required for this painting from its Appropriation for Indian Education and not from the funds of the Band. Please give this matter your prompt attention, as we desire to have this building painted during the present summer.\n\nMr. Abraham has drawn attention to the carrying on of a school garden in connection with this school. He states that the soil in the school yard is not suitable and that the idea of having a garden there is not practical. He further states that the children have gardens at their homes. It is considered that no further action need be taken by the teachers and pupils in the conducting of a garden at the school. You should, however, encourage the pupils to conduct garden plots at their homes and exhibit samples of the produce grown at the local school fair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

With reference to the painting, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Anderson was requested to prepare a brief specification of the work to be done. He was asked, also, to obtain prices from two or three responsible painters in the vicinity for performing the work. The Department will pay the expense involved from the Appropriation for Indian Education and not from Band Funds. We are again drawing this matter to the attention of the agent.\n\nYour report regarding the carrying on of school garden work is noted. It is also noted that you consider having a garden at this school is not practical, owing to the ground in the yard being unsuitable, and the problem of attending to same during the summer holidays. We are taking this matter up with the agent and suggesting that, in view of your report, he need not take any further action in having the teachers and children carry on gardening at this school. We are advising him to encourage the children in every way possible in the conducting of home garden plots and exhibiting samples of the produce grown therein at the local school fair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

We have been informed by Mr. Abraham, who recently visited this Reserve, that the Indian Council would not provide the funds. As, however, it is necessary that this work be done, we instructed the Agent to prepare a brief specification of the work to be done and obtain prices from a number of responsible painters in the vicinity.

The small cupboard at present in use is not large enough and can be used for medical supplies and a new one installed for all other school supplies.\n\nI am enclosing herewith an estimate of the cost for same and provided you approve of one being installed I would recommend that the burden for the one at $35 be neglected.\n\nYour truly\n\nA.S.

The small cupboard at present in use can be used for medical supplies and the new cupboard which you are authorized to supply will be for the use of the school supplies. When this cupboard has been installed, you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date, relative to the glass required in the senior room.

You should place the order with the firm who can supply the same type of desks as those already in the school, in order to have uniformity in the seating equipment.

I examined it on Thursday last, and from observation it would appear to me to be necessary to take levels to find out if there is sufficient drop for proper drainage. Provided you have the plans when the school was built, I am of the impression it will show a drain from the North West corner of School to a well, a little west of School, and from this well another drain was made but I am informed was never connected to the well.\n\nI cannot advise opening these drains until it is certain that proper drainage can be had.\n\nYour truly,\n\nM.S.

This should be definitely stated in his work. He doesn't seem to think that he receives sufficient pay to do this, but it is very important especially on a reserve where health conditions are none too good.\nOttawa, September 25, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Rama Indian Day School, recommends that the closets receive the attention of the caretaker each day, and that he should see that they are kept in a cleanly condition. It is considered that the teachers should impress upon the children the need of cleanliness and thus assist the caretaker in keeping these toilets in a sanitary condition.\n\nPlease draw this matter to the attention of the teachers and the janitor and insist that the janitor see that these toilets are kept in a sanitary condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Anderson, Agent,\nLongford, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Anderson:\n\nIn discussing the problem of a school picnic before the end of June, Miss Kellogg and I wondered if it would be permissible to arrange an Educational trip, say to Port McNall to the docks, or some such place, just for the pupils from 10 years of age up. We could take them with us and combine Geography, History and Picnic. There would be the expense of a truck or conveyance of that kind. Do you think the Department would be willing to bear the expense. If you could go along and Rev. & Mrs. MacKenzie as well as we two teachers, the children would be well taken care of. They see so little of the real Canada, it would be good for them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJean Stickley\nPrincipal\nLongford Mills\nJune 11, 1927\n\nSir,\n\nRe Rama Indian Day School.\n\nI have been requested by the teachers of Rama Indian Day School to arrange for a one day outing or picnic for pupils from 10 years of age up. The proposal is to give them an outing that would be of some education to them. The school children never see anything more than what takes place on the Reserve and an outing as set forth in letter I receive from the Principal Miss Shickle would no doubt be a benefit and a pleasure to the pupils.\n\nThe only expense would be cost of conveyance at the rate of motor truck which will cost $2.00 per hour and would be for whole day.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent\nRama Indian Reserve\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nLongford Mill\nJune 11, 1927\n\nReference No. 24-165\n\nReplying to your letter of Nov. 26, 1926, wherein you advised that Mr. Orr, the Architect of the Department, would visit the Rama Indian Day School. I beg to advise that up to the present he has not arrived and the roof to the basement of the School is very bad and water in the basement of the School is very bad at present time. I have arranged some relief work at present time. I would recommend that the local boys have a floor installed raising the bottom about six inches so that the local work be clear of the water.\n\nI also enclose a resolution passed by Council regarding a new Council House providing the Orr visits the Reserve he could then visit and inspect the Hall and make a report.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nM.J. Anderson\nAgent\nRama Indian Reserve\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 15, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to water in the basement of the Rama Indian Day School. I cannot agree to the provision of a wooden floor in the coalbins. Mr. Orr will visit the school in the early future and action will be taken following his report.\n\nI have also your letter of the 11th instant, asking for a grant for an educational trip, or picnic, for the older pupils of this school. This scheme commands itself to the Department and I have to authorize you to expend the sum of not more than $24 for a school outing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.
