Fetterley,\nWater & Power Bureau,\nPublic Building,\nCALGARY, ALTA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to your visit, we enclose herewith three copies of letter from Pumps & Softeners giving iron content in sample of water submitted from the Blue Quills Indian School at St. Paul, also their quotation on I.R.30 Iron Removal Filter necessary to take the iron out of this water. We hope to be favored with your business.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBELL & MORRIS.\n\nSDJ:ES.\nBELL AND MORRIS\nWholesale Merchants\n\n527 8th Ave. West,\nCalgary, Alta.\nMarch 8th, 1938.\n\nTo: Bell & Morris,\nCALGARY, ALTA.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe your recent enquiry, re The Blue Quills Indian School, we would advise you that this water has 12 ppm. of iron in same, and this amount of iron would certainly affect the capacity of any Softener in the course of time materially.\n\nWe would recommend the installation of our I.R.30 Iron Removal Filter, which is described on page 38 of our current catalogue. The price of this is $642.00 F.O.B. St. Paul. Delivery could be made approximately ten days from receipt of order.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPUMPS & SOFTENERS.\nCOPY/AB\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nSurveys and Engineering Branch.\nDominion Water and Power Bureau.\n\nCalgary, Alta., March 9, 1938.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian School Water Supply\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 2nd instant and yours of 25th ultimo I wish to state that Bell & Morris, of Calgary, have received a report on the iron content of the well water, presumably from the 200 feet level, at the above-named school.\n\nThe analysis was performed by Pumps & Softener Limited of London, Ontario, and communicated to Bell & Morris, Calgary, wholesale dealers. Unfortunately the letter did not communicate a complete analysis, viz: of sulphate, etc., which would have been useful. They stated that the iron content was 12 parts per million and that it could be removed by an I.R-30 filter. The retail price quoted was $64.5 f.o.b. London but with Government discounts the price is $64.5 f.o.b. St. Paul, the location of the school.\n\nIn an interview with Bell & Morris, yesterday, Mr. Fetterly of this staff requested them to write to the London Company for a complete analysis, if they have it. In order to save time they were requested to send copies to Mr. Mills and the Controller as well as to this office. Consequently this analysis, if available, will arrive in Ottawa about the same time as this letter.\n\nIncidentally, the softener at the school is a Durco.\n\nIt was also mentioned to Bell and Morris, while discussing the iron-remover, that the style quoted, viz: the I.R-30, is quoted in the Catalogue as having a capacity of 15 U.S. Gallons per minute or 900 Imperial gallons per hour. Provided the requirements of the school is 4000 gallons the time required to treat the water would be 4\u00bd hours per day. The I.R-30 with 8 gallons per minute would require, at 400 Imperial gallons per hour, 10 hours. The use of the larger unit was questioned by Mr. Fetterly although on afterwards considering the matter, 10 hours appear to be rather long to pump each day and the largest unit might be more in keeping with the water softeners - 2 S.F.B. twinned together, which handle 60,000 grain gallons of Sulphites each while the iron-remover has a capacity of 60,000 wine gallons or 1-P.F.M. iron. This data was given to the London Co. as a reminder when they quoted the I.R-30 Filter.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe final question to consider is the possibility of all of this machinery as contrasted with cost of a new well, possibly $1300, as intimated in the original letter and wire of 1935. The usefulness of a new well to another depth would have to be considered in contrast to the present one when treated. It appears, however, that a filter, if effective would be less expensive.\n\nA visit to the school before definite plans were made might be advisable.\n\nEnclosed you will find a copy of the Duro Catalogue, Page 32 contains a description of the Filter mentioned above.\n\nI am also enclosing copies of the communications between Bell & Morris and Pumps & Softeners.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) O.H.

Anderson /G\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Water Supply, Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant with reference to the above, and might say that the only such report was attached to my memorandum of the 17th ultimo.\n\nAs regards undertaking to remove the rust from this water, this question was also dealt with in my memorandum of the 17th ultimo from which it will be noted that the installation of a filter for this purpose would cost approximately $642.00. I am, however, still of the same opinion as given in my memorandum of the 17th ultimo, that the expending of an additional $642.00 with $600.00 already expended in a water softener would be a lot of equipment for this well.\n\nIn this connection, you will recall that your memorandum of the 2nd ultimo concurred in my suggestion in so far as obtaining the views of Mr. Hoover as to whether it would be better to drive a new well rather than incur the additional filtering expense, and accordingly on the 25th ultimo, Mr. Hoover was written for his opinion in this connection. No reply has yet, however, been received.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n13th April, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum received from the Chief Engineer with reference to the water supply at Blue Quills residential school.\n\nIt will be noted that as $680.00 has already been spent in providing a water softener Mr. Mills does not consider an additional expenditure of $642.00 would be justified. Mr. Hoover has been asked to report on the advisability of drilling a new well which might be less expensive than providing a softener for the old well. It will also be noted that no reply has yet been received from Mr. Hoover.\n\nCopies of letters from Bell and Morris together with a report on the content of the water at this school are attached.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of April 13 with reference to the water supply at the above school.\n\nI agree with you that it would not be advisable to purchase another water softener. At the same time I would appreciate if one of your engineers would visit this school at an early date and carefully consider the advisability of digging another well. Following that visit he could report on the probability of securing water and let me have a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of a new well. We have not provided any special funds for the purpose but it might be possible to secure the money from the small amount which we have available for unforeseen expenditure, provided your engineer considers that the digging of a new well would be likely to overcome the difficulty that the school management is now experiencing.\n\nDirector.\nReport\non\nSeptic Tank and on the Well Conditions\nat\nBlue Quills (R.C.) Indian School - St. Paul, Alberta\nby\nP.A. Fetterly, B.Sc., A.M.E.I.C.,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nI. Purpose of Report.\nThis report is prepared with further reference to a report dated Nov. 8, 1932, regarding the condition of the Septic Tank and also to a telegram received from Ottawa on Dec. 21, 1932, regarding the condition of the wells. The writer visited the location on January 13 and 14.\n\nII. Septic Tank.\nA cheque for $500 was received from the Indian Department on 9th ultimo for the purpose of erecting a building 9' x 9' x 7' over the tank and for repairing and changing the location of the motor from the underground concrete chamber to the house provided for it.\n\nH.S. Fraser, of St. Paul, Alta., was entrusted with the construction of the house and I.H. Galloway with the installation of the meter and other electrical work. Estimates were previously obtained and were subsequently closely followed. This portion of the work is now satisfactorily completed.\n\nThe septic tank being filled to a depth of 7 feet with unwatered raw sewage which also clogged the outlet pipes, Mr. Fetterly found it necessary, during his visit of January 13, to engage J. Pigeon of St. Paul, to remove it, as Father Angin would not undertake the work with his small staff and no facilities.\nMr. Pignon promised definitely to finish the work but a letter was received from the Principal on January 25th, by which time this office had expected the work was completed, to the effect that he only worked one day and then abandoned it. The Principal was instructed to hire another man whom he mentioned. It is too much to expect Father Angin's staff to do this portion of the work.\n\nThe cost to date was as follows:\n\nH.S. Fraser, St. Paul, Carpenter $226.62\nThis was an extremely reasonable cost.\n\nI.H. Galloway, St. Paul, Electrician. 45.32\nThis was also very reasonable.\n\nStandard Iron Works, Edmonton 68.40\nRepair of motor and fabrication of extensions, etc.\n\nThe motor was found when unwound to be in poorer condition than first thought.\n\nTotal. $336.34\n\nThe first two bills were paid from the $500 advance. The last invoice is in hand but is being held until the bill for removal of sewage is received, which should be within a few days. The total required extra amount will then be requested from Ottawa.\n\nIt is suggested that the Department of Indian Affairs send the circular which has been seen at other schools containing instructions that the septic tank be cleaned out every six months. Father Angin states that he has never received a copy.\n\nIII. Wells.\n\nImmediately on receipt of the wire dated December 31st, W.E. Gullion, the Indian Agent at Saddle\nLake Agency, in whose district the school is situated, was communicated with. He stated that the driller had again brought in water, at least temporarily and that a visit by the writer was not immediately necessary. A visit was made on January 13 and 14.\n\nA resume of the writer's findings are as follows:\n\n(a) Three wells have been drilled.\n\nWell No. 1.\n\nDrilled 300 feet west of the school in 1930 on the slope of a hill about 20 feet high. This well is 470 feet deep. Four veins of water were found 96', 205', 327', 460'. The first vein contained hard water and the last two fairly soft water. There were 350 feet of water in the well producing 2500 gallons per hour. It is said that the hole became crooked in the last few feet. Casing was lowered to the bottom. Some of this casing was afterwards removed. It was 6\", 5\" and 4\u00bd\" in diameter. This well afterwards partially filled with sand and was definitely abandoned.\n\nWell No. 2.\n\nDrilled within five feet of No. 1 in 1930 by the Contractors who built the school, for construction purposes, to the 96 foot vein. This produced very hard water and was not intended for permanent use by the School. It is at present used continuously when no water is available from No. 3, which is now nearly all of the time. It produces 2000 gallons per day. The school requires about 4000 gallons, and consequently must ration the water. They melt snow for soft water. The casing in this well is 6\" diameter throughout.\nAn analysis made January 3, 1933, by the Alberta Provincial Analyst indicated a hardness of 85.68 grains per gallon (St. Barnabas School Onion Lake, Sask., water contains 38 grains).\n\nWell No. 5.\n\nThis well was drilled to the 327 foot vein within 50 feet of the School, in August, 1931. The hole is 8 inches diameter with a 6\" casing throughout. The hole is straight. Water came up to within 92 feet of the surface, i.e. 235 feet of fairly soft water. All veins of No. 1 were struck at similar depths.\n\nThe water pipe is 3\" diameter. The Department had to go to the 327 foot vein to get sufficiently soft water. The analyst on January 3, 1933, found it to contain 14 grains per gallon.\n\n(a) Later Activities with Well No. 5.\n\nThe driller of Well No. 5, Mr. Frederickson, of St. Paul, Alta., was called in by W.E. Gullion, Indian Agent, to ascertain the reason for cessation of flow, on Nov. 5. He worked at various times until Christmas.\n\nWhen the well was finished, August 1931, he put 3 feet of average gravel in the casing. During the 14 succeeding months 40 feet of sand, similar to the sample which is being sent under separate cover, apparently came through the gravel into the casing. The sample being sent was gathered in the water and dried for transportation. It must have some silt as 2 hours are required for settling. It is not sand rock. This sand, as will be noticed, is very fine and would go through a 100 mesh screen or even finer. A sand point would not stop it. Any screen which would stop it would probably clog altogether. This sand is being pumped whenever the well is used.\nThe cylinder is 87 feet from the bottom of the well. The driller removed this sand at the beginning, November 5, by agitation with a baler. He then drilled through the 3 feet of gravel with an 1800 lb. bit. He then placed 10 feet of average gravel and stone into the casing. Apparently he stopped the water nearly altogether. However, after an interval he again drilled through the 10 feet of gravel, his drill becoming stuck twice in the last two feet. He finished by dumping in one pail of gravel. The water was evidently coming intermittently during these times, but the sand was always present in the pumped water, in suspension. In manipulating the pumpseeds and cylinder the rods broke. This is the condition of the well at the present time.\n\nOne of three things must have happened when drilling. Either the gravel was pulverized, driven below the end of the casing, or the lower ten feet or so of the casing is broken (6\" casing in an 8\" hole). However, the writer is assured that the last alternative is not probable.\n\nMr. Fredrickson, the driller, informed Father Angim that he had sent a report to this office containing a log of the well and an account of his activities but this report has not yet been received.\n\n(b) Solutions of the Problem.\n\nSeveral solutions were offered, as enumerated below.\n\nThe writer returned to Calgary on January 15. He has found since that it is exceedingly difficult to find anybody that has had experience in this sort of well trouble and who has a remedy. After several interviews with engineers, wholesale firms and well drillers, he found that a Mr. Nelson, Instructor at the Technical\nInstitute, had drilled many wells of this nature, in Northern Alberta. Pending receipt of Mr. Fredrickson's report, he offered a logical solution. This was afterwards corroborated by a former South Dakota driller who lives in Calgary and who has invented a pump for this kind of water trouble in which the leather cup washers are inverted and the water forced through a hollow pump rod.\n\nThe various solutions are as follows:\n\n**Father Angin's Solution**\n\nPurchase a 4 ton block and 40 feet of chain to lift out the rods if they break because of sand and to pull the cylinder. The accumulated sand could then be taken out by a baler, hand-operated. This could be done every 10 or 12 months and would occupy 5 or 6 days. He states that his own staff could do this work. However, it would constitute a permanent operation. It would cost about $200 for hand-operation, plus the cost of an engine which undoubtedly would have to be purchased for permanent operation, a total of $600.\n\n**Mr. Fredrickson's Solution**\n\nHe would sink another well in the immediate vicinity of No.3, to the same depth (387 feet) at a cost of about $900. This is also favoured to some extent by Mr. Gullion. Mr. Fredrickson does not want to touch the old well at all.\n\nA new well may develop the same trouble as before.\n\n**A solution considered by Mr. Gullion and the Writer**\n\nUse No. 2 (96' deep) with possibly another of the same depth near it and use a Zeolitic Water Softener, to soften the water. This water is very hard (86 grains\nper gallon) and a water softener would cost from $1200 to $1500 for 4000 gallons per day. It would be a sure solution of the difficulty. It is to be noted that the capacity of No.2 is 2000 gallons per day as far as proved.\n\nMr. Nelson's Solution\n\nRepair No.3 in the following manner:-\n\nRemove the Cylinder and pipe. Clean out the sand and gravel to the bottom of the casing - 527 feet. Attach sufficient pipe to lower the cylinder to the bottom of the well. Pump slowly steadily and incessantly for two or three days or more, night and day. The thickness of the water vein at 527', possibly consisting of the fine sand, is not known. It may be 6\" or one foot. The pump should never stop. The cylinder should be at the bottom to catch all sand as possibly only the finer sand is carried up at present by the cylinder 67 feet above the bottom. However, this incessant pumping should clear a space beneath and around the bottom of the casing and also for a distance vein itself. This would then act as a reservoir. If enough sand were pumped out it might never trouble the well again.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThis report is prepared pending receipt of Mr. Fredrickson's log and report and possible subsequent consultation with Mr. Nelson.\n\nIt is evident from the divergence of opinion and from the various interviews that the solution of the problem is difficult. The only feasible source of water for the school consists of one of the exposed veins and one of these must be developed.\n\nConsiderable consideration of the problem before taking action is warranted because of the cost of experi-\nA sample of the sand which comes from the well with the water is being sent under separate cover. This sand may or may not consist of the entire content of the vein, or the coarser sand may be at the bottom.\n\n(sgd) P.A. Fetterly  \nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n(sgd) O.H.

One would expect that, considering the number of deep wells which have been drilled in the west, some authoritative method would by this time be found, but two more expert opinions have been given, since the above was written. Mr. MacDonald, Toronto Engineer in charge of Construction of the Glenmore Dam, Calgary, considered that a form of \"air lift\" and settling tank could possibly be used.\n\nL. Michael, of Gleichen, when being consulted regarding the Old Sun School well on January 30, and who has had considerable experience, stated that he would use the baler, instead of lowering the cylinder and damaging it, to take out the water and sand. He prefers a short stroke for deep wells, and at any rate, a slower speed than is usual.\n\nQuick action is necessary as a letter has been received from Father Angin stating that \"the well is not fixed up and we have not sufficient water with the shallow well.

Johnston,\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: File 41167 - W.\n\nI have your letter of February 6th in reference to difficulties encountered in drilling for water at the Blue Quills Indian School near St. Paul, Alberta, and sample of sand from No. 3 well.\n\nThe difficulty of fine sand and silt coming with the water and plugging the well has been met with at many places in the prairie Provinces, and in other regions. H.E. Simpson, State water geologist of North Dakota states in a recent report that \"it is not an exaggeration to say that thousands of holes (in North Dakota) have been abandoned and hundreds of thousands of dollars lost through the inability of the drillers to secure water in ample amounts from fine sand deposits in which the water occurred in abundance. Even after wells have been finished and enough water apparently secured, the life of other thousands of these wells has been brief due to the infiltration of the fine sand, the clogging of the screens, the filling of the pipes, and the cutting out of the valves in the pumps. If the problem of securing this water through proper drilling and finishing of these wells can be solved, it will be not only a great financial saving, but also a great material benefit to the people of the state by reason of better water supplies.\"\n\nThe method proposed by Mr. Nelson, namely cleaning out of the well and pumping sand and water sufficiently long to clear a space around the bottom of the casing, is the one commonly adopted. As much of the material is fine enough to be carried in suspension in the water I doubt whether the method would be successful except temporarily. A method used by the Kelly Well Company, the Layne Canadian and other large well drilling concerns might be successful, but would be very expensive. A large outside casing is put down to the water sand and fine gravel placed between it and the screen at the lower part of the inside smaller casing. The outer casing is then withdrawn and a filling placed around the inner casing. A modification of this scheme by using two small casings with a screen on the inner one and gravel between the two at the water sand might be tried. A very fine screen would be required and it is doubtful whether it would not become plugged.\n\nA sieve analysis of the sand is as follows; probably the sand in place is somewhat coarser;\n\n| Plus 0.1 mm. | 38 |\n|--------------|----|\n| 0.1/0.05 mm. | 14 |\n| Minus 0.05 mm. | 50 per cent |\n\nThe sample is, therefore, fine grained. A little of the plus 0.1 mm. portion is retained on a 0.2 mm. sieve. The grains are subangular.\nIn connection with the plan favoured by Mr. Fetterly, namely using No. 2 well, which seems to be the most feasible scheme, it may be advisable to find out whether there is a screen in the well and if not whether a screen would increase the water supply. This would depend upon the thickness and character of the water sand. If it is proposed to soften the water a fairly complete analysis of the water should be made; some hard waters can be softened by the Zeolite exchange silicate process whereas others cannot. Analyses are made by some of the firms handling water softeners.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) W.A. Johnston.\n\nWAJ/AHC\nREPORT\n\non\n\nThe Well Situation\n\nat\n\nBlue Quills Indian School\n\nby\n\nP.A. Fetterly\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nI. Introduction.\n\nA letter was sent to the Director, dated April 22nd, 1935, stating that the writer was proceeding to St. Paul immediately to make an inspection of difficulties which had been mentioned in the wire and telephone conversation with Mr. W.E. Gullion, Indian Agent, and Mr. J.E. Fredrickson, driller. These men were interviewed on April 26 and 26.\n\nII. Mr. Fredrickson's Activities.\n\nIt was ascertained that the new 3\" piping, rods and cylinder had been placed in the well, the bottom of the 6\" casing being at the 326 foot level. The water vein being utilized runs from 325 feet to 327 feet, i.e., 4' thick, with the casing one foot from the bottom of the sand vein. A stratum of clay lies under this vein.\n\nMr. Fredrickson stated that when he started to work the first time, i.e., about November 1, 1932, the accumulation of sand in the 6\" casing was 40 feet thick. He, of course, stopped working about December 25. When he began again about April 15, 1933, he found 24 feet of sand, the accumulation of 3\u00bd months. This sand was so dense that he had to drill through it.\ninstead of simply baling it out. This, of course, all took place in the lower 24 feet of the 6\" casing, and occupied about half a day. He then lowered the cylinder and pumped water and mud (please note that it seemed to be mud rather than sand, but was similar to the samples which were obtained by the writer on January 10 and sent to Ottawa), for 2\u00bd hours.\n\nIt then stuck solid and the pump stopped because of the resistance at the end of that time. He then removed the 3\" piping and cylinder, about 3 hours' work. He then had to drill the sand out again and bail out until the water became fairly clear but not as clear as it was 2 years ago when he first drilled it. Three days were occupied in this one operation. The sand appears to almost actually shoot up to a depth of several feet within a few minutes.\n\nThis operation was repeated three times, each time there being 10' or 12' of sand in the casing accumulated within a few hours or less. The last two times he could only pump 15 or 20 minutes, before the cylinder froze. He had to extract pipe, rods and cylinder every time he cleaned it. When he had tried this for three times he decided that it was wasted effort and advised Mr. Gullion, on April 28, to communicate with Calgary office, stating that the \"Nelson plan\" had proved unsatisfactory.\n\nIII. Cause of Troubles\n\nMr. Fredrickson believes that the trouble is caused by the fact that the lower 20 feet of casing, or a certain length of it has been ruptured by the continuous\ndrilling and pounding and that the \"mud\" in the water comes from the clay stratum immediately above the water sand vein as it is much finer than the original water vein sand. This is problematical. He claims that when he finished the well two years ago, he advised that the pump be started immediately and pumping continued until all sand has disappeared from the water. He believes that this was not done and was the cause of the present trouble. He also states that a well should always be pumped immediately after it is finished to clear it and that if this is not done trouble is liable to ensue. Mr. Nelson agrees with this fact.\n\nIV. Fredrickson's Cure\n\nMr. Fredrickson is of the opinion that a new well should be driven about 50 or 40 feet away from the present well. He claims that under certain conditions he will guarantee a free flowing well, if he be allowed to plan it and to pump until clearing as soon as finished. He states that a well cannot be allowed to stand as it will deteriorate.\n\nHe would not place the cylinder at the bottom of the well as in the present experiment. He drilled a well for the St. Paul Flour Mill, two miles to the east, 360 feet deep, and kept it going for a month. This water is rather harder than that of the School well.\n\nHe thought of inserting a 5\" casing inside the 6\" casing, for the full distance with a screen on the bottom but if the 5\" casing were ruptured mud would still\nenter to the cylinder.\n\nHe claims that he cannot clean the well with the baler as the water stays muddy continuously. Mr. Nelson and Mr. Fredrickson agree on the system of continuous pumping and the latter states that this should have been done at the beginning as it cannot be done now because of the nature of the sediment, as explained above, they only being able to pump for a few minutes at each operation before cleaning the cylinder and pipe.\n\nV. Log of Well\n\nThe log of the present well, No.5, is not now available, but the log of Well No. 1, drilled by J.G. Douglas, 11706-87th St. Edmonton, in 1929, has been given as follows (this well is 300 ft. west of No. 1 and of the School):\n\n- Yellow Clay 0' - 30'\n- Blue Clay 30' - 100' - Very Hard water vein at 98'.\n- Hard blue clay 100' - 120'\n- Blue Clay and Many Boulders 120' - 198'\n- Clay & Gravel 198' - 228' Hard water at 207'\n- Sand 228' - 298'\n- \"Soft water\" sand 298' - 330' Softer water at 324' (Clay 2')\n- Fine Sand 330' - 360'\n- Coarse Sand 360' - 370'\n- Fin. Sand 370' - 390'\nRiver Sand 590' - 410'\nSand mud\nQuicksand, gravel\nand clay 420' - 461' bottom of well,\nsoft water.\n\nVI. Notes.\n\nA considerable amount of gravel has been placed at different times in the well for straining purposes. This gravel and the sand have been drilled through or pushed down or outwards at various times. It is difficult to estimate the exact or approximate condition of the bottom of the well and 6\" casing.\n\nThe present pump should deliver 350 to 500 gallons per hour and the present well should produce this amount if in good order. This amount would be sufficient for all school purposes.\n\nVII. Observations.\n\nFor the first time the writer has had an opportunity of observing Mr. Fredrickson. He has been drilling wells for 14 years and consequently has a considerable amount of experience in this work. He appears to be quite anxious to obtain water and, in the writer's opinion has done what he could. Mr. Gardner-Smith recommended him in the beginning with apparently good reason after making enquiries.\n\nThe writer, together with Mr. Gullion and Father Angin, and afterwards, with Mr. Fredrickson consulted today regarding the matter, and, allowing for\nlimited knowledge on the part of all but the latter, came to the conclusion that the only solution they could see was to drill another well 20' or 30' to the west, with all of the precautions gained in the experience of drilling No. 3.\n\nWhile awaiting definite instructions from Ottawa on the matter, Mr. Fredrickson has been instructed to make one more attempt. This consists in beginning with a clear casing as far as may be known, then pour in a few feet of gravel, say 5 or 4 feet, then insert the pump and test the efficiency of the screening. If sand is still found to come through, place one or more feet of gravel and try again. In this way an exact amount of gravel to stop the sand but not too much to stop the water may be found. If this fails then no other method is known to the writer. One considers that the limit for experimentation has been nearly reached in the present well. The cost will soon approximate that for a new well if not stopped. Mr. Fredrickson guarantees a new well under certain conditions which are not difficult, and are principally concerned with the cost.\n\nThe water question is more serious to the School than ever because the snow - which has been their principal source of soft water - has disappeared. Laundry conditions are deplorable and the hard water is affecting the water pipes. Father Angin is exceedingly anxious and urged the writer to wire to Ottawa for an immediate answer and authority to proceed.\nMr. Fredrickson's presence on the work increases the cost every day he is there, consequently early instructions are imperative. It is obviously impossible for the writer to be in constant attendance at the School to check up the activities.\n\nMr. Nelson, on April 28, proposed one last attempt to save the well. This plan was to drill a further 40 feet below the casing, then lower a charge of 4 sticks of dynamite 15' below the casing to produce a cavity into which the sand surrounding the bottom could run, if it will not come up by pumping. This was found to be impossible because the sand runs into the drilled hole as fast as drilled and packs there. To hold it, the casing would have to be driven through the water vein and thus cut off the supply.\n\nVIII. Cost Estimate.\n\nIt is estimated that a new well, together with an underground gallery 20 feet long, extending the present one would cost about $1300 or $1400. This would include casing, drilling and extension of the basement. The recently purchased material would be utilized.\n\nIX. Addendum.\n\nThe writer has just witnessed the baling of the well. The water obtained in the bailer contains at a rough estimate about 5% of fine sand and mud. This settles in 10 minutes to a muddy appearing opaque water with much sediment on the bottom of the can. The remainder clears fairly well in about 2 or 3 hours indicating that clay is present. A sample of the sediment was obtained and dried. It is similar to that obtained in January.\nI. Conclusion.\n\nA perusal of this report, prepared at the School, will convey to the reader all that is known by the writer regarding the well situation. Suggestions have been made as to possible procedure. It is with a great deal of hesitation that one recommends another well as the expense of obtaining water has already been great, but it is the only solution to the writer's knowledge.\n\nP.A. FETTERLY,\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nDated at St. Paul, Alta., April 26, 1935.\n\n(sgd) O.H. Hoover,\nEngineer-in-Charge.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau\n\nCalgary, Alta., June 14, 1935.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian School Well Situation.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr. Fetterly of this staff visited the above named School on June 9th to examine Well No. 3 and to prepare the accounts of J.E. Fredrickson and Father Angin for payment. These are attached to another letter of even date.\n\nHe found that Well No. 3 is working satisfactorily. Father Angin is satisfied, providing the water is not too hard. The present capacity is limited by the capacity of the pump. This pump is rated at 600 gallons per hour but on test produced about 500 gallons. The well as at present conditioned would probably produce upwards of 1000 gallons per hour if the pump could handle it. Plenty of water is now available for the School.\n\nMr. Fredrickson, as a last resort, on the advice of Mr. Gullion and on previous suggestion by Mr. Fetterly, exploded two charges of dynamite of three sticks each, at different times; one at 200 feet and the other at 200 feet. The water, presumably from the \"200 ft. seam\" arose to within 45 feet from the surface of the ground at the time. It was still at that point on June 9th. The cylinder is 100 feet from the surface. The water has been coming since May 20th with no apparent diminution. The School needs 4000 to 5000 gallons per day. There are at present 130 people. If the school filled the number would be 185.\n\nThere is no means of knowing whether the well will be a permanent producer. Only time will answer this. At any rate, three quart jars of water were obtained by Mr. Fetterly. He allowed the pump to activate for some time before collecting the water directly from the well. The original sample from this vein indicated 50 grains per gallon of hardness. There is a strong possibility that the present water is too hard for plumbing and boilers. This can only be found on analysis.\n\nI am therefore sending you a sample of the water collected on June 9th. I will send another sample to the University of Alberta for analysis. The third sample will be retained for possible future use of a manufacturer of Water Softeners.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nYou will note that a sand sediment is present. This was not noted at the time of collection, although the water was very slightly discoloured.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, paragraph 5, I might state that we were very anxious regarding the expense which was being incurred in attempting to clean out the well but could see no other solution except to attempt rehabilitating Well No. 3 as authorized by you and while awaiting authority to begin another well if efforts were useless. Mr. Fredrickson was on the ground with his outfit and continued his attempts. As a result he has now obtained water, although of unknown hardness. The cost has been much less than was anticipated by this office.\n\nAs will be noted, no expense has been incurred since May 20, due to Mr. Fredrickson's expressed unwillingness to add to the already high cost of obtaining water. Mr. Fredrickson has been very reasonable throughout.\n\nWith regard to the 4th paragraph of the same letter I might explain that the present well is situated in a 6' x 6' concrete \"tunnel\" extending at right angles for about 30 feet from the boiler room. The top of the tunnel, consisting of concrete is at the surface of the ground. The greater portion of this tunnel is occupied by the pressure tank. The end of the tunnel farthest from the building contains the pump and well No. 3 in a space 4' x 6' x 6'.\n\nIt was proposed to extend this space for 60 feet further for the proposed new well in order to get away from the influence of Well No. 3.\n\nIn order to save expense it was proposed that the chamber for the new well at the end of the new tunnel 60' from the building would have been 6' x 6' x 6' with a narrow gallery for pipes connecting with the old one to minimize excavation and concrete. The alternative method would be to construct a house above the new well. This was considered to be more expensive than an extended tunnel. This new gallery and tunnel would have been at the same elevation as the original, the top being at the surface of the ground.\n\nMr. Fetterly is of the opinion that the matter can be left in status quo at present until the well has proved itself or until the necessity for a water softener is evident from analysis of the samples which have been secured.\n\nIt is to be acknowledged that the very small\nquantity of fine sand in the sample submitted is rather disturbing but this may disappear on continued use of the well, although it may also gradually fill up the pipes below the cylinder or collect in the pressure tanks on settling. The results of this particular difficulty will be found later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) O.H.

Letters from this office dated May 30, June 5, 14 and 15, and July 4, the latter containing copies of the chemical analysis, were sent the Director fully covering the well situation.\n\nA final visit was made on July 20 in connection with vouchers.\n\nCONDITION OF WATER SUPPLY\n\nThe well was found to be working properly and is producing sufficient water for all purposes. This water is rather hard, as shown by the analysis, but the School Engineer, in the absence of Father Angin, stated that it was \"pretty good, although a little hard\". A letter from the Director, dated July 17, stated that \"no funds were available at the present time for the installation of a water softener and that so long as the water supply remains\nadequate as to quantity, no further action will be taken at this time\".\n\nThe matter of a softener will thus remain in abeyance as long as conditions are as at present.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nReferring to Mr. MacKenzie's letter of 11th ultimo, File 115-1-5, Ref. 128247 W, last paragraph, there should be no further expenditure at this school for Water Supply.\n\n(sgd) P.A.

Mr. Hoover is, however, being written to submit a report as soon as there is an opportunity for Mr. Fetterly to make a visit to this school and hold a conference with the Agent with regard to the matter in question as suggested in Mr. Hoover's letter of the 8th ultimo.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of the 12th ultimo and with regard to the last paragraph of such memorandum, I am attaching hereto for your reference copies made of certain reports on the files of the Controller of the Dominion Water and Hydrometric Bureau.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

It has now been arranged to have Mr. Fetterly visit the school as soon as possible and confer with the Principal and yourself regarding the best course of action to take.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nReport on\nNew Well at Blue Quills Indian School\nSt. Paul, Alberta,\n\nby\nP.A. Betterly\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\n\nPursuant to instructions dated May 14, a visit was made to the above named school on May 16, 1936, where a conference was held with J.E. Fredrickson, driller, and Father Allard regarding details of a new well to replace the one now in use.\n\n2. Previous History.\n\nThree wells have been drilled, one at 460 feet to soft water, but the well was never used apparently through immediate non-use; one to 107 feet which was too hard; one at 327 feet which could not be used; while the last attempt, made in about 1935, was to explode a charge in the last-named well at 200 feet in an attempt to use it.\n\nTo recapitulate, there are four senses of water:\na. 98' entirely too hard for any use,\nb. 200' very hard but used for the past several years through rupturing the casing with dynamite,\nc. 327' a softer water which could be used but through apparent misuse at the time of drilling became useless because of sand,\nd. 460' a soft water which can not be used because of the mixture of fine sand and mud.\n\n(Note. This recapitulation is from memory as this report is being prepared in the field.) It is the\nthird seam which Mr. Fredrickson proposes to develop with the proposed new well.\n\n3. Proposals.\n\nThe pressure tank is housed in a basement with no superstructure above ground which lies for a distance of 21 feet at right angles to the main building (westward), and 10 feet wide. The pump basement extends a further 11 ft. westward from the end of the tank basement. Thus, the two structures are continuous in every way and extend for 33 feet westward from the main building, with a wall between pierced by a door.\n\nIt is proposed to add a further basement 10 feet wide and 8' long to the present pump house which is 6 feet high. The new well would thus be about 7 feet west of the present well.\n\nA plan can be prepared on the writer's return to the office but it is not essential as the structure is simple, consequently the work can go ahead without it if necessary.\n\nMr. Fredrickson proposes to tap the 327' seam which consists of fairly soft water although a screen may have to be used to keep the sand out. This is not certain yet. He wants to handle the matter according to his best judgment and according to the knowledge gained of the strata through the logs of the other drillers (He did not drill the wells but tried to rehabilitate No.3 well). He is a reliable driller and anxious to make a success of the matter after the failures of other drillers in the past.\n\nHe wants to pump immediately after striking water\nand to a sufficient length of time to prove the well. He also wishes to test the water for hardness before finally passing on it.\n\n4. Materials on hand and to be purchased.\n\n(a) Pump.\n\nThe present pump can be used. It is a Beatty self-oiling Deep-well Head, Page 1429-VM, in No. 4 Catalogue of Beatty Bros. It is a good durable pump. It will have to be disconnected from the present well for a day or two to prove the proposed well, then moved back again to supply the School for a short time till the new well is finished, and then finally moved to the new well. These three changes will cost $30.\n\n(b) Concrete basement.\n\nThis will be 10' x 8' x 6' high with 8\" walls, and Father Allard, who has had considerable experience with concrete construction, will attend to construction of this structure after the well is finished and will charge us for the cement and labor. It will thus be inexpensive. The cost will be about $100. (The west side of the present well basement consists of brick). To be built after well is proved.\n\n(c) Casing.\n\nA total length of 327 feet of 5\" inserted casing will be needed and it will have to be on the site before drilling is commenced according to Mr. Fredrickson. At $90.00 wholesale the total cost will be $322.10. Mr. Fredrickson can supply this material wholesale if allowed to do so.\n\n(d) Well Pans.\n\nThere are at present on the ground 8-20 foot lengths of 3\" plugged and waxed pipe, available for use. There are also 60' in the present well. A further length of 40 feet of 3\" p & r pipe will then be needed, or a total length of 260 feet. Thus 40 feet at $92.51 per hundred feet will cost $37.00.\n\n(e) Rods.\n\nThere are 94 feet of 1-3/8\" octagonal rods on the site and 60 feet more in the present well. Thus, 106 feet more are needed at a cost of $5 per foot or a total cost of $37.10.\n\n(f) Working Barrel.\n\nThere is a new 36\" x 2\u00bd\" working barrel at the\nschool and purchased by the school a year ago in an attempt to rehabilitate the present well. The plunger was used and is not likely to be in good condition. A new plunger will cost about $20.\n\n(g) Screen\n\nA screen may or may not be needed depending on quality of sand. Its length depends on the depth of sand water stratum. The length will probably be 5' to 7' but the cost per foot is not available at present (in the field).\n\n(h) Cost of Drilling.\n\nMr. Fredrickson's price for drilling will be $1.75 per foot for the first 180 feet and $2.00 per foot thereafter, that is, to 327 feet. The total cost will therefore be as follows:\n\n| Feet     | Cost   |\n|----------|--------|\n| 180 feet | $315.00|\n| 147 \"    | $294.00|\n\nTotal cost of drilling $609.00\n\nThe exact footage may vary slightly.\n\n5. Recapitulation of Cost.\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Pump (shifting)               | $30.00 |\n| Concrete basement             | $100.00|\n| Casing, 6 inserted wholesale  | $322.10|\n| Well pipe, 13\" p & r.         | $37.00 |\n| Rods                          | $37.10 |\n| Plunger for working barrel    | $20.00 |\n| Screen                        | ?      |\n| Drilling 327'                 | $609.00|\n\nTotal $1155.20\n\nAdd 10% for contingencies $155.00\n\nTotal estimate $1310.20\n\n6. Time Element.\n\nThere are two reasons for immediate action:\n(a) Condition of the whole plumbing system.\n\nThe tubes of the boilers were examined superficially and are obviously in a bad state. A bill for $100 was incurred a short time ago in repairing the back end and it is not known when any portion of the $15,000 pumping system of the school may fail. The hard water in present use is very bad on the system and works fast in disintegrating the material. For instance, one result to be feared is that the expected soft water of the proposed new well may dissolve any scale already located inside the pipes and expose the material to new disintegration. This is merely given as an illustration of the possible extent of damage to the inside of the boiler pipes, pressure tank, conducting pipes, radiators, etc.\n\nThe writer performed ablutions in water too thick to see through, of a reddish brown colour. (Descriptions and analyses have already been reported).\n\nIt is obvious that, when the boiler pipes burst some time ago, that other results will probably follow soon.\n\nThus for this reason alone haste is necessary.\n\n(b) Mr. Fredrickson's Movements.\n\nHe stated that he would be in St. Paul until not later than May 30. He is then moving to another part of the province to do some C.P.R. work. He will be busy until that date at St. Paul but couldn't wait longer. After that date he would have to be brought back at a certain cost.\n\nHe is a reliable man with good reputation for conscientious work and in fact is the only active driller known to the writer in the north country.\nFor these two reasons I would recommend that instructions be issued for immediate beginning of the work, i.e., within the next ten days.\n\n7. Mr. Fredrickson's Guarantee\n\nHe guarantees sufficient water to supply school if he is allowed to carry out activities according to his own ideas after the drilling is done; e.g., pumping continuously for a time at the expense of the Department, and other minor matters. He is ready to accept half the cost of drilling plus cost of moving the pump three times ($30.00), with the balance at the end of 12 months, as an actual fact it is supposed by the writer that the whole cost will be paid in a reasonable time after finishing the well. He also wished to have the water analysed although he believes the 327' seam will be suitable.\n\nP.A. Fitterly\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nSt. Paul, Alberta, May 17, 1938.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Blue Quills Indian Residential School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nWith regard to the above and further to my memorandum of the 16th instant a report prepared by Mr. Fetterly of Mr. Hoover's office in Calgary is attached.\n\nIn forwarding this report Mr. Hoover makes no comments with regard to same in his covering letter. It will be noted, however, from Mr. Fetterly's report that apparently the best thing to do under the circumstances is to drill a new well. Mr. Fetterly does not give any guarantee, however, as to results but Mr. Fredrickson, a local driller, apparently feels quite sure that if he is given the job of drilling this well and allowed to use his own methods of cleaning out the sand, etc., that suitable water can be obtained.\n\nIt is proposed to drill a new well close to a previously drilled well that struck water at a depth of about 327 feet. Apparently this water was reasonably satisfactory, but through an unfortunate number of circumstances in connection with the handling of the well after drilling, it has never been possible to use same although an effort has unsuccessfully already been made to rehabilitate the well in question. It will be noted that Mr. Fetterly's total estimated cost for all the work involved is roughly $1800.00, and this is therefore the amount which would have to be provided by the Indian Affairs Branch in accordance with Dr. McGillivray's memorandum to you of the 9th instant before work can be started.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Fetterly's report that he feels that this work should be started as soon as possible as continuing to use the present water is likely to cause further trouble and repair expenditure in connection with the plumbing section at this school.\n\nI would be glad to have a decision with regard to the undertaking of this work and also with reference to having Mr. Fredrickson do the work, providing it is decided to drill a new well.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

It would appear from this report that Mr. Fetterly does not feel able to guarantee a sufficient supply of water by the building of a new well but that it is the opinion of Mr. Fredrickson, a driller who has had experience in the locality, that the chances are very good.\n\nI should be glad to have your decision as early as possible in order that Mr. Hoover may be advised to proceed with the work. It is noted that the total estimated cost is $1,300.\n\nApproval is being asked to have Mr. Fredrickson undertake the work if you decide that it should be carried out.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are no doubt aware an engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch has recently visited the Blue Quills Indian Residential School in connection with the water supply.\n\nAfter carefully considering the water situation it has been decided that the best course to take would be to dig a new well. The approximate cost of this will be $1300.00 and the Surveys & Engineering Branch is being requested to proceed with this work as soon as possible.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of March 18 we provided $400.00 in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 for repairs and improvements at the Blue Quills School. However, in view of the necessity for having a good water supply this amount will have to be used toward the cost of the new well and you should, therefore, inform the Principal that the Department regrets that it will not be possible to consider any other expenditure at the Blue Quills School this year other than the well. The Department trusts that the Principal and staff of the Blue Quills Residential School will co-operate with the well driller. I understand that it is the driller's intention to pump the new well continuously for a time after it has been completed. It is expected that the school staff will comply with any suggestions made by the driller or the engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. E.

While we did not provide such a large amount in our current year's appropriation for this school we have a small item in our appropriation which was unallotted and the necessary funds can be obtained.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate if you would issue instructions for this work to commence as soon as possible and on receipt of application from you I will arrange to have an amount of $1300.00 transferred to your Branch.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nSaddle Lake, Alta., June 17, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report for the month of May 1938.\n\nOne of the boilers at the Blue Quill's school developed leaks and arrangements are under way to have the boilers inspected by a boiler inspector.\n\nW.

It will however, be noted that the total amount of money required, according to this latter estimate, is $1,391.00. In this connection, however, it will be noted that there is one item in Mr. Hoover's breakdown of costs namely, one well screen $110.00, which he states may or may not be required. If this item is not required the new estimate of course would be covered by the original $1,500.00. It is recommended in this connection however, that Mr. Hoover be instructed that expenditure is to be limited to $1,500.00 if at all possible.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is assumed it is now in order to proceed with having this well drilled and in this connection, I would refer you to your memorandum of the 13th ultimo in which you advised that the approval of the Minister had been asked for the employment of Mr. Fredrickson in the drilling of this well. I would be glad to be advised if it will be in order to engage Mr. Fredrickson as driller.

This money is intended to cover the cost of digging a new well at the Blue Quills School.\n\nFor some time past, the water situation at this school has been causing us serious concern, and a recent survey made by the Surveys and Engineering Branch indicates that the only possible solution is to dig a new well.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnis\nActing Director\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS\nMECHANICAL BRANCH\n\nH. G. ALEXANDER,\nBOILER INSPECTOR,\nNO. 10,\nVEGGERVILLE, ALTA.\n\n18th July 1938\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlberta.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn compliance with your request, I inspected the boilers at the blue Quill's Indian Residential School, St Paul, Alberta.\n\nI found that one of these boilers (A)9556 was leaking in the firebox, at the tubes, and at the stay bolts of the lower tube sheet, also the lower rows of stays of side sheets in firebox, four rows high from firegrate. I had all the tubes in firebox expanded, and these stood the water test of 45 lbs., without undue leakage, should these give trouble when boiler is fired up; it would mean that these tubes would require to be renewed, owing to the ends having been overheated, thereby losing their tensile strength.\n\nThe covering will require to be removed from throat sheet and outer casing side sheets to permit of stays being tightened, it looks to me as though the tube ends and stays were cooled off suddenly, say by water being thrown into firebox and striking them, when there was a hot fire on grates, rather than by shortness of water in boiler, my reason for this is, that the crown sheet and upper rows of stays, in side sheets, do not show any sign of being damaged, which naturally they would have shown a shortness of water in boiler, at the time the damage occurred, also the other end of tubes would have shown leakages as well.\n\nI understand that there was no regular fireman on the premises at the time the accident to boiler took place, and I could not get any authentic account of the occurrence.\n\nAt time of my visit the general appearance of the boiler room gave the impression that there was no one giving it much attention, the floor was in a more or less littered condition, with coal and ashes lying around in odd places, the main sewer was\nchoked, so we had to depend on the small auxiliary opening when emptying the boilers. I was informed that sometimes during the winter this sewer freezes up, and does not open up again till towards the end of July or sometimes in August; this could be remedied somewhat by installing an electric pump, and making a sump in the floor.\n\nI was informed that the return piping gave trouble last winter, rusted away, when renewing them the level of the piping was lowered, at the present level, a non-return valve is required, this to be installed in return line to each boiler, with the present stop valve, that is in line between it and the boiler, there is also a cross connecting pipe running between the two boilers, this takes care of return water from heater for heating water for the building, this pipe should be connected to main return pipes, on the building side of non-return valves, that is with non-return and stop valves between connection & boilers, this would prevent the water from moving from one boiler to the other should there be any variance of the pressures in the boilers from whatever cause.\n\nThe fire grates to be moved from place, plates freed from rust and a good boiler paint used to paint the plates, this should be done every year on all three boilers, to counteract any tendency of plates corroding.\n\nOne tube requires to be renewed on Boiler (A)9557, this tube gave out during test, a pit hole developed on the underside of tube had eaten through.\n\nOn looking over the domestic water supply installation for building, I found that there was considerable leakage of water past pump rod and packing gland, requires new packing in stuffing box, I could not locate any safety valve on piping from pump to storage tank, there should be one on system to take care of overpressure, so that there is less likelihood of the tank or piping giving out, at present the only devise taking care of this is the electric stopping and starting switch for the electric motor of pump.\n\nIt would be advisable in the summer months that certain routine work be carried out, which cannot very well be done when the heating system is in operation, such as repairs to pipe lines, grinding in or\nor replacing valves on boilers, water lines, steam lines throughout the building, there is also the pump to be attended to, as well as the lighting system. I would mention here that to comply with the boilers Act and regulations, a certificated man is required to look after the high pressure boiler when it is in use; this man should also be able to undertake such repairs as I have mentioned above.\n\nThe domestic water supply to buildings appears to be somewhat troublesome to the piping; it looks as though there is some iron in it; it comes out of the pipes fairly red if the valve has been closed for any length of time; there is not much scale forming material init judging from the inside of boilers, where it leaves a slight deposit of reddish sludge; it has a tendency to cause a pitting action on the underside of tubes and the lower parts of the interior of boilers.\n\nA separate blow down valve should be installed for the heating boilers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.G. Alexander,\nBoiler Inspector.\nATTENTION: Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nRe: Condition of boilers, Blue Quills Residential School, Saddle Lake Agency: (See Paragraph 2, Page 2, of my report No. 407-11A dated Feb. 8, 1938, re Water Supply, Blue Quills Res. School:\n\n---\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that when at the above school with Agent Gullion on May 25th, last, I looked at these boilers, which were reported as being in bad condition. It was then decided that Agent Gullion ask the Provincial Boiler Inspector to make a thorough examination and report on the matter, which has now been done.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of the said report and would ask that steps be taken to overhaul these boilers at once while the children are away on vacation. To do this work properly will necessitate engaging a competent mechanic, and I would ask that Agent Gullion be instructed to have the whole lay-out checked over, with a view of ascertaining the approximate cost of properly repairing same, and report to the Department, when authority could be granted and the work proceeded with. No doubt a mechanic would have to be brought out from Edmonton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the condition of the boilers at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. You may arrange for having these boilers examined but it should be understood that we can only consider making the repairs that are absolutely necessary. Consequently, when forwarding an estimate of the cost of fixing the boilers only the urgent repairs should be considered.\n\nI carefully read the report submitted by the boiler inspector Mr. Alexander and it would appear from this that he is under the impression that the mechanical plant at Blue Quills School is not receiving the attention that it should. In this connection I quote the following extractions from his report:\n\n\"I understand that there was no regular fireman on the premises at the time the accident to the boiler took place, and I could not get any authentic account of the occurrence.\"\n\n\"To comply with the boilers Act and regulations, a certificated man is required to look after the high pressure boiler when it is in use, this man should also be able to undertake such repairs as I have mentioned above.\"\n\nI know you will agree with me that it is most important that all equipment at Indian Residential Schools is properly supervised and I trust you will take up this matter with the Principal at once and be in a position to advise us within the next month that the school management\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nhave made the necessary arrangements for a qualified man to look after the mechanical equipment at the Blue Quills School during the coming academic year which starts on September 1.\n\nIn the first part of this letter you were requested to only consider the very necessary repairs to the boiler. The reason for this is that we have recently authorized the digging of a new well at the Blue Quills School and the cost of this will more than exceed the amount which we found it possible to specifically provide in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Blue Quills School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTRANSFER BETWEEN ALLOTMENTS\n\nT.

In this connection, I would refer to the report of Mr. Alexander, Boiler Inspector, in which he makes the following remarks in the second paragraph\u2014\"I had all the tubes in firebox expanded, and these stood the test of 45 lbs. without undue leakage; should these give trouble when boiler is fired up, it would mean that these tubes would require to be renewed, owing to the ends having been overheated, thereby losing their tensile strength\".\n\nBeing uncertain as to the exact condition of the tubes, I made arrangements to have these as well as the other requirements checked by Mr. Jeffery Dubois, engineer, on the 13th. One of the tubes was taken out and a light inserted. Most of the tubes were found to be badly pitted from corrosion and it is considered that they would not stand steam pressure for any length of time. For your information, I am forwarding to the Department a parcel containing a portion of one of the tubes taken out of the boiler at the school. It will be seen from this that the tubes are in poor condition to stand the continuous steam pressure that will be necessary as soon as colder weather sets in and they would no doubt give out before the winter is over. Should leakages develop during cold weather, further damage might be caused, in which case, repairs would no doubt prove expensive.\n\nIf the Department approves, Mr. Jeffery Dubois of St. Paul, Alta., offers to do the necessary repair work at the rate of sixty cents per hour. Mr. Alexander informed me that Mr. Dubois is a very capable engineer and he has the necessary working equipment on hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Hoover,\nEngineer-in-Charge\nDepartment of Interior, Calgary\n\nHAVE DRILLED DEPTH TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE FEET CLOSING OFF NINETY FIVE AND TWO HUNDRED FOOT VEIN WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY STOP RISK TOO GREAT TO DRILL FURTHER WITH PRESENT CASING WATER FOLLOWS CASING RUINING SOFT WATER VEIN AT THREE TWENTY SEVEN STOP ADVISE PLACING SECOND STRING TO COMPLETE STOP REQUIRE AUTHORITY FOR SAME WIRE REPLY\n\nJ.E. Frederickson\nDriller.\nBlue Quills Indian School.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the new well at the above-named school I am enclosing a telegram received this morning from J.E. Fredericksen, driller. As a consequence I immediately phoned him for the purpose of determining definitely why it was necessary to insert a second string of casing, (4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" as suggested in the wire, into the present 5\" casing.\n\nMr. Fredericksen explained that the 5 inch casing which is at present in the well will very shortly penetrate a sand formation and by experience of the last few days drilling he is convinced that it would be practically impossible to shut off the water at the ninety five and two hundred foot levels if the 5 inch casing was carried further and into this sand streak. With great difficulty the water at ninety five and two hundred foot levels has now been completely shut off and as the purpose of the well is to shut off the flow of the extremely hard water from two seams it was decided to allow Mr. Fredericksen to run a second and new string of 4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch casing and not to further disturb the present 5 inch string which is at the present time completely sealing off the water veins as above mentioned. This will increase the cost of the well to the extent of the cost of additional casing but under the circumstances and if the softer water is obtained in the lower veins the additional cost will be wholly justified.\n\nThis unforeseen expenditure could not be avoided and is hereby recommended for approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) O.H. Hoover.\n\nEngineer-in-Charge.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nSurveying & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School Water Supply\n\nYou will recall that your memorandum of July 21st last advised that $1300.00 was being provided by the Indian Affairs Branch for the drilling of a well at the above school. This work has been in progress and a copy of a letter with reference to same received from Mr. Hoover along with copy of a wire received by Mr. Hoover from the driller are attached. Under the circumstances, as given in this correspondence, it would appear that although an increase in the original estimated cost of the well will result, Mr. Hoover's recommendation for the running of a second and new string of 4\u00bd\" casing so as not to disturb the present 5\" string is in order and his recommendation is therefore concurred in.\n\nI would be glad to have your approval so that a suitable wire may be sent Mr. Hoover.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School Water Supply\n\nI have your memorandum of the 13th instant with reference to the above project and have asked Mr. Hoover to forward a statement of expenditure already made and also to give an estimate of total cost.\n\nIn this same connection I may say that I am now in receipt of a further letter from Mr. Hoover in which he advises that according to information supplied him by Mr. Fredrickson, it may be necessary to buy new equipment for this well not originally intended, such as new pump head and new pump rods, as well as approximately 100 feet of new pipe for the pump.\n\nMr. Hoover did not give any estimate of the expected cost of this equipment, but I have now requested him to give us an estimate of the cost of same.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School, Water Supply.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of the 17th ultimo with regard to the above, a report has now been received from Mr. Hoover giving detailed information regarding expenditure made to date and estimated total cost for this work. From this report which was dated the 15th instant the expenditure to date is as follows:\n\nDrilling 100' at $1.75 equals 175.00 less 10% equals 157.50\n330' of casing 5\" casing at 98.50 equals 325.05 less 2% 316.55\n476.05\n\nThe total estimated cost is itemized as follows:\n\n330' 5\" casing at 98.50 per hundred ft. $325.05\n328' 6\" 4 1/4 casing at 88.00 per hundred ft. 262.80\nDrilling 327' \"as before\" 609.00\n100' of 3\" P. & R. pipe at 92.51 92.51\n320' of 1-3/8\" octagonal rods at 35\u00a2 112.00\n1-2 5/4\" plunger 20.00\nShifting of pump \"as before\" 30.00\nConcrete basement 100.00\nNew pump head Crane D 9, 3 H.P. 352.00\n\n$1883.36\n\nContingencies 116.64\n\n$2000.00\n\nAs you are aware only $1300.00 has been provided, this amount being based on Mr. Hoover's original estimate of cost as given in his report of July 2nd last, copy of which accompanied our memorandum of July 11th last. The reasons for the additional cost as now estimated amounting to $700.00 over the first estimate as given by Mr. Hoover are contained in our memoranda to you of the 11th instant and 17th instant respectively.\n\nI would be glad to be advised as soon as possible as to whether the additional $700.00 can be made available, as if not, then it will be necessary to advise Mr. Hoover that certain of the expenditures, such as new pump head, cannot be made this season.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nSince the above was dictated the following radio telegram has been received from Mr. Hoover:\n\n\"Re well at Blue Quills Indian School Water is obtained at three hundred and twenty seven feet STOP The sand formation at water vein will require a well screen at estimated additional cost one hundred and ten dollars STOP In letter October fifteenth therefore add above amount to total cost.\"\n\nApparently this means that an additional $110.00 is now required over and above the $2,000.00 contained in Mr. Hoover's report as previously quoted. This now gives a total of $310.00 required over and above the $1300.00 now available.\n\nWith regard to the screen referred to in Mr. Hoover's wire quoted above, you will recall that an amount was included for this item, but as it could not be definitely said that same would be required until the well was drilled, it was omitted from expenditure to be made when the $1300.00 was approved, understanding being that if a screen was later found to be necessary the Indian Affairs Branch would endeavour to secure the necessary additional funds.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S. Miller\nOctober 25th, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School, Water Supply.\n\nI am forwarding herewith copies of memoranda from our Chief Engineer in regard to the above, from which it will be noted that the total expenditure necessary in connection with providing the water for the above school, will be \u00a32110.00. Only \u00a31300.00 has been provided for this work, and if the well, pump, piping etc., is to be completed, then an additional \u00a3810.00 will be required. I should be glad if you would advise if this amount can be provided.\n\nThe necessity for the extra amount arises from the fact that the driller considered that in order to exclude water obtained from the shallower depths and to make sure of only getting water from the lower depths, an additional string of 4\" casing was necessary. This amounted to \u00a3202.00. It became necessary also for him to buy new equipment, which was not expected originally, including a new pump head and new pump rods, and approximately 100 feet of new pipe. This totalled approximately \u00a325.00. In addition to this, there is a provision of \u00a3110.00 for a screen.\n\nDirector.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS          | WEIGHT OR FEET | LIST PRICE | GROSS EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | 2% GOODS | NET GOODS |\n|----------|-------------------------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|----------|----------|-----------|\n| 2        | 1/4\" 2\" Sta. spring checks    |                | 4.58       |                 |          | 9.36     |           |\n| 1        | \" 3 x 2 1/2\" Soc.

The ordinary machines are found too light for heavy work and he asks that additional machines be supplied;\u2014\n\nFollowing are the list of items asked for;\n\n3 Tailor sewing machines\n1 Button hole attachment for sewing machine\n1 Mangel - power\n\nThe latter item is required for use with the power washing machine in use at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\n\nC.P. Schmidt Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCalgary, October 26th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter and report on the Blue Quills Residential School received from Agent W. E. Gullion, Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nAs regards the equipment asked for, I strongly recommend that same be granted: Tailor's sewing machines are very much needed, as at present the work in the sewing room is being considerably delayed because stitching on heavy materials cannot be done on ordinary sewing machines.\n\nA power mangle is also a necessity at this School.\n\nAs regards a suitable building and equipment for manual training purposes, mentioned in the Agent's report, I beg to say that an extra large garage attached to the boiler room of the main building has just been completed: A carpenter's work-bench is being installed at one end of this building, where the boys will be taught general farm carpentry by the school carpenter-labourer. A mechanic's work-bench has been installed in the boiler room, and the older boys are called upon to assist the engineer-mechanic when repair work is done.\n\nI find, however, that the outfits of tools, both carpenter's and Mechanic's, are very limited, and have suggested that a requisition be made for a few more of these.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nCalgary, October 26th, 1938.\n\nRe: Steam boilers (heating) Blue Quills Residential School, Saddi Lake Agency, (Ref. Dept. File #118-1-5:\n\n---\n\nSir:\n\nWhen at this school on the 19th instant, I looked over the boilers, and found that these had been repaired, some forty (40) new flues having been put in. Mr. Wm. Dubois, the Engineer-in-charge was preparing to have everything in readiness for heating the building as soon as the weather becomes cold.\n\nHe was in hopes the new well would be completed before doing so, but I am doubtful of this as there is still considerable work to be done on this well, Viz.,\u2014 installing screen at bottom, excavating pump pit, making concrete walls and roofing same, installing pump, connecting same with pressure tank, &c., &c.\n\nI am confident everything will be in readiness before cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that when at the Blue Quills Residential School, Saddle Lake Agency, last week, I noticed that the stench from the septic tank, which is located a few feet from the South-west front corner of the main building, was terrible, and could be smelt all through the house. I was told this septic tank had been cleaned out a short time ago, but that notwithstanding this, the disagreeable odour still prevails, and when the wind is from the West it is impossible to keep windows open.\n\nI note from the files in this office that this matter was looked into in the year 1935 when Mr. D. B. Menzies, Provincial Sanitary Engineer, made a report on same, in which he made three suggestions, one of which (No. 3) was carried out, on instructions received from the Department under date of September 21st, 1935, File No. 118-1-5. As Mr. Menzies' report was forwarded to the Department but no copy kept at this office, I have no idea what the other two suggestions he made, are.\n\nSomething will have to be done in the matter before another summer comes along. I cannot understand the idea of placing a septic tank so near a building when there is lots of land and space surrounding it.\n\nI beg to ask that a copy of Mr. Menzies' report, mentioned above, be sent me for my file. After perusing same and going over the ground, I may have a suggestion to offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch;\nDept. of Mines & Res.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nCalgary, October 26th, 1938.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Blue Quills Residential School, Saddle Lake Agency, (Ref. Dept. File No. 118-1-5):\n\n---\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that when returning from my holidays (statutory leave) on the 16th instant, I made a short visit to this school with Agent W. E. Gullion, and found that the new well had been sunk and a good depth of water found at the depth of 327 feet, in a layer of very fine sand:\n\nA sample of this sand has been sent to a firm in the U. S. A. for the purpose of ascertaining from them what type of screen they would recommend putting in; also whether they had any suggestions to make in regard to preventing the sand from being pumped up and blocking the well.\n\nA sample of the water has been sent to the laboratory in Edmonton for analysis.\n\nPrices have been asked for repairs to the old pump now in use, parts of which are badly worn. If the cost of repairing this pump is very high, a new pump will, I understand, be installed.\n\nMr. P. A. Fetterley of the Dominion Water Power Bureau, Calgary, is giving the matter his personal attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. The tailor's sewing machines have been ordered.\n\nNo funds are available in the current year's appropriation for the purchase of the mangle and consequently it cannot be supplied.\n\nI note the arrangements that are being made for vocational training and when the requisition for the tools is received it will have very careful consideration. We have expended a great deal of money at the Blue Quills School this year and our funds have now reached the stage where it is difficult to authorize extra expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

DATED November 8th, 1938.\n\nAPPROVED BY THE TREASURY BOARD\n\nFOR SECRETARY\nFinal Report\n\non\n\nWater Supply at Blue Quills Indian School\n\nby P.A. Setterly,\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\n\nThis is the final report on new well for Blue Quills Indian School. The original report, dated May 17, 1938, contained estimates and recommendations.\n\nThe well is now completed. A copy of a letter was received from Rev. H. Balter, dated January 4, 1939, to C.P. Schmidt, Inspector for Indian Agencies for Alberta, containing an extract, the translation of which reads as follows:\n\n\"We profit of this occasion to inform you that the new well obtained from the Department is completed and is at the present time supplying an abundance of soft water. As it is, it can be used for washing clothes without the necessity of adding any ingredient. It is a real blessing for the house.\"\n\nThis would seem to indicate that the new well is a success.\n\n2. Composition of Water\n\nA sample was obtained when the seam was first penetrated which, when analyzed by the Calgary City Chemist, was found to contain a considerable amount of salts but no iron. This discovery provided a sense of anxiety until a new sample was\nobtained recently after the well was cleared. This new sample has not yet been analysed but the portion of Rev. L. Balter's letter given above would appear to settle the question even without a further analysis. The new sample is now in the office and will be sent to the Provincial Analyst for analysis. The yield is apparently also very satisfactory.\n\n3. J.E. Frederickson's activities.\n\nIt should be mentioned at this point that the driller, Mr. Frederickson is to be highly commended for the able and conscientious manner in which he has carried out his duties, particularly as it was impracticable for the Inspecting Engineer to be present except for one brief visit, and that when only the hole was first drilled. This 227 foot seam was apparently passed in former drillings but he was certain that he could develop it.\n\n4. Cost of Well.\n\nThe total cost of the well to date is as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Western Supplies Ltd., Edmonton, 5\" well casing  | $326.05  |\n| J.E. Frederickson, driller, drilling well         | $609.00  |\n| Western Supplies Ltd., Edmonton 4\u00bd\" casing       | $262.80  |\n| Hayward Lumber Company, St. Paul, Lumber &c.     | $134.10  |\n| Beatty Bros. Ltd., Edmonton, Octagonal wood rods, etc. | $200.81  |\n| Crane Ltd., Calgary well screen                  | $100.75  |\n| J.E. Frederickson's final invoice (attached)     | $246.88  |\n\nTotal: $1929.39\n\nIt is true that this amount exceeds that mentioned in\nyour letter of Nov.5,1938, ($1700) but several unexpected factors entered into the construction. The 4\" casing, costing $262.80 was entirely unexpended and unusual but it was necessary to preserve the well. It was of course placed inside the 5\" casing which had to be left in position. Again, the pump had to be changed four times, making necessary an extra expenditure of $20 ($50 less $30) in Mr. Fredericksen's current invoice, attached and not yet paid. Another extra expense was $80 for cleaning out the well and putting in the well screen, as the sand was so fine and the delay of obtaining the well screen was so great, owing to the fact that the necessity for the well screen and its design could not be foretold until the sand was sampled and sent to the manufacturers in Illinois for analysis, and the basement built, that the well partially filled up because of the fineness of the sand and had to be cleaned out again. There was also unavoidable delay in obtaining the screen. All this time, several weeks, the drill outfit stood over the well and its use elsewhere lost. The cost of the well screen itself, $100.75, was partially unexpected. This the total unexpected, and unforeseeable expense amounts to $463.55.\n\nAs a probable compensation, it appears that the Duro Water Softener, costing $680 plus $55.15 for fittings - valves, pipe, etc., purchased and installed in November, 1939, and which has not been used for two years or more, will not now be necessary as the water is reported as soft. If this be the case, it can now be released for use in another school. Mr. Schmidt recently mentioned that the water of St. Paul\nIndian school, Blood Indian reserve, has become hard and may require treatment.\n\nAnother matter needing attention is the 5\" casing originally purchased but not used in the well for reasons mentioned in a previous report. These are 84 feet of this casing left on the ground. The cost was $98.50 per 100 feet. This is worth $82.74. It is supposed that the invoice of Western Supplies Ltd., Edmonton, from whom it was purchased, has been paid. This casing could not be returned before payment of the invoice as it was not known until the well was completed whether it would be needed.\n\nIf the casing be now returned, and it is understood that the Company will do so, less freight, the Indian Affairs Branch will lose the amount to the Receiver General.\n\nRegarding the disposal of this 5\" casing Mr. Fredericksen was unofficially contacted and he stated that he was prepared to pay $50.00 for the pipe to be deducted from his latest invoice, now attached.\n5. Recapitulation of Costs.\n\nTotal cost to date per invoices 1929.39\n\nLess 84' of 5\" casing @ 98.50 per 100 ft. = 82.74\n\nLess freight, to Co. or $50 to Frederickson) 82.74\n\nor if Frederickson's offer be accepted 1846.65\n\nor if Frederickson's offer be accepted 1879.39\n\nUnanticipated expenditures:\n\n4\u00bd\" Casing \"262.80\nCleaning out by Frederickson 80.00\nChanging pump extra 20.00\nWell Screen 100.75\n\n463.55\n\nReleased water softener 680.00\nValves, pipe, etc., \" 55.15\n\nProviding the water softener will be used in another school the actual cost will be lessened to a considerable extent.\n\n6. Observations on Construction\n\nIt is true that the total expenditure exceeds the proposed amount, but several factors enter into the consideration of the matter. This is the fourth well drilled at this school, although the first dealt with by the writer. One was over 400' deep. Another was over 300 feet, another was 90 feet. Its completion has caused a great deal of anxiety and labour and the conclusion may be considered as fortunate. If this well had not been a success the solution of the problem for the school would have been very difficult. In this connection the Sacred Heart School situation is brought to mind. In construction above ground most of the contingencies may be foretold but in a case like this\nwhere so many attempts had been made, all underground and unsuccessful, a previous exact estimate is impossible. Paragraph (5) shows this condition clearly. The main observation is that it appears to be a success. In addition, the Water Softener appears to be available for another school. Another difficulty was in having a constant supply of water for the school during construction where the wells were only seven feet apart. This entailed extra delay and consequent expense which may not easily be anticipated.\n\n7. Recommendation.\n\nIt is recommended that the enclosed invoice of J.M. Fredericksen for construction of basement, etc., be paid to a total of $246.78 or, if his offer of $50.00 for the 84 feet of 5\" casing be accepted, for $196.78.\n\nThe item of $90 for basement was an agreed contract price for complete basement, excavation back-filling, including labour only, and was reasonable as an attempt made at the time of the visit to have it done by hired labour would have cost $150 for this item alone.\n\nMr. Fredericksen would gladly receive the cheque as soon as possible, as he has already disposed of a considerable portion of the amount from his personal funds.\n\nP.A.

Fetterly\n\nDated 13th January, 1938.\nJanuary 19, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian School Well.\n\nEnclos.\n\nAttached please find in duplicate final report received from Mr. Hoover and prepared by Mr. Fetterly with reference to the above project.\n\nFrom Mr. Fetterly's report it will be noted that results obtained from this well are satisfactory to the school authorities. It will further be noted that the total cost is given as $1,929.59, which is in excess of the original estimate of $1,700.00. Reasons for the increased costs are given in the attached report.\n\nMr. Fetterly suggests the Duro Water Softener purchased and installed in November, 1935, but which has not been used for two years or more will not now be necessary as the school authorities appear to be satisfied that the water as obtained from the well is soft enough for general use. Under the circumstances, probably the Indian Affairs Branch would wish to consider the transferring of this equipment to some other locality, and in this latter connection it appears that Mr. Schmidt is of the opinion that the water of St. Paul Indian School, Blood Indian Reserve may require treatment.\n\nAnother point that arises is dealt with on Page 4 of Mr. Fetterly's report. It will be noted that there is on hand 84 feet of 5\" casing worth, according to Mr. Fetterly, $82.74. Two suggestions are made for disposing of this material. One is to return it to the firm from which it was originally purchased receiving from them a cash payment which would have to be credited to the Receiver General; the alternative suggestion is contained in an offer by Mr. Fredrickson of $50.00 which could be deducted from a payment still due him. We would be glad to receive advice as to which of the above suggestions should be acted upon.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector of Surveys and Engineering,\nOttawa.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT. M. Miller\n23rd January, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian School well.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer together with a copy of the report prepared by Mr. Fetterly on the situation in connection with the above well.\n\nIt will be noted that the Duro Water Softener, purchased and installed in November 1935, is not necessary at this school and that your Branch may wish to consider its transfer to some other locality.\n\nIt will also be noticed that Mr. Fetterly suggests that an amount of 5\" casing be returned to the firm in which case the amount to be credited would go to the Receiver General or that the casing be turned over to Mr. Fredericksen, in which case an amount of $50 would be deducted from the payment still due him.\n\nAs both of these matters are of interest to your Branch I should be glad to have your views.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 28, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA report has just been received from the Surveys & Engineering Branch in which they advise that the well at the Blue Quills Indian residential school has been completed and that an abundant supply of soft water has been secured.\n\nWith reference to the water softener Mr. Fetterly writes as follows:\n\n\"As a probable compensation, it appears that the Duro Water Softener, costing $680 plus $55.15 for fittings, valves, pipe, etc., purchased and installed in November, 1935, and which has not been used for two years or more, will not now be necessary as the water is reported as soft. If this be the case, it can now be released for use in another school. Mr. Schmidt recently mentioned that the water of St. Paul Indian School, Blood Indian Reserve, has become hard and may require treatment.\"\n\nPlease let me know if you consider the water softener should be transferred from the Blue Quills to the St. Paul's school and if not are you aware of any other school or Agency at which good use could be made of this softener? If you are not aware of any place where it can be used arrangements will be made with the Salvage Officer to dispose of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. P.

P. Schmidt is being written to with reference to the disposal of the water softener.\n\nIn view of the explanation given by Mr. Fetterly it is considered that the unused 5\" casing should be turned over to Mr. Frederickson and the sum of $50.00 deducted from any payment still due him.\n\nDirector.\nSTATEMENT\n\nFOLIO\n\nJanuary 14th, 1939\n\nM.

Hoover,\nEngr. in Charge,\nCalgary.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing report of analysis on sample of water received from you and have expressed results in parts per million and in grains per gallon.\n\nYou will note a water of medium hardness and containing a considerable amount of sodium carbonate and sodium sulphate. I presume that the Duro softener is of the Zeolite type and should remove all the hardness from this water.\n\nThe scale formed from above water would be soft, there being no permanent hardness present. A soft water with no hardness would be much more satisfactory for domestic supply, there being no scale deposited in boilers and considerable saving on soap. While the water is not excessively hard - 9.87 grains - I would consider that the expense involved would be justified, as you have a softener in stock.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) James A. Kelso\n\nDirector, Industrial Laboratories\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian School and St. Paul's Indian School.\n\nBy reference to our memorandum of January 19th last, it will be noted that as satisfactory results had been obtained at the Blue Quills Indian School from a new well that had been drilled, the suggestion was made that the Indian Affairs Branch give consideration to transferring the Duro Water Softener from the Blue Quills Indian School to some other point where it might be needed such as the St. Paul Indian School as suggested by Mr. Schmidt. Your memorandum of February 3rd last indicated that this matter was receiving the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nUnder date of the 12th ultimo, we received a letter from Mr. Hoover advising that samples of the water in the well at the Blue Quills School had been analyzed and while the results of such analysis had been found to be reasonably satisfactory, Mr. Hoover was having a second sample tested. Copies of the analysis as well as the report of the Director of Industrial Laboratories at Edmonton covering the first test made are attached.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a further letter from Mr. Hoover in which he advises that the second analysis indicated no iron present, and that the sample when tested with a quantity of Zeolite gave results indicating that the Zeolite had removed about 70% of the salts present. The analyst who made the test states that this would cause the water to be quite sufficiently soft for all purposes for which it is intended to be used.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is now recommended that the Duro Water Softener which is now at Blue Quills Indian Residential School be removed to St. Paul's Indian School, Cardston.\n\nMr. Hoover advises that if this Softener is moved, a representative of his office should be present at Blue Quills School during removal. It appears that Mr. Hoover expects to have Mr. Fetterly at Edmonton about the end of the present month. If we could be advised regarding final decision in connection with removal of this Water Softener shortly, then instructions will be issued so that Mr. Fetterly can supervise the shipment of this Softener from Blue Quills School to St. Paul's School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

It is noted that tests show the water satisfactory and hence the Duro Water Softener is available for transfer to another school.\n\nWill you please advise if, in accordance with the recommendation of Mr. Schmidt, arrangements should be made for the removal of this Softener to St. Paul's. You will note that Mr. Fetterly will probably be available for removing the apparatus at the end of this month.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJune 19, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of January 28 last in connection with the water softener at the Blue Quills Indian residential school.\n\nA recent report received from the Surveys & Engineering Branch states that the water has been analyzed and is pronounced satisfactory. The Surveys & Engineering Branch suggest that the softener at present at the Blue Quills school be transferred to the St. Paul's Indian residential school. They further advise that Mr. Fetterly will be at Edmonton about the end of the current month and at that time could supervise the shipment from Blue Quills to St. Paul's.\n\nPlease advise all parties concerned immediately that the Department approves the transfer of this softener to the St. Paul's school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

A detailed list of the material and price of each piece, is required in quadruplicate, one copy for your file.\n\nI understand Mr. Fetterly has sent a sketch of the softener to the Principal to facilitate the setting up of same, it being thought that probably the mechanic at the school could do this work.\n\nThis softener is, I understand, double capacity, i.e., two No. SF 5 softeners connected together. I am enclosing herewith catalogue sheets which might be of some assistance in assembling this machine. I would ask that these be returned, as they were cut out of a catalogue.\n\nLabour to install the softener at Blue Quills School cost $22.85; a local plumber did the work.\n\nI would ask you to look into this matter at once, if possible, as I am hoping to go South during the first days of next week, and would like to talk the matter over with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn E.

Hoey  \nSuperintendent Training Division  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast November the Blue Quills Indian Residential School found it necessary, in order to provide accommodation for some extra pupils, to purchase the enclosed bill of goods from Simmons Limited.\n\nThis was really an emergency case and there was no time to refer it to Ottawa. Your new regulations cause long delays in the purchase of essential supplies for our schools. This is not said in a spirit of criticism but to justify the purchase made.\n\nHoping that you will be good enough to authorize the payment of this account, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Department of Mines & Resources]\nSADDLE LAKE, ALBERTA.\nAugust 31st, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to inform you that several leaks have developed in the roof of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school and repairs to the roof will be necessary in order to prevent damage to the plaster inside of the building. Several spots were pointed out to me and it was noticed that there were three patches of plaster in the chapel ceiling that appeared to be loose. Small spots are noticeable in both dormitories and there are leakages around several of the pipes. There is also considerable leakage through the ceiling of the kitchen. The plaster in one corner of the laundry is becoming loose and the ceiling is rather badly cracked.\n\nWith the exception of the corner of the laundry and discoloration of plaster in spots where water has seeped through, the damage so far is slight. In order to remedy the cause however, I am of the opinion that it would be necessary to treat the whole roof. It is a hard matter to locate the exact source of the leakages and no doubt there are minute cracks in the roofing composition at various points over the entire roof.\n\nThe school could furnish some of the labor but in order to have the work properly done, it should be supervised by a man who has had practical experience in roofing and plaster work. The cost would probably be about $300.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Guillon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI wish to inform you that the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school has taken up the question of having certain alterations made in connection with the bath tubs and wash basins at present in use at this school.\n\nIt is pointed out that from past experience, it has been found that where bath tubs and wash basins are used by the pupils, it is very difficult to deal successfully with the various skin diseases, such as impetigo, scabies, etc. In order to overcome this difficulty, the Reverend Principal suggests that the wash tubs and wash basins now in use be disposed of and that these be replaced with shower baths and wash sinks.\n\nWith this in view, the Reverend Principal took up with Messrs. H. Kelly & Company, Limited, Edmonton, the matter of cost of new showers and fixtures and also allowances, in the event of a trade-in, of the used bath tubs and basins at the school. Following is a list of estimated requirements:\n\n- 2 - 5' wash sinks with Hot and Cold water combination taps - a total of 10 taps.\n- 1 - 1\u00bd\" S Nickel Plated trap\n- 7 - 1\u00bd\"x1\u00bc\" Crosses\n- 80 ft. \u00bd\" Galvanized pipe\n- 40 \" \u00be\"\n- 20 \" 1\u00bc\"\n- 24 Only 1\u00bd\"x\u00be\" Galvanized Tees\n- 24 \u00be\" Valves, compression\n- 12 Showers, complete with unions, shower head and arm.\n\nMessrs. H. Kelly and Company quoted a price on the whole list given above, of $395.00, f.o.b. St. Paul, and\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nand offer to allow a credit on the used fixtures as follows: Wash basins - $5.00 each; bath tubs - $15.00 each. On this basis, the difference in the cost which would have to be paid over and above the amount which would be allowed for the used bath tubs and basins, would be $168.00. There would also be an item of about $10.00 for cement which would be required if the change was being made. Providing the labor was arranged for by the school, the total cost therefore would be approximately $178.00.\n\nI might mention that the matter of substituting shower baths and wash sinks for the pupils has been discussed with the Medical Officer, Dr. Decosse, and he considers that these would undoubtedly prove more satisfactory, particularly at times when some of the pupils might be affected with infectious skin diseases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nW.E.

I beg to ask that the matter of disposing of the wash basins be held in abeyance pending further word from this office. Individual wash-basins are very badly needed at the Youville Residential School, Edmonton Agency. This was mentioned in my report on this school under date of January 13th, 1937. Nothing has been done in the matter to date.\n\nC. Pont. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nCalgary, October 9th, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nRe request and suggestion made by the Principal of the Blue Quills Residential School that certain alterations be made in the boys' section -- bath-room and wash-room -- viz.,\n\n(a) Removal of two double rows (7 and 6 double) fixed individual wash basins in the boys' wash-room in the basement, and replacing same with a flowing water system, i.e., long pipes with taps only and draining trough, having a drain-pipe under each tap. The removal of these fixed double rows of individual basins will give sufficient room to install (b);\n\n(b) Installation of five shower baths;\n\n(c) That the five bath tubs in the bath-room adjoining the boys' dormitory be removed. This would provide room for ten (10) extra beds;\n\nthe reason for suggesting the changes being that it is found quite difficult to clean, scald and disinfect these bath tubs and wash basins after each individual has used them, and there being many pupils suffering from scabies or impetigo (scabs), and it is believed that the flowing water for washing, and shower baths would greatly help combat this serious and no doubt communicable trouble amongst the pupils, which is always very acute and wide-spread amongst them -- more so on their return to school after the summer holidays.\n\nWhen discussing the matter with the Principal of the School and yourself last week, I understood you to say that quotations had been obtained for the cost of new material and labour required to make the changes, and that the plumber had made an offer for the bath tubs and wash basins which are to be removed; also, that this information had been forwarded for the Department's information and decision: Apparently this was forwarded direct to Ottawa, as I do not find any trace of it here. I believe it should have been sent through this office, or at least a copy sent here. If my interpretation of Department's Circular No. C. 154 dated May 17th, 1937, is correct: (Ref. No. 1, Buildings, School, \"including all new projects for repairs\").\n\nWill you please send me, by first mail, copies of all correspondence, quotations, lists of new material required, &c., pertaining to this matter? I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Department, asking them to withhold their decision on the matter pending receipt of my report, which I will forward upon receipt from you of the information asked for above. My reason for doing so is that -- as I said to you when at the school -- we can make use of the individual wash basins at another school where we have no such equipment, and I would not consider selling or trading them to an outsider at a sacrifice price.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSADDLE LAKE, Alta.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter enclosing copy of your letter of the 9th instant to Indian Agent Cullion with reference to certain alterations in the bath room and wash room at the Blue Quills Indian residential school. For your information I enclose copy of letter of August 31 received from Agent Cullion. The matter was taken up with the Purchasing Agent but order has not yet been placed, although they are ready to do so at the present time. Please let me know by return mail your wishes in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nIndian Residential School,\nBlue Quill School,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are pleased to quote on the following material for the above school:\n\n2 - 5' Wash sinks with Hot and Cold water combination taps, a total of 10 taps.\n\n1 - 1\u00bd\" S Nickel Plated trap.\n\n7 - 1\u00bd\" x 1\u00bc\" Crosses.\n\n80 feet - \u00be\" Galvanized pipe.\n\n40 \" - \u00bd\" \"\n\n20 \" - 1\u00bd\" \"\n\n24 only \u00be x \u00be x \u00bc Galv. tees.\n\n24 - \u00bc\" Valves compression.\n\n12 - Showers complete with unions, shower head and arm.\n\nThe above for the sum of Three Hundred and Ninety-Eight Dollars ($398.00).\n\nWe will allow a credit on the used fixtures; wash basins, $5.00 each; Bath tubs, $15.00 each. The above F.O.B. St. Paul. Thanking you, and hoping that you will favour us with this work, we remain, Yours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H. KELLY & CO., LTD. Per: \"Wm. CARSE.\"\nSir:\n\nReference your No. 118-1-5 of the 13th instant re certain alterations in the bath room and wash room at Blue Quills Residential School, I beg to report that when at the school on the 26th ultimo, I was informed that application for making these alterations had been made to the Department: (Reference my letter of the 9th instant to Agent W.E. Gullion, copy of which I forwarded to you). As stated in this letter, I did not approve of selling or trading in the individual wash basins, as we could make use of them elsewhere.\n\nAgent Gullion has sent me a copy of his letter to the Department; also copy of quotation from H. Kelly & Co., Ltd., Edmonton (copy of which I attach hereto), for material amounting to $398.00. This firm also state that they will allow a credit for used fixtures as follows: 28 wash basins @ $5.00 each; 5 bath tubs @ $15.00 each.\n\nAccording to Agent Gullion's letter, I take it that the labour is to be done by the School. This point, however, is not clear to me.\n\nMy recommendation is that the new flowing water system, taps and catch basins for washing, and shower baths, be installed, and that all individual wash basins, complete with fixtures, that are removed, be transferred to the Youville Residential School, St. Albert, Alta., in the Edmonton Agency, for use in the boys' wash room, to replace wooden brackets and loose basins now being used. The latter arrangement is most unsatisfactory, as a certain amount of splashing and spilling of water always takes place, which leaves the wooden brackets and floors wet.\n\nThe five bath tubs, if not required elsewhere by the Department, might be disposed of.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nOctober 25, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in connection with certain alterations in the bath room and wash room at the Blue Quills residential school. Previous to the receipt of your letter arrangements had been made with H. Kelly & Co., Edmonton, to supply the new equipment needed and to allow a credit of $5.00 for each of 28 wash basins and $15.00 for each of 5 bath tubs. This arrangement was considered reasonable by the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C. F.

The bearing is marked \"Hess Bright\" 6400 SKF GDS and has six balls.\n\nUpon being advised that the pump in the tank was out of order yesterday, I went to the school. The pump head had been removed and the parts were being taken up. The end of the shaft, an eight foot length of 1\u00bd\" pipe, two lock washers and one side of the pump head were damaged by corrosion. The shaft and pump head can be repaired at St. Paul and an 8 ft. length of suitable pipe can also be obtained there.\n\nIn order to have the pump repaired and the damaged pipe replaced as soon as possible, I advised them to have this work done at once. The pump can then be used temporarily by hand, in case of emergency. The bearing which I am sending cannot be obtained here. The maker's name is not on the pump but I believe that Messrs. Bell and Morris of Calgary handle them. The number on the pump head is G245-200.\n\nThe two lock washers required are for 1\u00bd\" shaft, the washers being \u00bd\" in thickness and 4\" across.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

E. Guillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that it will be necessary to replace at least four of the old sewing machines at present being used at the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school. I have today checked over these machines and as they are of a very old type, would not in my opinion be worth more than $5.00 each on a trade-in.\n\nIt occurred to me that these machines, while they will not be of much further use to the school, might be suitable to start some of the older girls who have taken up sewing. You will understand that in placing the value of the old machines at $5.00 each, I am taking into consideration the fact that considerable expense would be entailed in the way of removal charges, minor repair parts, sales expenses, etc., which would eventually add to the selling cost of the old machines.\n\nI would be prepared to deliver, f.o.b. St. Paul, Alberta, four new No.15-88-404 Singer Sewing Machines at a price of $53.30 each. These are four drawer machines and would be complete with standard equipment. The machines I am sure, would prove entirely satisfactory for sewing which is required at the school.\n\nIf this meets with the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs, I shall be glad to arrange for delivery of the machines when required.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSinger Sewing Machine Company.\n\n[Signature]\nBig Valley,\nAlta.\nSaddle Lake, Alta.,\nFebruary 21, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an offer made by Mr. H.J. Sampson of Vegreville, Alberta, representative of the Singer Sewing Machine Company, to supply the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school, four No. 15-88-404 Singer sewing machines at a price of $53.50 each, f.o.b. St. Paul, Alta.\n\nIn regard to these machines, I might say that I was informed that some of the old machines now in use at the school were old and worn and that it was desired that new machines be supplied if possible. I visited the Blue Quill's school and checked the sewing equipment carefully.\n\nThe machines listed below and which are said to have been in use for about thirty years are in poor condition:\n\n1 - 6 drawer Singer - Serial No. G881139 - 32 years\n1 - 2 \" \" \" 11122-311 - 40 \"\n1 - 4 \" \" \" F5029319 about 30 \"\n1 - 4 \" \" \" 15420590 \" 30 \"\n\nThe machines on which prices are quoted by Mr. Sampson are the four drawer with standard equipment.\n\nThe question of trade-in allowance on the old machines was gone into but Mr. Sampson stated that owing to the age and condition of the machines, the trade-in valuation would not be more than $5.00 each.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIt was also suggested that in the event of new machines being supplied, the four old machines might be given to certain girls who would be selected for their interest in sewing. This would be preferable to turning in the old machines at $5.00 each.\n\nIn order to meet the sewing requirements at the school, the Reverend Principal would appreciate having the four old machines replaced and the foregoing is submitted for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith letter addressed to the Secretary by Mr. W. E. Gullion, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, which is self-explanatory.\n\nThe condition of the four old sewing machines now in use at the Blue Quills School, was brought to my attention when I visited the school sometime ago. They are old and worn, and should be replaced. I therefore recommend that this be done.\n\nI agree with the suggestion, that rather than turn them in to the Company at a value of $5.00 each, they be given to certain girls who would be selected for their interest in sewing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMarch 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the sewing machines at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nFunds for the current fiscal year have been completely assigned and consequently it is impossible to consider purchase of new machines at the present time.\n\nI am unable to state at present what funds will be available for the fiscal year 1940-41 but you might write to me again about May 15 and further consideration will be given to the request of the Principal for new sewing machines.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSADDLE LAKE, ALBERTA.\nAugust 31st, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to inform you that several leaks have developed in the roof of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school and repairs to the roof will be necessary in order to prevent damage to the plaster inside of the building. Several spots were pointed out to me and it was noticed that there were three patches of plaster in the chapel ceiling that appeared to be loose. Small spots are noticeable in both dormitories and there are leakages around several of the pipes. There is also considerable leakage through the ceiling of the kitchen. The plaster in one corner of the laundry is becoming loose and the ceiling is rather badly cracked.\n\nWith the exception of the corner of the laundry and discoloration of plaster in spots where water has seeped through, the damage so far is slight. In order to remedy the cause however, I am of the opinion that it would be necessary to treat the whole roof. It is a hard matter to locate the exact source of the leakages and no doubt there are minute cracks in the roofing composition at various points over the entire roof.\n\nThe school could furnish some of the labor but in order to have the work properly done, it should be supervised by a man who has had practical experience in roofing and plaster work. The cost would probably be about $300.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from Indian Agent Gullion's letter dated March 1, 1940.\n\nYou will note that under the heading of \"General\", I have entered the following comment: \"The roof of the school building will need attention in order to prevent extensive damage to plaster on ceilings; Ref., my letter No. 1-S4.2, August 31, 1939.\" I am attaching to report, copy of letter referred to.\n\nIn regard to this, I wish to inform you that my attention was again drawn to the leakages in the roof, particularly in the kitchen where the water had been leaking through the ceiling and onto the floor. Otherwise, the building appears to be in good shape.\n\nBeds have been placed in the two rooms formerly used as boys' bath rooms. There are five beds in the smaller room and eight beds in the larger room, making a total of eighty-two beds now in use in the boys' dormitory.\n\nThe Reverend Principal informed me that he would probably ask for the discharge of about twenty pupils at the end of the term.\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 1st instant which mentions the repairs required to the roof at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThere are no funds on hand at the present time which could be used for making the repairs that you consider necessary but it is hoped to be able to provide funds for this purpose in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41. However, owing to the dissolution of Parliament this money will not be available for another month or more.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter of August 31 you stated that the cost of reroofing the school would be $300.00. Is the Department to understand that this estimate covers the material and the wages of the foreman who you consider should be engaged.\n\nPlease let me have detailed information regarding the material required in order that arrangements may be made as soon as funds will permit to have the Purchasing Agent secure the material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. W. E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\nMarch 27th, 1940.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to inform you that upon being advised that one of the tubes in the high pressure boiler had developed a leak, I visited the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school yesterday and while there, checked this boiler. It was noted that the majority of the tubes visible through the hand holes, were very badly pitted. There are holes in three of the tubes and from their appearance, several others are no doubt so badly corroded that leaks will develop shortly. This boiler is used for laundry purposes and necessary repairs will be required as soon as possible.\n\nI am of the opinion that a new set of tubes will be necessary in order to make the boiler safe.\n\nThe number and size is as follows:\n50 tubes - 4ft. 6\" in length by 2 inches.\nThe serial number of the boiler is 292118, certificate No.8955 A.\n\nThere is a flue expanded at the school and the Reverend Principal informed me that the new tubes can be placed in the boiler by their engineer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nApril 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo it is noted that immediate repairs are required to the high pressure boiler at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase from a firm on the approved list of the tubes that are required. It is noted that the new tubes will be placed in the boiler by the school engineer without cost to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W. E.

He was, therefore, authorized to purchase the tubes from a firm on the approved list. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

You did not specify any special type of machine and consequently the Department ordered the machine usually supplied to all residential schools. Recently, we were surprised to receive a letter from the Singer Sewing Machine Company, with whom the order had been placed, stating that you had requested a change in the type of sewing machine.\n\nYou must be aware that you have no authority to write to a firm with whom an order has been placed. If there is any mistake, you should write direct to this Branch and the matter will then be taken up through the proper channels.\n\nI am requesting the Purchasing Branch to notify the Singer Sewing Machine Company to ship to the Blue Quills School the sewing machines which we have already ordered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.

While conversing with the principal I learned that it was the intention of the Oblate Fathers to build an addition to the school. This addition is to make use of the east wall of the present building, i.e., the laundry, the power room and the garage. This addition to be partly, a two story addition consisting of: 1. Ground floor\u2014recreation room, one class room and a Manual Training shop. 2. The upper story, at the north end, would be used as a dormitory for senior boys.\n\nRev. L.

Heey Esq.  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSeveral times in the past, the Church authorities in visiting our school have suggested the advisability of separating the big boys from the small ones, especially in the recreation hall and in the dormitory. Furthermore, our class rooms are somewhat crowded and we need badly a manual training room.\n\nTherefore with the advice of our Provincial, Rev. Father H. Reuther O.M.I., I am writing you to ask your permission to begin the construction of an addition to our school. In putting a Skylight on the roof of the laundry the proposed addition can be put against the laundry thus the heating of the new building will be easy.\n\nI am inclosing a sketch-map of the proposed construction. If you give your consent I would be obliged if you could wire your answer as we would like to begin the work at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nJune 11, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you state that the Church authorities are prepared to erect an addition to the Blue Quills Residential School in order to provide further accommodation for the pupils as well as a manual training room.\n\nYour request has been very carefully considered and it has been decided to approve the erection of the proposed new addition with the following understanding:\n\n1. That the new building is totally erected at the cost of the Church authorities and that this Branch will not be asked to refund any of its cost;\n\n2.

L. Balter the Principal and Rev. R.F. Pratt, assistant Principal and bursar mentioned in conversation that they were considering building an addition to the school but that no decision had been reached in the matter.\n\nWhen at the school on the 6th instant Rev. Fr. Pratt in conversation stated they had decided to build, that they had some of the material purchased and that he expected to start excavating next week June 9th-14th. Rev. L. Balter, the Principal, being in Edmonton to attend a Council meeting of the Oblates, and Fr. Pratt being unable to say whether the matter had been referred to the Department. I took it upon myself and phoned Rev. M. Rouxier, the Provincial of the Oblates to ask him whether the Department had been informed. His reply was in the negative and stated he had asked the Principal to do so. On his return that evening, June 6th, I asked Rev. Balter the Principal if he had written to the Department, his reply being also in the negative. I suggested that he do so and also send a plan or sketch and specifications. He agreed to do so saying he would mail them next day. The Department have no doubt received same by now.\n\nThe present building faces South. The new addition will be along the East wall of the North section of this, or in other words the outside wall of the laundry, power room \"lighting plant room\" and garage will be used as the West wall of the addition, or again, three (3) new walls only will have to be built when constructing the 1st story of the proposed new addition. This will mean that the windows in the laundry and power rooms will be closed or blinded. To light these rooms, laundry and power room which are one story only, it is proposed to put sky lights or cupolas or windows on the flat roof.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhat material will be used in the construction of this addition has apparently not been decided upon. The following was mentioned to me - the foundation will be concrete and the lower 4 or 5 feet of the wall concrete also, to serve as a wainscoting; the upper part of the wall will be frame - the inside either stucco or brick veneer. This has not been decided. The roof will be rubberized roofing (not tar or gravel). Floors - cement was mentioned for recreation room and work shop. Heating, steam from boilers, system now in use. Water, connected with present system pressure tank; Fire protection. Lighting, windows to be horizontal.\n\nThe North end to have an upper story to be used as a dormitory for the older boys.\n\nThis addition will fill a long felt want in view of the fact that this school have many more pupils in attendance over the quota for which the original building was built.\n\nFor the information of the Department please I understand the matter has not been taken up with the Indian Agent's office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.F. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nJune 23rd 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Blue Quill's Residential School.\n\nI beg to inform the department that on Saturday a.m. I received a call from Father Pratt stating that the freezing unit of the school refrigerator was not working. Saturday afternoon I was into the school and inspected the freezing unit.\n\nFor your information I would state that the unit is of the Kelvinator Type with the compressor and engine on the outside of the refrigerator, it did not appear to be in any too good shape and I was informed it started giving trouble on Friday June 13th last and was certainly not working properly when I saw it on Saturday June 21st.\n\nFather Pratt informed me that it would cost in the neighborhood of $60.00 to have a man out from Edmonton\u2014Ryan Bros\u2014to put the unit in order. Saturday morning he requested me to wire the department for this authority however I am air mailing instead and if the department authorize this expenditure, I would ask to be informed by wire.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B.

Children returned to both schools on Sept. 23rd. A fair response resulted at the present there being 16 absent from Blue Quills School, most of them away with their parents threshing on the out side. Some six children are absent from the Edmonton School. A few new recruits went to school but up to the time of writing have not received their applications. Called at the Blue Quills School once during the month before the school opened to inspect bake oven that the repairs are being paid for by the department. The progress of the building of the addition to this school is very slow and it would appear very doubtful that it will be finished this year. It would appear that the school undertook just about a little more than they can manage.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nW.B.

This work was carried out by the Somerville Hardware Co. and paid for by this office Voucher No. 979 in the sum of $2.18.\n\nI would refer you to the third paragraph of my letter in which I stated that the plant did not appear in good shape. Further to this a salesman called at the school last fall and wrote me in regards to the plant and I quote from his letter: \"With regards to the old outfit which you might wish to trade-in, we understand it has been in use for ten or eleven years. Apart from natural wear it is now very much antiquated and its resale value is questionable\", etc.\n\nI am not aware if the department would consider a new plant being installed or if funds would be available. I am aware that the plant has been giving trouble before it was repaired last year and as stated above it would appear that the natural wear is making the plant a bill of expense to operate.\n\nIf the dept. is prepared to go to the expense of a new plant, I would go carefully into the prices and installation features of a new plant.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nBlue Quill School, St-Paul, Alberta.\n12th March 1942.\n\nTo W.P.B.

You might make further enquiries, however, with a view to ascertaining exactly what is needed at the Blue Quills School and the approximate cost.

Donohue\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOffice of the Saddle Lake Indian Agency,\n\nMar. 30, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 97 - 42 amounting to $21.86 in favour of St. Paul Foundry for repairs to sewer-Blue Quill's school.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\nReq. 9070\nDear Mr. B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\n\nRe: Blue Quill Indian School, St. Paul.\n\nOn April 29 last we had the pleasure of quoting\nFather Pratt on Refrigeration for walls in cooler\nat the school.\n\nAlthough prices have advanced slightly, and\nwe look for still further increases, we will\nconfirm original quotation at this time,\nsubject to fairly prompt acceptance, and subject\nto increased taxes or other expenses over\nwhich we have no control.\n\nOur quotation is based on the installation of\ncooling rooms being 3' x 6' each or equivalent.\n\nFor the necessary equipment to cool a room\n8' x 5' x 9', we would specify a C 6A 1/2 H.P. unit\n8' x 5' x 9', we would specify a C 6A 1/2 H.P. unit\n8' x 5' x 9', we would specify a C 6A 1/2 H.P. unit\n\nFor a unit to cool a room 11' x 5' x 9', we\nwould specify a heavy duty C 2A 1/2 H.P. unit\ncompressor with a No. 15 - 4 speed Air Conditioning\nUnit. Our price on this would be $550.00 installed\nand include 12 months free service.\n\nIn the event of our supplying a single speed\nunit, $20.00 would be deducted from above prices,\nbut for the difference in cost we can assure you\nthe 4 speed coil would be by far the most\nINTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE\n\nPreferable, both as regards efficiency and economy.\n\nWe are quite aware cheap equipment is available, but we have no hesitancy in saying that when investing in Refrigeration equipment, the best is bound to prove most economical in the final analysis.\n\nWith regard to the old outfit which you might wish to trade in, we understand it has been in use for ten or eleven years. Apart from natural wear it is now very much antiquated and its resale value is questionable. However, we would be prepared to allow you $400 for it, and if you found it could be sold for more than our allowance we would prefer not to have it.\n\nRegarding terms, prices quoted are cash prices; however, if terms are preferable we would require 25% down until sold, and if extended terms on the balance there would be an interest charge of 5% on the balance.\n\nWe sincerely hope that our proposal meets with your approval and that we may be favored with your order. You can be sure that, if given the business, we shall see that the installation is one which will meet with your approval, and give you many years of satisfactory and trouble-free Refrigeration.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nRyan Bros., Ltd.\nDr. B.B. Blondal.\nUNIT COOLERS\n\nCABINETS:\nCabinets are attractively designed and constructed entirely of non-corrosive materials. Corners are rounded which make for better appearance and integral channel members across the top of unit provide rugged means for ease of installation. Units are furnished in brown baked on wrinkled enamel finish. Upon request, they may be supplied in any color at slight additional cost.\n\nCABINET BOTTOM PAN INSULATED:\nThe bottom of the cabinet is thoroughly insulated to eliminate accumulation of condensate on the outside.\n\nCOOLING ELEMENT:\nThe cooling element is made of 3/8\" O.D. seamless copper tubing with aluminum fins hydraulically bonded to tubes. Fins are arranged vertically thereby assuring quick drainage of condensate. All elements have four parallel banks of tubes manifolded so as to increase operating efficiency and assure complete distribution of liquid refrigerant throughout the entire element. The ratio of secondary surface (fin surface) to primary surface (tube surface) is 5.9 to 1.0 in all elements.\n\nPhysical Dimensions of Unit Coolers\n\n| Model Number | H   | W   | D   | C   | O.D. | A   | B   | S   | L   |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 10           | 16  | 17  | 19  | 2   | 21   | 18  | 9   | 5   | 1/2 |\n| 12           | 17  | 18  | 19  | 2   | 21   | 19  | 9   | 5   | 1/2 |\n| 15           | 20  | 21  | 20  | 3   | 23   | 22  | 10  | 7   | 1/2 |\n| 19           | 23  | 24  | 20  | 3   | 23   | 25  | 10  | 7   | 1/2 |\n| 21           | 26  | 27  | 20  | 3   | 23   | 26  | 10  | 7   | 1/2 |\n| 24           | 29  | 30  | 21  | 4   | 25   | 29  | 10  | 7   | 1/2 |\n| 27           | 32  | 33  | 21  | 4   | 25   | 34  | 11  | 11  | 1/2 |\n\nS - SUCTION LINE SIZE\nL - LIQUID LINE SIZE\nP - 3/4 PIPE TAP DRAIN\nUNIT COOLERS\n\nFor Room Temperatures Above 32\u00b0 F.\n\nMcQuay Unit Coolers provide uniform refrigeration throughout all portions of Walk-In coolers, storage rooms, beer keg storage rooms and all types of fixtures where forced air circulation is desirable. Unit coolers eliminate the necessity for fixed louvers and make possible additional storage space.\n\nUnits are furnished with a special Flow-Way expansion valve as illustrated. This patented feature makes possible improved air diffusion throughout storage room. It is suggested that the unit be installed and the adjustable louvers placed in proper position to attain full benefits from this advantage.\n\n| Unit Cooler Model Number | Code Word | Rating in B.T.U. per Hour | Net Weight | Shipping Weight | List Price With Valve | List Price Without Valve |\n|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| 10                       | CEDAF     | 187                       | 2905       | 3710            | 55                    | 598.50                  | $36.00                  |\n| 12                       | CHAAU     | 247                       | 3705       | 4910            | 80                    | 100                    | 126.50                  |\n| 15                       | CHBAU     | 309                       | 5835       | 7780            | 105                   | 128                    | 153.50                  |\n| 18                       | CHBHU     | 532                       | 8290       | 9615            | 135                   | 161                    | 180.50                  |\n| 20                       | CORKA     | 619                       | 9295       | 12390           | 135                   | 161                    | 191.50                  |\n| 22                       | CREWO     | 851                       | 12750      | 15600           | 160                   | 206                    | 211.50                  |\n| 24                       | CUDID     | 1056                      | 15840      | 21120           | 275                   | 330                    | 271.50                  |\n| 27                       | CYHOL     | 1319                      | 19735      | 26390           | 362                   | 462                    | 321.50                  |\n\nPhysical Data for Unit Coolers\n\n| Unit Cooler Model No. | Motor Specifications | Fan Size | Cu.

Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing our telephone conversation of some few days ago, we have pleasure in submitting for your approval, the following tender to supply and install Frigidaire automatic refrigeration in the Blue Quill Indian School at St. Paul.\n\nThe present box in the school is now approximately 5 x 8 x 9, inside measurements, and appears to be insulated with three inches of cork board. The equipment required to cool this box would be -\n\n1 - Model WF-250, 1/2 h.p. Frigidaire water-cooled condensing unit.\n1 - Model WX-1466 Cooling Coil, complete with thermostatic expansion valve.\n1 - Model PX-22 Ice-Making Frigidaire cooling coil, complete with thermostatic expansion valve. Having a capacity to freeze 19 lbs. of ice, or 156 tubes at one freezing, and is equipped with 6 trays. We have figured this to handle three complete freezings of ice per day.\n\nWe are proposing to use a water-cooled condensing unit, owing to the fact that the room the compressor would have to sit in is closed at all times and ventilation is rather poor; and, as this room is used as a storeroom, an air-cooled unit would only have a tendency to heat this room up.\n\nPrice of the above-mentioned equipment, completely installed, f.o.b.

L. Balter the Principal and Rev. R.F. Pratt, assistant Principal and bursar mentioned in conversation that they were considering building an addition to the school but that no decision had been reached in the matter.\n\nWhen at the school on the 6th instant Rev. Fr. Pratt in conversation stated they had decided to build, that they had some of the material purchased and that he expected to start excavating next week June 9th-14th. Rev. L. Balter, the Principal, being in Edmonton to attend a Council meeting of the Oblates and Fr. Pratt being unable to say whether the matter had been referred to the Department. I took it upon myself and phoned Rev. M. Routhier, the Provincial of the Oblates to ask him whether the Department had been informed. His reply was in the negative and stated he had asked the Principal to do so.\n\nOn his return that evening, June 6th, I asked Rev. Balter the Principal if he had written to the Department; his reply being also in the negative. I suggested that he do so and also send a plan or sketch and specifications. He agreed to do so saying he would mail them next day. The Department have no doubt received same by now.\n\nThe present building faces South. The new addition will be along the East wall of the North section of this, or in other words the outside wall of the laundry, power room \"lighting plant room\" and garage will be used as the West wall of the addition; or again, three (3) new walls only will have to be built when constructing the 1st story of the proposed new addition. This will mean that the windows of the laundry and power rooms will be closed or blinded. To light these rooms, laundry and power room which are one story only, it is proposed to put sky lights or cupolas or windows on the flat roof.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhat material will be used in the construction of this addition has apparently not been decided upon. The following was mentioned to me - the foundation will be concrete and the lower 4 or 5 feet of the wall concrete also, to serve as a wainscoting; the upper part of the wall will be frame - the inside either stucco or brick veneer. This has not been decided. The roof will be rubberized roofing (not tar or gravel). Floors - cement was mentioned for recreation room and work shop. Heating, steam from boilers, system now in use. Water, connected with present system pressure tank. Fire protection. Lighting, windows to be horizontal.\n\nThe North end to have an upper story to be used as a dormitory for the older boys.\n\nThis addition will fill a long felt want in view of the fact that this school have many more pupils in attendance over the quota for which the original building was built.\n\nFor the information of the Department please I understand the matter has not been taken up with the Indian Agent's office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nJune 23rd 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Blue Quill's Residential School.\n\nI beg to inform the department that on Saturday a.m. I received a call from Father Pratt stating that the freezing unit of the school refrigerator was not working. Saturday afternoon I was into the school and inspected the freezing unit.\n\nFor your information I would state that the unit is of the Kelvinator Type with the compressor and engine on the outside of the refrigerator; it did not appear to be in any too good shape and I was informed it started giving trouble on Friday June 13th last and was certainly not working properly when I saw it on Saturday June 21st.\n\nFather Pratt informed me that it would cost in the neighborhood of $60.00 to have a man out from Edmonton\u2014Ryan Bros\u2014to put the unit in order. Saturday morning he requested me to wire the department for this authority however I am air mailing instead and if the department authorize this expenditure, I would ask to be informed by wire.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B.

Children returned to both schools on Sept. 23rd. A fair response resulted at the present there being 16 absent from Blue Quills School, most of them away with their parents threshing on the outside. Some six children are absent from the Edmonton School. A few new recruits went to school but up to the time of writing have not received their applications. Called at the Blue Quills School once during the month before the school opened to inspect bake oven that the repairs are being paid for by the department. The progress of the building of the addition to this school is very slow and it would appear very doubtful that it will be finished this year. It would appear that the school undertook just about a little more than they can manage.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nW.B.

This work was carried out by the Don Swille Hardware Co. and paid for by this office No. 375 in the sum of $218.00.\n\nI would refer you to the third paragraph of my letter in which I stated that the plant was not in good shape. Further to this a salesman called at the school last fall and wrote me in regard to the plant and I quote from his letter: \"With regard to the old outfit which you might wish to trade-in, we understand it has been in use for ten or eleven years. Apart from natural wear it is now very much antiquated and its resale value is questionable, etc., etc.\"\n\nI am not aware if the department would consider a new plant being installed or if funds would be available. I am sure that the plant has been giving trouble before it was traded last year and as stated above it would appear that the natural wear is making the plant a bill of expenses to operate.\n\nIf the dept. is prepared to go to the expense of a new plant I would go carefully into the price and install-ation features of a new plant.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOct 1941.\nBlue Quill School, St-Paul, Alberta.\n12th March 1942.\n\nTo W.F.B.

Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alta., at the school.\n\nAlthough prices have advanced slightly, and we look for still further increases, we will confirm our initial quotation at this time, subject to fairly prompt acceptance, and subject, of course, to increased taxes or other expenses over which we have no control.\n\nOur quotation is based on the installation of cooling rooms being 3\" of cork in equivalent.\n\nFor the necessary equipment to cool a room 8' x 5' x 9', we would specify a C 6 A 1/2 H.P. Mills Compressor with No. 12 - 4 speed air way Blower Coil. With this unit you can control the running time to suit the weather conditions. The equipment in question would be of the latest designs and finest quality, and would provide maximum efficiency in refrigeration service at a minimum operating cost. The price on this equipment, including freight all charges, freight, and service for 12 months, you to supply chemicals, is $435.00.\n\nConnections to be brought within 25' of compressor.\n\nFor a unit to cool a room 11' x 5' x 9', we would specify a heavy duty C 2 A 1/2 H.P. Mills Compressor with a No. 15 - 4 speed air conditioned Coil. Our price on this would be $550.00 installed and usual 12 months free service.\n\nIn the event of our supplying a single speed coil $20.00 would be deducted from above prices, but for the difference in cost we can assure you the 4 speed coil would be by far the most...\nINTER-OFFICE CORRESPONDENCE\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nRegarding your request for refrigeration equipment, we understand your concern about the cost-effectiveness of such an investment. We assure you that our refrigeration units are designed to provide excellent value for money.\n\nWe have been in the business for several years and have gained a reputation for reliability and efficiency. Our equipment is well-maintained and has proven to be highly effective in various settings.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that our refrigeration units will meet your requirements and provide you with satisfactory service. We look forward to your order.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRyan Bros. Ltd.\nDr. B. Blundell\nUNIT COOLERS\n\nCABINETS:\n\nCabinets are attractively designed and constructed entirely of non-corrosive materials. Corners are rounded which make for easier appearance and integral channel members across the top of unit provide rugged means for ease of installation. Units are furnished in brown baked on wrinkled enamel finish. Upon request, they may be supplied in any color at slight additional cost.\n\nCABINET BOTTOM PAN INSULATED:\n\nThe bottom of the cabinet is thoroughly insulated to eliminate accumulation of condensate on the outside.\n\nCOOLING ELEMENT:\n\nThe cooling element is made of 3/8\" O.D. seamless copper tubing with aluminum fins hydraulically bonded to tubes. Fins are arranged vertically thereby assuring quick drainage of condensate. All elements have four parallel banks of tubes manifolded so as to increase operating efficiency and assure complete distribution of liquid refrigerant throughout the entire element. The ratio of secondary surface (fin surface) to primary surface (tube surface) is 5.9 to 1.0 in all elements.\n\nPhysical Dimensions of Unit Coolers\n\n| Model Number | H   | W   | D   | C   | O.D. | A   | B   | S   | L   |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 10           | 16  | 17  | 19  | 2   | 21   | 18  | 9   | 5   | 1   |\n| 12           | 17  | 17  | 19  | 2   | 21   | 18  | 9   | 5   | 1   |\n| 15           | 20  | 21  | 24  | 3   | 23   | 22  | 10  | 7   | 1   |\n| 18           | 23  | 24  | 27  | 3   | 26   | 25  | 10  | 7   | 1   |\n| 21           | 26  | 27  | 30  | 3   | 29   | 28  | 10  | 7   | 1   |\n| 22           | 26  | 27  | 30  | 4   | 29   | 28  | 10  | 7   | 1   |\n| 24           | 29  | 30  | 33  | 4   | 32   | 31  | 11  | 7   | 1   |\n| 27           | 32  | 33  | 36  | 4   | 35   | 34  | 11  | 7   | 1   |\n\nS - SUCTION LINE SIZE\nL - LIQUID LINE SIZE\nP - 3 PIPE TAP DOWN\nUNIT COOLERS\n\nFor Room Temperatures Above 32\u00b0 F.\n\nMcQuay Unit Coolers provide uniform refrigeration throughout all portions of Walk-In coolers, storage rooms, beer keg storage rooms and all types of fixtures where forced air circulation is desirable. Unit coolers eliminate the necessity of overhead bunkers and make possible additional storage space.\n\nUnit coolers are available in the Three-Way Design arrangement as illustrated. This patented feature makes possible improved air diffusion throughout storage room. It is suggested that the unit be installed and the adjustable louvers placed in proper position to attain full benefits from this advantage.\n\n| Unit Cooler Model Number | Code Word | Rating in B.T.U. per Hour | Net Weight | Shipping Weight | List Price With Valve | List Price Without Valve |\n|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| 50                       | CEBAH     | 187                       | 2965       | 3740            | 55                    | 73                     | $58.50                  | $55.00                  |\n| 32                       | CHAVY     | 217                       | 3705       | 4940            | 80                    | 100                    | $128.50                 | $135.00                 |\n| 35                       | CHEKU     | 389                       | 5835       | 7780            | 105                   | 120                    | $155.50                 | $140.00                 |\n| 38                       | CHURU     | 535                       | 9900       | 13060           | 135                   | 161                    | $210.50                 | $195.00                 |\n| 33                       | CLAVE     | 619                       | 9265       | 12390           | 135                   | 161                    | $191.50                 | $170.00                 |\n| 21                       | CORKY     | 750                       | 11250      | 15000           | 168                   | 206                    | $231.50                 | $200.00                 |\n| 22                       | COWBOY    | 851                       | 12500      | 17028           | 164                   | 210                    | $221.50                 | $200.00                 |\n| 24                       | CUDID     | 1056                      | 15560      | 21120           | 275                   | 350                    | $271.50                 | $250.00                 |\n| 27                       | CYBOL     | 1319                      | 19765      | 26390           | 362                   | 462                    | $321.50                 | $300.00                 |\n\nPhysical Data for Unit Coolers\n\n| Unit Cooler Model No. | Motor Specifications | Fan Cu.

You might review the matter again with the Principal, with a view to ascertaining if the present refrigeration plant could be repaired so as to last another year or two.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W. P. B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\nOttawa,\nJuly 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your report for the month of September, 1941, you wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The progress of the building of the addition to this school is very slow and it would appear very doubtful that it will be finished this year.\"\n\nSince that time we have not received any report from you regarding this matter. As you are aware, the Department did not request the school authorities to erect an addition but they voluntarily offered to do so.\n\nI should appreciate receiving from you a report indicating what progress has been made in its erection and if the new addition conforms with the present building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nBlue Quills Res. School,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\nJuly 21, 1942\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of July 16th, 1942 I beg to inform you that, notwithstanding difficulties to obtain construction materials on account of war restrictions and scarcity of workmen, our new building is progressing satisfactorily although slowly and we hope to be in a position to have a place in readiness for manual training about the end of September next.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L. Balter, O.M.I., Principal\nDear Sir;\n\nReference to the above file and your letter dated 16th ult. I have to inform you that progress of the building is now continuing; it is hoped to have the first floor ready for use by the opening of School approximately last Sept. next but of this I am doubtful.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter and the question \"if the new addition conforms with the present building?\" The appearance will conform with the present school. It will be finished with a brick veneer and the school authorities hope to get bricks to match those of the school. The new addition will be of only semi-fire proof construction being of frame construction, ship lapped brick veneer on the outside, with hyp-rock plaster board finish on the inside, built on concrete footings, with Tar & felt roof. The building is approximately 40 feet wide by 90 feet long cornering on to the back north east corner of the present school building. The new building will be used - downstairs, Manual Training shop, recreation hall, class room, teacher's room, boys' lavatories and small store room. Second floor sleeping quarters.\n\nFather Buchard stated it would cost approximately $17,000.00. I stated some time ago to the Principal of the school they should have employed an architect. It is a large building to undertake on a sketchy plan, without reference to the heating and sewerage and to the capacity of the present heating plant and more particular as to the sewage disposal. The heating could be handled without much difficulty in any case.\n\nA further report will be submitted monthly from now on.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWP.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\nSaddle Lake, Alta., Aug. 8, 1942.\n\nREPORT FOR MONTH OF JULY.\n\nThe Blue Quill's school was visited on the evening of July 23rd to see the progress of new building which is very slow. The whole of the school premises and some of the buildings have a down at the heel appearance and it is to be hoped that the new principal will make improvements and there is plenty of room to put up a real showing.\n\nW.P. B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nre Refrigeration.\n\nI beg to inform you that on my recent visit to the Blue Quills School, Father LeTour asked me to write to the department and have you review the correspondence in connection with the purchase of a new refrigeration as outlined in my letter of June 20th last.\n\nFather LeTour is of the opinion and I am too that this kind of equipment will be very difficult to obtain in another year. I am still informed by Bruce Robinson Electric Co., Ltd., that they can still supply their equipment as outlined in their letter which you have in your possession.\n\nIt would appear that the present refrigeration plant is about at the end of its usefulness and while still working and doing the job I am very doubtful that it will get thru another season.\n\nOn behalf of the Principal of the School I would ask you to reconsider the purchase of a new plant.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nN.B. I would refer you to my letter of June 20th last and to the third paragraph in which I asked you to return the quotations for my file.

The present refrigeration plant is approximately eleven years old and was probably installed at the time the school was built. The request for a new refrigeration unit at this school has been under consideration for at least two years. An expenditure of approximately $48.00 was incurred in repairs to this plant in June, 1941. The Principal of the school, in a letter to the Agent dated March 12, 1942, states:\n\n\"This system gives us trouble every year and we are obliged to bring our meat to St. Paul, four miles from here, for storage.\"\n\nI am attaching hereto letter and quotation received by the Indian Agent from Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd., Edmonton, Alta. Indian Agent Pugh, in a letter dated September 14, states:\n\n\"I am still informed by Bruce Robinson Electric Co. Ltd. that they can still supply their equipment as outlined in their letter which you have in your possession.\"\n\nThe Agent recommends that in view of the urgent need for this equipment at the school the request for the refrigeration unit be very carefully and sympathetically reviewed. The Agent is anxious that we should return the pages of the catalogue and the quotation for his files.\n\nR.A.

The cistern overflow drain and the drain from the boilerroom floor sump join outside the building and discharge through a 6\" V.T. pipe into a slough north of the school. A floor drain from the garage in the building also runs into this line. The invert of the overflow at the cistern is 2.5 feet higher than the boiler room floor and the invert of the drain at the slough is 3.7 feet lower than the boiler room floor.\n\n\"The serious flooding of the boiler room (and of the well pump room which is on the same level) occurred several years ago in the spring when the lower portion of the drain to the slough was frozen. Roof water from the spring rains filled the cistern end the overflow backed up through the boiler room floor drain since the slough outlet was blocked by ice. Some trouble is experienced each spring by similar freezing of the outlet from the boiler room floor drain but the cistern has not been killed at the same time and no flooding has occurred in recent years. There is slight possibility of the slough water rising enough to back up into the boiler room as the highest known level of the slough is some 1.7 feet lower than the boiler room floor, the level on May 20 being 2.7 feet lower than the floor.\n\n\"A repetition of the flooding of the lower levels of the building would be prevented by providing separate outlets for the boiler room floor drain and the cistern overflow. However, the outside drain pipes, being fairly shallow, would be likely to freeze and cause some degree of flooding. Therefore, I would recommend that the drainage be left as at present with a lamp hole being provided halfway between the building and the slough outlet so that a steam line from the boiler could be passed down the pipe to keep it thawed. The main drain should be uncovered at this point, a Y branch and 1/8th bend inserted in the line and tile pipe brought up to the ground surface and fitted with a wooden removable plug. This work is estimated to cost $25.00.\"\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\"The cistern water has not been used for laundry purposes because of the fear of hardness and possible contamination from the refrigerator drain which discharged into the cistern. This drain has been diverted to discharge into the main laundry drainage system and the school authorities will use the cistern for the laundry as was originally intended. There is very small likelihood of any water overflowing from the cistern in future as both the school principal, Father Le Tour, and the school engineer, Mr. Dubois, are now advised of the circumstances leading to flooding.\n\n(2) Septic Tank\n\n\"The school septic tank was completely full of sludge at the time of my visit and it is very evident that much of the troublesome odour is due to lack of cleaning. The tank was built in 1930 and was completely cleaned in 1935 and partially cleaned in 1938. Apparently the objectionable odour was not noticed until a year after each cleaning. Father Le Tour, the principal, will have the tank cleaned at the end of this month when the children are away. Periodic cleaning of the tank will, I believe, relieve the condition complained of.\n\n\"I am forwarding under separate cover tracing of sketch plan showing septic tank details as obtained from plans of the original installation supplemented by information supplied by the school engineer. The capacity of the septic chamber is ample for a school population of 130 and there is no sign of obstruction in the discharge pipe for the effluent. However, the existing manhole is small and not well placed for cleaning the tank and I would recommend that an additional manhole be built as indicated on the tracing.\n\n\"It is also apparent that the tank is poorly ventilated as the soil inlet is an elbow and there is no direct connection from the air space in the tank to a vent pipe. I would therefore recommend that the inlet elbow be replaced by a tee. The odours complained of apparently come from gas escaping into the pump well and from there to the school. To prevent this, all openings in the pump well should be fitted with airtight hatches and these should be kept closed. The estimated cost of these alterations and modifications is $125.00.\"\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Cornish is of the opinion that the freezing of the drain and consequent flooding of the boiler room can be prevented by making provision for thawing the drain at a cost of $25.00; also that the objectionable odour from the septic tank could be prevented by cleaning out the tank. To facilitate this he recommends that an additional manhole be constructed. The cost of this and some slight alterations to prevent the escape of gas is estimated to be $125.00.\n\nMr. Walker states that this work can be carried out by the School Authorities without further reference to this office.\nWhile at the School Mr. Cornish inspected other facilities and regarding Fire Protection stated as follows:\n\n\"The fire escapes are in good condition but in many cases hard of access from the second floor where access doors are in staff rooms with a bed placed across the opening which is consequently secured closed and blocked against drafts.\"\n\nIt is suggested that this condition be brought to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nT.

To facilitate this the Surveys & Engineering Branch recommend an additional manhole at a cost of $125.00. No doubt Mr. Cornish of the Surveys & Engineering Branch explained the matter fully to the Principal and you may authorize an expenditure of $150.00 to effect these improvements.\n\nThe representative of the Surveys & Engineering Branch also reports regarding fire protection at this school as follows:\n\n\"The fire escapes are in good condition but in many cases hard of access from the second floor where access doors are in staff rooms with a bed placed across the opening which is consequently securely closed and blocked against drafts.\"\nYou should bring this matter to the attention of the Principal immediately in order that the condition may be remedied.

Pugh, Esq., Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nRe: Sewage System - Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, with enclosure, both of which are self-explanatory.\n\nYou will note that Part 2 of the Surveys and Engineering Branch report deals with the septic tank; The trading of sketch plan referred to in paragraph 2 of this part of the report, has not been received here; the principal and the engineer will, I presume, have a rough draft of this; if not, and this tracing of sketch is required before the work can be started, you will please write to the Department at once, asking them for same.\n\nThe first part of the report refers to:\n(a) Flooding of the boiler room;\n(b) Cistern overflow;\n(c) Freezing of outside drain-pipes which are shallow, and the thawing of same.\n\nParagraph 2 of this part of the report refers to the cistern water, and possible contamination from the refrigerator drain: It would appear from this report that both the principal and the school engineer have been advised regarding this trouble.\n\nI have to ask you to give this matter your immediate attention by calling at the school and making arrangements to have the work done at once, according to plan and specifications.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to submit vouchers to the Department in the amount of $150.00, which is the sum authorized by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Viz., $125.00 for an additional manhole, &c., and $25.00 for making provision to thaw out the drain pipes.\n\nWhen this work has been completed, please let me have copy of correspondence exchanged in this regard; also a statement of vouchers submitted, giving Voucher number, in favour of whom, showing whether material or labour, and amount.\n\nC.

Schmidt, with more particular reference to Paragraph No. 2 of Engineer's Cornish's report in which he states a tracing of sketch was being enclosed. I beg to inform you that this was not received by Mr. Schmidt or this office.

Flooding of the boiler room;\n2. The septic tank.\n\nIn Mr. Cornish's report, which you sent to me in your memorandum of June 21, he makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am forwarding under separate cover tracing of sketch plan showing septic tank details as obtained from plans of the original installation supplemented by information supplied by the school engineer. The capacity of the septic chamber is ample for a school population of 120 and there is no sign of obstruction in the discharge pipe for the effluent. However, the existing manhole is small and not well placed for cleaning the tank and I would recommend that an additional manhole be built, as indicated on the tracing.\"\n\nMr. W.F.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alta., has written to me requesting a copy of the tracing referred to by Mr. Cornish, in order to enable the school management to install the additional manhole.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta  \n31st July 1943.\n\nC.P. Schmidt Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary,\n\nRe: Fire Escapes at the Blue Quill Indian Residential School.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th inst re above and quoting Engineer's Cornish's report, he stated the facts as you and I are aware of them but he did not offer a remedy and for your information Mr. Cornish, Father Letour and myself discussed what might help the situation, however like so many more reports, it still leaves the man in the field on the \"spot\".\n\nYou are aware of the plan of the staff rooms covering the approaches to the fire escapes on the second floor of the school and to refresh your memory find plan attached. You will readily see the difficulty of placing a bed in the rooms. To say the doors are blocked against drafts is purely, I mildly, I was in the rooms in the middle of the day last winter and to say they were drafty and cold would be a misstatement of facts, they were more like being in an open cockpit airplane at 50 below zero. It was just impossible to keep them habitable, with the inside door left open, they are still very very cold.\n\nIn your note attached you mention my monthly reports in which I have inspected or referred to fire escapes, they are constantly in my mind. You also mention \"fire Proof\" building - which the school staff always refer to the building as fire proof - you call it semi-fire proof. On the 19th July I went thru all the plans and specifications at the school to see if there is any reference to \"fire proof\", there apparently is not. However I have inspected the school very carefully this summer and there is no wood used in the construction even all floors are concrete also staircases and the roof is supported with wire rods. The building would undoubtedly appear fire proof.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, when at the school on the 19th July we discussed the fire escapes and approaches at length.\n\nOn your next inspection, we will check them together.\n\n\"W. P. B. Push\" (Sig)\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nCop. for your information please.

Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nAttention: Mr. P. B. Pugh\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of October 9th with reference to file SS for 1 only V401 Diaphragm Pump.\n\nWe beg to quote you $41.00 on this order F.o.b. our warehouse with delivery approximately 15 days.\n\nTrusting to be favoured with your valued order, we remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMANAGER\nHeavy Goods Department\n\nDescription of Pump. Diaphragm Pump. Size hose 3\", capacity-hour gals 3500. Weight each 175 lbs. Specially adapted for pumping large quantities of muddy or slimy water containing grit, sand, coal or any material which would destroy plunger type pumps. Handle may be attached to either side of pump. Rubber Diaphragm is made from selected rubber, pliable & durable. See Page A 184\u2014Marshall Wells Catalog.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 118-1-5. Re Sewage System, Blue Quill's School.\n\nReference your letter of the above file dated 25 June and addressed to Inspector C.F. Schmidt, for your information, the work on the septic tank has been carried out in accordance with the instructions. Father Letour Principal of the School is now preparing the accounts; he assures me that there will be enough money left out of the amount allowed to purchase a Diaphragm pump for the future use in cleaning out the septic tank at regular intervals.\n\nI would recommend the purchase of the pump at a cost of $50.00, attached a letter from Marshall Wells Alberta Co., Ltd., however to add to this price will be certain connections, which will be gone into in detail if the pump is allowed.\n\nFor your information the tank up till this year had not been cleaned out for five years and the job was no honey pail job, it was terrific, and instead of the material being a liquid it was a sludge and was all dipped out with pails and hauled away in barrels approximately 5000 gals. If a suitable pump was purchased the tank could be easily cleaned about twice a year and the tanks would remain active in regards to their bacteria action. Before the cleaning this summer it was evident that the tanks had just got to a ludge and the bacteria was smothered.\n\nI trust the department will see their way to allow the purchase of a suitable pump. A pump like the one quoted on I am informed by the Rev. Ellis is doing good work and keeping the tank working very well at the St. Barnabas Anglican School, Onion Lake.\n\nWP.\n\nH.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 30, 1943.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the work that has been done in connection with the sewage system at the Blue Quills School. The Department approves the purchase of a diaphragm pump to be used for cleaning out the septic tank at regular intervals. If this is done there should be no further difficulty and I feel certain that you will impress on the management the necessity of giving the desired attention to the septic tank.\n\nR.A.

Father Latour,\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSaint Paul,\nAlta.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe Blue Quill's Residential School.\n\nI beg to report that the roof of the above school is leaking in about six or eight places around vents, also the roof of the laundry is leaking.\n\nFor your information I have checked the leaks and as you will be aware to repair leaks on the built up roofs is a very difficult task and must be very carefully done or else they become worse. I would recommend that a Professional Roofer be employed from Edmonton, to insure that a good repair job is made. For your information I do not know of a first class roofer in St. Paul district. I have discussed the matter with the Principal Father L.C. Latour and he is of the same opinion.\n\nIn regards to an estimate of the cost I am not in a position to give this owing to the work that might be entailed to make a good job of the leaks. I would further state that in six leaks and the ceiling over the laundry, damage is being caused to the plaster.\n\nI would ask authority to get this work underway as soon as possible.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nVia Air Mail\nOttawa,\nJune 8, 1944.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, with reference to the roof at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom the information given in your letter it is difficult for the Department to estimate what the probable expenditure would be. If you think that the repairs could be made at a cost not exceeding $150, we have no objection to your proceeding at once. However, if the possible expenditure exceeds the amount stated, it is felt that an estimate should first be obtained and submitted for our consideration. I agree that it is essential that the roof should be repaired, but at the same time the specific amount provided in our appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Blue Quills School has already been expended in providing the material requested for the hog pen.\n\nR.A.

Explanations were requested regarding two items on that voucher and no reply has yet been received.

Copy of purchase order was forwarded to the Principal on April 20, 1944. As yet we have not received the account, and we do not know whether or not the material reached the school. If the items shown on the purchase order were received, the account should be certified and forwarded for payment.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would point out to the Principal that as soon as material is received in good order the account should be certified and forwarded.

This account would appear to be in order for payment.\n\nFor your information he has one more trip out this winter to check two reported leaks in the roof after his repair work last fall, to date I have not had his account. I understand he is putting his account in for expenses only. I have written him in this connection.\n\nIn regards to the second paragraph of your letter, I have taken this matter up with the Hayward Lumber Co., Ltd. and the Principal and I expect the account will be submitted within the next two weeks without fail.\n\nI regret the delay in these accounts being forwarded. I think I explained to Mr. Phelan the reason for the delay in the North-West Roofing Co. account; it was owing to two leaks developing after the roof was repaired in the fall.\n\nWPPB.\n\nH.F.B.

Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nEncl.\nOTTAWA, January 27, 1948.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Needed Equipment at Blue Quills School\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYour dietitian in her report on the above Indian school dated November 4, 1947, recommended the following equipment and alterations:\n\n1. Installation of proper dishwashing and pot washing facilities.\n2. Replacement of cook stove.\n3. Enlargement of walk-in refrigerator.\n4. Large cook's table,\n5. Potato peeler.\n6. Electric mixer.\n7. Cooking utensils - kettles, mixing bowls and knives.\n8. A large tank for a continuous supply of hot water.\n9. Repair of flooring in kitchen, diningroom and dishwashing room.\n\nWhen the above have been provided for it is hoped that the school will be in a better position to satisfy the requirements of your expert in nutrition.\n\nThis school has no hen house and this has been a serious handicap for the supply of proper food for the children. When I visited this institution last fall, I told the then Acting Principal that I would do my best to bring this matter to your attention. It is the intention of Reverend Father Bernet-Rollande to secure plan for a hen house large enough for 400 hens. When this has been done, and the quantity of lumber and materials made out, I shall present the list to your Department for its approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Flourde, O.M.I.\nJanuary 29, 1948.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th instant with reference to equipment recommended by the dietitian for the Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, some of the equipment recommended has not been supplied to residential schools in the past. In addition, our funds are so limited at the present time that we are not in a position to consider heavy expenditures.\n\nThe contents of your letter will receive further consideration after April 1st.\n\nIt is noted that the principal intends to request materials for the erection of a hen house. The Department hopes that he will give careful consideration to the matter before presenting his request. Care should be taken not to provide a hen house larger than is absolutely necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O.

Hayward Lumber Company Limited,\n   Edmonton, Alberta\n\n2. The Imperial Lumber Company Limited,\n   St. Paul, Alberta\n\nfor material needed to erect a colony brooder house and double deck laying house for the above institution.\n\nThis school has been without a hen-house or any facilities for keeping chickens for several years past and your dietitian has found fault with this handicap, and has suggested the immediate construction of such a building. The brooder is for the raising of baby chicks and is quite essential at the present time on any farm.\n\nThe principal wants to start construction of both the brooder and the hen-house immediately so as to be able to have them ready for the coming season. I might add that these estimates were made from plans supplied by the Federal Branch of Agriculture.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your immediate attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nEncl. 2.\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $135.89 to purchase materials required for the erection of a brooder house at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nAs there is no mention of labour it is presumed that the school management will do the necessary work in erecting this house without cost to the Department.\n\nOwing to the lack of funds it is not possible for us to consider allowing the amount requested for the hen house. We will give the matter further consideration after April 1st when we know what amount will be available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 but at the present time I am not in a position to give you definite assurance that the amount requested will be available. In the meantime I would like to know if we supply the materials whether the school management will do the work without cost or if an expenditure will be necessary for labour. In the latter event, we would like to know the approximate cost of labour so that we will have an adequate picture of the whole transaction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nLaurier Avenue East,\nOttawa.\n\nPP/MGD\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account amounting to $135.89 covering the cost of materials required for repairs to the brooder house at the Blue Quills Residential School. The labour for the erection of the addition to the house is being provided by the school management. We were obliged to order the materials immediately so that the house could be repaired at once in order that space would be available for young chicks.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

Gooderham, Esq.\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Blue Quills School.\n\nThis will advise that I have made a recent check on the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, and certain repairs that are required. You may recall on your last visit to Saddle Lake Agency, that we paid the School a visit, and one point brought up by the Rev. Father Rollande concerned the roof.\n\nThere are about four places on the roof that will require repairing. I have made various enquiries in and around St. Paul in an endeavour to obtain prices from various contractors for the repairing of the roof, and I find that the majority of them have a full season lined up. I have one letter here from Mr. B. B. HOLLINGER of the Mid-West Insulation Service, (copy of which is attached) and I would like to know if it would be in order to have him come out as soon as possible, and get his prices not only on repairing the roof, but there are approximately 145 windows that should be caulked. I noticed during the cold part of the winter, that the rooms were very drafty and hard to keep warm. There is no doubt in my mind that the windows was the cause for same, and would be of great help to the fuel account should it be possible to have them caulked. All the houses here at the Agency were caulked by the Mid-West Insulation Service, and I feel they were vastly improved for winter conditions.\n\nI would like to see this work completed between the first part of July, and the first of September, and in the meantime would greatly appreciate any advice in this regards.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent,\nSaddle Lake Agency.\nE. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSaddle Lake.\n\nAttached is copy of a letter received from the Superintendent in which he states the repairs required to this building.\n\nThe Midwest Insulation Service may be capable of making these repairs, though I did not know that this company repaired tar and gravel roofs. However, it is an insulating company and has done considerable work in insulating homes of staff and Indians throughout the province, and can be recommended for this work.\n\nWould authority be granted to call for tenders on the repairs to the roof and the insulating, as suggested by Mr. Taylor? I do know the roof must be repaired, as it is leaking badly in spots and damage is being done.\n\nYou might answer direct to the Superintendent with a copy to this office.\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nenc.\nJune 4, 1948.\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, St. Brides, Alta.\n\nRegional Supervisor Gooderham has forwarded to us copy of your letter to him dated May 26th regarding the Blue Quills School.\n\nThe Department approves you calling for tenders for repairs to the roof and the insulating mentioned in your letter. When we have this information we will be in a position to decide if funds are available.\n\nYou should keep in mind that we have already agreed to supply the materials, at least, for the new hen house at this school. In this connection I direct your attention to official letter of May 4th to which we have not yet received a reply.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention Col. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 4th, 1948, File 118-1-5(E.1), this will advise that I have made various attempts to get an estimate on the repairing of the roof of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, and the results have not been very favourable. On the 29th instant I received an offer from Mr. MARCHAND, General Maintenance Superintendent for the Franciscan Fathers, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nMr. MARCHAND's quotations are as follows:\nFor the two wings of the School, and the roof over the garage and Kitchen 6900 square feet will have to be repaired. Damage is caused from crushed rock, which was put on this roof in place of pea-gravel.\n\nMaterial required:\n250 gallons of Asbestos Cement $437.50\n120 yds burlap 40 inches wide $35.20\nLabour for three men $461.90\n\nThe labour also includes the corking of 125 windows at $1.00 each, and 16 doors at $2.00 each. I was shown work done by Mr. MARCHAND on the St. Theresa Hospital in St. Paul, and it appears to be very satisfactory, as well as being a good looking job.\n\nMr. MARCHAND informed me that he would be able to do the School within the next two weeks, but would be unable to do so at a later date. May I please be advised by return wire, whether or not it will be in order to have this work completed.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent,\nSaddle Lake Agency.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nAugust 4, 1948.\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor, Supt. Indian Agency, St. Brides, Alta.,\n\nWe have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the repairs required to the roof of the Blue Quills Residential School. The Purchasing Agent has been requested to secure the asbestos cement and burlap.\n\nWhen the material is received, we approve an expenditure of $461.10 for labour.

We would appreciate it if the material could be secured as soon as possible as the labour is now available and we would like to have the work done before the school reopens in September.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED: [Signature]\n\nAPPROVED: [Signature] For Director\n\nNOTE: 1.

All Requisitions should be submitted in duplicate. One copy will be returned as acknowledgment.\nWhile at Saddle Lake yesterday Mr. Connolly, Supervising Engineer Indian Health Services, and I were asked to look over the residential school, particularly refrigeration, roofs, and windows.\n\nThe present refrigeration is a well insulated room 6' x 8', adjacent to a pantry off the main kitchen. The Principal wants more space, part of it to be cooled below 32 degrees where he can keep meat, in other words a freezer. Our opinion is that the present refrigerator would make the freezer and that the pantry should be insulated and turned into ordinary refrigeration. Miss Macready visited this school. Her report should be on file somewhere. I regard the project as important to health and Mr. Connolly says that it is feasible.\n\nWe went over the tar and gravel flat roofs, which cover the whole school building. They are 16-17 years old and are leaking. A Mr. Marchand, who talked as if he knew the business, is mending and patching the roofs without guarantee of payment. Mr. Connolly and Mr. Marchand agree that the whole roof will have to be replaced next year. All that can be done at this time is to patch the bad places so as to minimize interior damage during the winter and spring. One of the objects of this letter is to hope that some arrangement can be made to ensure the patching and the payment of Mr. Marchand for doing it. He seems to have done about $150.00 worth of work up to date.\n\nMr. Marchand was actually officially engaged to caulk the window frames. He found that there was as much leaking space around the sash as between the frames and brickwork. There is a curious arrangement of weather stripping consisting of a loose slat of hardwood at each side of the sash, fitting into the groove in which the sash slides up and down. Mr. Marchand is nailing on some of these slats, the only feasible emergency repair, and not a bad one. This work is not covered by his engagement for caulking. It is thought that $500 worth of time and materials will be required to make these windows reasonably weatherproof.\nCALGARY, Alberta  \nSeptember 16th, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,  \nSuperintendent of Education,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a letter which was received from Dr. Stone. Apparently he and Mr. Cannolly went over the school without our Superintendent, Mr. Taylor. Since he raised certain points with regard to repairs and the cost of these repairs, I am not waiting until I contact Mr. Taylor before submitting this information to you.\n\nOn reference to our files, it is noted that Mr. Taylor asked for authority on July 30th to accept an offer from Mr. Marshand to repair the roof and cork windows and doors. The impression left by Dr. Stone was that a very small amount was allowed.\n\nI know the roof of this school is bad. It was built at the same time that the Old Sun School on the Blackfoot Reserve was erected. The Old Sun roof has already been renewed. A complete bonded roof is the only solution, and it will be expensive. You should be prepared to do this work next year.\n\nIn regard to the other repairs which the Doctor mentions in his letter, and in respect to the additional refrigeration space, I would appreciate it if you could let me know how much money might be available beyond what is already authorized. I will then contact Mr. Taylor.\n\nC. H. Gooderham,  \nSupervisor of Indian Agencies.\nSeptember 22, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Residential School\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, we authorized an expenditure of $461.00 for labour and $63.00 for material, for repairing the roof at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that you consider a new roof should be placed on this school during the summer of 1949.\n\nPlease have Superintendent Taylor give us an estimate of the cost of a new roof so that we can give the matter final consideration when we are preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nIn connection with Dr. Stone's suggestion for increasing the space for refrigeration purposes, you might also have Mr. Taylor submit an estimate of the cost.\n\nBernard F.

However James STEINHAUER, Contractor (Treaty Indian) quoted his price at $1,039.20. I feel quite satisfied he has the ability of giving as much satisfaction, and as good a job as any one.\n\nI would recommend, should Funds be available, that $2,500.00 be granted for this project, and that James STEINHAUER be given the contract. I also feel that the care and the productive value of chickens be included as an Educational Interest to the Indian Children, for their future benefit. I will not hesitate to admit that the cost of this project is seemingly high, but it is considered that the results in the future will more than offset the Initial Outlay.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent,\nSaddle Lake Agency,\n\nCopies to:\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nRegional Supervisor,\nRev. E. B. Rollande, Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention Col. B.F. Neary,\n\nReference your file 11801-5 (E.1) dated May 4th, 1948, this will advise that I have taken the matter up with Rev. Father Rollande, as requested, concerning a hen house for the School.\n\nTo date there has been no facilities at Blue Quills for chickens and all eggs have been purchased for use at the School and at times purchasing of same was practically impossible.\n\nThe plans and materials listed were obtained from Experimental Farm Services, Department of Agriculture, Ottawa, Ontario. They are for a double deck laying house, size - 25 ft. x 31 ft., 2 storey. The Rev. Principal has purchased 150 Plymouth Rock pullets and I concur with his figures that this number of chickens are required. During the school term 1947 - 48 there were approximately 167 children in attendance.\n\nThe reason for the double deck laying house is to keep non-laying hens from mixing with the layers and thusly the non-layers can be fattened for consumption at the school. This, without a doubt, would be cheaper than buying meat.\n\nI am attaching a copy of the building plans for your consideration, and would respectfully request that they be returned if same appear to be satisfactory.\n\nI was informed that the school has no carpenters for this project, and the cost of construction was omitted on the original estimate by the principal. An endeavour was made, on various occasions, to obtain a price for construction by contractors and none were interested to any degree as they are (cont'd on page 2)\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA\nTERRACE BUILDING\n\nMESSRS Dominion Government, Department of Indian Affairs,\nBlue Quills School, ST.

The teacher in the senior room, which is made up of thirteen pupils in grades 7, 8 and 10, is qualified and appears to be doing a very good job. The other teachers were not qualified and at least one of them had no experience and only had a Grade 8 standing. The pupils were bright and happy and the institution in splendid order.\n\nThe return water line of the heating systems was inspected in so far as I could do so. As you know, it is leaky and, as a result, there is no pressure in the boiler. Unfortunately there will be considerable difficulty in finding the leaks as the location of the line is not known but something must be done immediately to correct this as the danger is great. I hope that authority has already been given because there is a competent engineering firm in St. Pauls to do the work. The management and discipline at this school is good. It is filled to capacity with a waiting list.\nDecember 15, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School\n\nThe comments made in your report on your recent visit to this school have been noted. It is unfortunate that there are three non-qualified teachers in this school.\n\nBy now the steam pipe should have been repaired as we sent the following telegram to Mr. Taylor on November 30th:\n\n\"Minister approves expenditure not exceeding $1,780. to repair steam pipes Blue Quills Residential School.\"\n\nBernard F.

H. Somerville, Superintendent of Mining Lands, Department of Lands and Mines, Edmonton, for a Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease covering the above land, and has been advised that your consent is required before a lease can be issued.\n\nThe St. Paul Utilities Limited supply natural gas to the town of St. Paul, Alberta, obtaining the gas from wells drilled by the St. Paul Syndicate. The Syndicate desires to drill an auxiliary well on the above land, partly to augment the supply to the town, but in addition thereto, to supply the Blue Quill Indian School at St. Paul with natural gas for heating purposes.\n\nAs the location of the proposed well on this land is more than 4,000 feet from your school there can be no danger, or reason why your consent should be withheld. We would, therefore, appreciate it very much if you would give this subject matter your kind consideration, and advise Mr. Somerville of the Department of Lands and Mines, Edmonton, accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWalter F. Thorn.\nWalter F. Thorn\nMoose Jaw, Sask.\nCanada\n\n208 Walter Scott Building,\nJanuary 14th, 1949.\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe Blue Quill Indian School,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nYou will recall my conversation with you on October 12th last with reference to the installation of natural gas and heating in the above school. At that time you contemplated sending your engineer to St. Paul to check into the costs, and at the time of our conversation we figured the costs at approximately $15,000.00, and that you would include this item in your Estimates for 1949.\n\nI do not know whether your engineer has had the time to visit the school and check into the costs, but I am enclosing a tender from the St. Paul Foundry Limited, and I am very pleased to note that the total cost is only $11,650.00, which is considerably less than my estimate.\n\nThis cost will be made up, not only in a saving of fuel costs to the school but in convenience and cleanliness and regulated heat, which will prevent illness among the students and faculty. The cost of decorating from time to time will, in itself over a period of years, return the cost of this installation.\n\nThe burning of coal in this school has been extremely expensive,\nnot only due to the high cost of the coal itself but in hauling charges from the railroad siding and the taking away of the ashes, and there will also be a saving in the operational costs as it will not require a full time engineer and fireman.\n\nInsurance rates should be reduced because this installation covers all safety features.\n\nThe advantages of natural gas over any other type of fuel are so well known that it is not necessary for me to say anything further. I most heartily recommend your serious consideration of this installation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWalter F. Thorn.\n\nWFT/FBD.\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your letter dated January 7th, 1949, file 751-5(E), regarding natural gas in the town of St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nThis will advise that the development of natural gas in the town of St. Paul, by the St. Paul Utilities Limited, is developed to the approximate extent of 75 per cent. That is to say, about 75 per cent of the town is supplied with natural gas at the present time, and further developments are being hindered due to shortage of piping materials.\n\nThe St. Paul Utilities Limited have two wells lying East of the town. No. 1 well being the main source. No. 2 well is not found satisfactory but can be used in case of an emergency. The main factor in this line is to get a third well and the location suggested is on the Blue Quills Residential School grounds lying West of the town. Should authority be granted for the drilling of a well on these grounds, I would not hesitate in recommending the installation of natural gas in this school.\n\nI would recommend that an Engineer of the Department visit the School, as there is no doubt that a far better picture would be obtained in this manner. Heating of this School has not been found too satisfactory and an Engineer may recommend changes or point out factors which would tend to lessen the cost of heating. I also feel that natural gas would be more economical under the present circumstances, and would pay dividends before many years.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nFebruary 5, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. D. J. ALLAN,\nSuperintendent of Reserves and Trusts.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of yesterday, please find attached additional correspondence with regard to the installation of natural gas for the Blue Quills Residential School. The letter which I sent you yesterday from Mr. Thorn dealt with the digging of the actual well on the school property. This correspondence deals with the installation of natural gas units in the school and is therefore of interest to you only insofar as it is related to the digging of the well.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. D. J. McLean,\nSuperintendent of Reserves and Trusts.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of yesterday, please find attached additional correspondence with regard to the installation of natural gas for the Blue Quills Residential School.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nFebruary 23, 1949.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. W. M. Cory,\nDepartmental Solicitor.\n\nYour attention is drawn to a copy of P.C. 968 on file 751-9 attached. Does the Order in Council, in your opinion, vest title to Section 11, Township 58, Range 10, West of the 4th Meridian, in His Majesty in the right of Canada. If so, has the Minister of Mines and Resources administrative jurisdiction over it to the extent that he could alienate the mineral rights (oil rights) to an applicant for same, under the Regulations respecting petroleum and natural gas on Indian Reserves and Indian lands, P.C. 4509, in view of the fact that lands held for the administrative purposes of the Department, as in this instance, are neither Reserve lands nor Indian lands.\n\nCan you suggest any way in which the oil rights can be alienated?\n\nD. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\n\nDJM/MC\nFebruary 24, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Thorn:\n\nWe have been investigating the possibility of installing natural gas for heating at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School as previously discussed with you.\n\nUnfortunately, our heating engineer has not been available for trips to Western Canada as he has been engaged in major repairs at our schools in Ontario and the Maritimes.\n\nHowever, he is to leave shortly on an extensive inspection trip to Western Canada and I have asked him to visit the Blue Quills Residential School and to thoroughly investigate the possibility of installing natural gas at this institution.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Walter F. Thorn,\n208 Walter Scott Building,\nMoose Jaw, Saskatchewan.\n\nBFN/HM\nOttawa, February 24, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe above residential school is located very close to the town of St. Paul, Alberta. At the present time, natural gas is used in this town in some seventy-five percent of the homes and business concerns there. The St. Paul's Utilities Limited have two wells lying East of the town with number one well being the main source. This company has requested authority for the drilling of a well on the property occupied by this school.\n\nMr. Indian Superintendent Taylor has recommended that if natural gas is discovered there, that we consider the installation of it as a source of heating for this school. He has further recommended that a heating Engineer from the Department visit the school as he has found that the general heating has not been too satisfactory in the past. We have obtained from Walter F. Thorn of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, an estimate prepared by the St. Paul Foundry Limited for the installation of natural gas in this school. I attach a copy of this estimate for the information of your heating engineer.\n\nIt would be appreciated if arrangements could be made to have your heating engineer visit this school during the course of his visit to Western Canada and advise concerning the feasibility of such natural gas heating installations. He will be able to get further information from Mr. Indian Superintendent Taylor at St. Paul Alberta and from the St. Paul Foundry Limited.\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl:\nBFN/HM\nSaddle Lake Indian Agency,\nST.

Unfortunately, due to illness, he was removed before completing the building. The structure is always in this incomplete condition and we believe that something must be done either to complete or demolish it.\n\nWe would appreciate very much if one of your inspectors or architects could visit Blue Quills in the near future and submit a report to your Department on this problem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n30th April, 1949.\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Residential School\n\nWe have just been informed that there is an unfinished building at the above school. Erection of this building was started some years ago by a former Principal, but he was removed from the school before the building was completed.\n\nPlease let me know if you think we should complete the building or demolish it. Funds are provided in the current year's appropriation for this school.\n\nWe have also had a request for a potato peeler and a kitchen mixer at this school. You should consult the Principal and let us have a requisition showing the type of equipment required. The catalogue number should be stated if possible.\n\nYour early reply to the above matters would be appreciated.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Supt. of Indian Education:\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School,\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your letter of April 30th, under File 751-5(E.1), and I beg to report as follows:\n\nI have given this matter considerable study, and would recommend that the unfinished building be completed for the following reasons:\n\n(1) There are approximately 150 children of the R.C. faith not in attendance at School, and two or three Day Schools will have little or no effect on this matter of keeping the Blue Quills School filled.\n\n(2) There is no building available at this School for Manual Training, and the School is filled to capacity.\n\n(3) Should more Indian Pupils be desirous of a higher Education, despite the fact we have Day Schools on the Reserves, I feel this Building would be of great value.\n\n(4) At a recent Band Meeting at the Cold Lake Indian Reserve, I learned that this Band are against a Day School, and would recommend that they attend the Blue Quills School until such time as other arrangements could be made.\n\nFurther to the above this will advise that I have gone over the building with our Local Hayward Lumber Co. Agent, his Superintendent, and a Mr. Wilson contractor from Lloydminster, Sask. They gave me the following estimations. The Cement work (foundation, floors, etc.) and the Frame Work (walls, studing, etc.) at the present rates would cost in the vicinity of $8,000.00, and in the neighborhood of $20,000.00 to complete the building. This would include Material, Labour, Heating, and Lighting. Their prices for the demolishing of the building were $4,000.00, or $2,000.00 and materials salvaged, and this would mean a total loss for the Cement work.\n\nThe plans for this building were originally for\na Brick building, but under the existing circumstances, I do not feel that this would be satisfactory, as the quality of brick today is very poor, and prices extremely high. The quotations given me were for insulation and insul-brick on the outside. The dimensions of this building are; 40 feet wide, 80 feet long, two stories with 12 foot ceilings.\n\nI have quoted the facts above, that you may determine a little of the situation as it stands today. I would be able to obtain a more definite estimate on the completion of the building, but the estimate would not be far either way on $30,000.00. Mr. Wilson (contractor) informed me that he would rather give an estimate on day labour, than on a contract basis. His reasons were that a certain amount of the structure would have to be taken down, and rebuilt, as they are by no means suitable for a building of this size, and the parts to be taken down would take more time in order to salvage any of the material, than would the time and cost of straightforward building. On the east end of the building the foundation is cracked in two places, but would easily be repaired. The Cement floor is in a very good condition. The walls were partly insulated with shavings, but this would have to be removed, and re-insulated as part of the shavings have been ruined from weather conditions and exposure.\n\nI will endeavour to obtain any further information required, should it be felt that the building will be completed.\n\nI have informed the principal of the School on the last part of your letter, but this matter will be taken up under separate letter.\n\nW.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n507 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Residential School\n\nWe were recently informed that there is an unfinished building at the above school. Erection of this building was started some years ago by a former Principal, but he was removed from the school before the building was completed. Recently we wrote to Superintendent Taylor to obtain his opinion as to whether the building should be completed or demolished. In writing to Mr. Taylor we inadvertently stated that funds were available in the current year's appropriation for this school.\n\nThis statement was incorrect. The only funds we have in the current year's appropriation for the Blue Quills School are those for repairs and improvements and some equipment that were included in the Superintendent's estimates.\n\nIf it is eventually decided to complete this building, we might be able to secure a supplementary appropriation when the Parliament resumes its session, but we want it distinctly understood that we cannot make any definite promises to this effect.\nFor your information I attach a copy of Mr. Taylor's letter. Please let me have your comments on Mr. Taylor's letter and also any recommendation you care to make in the matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nPP/ST\nAttach.\nTo Superintendent of Education, Attention: Mr. Phalen, June 2nd, 1949.\n\n507 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\nJune 1st, 1949.\n\nW.

In any event, you should not anticipate anything this year beyond the appropriation for repairs, improvements and equipment, which were included in your estimates.\n\nYou should include an item in your 50/51 estimates to take care of this.\n\nG.

The plan to which it was partly built does not allow for much adaptation of the space for various uses.\n\nBy arrangement with the Superintendent the Principal was absent from the school.\n\nThe \"guest houses\" are still standing not far from the school.

The following report is submitted for your information and transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe above institution is located about two miles west of the Town of St Paul-de-M\u00e9tis, and it can be stated that it is one of the best kept buildings of all those visited by our officer to date.\n\nThe difficulties experienced in heating the building under severe weather conditions can be laid in part to a rather poor quality of coal which is hand fired, and in a large measure to the choice of the original piping design. As in many other cases in schools of similar layout, the piping distribution system was based on a vapour system designed to operate on several ounces of pressure. The ends of the mains are bled into a system of wet returns which means that no traps are used. This results in short circuiting when the pressure is raised in an attempt to obtain distribution of steam to the farthest points of the system. It will not be difficult or expensive to correct this phase of the design. The installation of float and thermostatic traps at the ends of the mains and branch mains will permit normal operating pressures of one to two lbs. per square inch to be used and will prevent short circuiting.\n\nThe heating system is served by two fire box type steel low pressure steam heating boilers. These boilers have been in service since the school was built and while they are not in the best condition, it is felt that they can provide several years of additional service.\n\nThe domestic hot water requirements cannot be served by the existing equipment. It is evident that insufficient consideration was given to the normal demands, in addition to which no distribution piping layout was made. The domestic hot water storage tank and the jacket heater are of capacities sufficient only to meet the light summer load.\n\nOne of the principal reasons for visiting this school was to investigate the possibility of converting from coal firing to natural gas firing. On February 24th a memorandum was received from Major MacKay together with an attached copy of a proposal to change to gas firing, prepared by the St. Paul Foundry Limited. We were requested to comment on this proposal at that time, but it was felt that our comment should be deferred until our heating engineer was able to carry out an inspection of the building.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe St. Paul Foundry Limited proposition dated January 11th outlined the work involved in connection with converting the boilers to gas firing and piping gas from the nearest source. The St. Paul Utilities Company have requested permission to drill a well on the school property, their intention being to connect this well to an existing gas well which serves the entire town.\n\nThe St. Paul Foundry Limited estimated on piping the gas from the nearest source, (presumably the proposed new well), to the school; the erection and equipping of a Regulating Station to include regulators, orifices, flanges, heaters, drips, pump, odorizer, motoring equipment, etcetera, plus converting the combustion chambers of the school boilers, installing burners, controls, etcetera. Their price was $11,650.00. It is felt that if this work is approved and tendered a lower price will be submitted by one or more competitive firms in the area.\n\nIn summary it can be stated that substantial savings in fuel costs will be realized if natural gas is provided. It would appear to be an extravagance to equip this building with stokers in lieu of gas burners, but some means of automatic firing is much to be preferred over hand firing in an institution of this size. After full consideration having been given, it is recommended that the following operations be carried out in order to bring this school up to a normal point of efficiency.\n\n(a) Install float and thermostatic traps at ends of all steam mains and branch mains.\n\n(b) Provide new 900 gallon domestic hot water storage tank.\n\n(c) Provide new indirect steam fed heater with self contained regulating valve; unit to have a capacity to heat 600 gallons of water per hour through 100 degree raise.\n\n(d) Provide new condensation pump and receiver to replace ineffective boiler return trap and air eliminator assembly.\n\n(e) It is considered advisable to take advantage of the natural gas supply and to convert from coal firing to gas firing.\n\n(f) Several minor operations will be necessary in conjunction with the above work which will be covered in the plans and specifications which will be prepared when approval is given.\n\nUntil plans and specifications have been outlined, it will be difficult to estimate within close limits the cost of these revisions. It is felt however that the sum of $15,000.00 will cover all the work outlined above.\n\nShould these operations be carried out, this school would become one of the best equipped and most efficiently run institutions of its kind. It should be borne in mind that the boilers will likely have to be replaced within five or ten years time.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nfor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nOttawa, July 20th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Blue Quills Residential School\nYour File: IA 1680-5\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of July 13th with reference to Mr. Hargreaves' recent inspection of the above school. In view of the recommendations contained on the second page of your memorandum, it is our intention to request $15,000.00 in the supplementary estimates to cover the cost of the improvements which you recommend.\n\nIn the meantime, it would be appreciated if the plans and specifications were prepared so that there will be no unnecessary delay in carrying out the work.\n\nNo decision has yet been made regarding the application of the St. Paul's Utilities Company to drill a well on the school property. Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary to take any further action at the present time in connection with converting the boilers to gas firing.\n\nPP/ST Acting Director.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, July 26, 1949.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSt. Paul-de-M\u00e9tis, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to Major MacKay's memorandum of July 20th in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur memorandum of July 13th contained an estimate of $15,000.00 which was considered sufficient to cover the specific items recommended in connection with the heating and domestic hot water services, together with a complete conversion from coal to gas firing.\n\nIt would appear that the Indian Affairs Branch misinterpreted our memorandum and that they understood our estimate covered only the items specifically mentioned.\n\nWe have been in touch with Indian Affairs Branch by telephone and pointed out to them that our estimate of $15,000.00 covered everything, including the laying of gas lines, digging a well and converting the boilers from coal to gas firing.\n\nOn this basis, the Indian Affairs Branch indicated verbally, that we should proceed to prepare plans and specifications covering the gas conversion operation together with the specific items.

Major Clark and I left for Saddle Lake early this week but we didn't get there - illness forced me to return to Calgary.\n\nI would prefer to delay the matter further until we have discussed it fully with Mr. Taylor and particularly in the light of pending developments in his agency. If a day school is erected on Cold Lake Reserve it may not be necessary to carry out any construction on the Blue Quills School other than normal maintenance. Certainly if a residential school is erected at Cold Lake we should not plan to spend any money on new construction at Blue Quills.\n\nUntil the new schools now being erected in the Saddle Lake Agency are completed and functioning and the situation clarifies itself, it might be unwise to plan any building at Blue Quills.\n\nI should like to know what is the latest date you must have this information in order to include an item in the estimates.

You might further indicate whether at any time your Service was in touch with the St. Paul Utilities Limited with reference to this matter of securing gas for heating purposes, for insofar as this Service is concerned, the said St. Paul Utilities Limited drilled on the property without having received any permission to do so.\n\nYou will further note that in the last paragraph of his memorandum, Mr. Gibson seeks advice as to the areas that should be reserved from drilling operations.

Original on 116859-6.\n\n10.- There are about 125 acres of land in connection therewith and devoted to the use of this institution. The area is too limited and with so much idle land within the reserve, I see no good reason why the Indians have restricted the institution to this area. This question was discussed before me last week and the Indians practically consented to increasing the area to about 500 acres if the school would employ a general handy male employee as blacksmith, farmer, etc.\n\n11.- The 125 acres is devoted to about the following buildings and grounds, 6 acres; gardens, 2 acres; grain, 30 acres; potatoes, 4 acres and about 80 acres to pasture. The pastureage is too limited for the stock kept.\n\nSgd. J. A.

The Indians, he thinks, would consent to increasing the area to about 500 acres, if the school would employ a man to act as blacksmith, farmer and handy man. Should the school be allowed this additional land it should only be on this condition.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Dewar\nBlue Quills Boarding School,\nSacred Heart P.O.\nFeb. 14th 1919\n\nTo the Honorable D.C.

For the past years, we have always been obliged to rent land from the Indians for cultivation, so if it is in your power, Honored Sir, to grant us this favor, we will be very grateful to you, as we are in need of the land, for the prosperity of the school.\n\nTrusting to receive an early and favorable answer.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nOttawa, February 24, 1919.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in regard to disposition of land around the Blue Quills Boarding School, and in reply to say that the Department is not taking any action towards the disposition of this land.\n\nI may say that Mr. W. M. Graham, Commissioner, Department of Indian Affairs, Regina, has full control in regard to the renting of lands on Indian reserves in the West, and possibly it might be well for you to communicate with him.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

SIMART\nS.T.R.P.R.I.S.E.M., S.E.A.L.\nOF INDIAN AFFAIRS, Ottawa\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nWith reference to your kind letter dated Nov. 18th, 1924, which I do not have a favourable reply to my letter dated Oct. 20th, 1924, concerning the advisability of securing a new and suitable site for the erection of a large modern boarding school, I have the honour to call your attention to the fact that three days ago the Indians of Saddle Lake having surrendered to the Indian Department that eastern portion of this Reserve, in which I did request you in my letter to choose some two or two and half sections partly for the main purpose partly for grazing and hay cropping purposes at the location of the new school.\n\nI think it is wise now for the Department to keep said 2 or 2\u00bd sections for such purposes at the price of $15.00 an acre.\n\nI hope that as soon as this surrendered land will be divided in sections by the surveyors you will appoint some official (Rev. Rev.) to buy together here and select said location.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nV. Gabillon\nO.M.C. Principal\nRef: E.X.\n\nMr. Ferrell\n\nDid you ever use this?\n\nMemo: For file:\nLands Branch explained that the Rev. P.'s suggestion could not be entertained. There is plenty of land to be had on that portion. We reserve which is not in the surrender.\n\nP.S.\nCOPY OF COMMISSIONER GRAHAM'S LETTER,\nHis No. 407-7B, dated Oct. 16, 1925.\n\nI beg to forward herewith the Estimates for the Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nThere is a matter which requires a special report from me. I refer to the school requirements for the Indians of this Agency and part of the Onion Lake Agency, viz.: Kesweehins Reserve. In my opinion, the question of building a school on the Saddle Lake Agency should not be considered. The school should be built at St. Paul de Letis, and should be sufficiently large to accommodate not only the children of the Saddle Lake Reserve, but of Cold Lake and Kesweehins reserves as well. I believe that a school of the same capacity as that which we have built for the Roman Catholic Church on the Blood Reserve would meet the requirements.\n\nI understand that the church authorities are anxious to have a school built at Cold Lake as well as at Saddle Lake. This would be a mistake, as a school centrally located would take care of the requirements of Saddle Lake and a great part of the Onion Lake Agency. Of course, if this scheme is carried out, and I think it should be, the Department should insist on closing up the day schools. In my opinion, the operating of these schools is only a useless waste of money, for which we are getting no value.\n\nI believe that the establishing of a school at St. Paul de Letis will meet with the approval of the Archbishop of Edmonton, and the Oblate Order.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nOttawa, October 28, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to a portion of your 407-7 B of the 16th instant, in which you recommend that a residential school be erected at St. Paul de Metis. I note that such a school would not only replace the worn out buildings at the Blue Quills Institution, but would provide residential facilities for the children of the Cold Lake and Leechewins reserves. A note has been made for future estimates in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, M.A.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, August 16, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Valens:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, with reference to the selection of a site for the Indian residential school that will replace the present Blue Quills institution on the Saddle Lake Reserve. It is possible that there will be a decision in this connection within the next few months. A Department officer, in conjunction with the Church authorities, will, of course, make an inspection of possible locations.

There are many factors which have to be taken into account before finally deciding upon the location of an institution of this kind, and it is usual to have the matter carefully considered by the officials of this Department acting in conjunction with the Church authorities. This procedure will be followed in this instance and at an opportune time action will be taken.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend V.

Father Cabillon, Section II, Township 58, Range 10, West of the 4th, M., School Lands, was withdrawn from sale on his request, as he is strongly in favour of it for a site for a new school should such a building be erected in the future.\n\nWill you be kind enough to take an early opportunity at the proper season of personally looking over this property and reporting to the Department. I do not wish to give any intimation as to when the new school may be erected as we have no appropriation as yet.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. W. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nHonorable Sir:\n\nOn this first day of the new year, I have the honor of offering to you my best wishes, praying to Almighty God that He may grant you good health this year and for many years to come in order that you may be able in future to perform these so important duties of yours, which you have fulfilled so well till now in the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nIn regard to the welfare of our school, I wish to say, that we are very much in need of a much larger school building which should be located not far from a central town and a railway station. Therefore I quote with much pleasure from Mr. R. T. Ferrier's letter addressed on Dec. 23rd last, to our pupils, the following: \"The Department is now considering building a new school for all of you and I trust that, before long, you will be in much nicer quarters.\"\n\nWith regard to the proposed site of said school building I would be pleased if the Department would send an Inspector early in the Spring to look for it.\n\nI hope the school section II, tp. 59, r. 10, W. of 4 m., which at our request, was withheld from sale for this purpose by the Honorable Charles Stewart, will be found a suitable site for such. It is three miles west of St. Paul de Metis, which may be considered as the central point of all the Indian Reserves (Cree and Chipewyan) situated in our district of Athabaska; and therefore the new school building should be large enough to accommodate from 150 to 200 children.\n\nI am,\n\nHonorable Sir,\nYour grateful and respectful servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 10, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the first instant, concerning a site for the proposed new Indian residential school at Blue Quills. Your representations have been noted and will be given consideration when a decision is being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. V. Gabillon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSacred Heart P. O.,\nAlta.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nFebruary 24th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWhen on my way to Saddle Lake Agency, I drove for one mile along the South Side of section 11, township 58, range 10 West of the 4th meridian, and noted the lay of the land. The whole section is level and when cleared would make a fine farm. I estimate that from fifty five to sixty per cent is open land, about thirty five per cent is covered with light scrub and the balance is covered with heavier clumps of poplar bluffs.\n\nThe south half is more open than the north. The upset price on this half was $17.00 per acre. There is a low place on the N.W.\u00bc comprising about thirty five acres. The upset price on this quarter was $12.00 per acre. The north east quarter has the most scrub on it of the lot and the upset price was $13.00 per acre.\n\nI am informed that a plentiful supply of good water has been procured by settlers in the neighbourhood of this land at from thirty to ninety feet. I consider the land very good value at the upset price. It is only about three miles from the town of St. Paul de Metis and could be made one of the finest farms in the district. I am passing this information on to you in the hope that it may be of value.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) W. Murison,\nInspector.\n\nP. S. - This section was reserved for the Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nW. M.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nOttawa.\nMarch 9, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nPursuant to our conversation concerning the site for the proposed new Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I am returning Mr. Murison's letter to you. A copy has been placed on our file. I should be grateful if you would make a personal inspection of this property, which, I understand, has been withheld from sale by the Department of the Interior until such time as the site for the new school is settled. You may incur a reasonable expenditure, testing for a suitable supply of water. I shall be glad to have your report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSeptember 28, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nYou will recollect that Section 11, T. 58, R. 10, W.4 M., was reserved in the School Lands sale for the location for a new residential school near St. Paul de Metis. This is the school in which Archbishop O'Leary is interested, and it will be in substitution for the Blue Quills School. When we were together in Edmonton I told you that the Indian Commissioner and myself were satisfied with the site, and you intimated that you might arrange with the Alberta Government that the land should be paid for at a reasonable if not a nominal price. I would now request that that arrangement be made. We have the money in the Estimates and we are ready to make the transfer of the amount at any time.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n5th October, 1928.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nBefore the Minister left for the west I discussed with him the desire of your Department to acquire Section 11, Township 58, Range 10, West of the 4th Meridian, for the purpose of a new residential school.\n\nThe Department administers School Lands as Trustee of the School Lands Endowment Fund and it is its primary duty to obtain for the Fund the greatest revenue possible; consequently it will not be possible to sell the land to your Department at less than the full value of the land as determined by an Inspector of this Department. However, we can arrange the matter by withdrawing the Section from the Fund, transferring to the Fund other vacant Dominion Lands of equal value. In this way a transfer may be made without expense to your Department. Of course the whole exchange will have to be approved by the Governor General in Council.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOctober 9, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nI have your No. 8 of the 5th instant, with reference to this Department's wish to acquire Section 11, T. 58, R. 10, W. 4th, for the purposes of a new Indian residential school. I am very pleased to learn that we can secure this section without expenditure; and, as it is hoped Parliament will provide an appropriation for building purposes at the next session, I should be grateful if you would arrange for the transfer at an early date. If, at any time, this section is not required for Indian school purposes, it will be returned to your Department. When the transfer has been approved, would you kindly let me have a copy of the Order in Council.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRoy A. Gibson, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Minister,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 10, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Thibaudieu:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, concerning the establishment of an Indian residential school west of St. Paul. You may inform the Board of Trade that I have taken steps leading towards the transfer to the Department of Indian Affairs of a school section near the town, and I am hopeful that the building programme can be started in a few months.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. J. Thibaudieu, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nSt. Paul Chamber of Commerce,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nBlue Quill's Residential School,\nSacred Heart, Alberta.\nMay 9th, 1929.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 118-1-1 of the 30th ultimo and am pleased to note that my request for a pupilage of 200 will be given favourable consideration.\n\nI would now beg to draw your attention to the matter of clearing and breaking of new land at the proposed site of the new Residential school which is to be built near St. Paul. As the season is well advanced, I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to make early arrangements to have sufficient land cleared as soon as possible in order that the breaking may be commenced early in June. A considerable acreage will be required for the crop season of 1930 and it would be very much appreciated if an approximate acreage of 200 acres could be prepared this year.\n\nI might mention that I have recently been approached by several well equipped farmers of the St. Paul district who would be ready to undertake the work of breaking.\n\nI have been informed that work is to be undertaken in connection with the erection of the new school and that plans are under way to have this started as soon as possible. No doubt the Department would have in view, when locating a site for the new school, a sufficient slope whereby suitable sewage disposal would be ensured. It has also occurred to me that a suitable water supply should be established. If these matters were taken in hand in the near future, there would be no loss of time after the commencement of building operations.\n\nAs I consider the matter urgent and in order to avoid delay, could it not be arranged that tenders for breaking, etc., if to be called for at an early date, be handed to Mr. Gallion, the agent here, for attention. In this connection, I might state that I am submitting to him, the names of the men who have interviewed me in regard to breaking.\n\nThanking you for your attention and in anticipation of favourable consideration of my requests,\n\nI beg to remain, Honourable Sir,\n\nYour obedient and humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Stamp]\nMay 15, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of October 5th, last, and my reply thereto of the 9th of the same month, with reference to the Department's desire to acquire Section II, T. 58, R. 10, W. 4th, for the purposes of a new Indian residential school. I shall be pleased to be informed as to what progress has been made in this matter and, if the transfer has been approved, to have a copy of the Order in Council. Plans are being prepared for the erection of the new school building, and I am anxious to have the question of the transfer of the section mentioned above concluded at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRoy A. Gibson, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Minister,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 17, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, requesting that the work be carried out in the clearing and breaking of new land on the proposed site of the new residential school which is to be erected near St. Paul de Metis.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that arrangements have not yet been completed for the transfer of Section II, T. 58, R. 10, W. 4th, the section which the Department is endeavouring to acquire for the use of this school. When this land has been acquired and a decision made as to the location of the new buildings, having in view the obtaining of adequate water and sewage facilities, the necessary action can then be taken to clear and break a portion of the land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. V. Gabillon, C. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSacred Heart, Alta.\nMay 18, 1929.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the establishment of an Indian Residential School at Section 11, T. 58, R. 12, west of the 4th W., I would recommend that the Dominion Water Board Branch be asked to have their District Engineer inspect this property and make a recommendation to the Department regarding a suitable water supply system for the building, and also a layout for a sewage disposal system.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\nMay 23, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has under consideration the establishment of an Indian Residential School on Section 115 T. 58, R. 10, West of the 4th Meridian. This site is in the vicinity of St. Paul de Metis, Alta., and is to replace the Blue Mills School at Sacred Heart, Alta., where the Rev. V. Cahillen is the Principal.\n\nA definite site has not yet been selected on the property for the school building, and before same is decided on, I would ask you to please arrange to have your District Engineer examine the property and submit a recommendation if a good site is available where an ample supply of water can be obtained and also good drainage facilities. A brief outline of the water supply and sewage disposal systems recommended might also be included in the report.\n\nThe building contemplated is similar to the one erected recently on the Blood Reserve, Alta., and will accommodate approximately 20 pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the proposed Indian residential school on Section 11, Township 58, Range 10, West of the 4th Meridian, and have asked the Commissioner of Irrigation to submit a report along the lines indicated in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to your Department's desire to acquire Section 11, Township 45, Range 10, west of the 4th Meridian.\n\nIn reply I may say that the delay in transferring this land is due largely to the fact that under the Dominion Lands Act other land of equal value must be selected to compensate the School Lands Endowment Fund for any land relinquished. It is the practice of the Department to complete the transaction in the case submitted to Council. However, in view of your representations as to the urgency of this case, a memorandum to Council will be placed before the Minister for signature immediately asking for authority to transfer this section to your Department, the land to be compensated later when other land has been selected in lieu thereof.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Deputy Minister.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq., F.A.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 5, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nI have your No. 9 of the 27th ultimo and I wish to thank you for taking immediate steps to transfer Section 11, Township 58, Range 10, west of the 4th Meridian, to this Department. This property is required for the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School, and I am desirous of commencing the building activity in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRoy A. Gibson, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Minister,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 6th June 1929.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 30th May, 1929, from the Minister of the Interior, submitting:\n\nThat representations have been made to the Department by the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs that Section 11, Township 56, Range 10, west of the 4th Meridian, which is School lands, is required by the Department of Indian Affairs for the purpose of erecting an Indian school thereon and for purposes connected therewith; and\n\nThat it is considered to be in the public interest to transfer said Section to the Department of Indian Affairs for the purpose mentioned.\n\nThe Minister accordingly recommends that the said Section 11, Township 56, Range 10, West of the 4th Meridian, be withdrawn from the School Lands Endowment Fund, in order that same may be set aside for the Department of Indian Affairs, and that in lieu thereof a selection be made from available Dominion lands of an area sufficient to reimburse the School Lands Endowment Fund for the relinquishment of said section and that the lands, when selected, be set aside as School Lands and gazetted as such.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing and submit the same for Your Excellency's approval.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\nJune 17, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the establishing of an Indian Residential School near St. Paul de Metis, etc. I understand that it will be possible to obtain electric power for the school from St. Paul de Metis, and I would ask you to kindly instruct your District Engineer to include in his report an estimate for the installation of the necessary power line from the source of supply to the site of the new school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Holden\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nGeneral Plan\nto accompany report of P. J. Jennings\nRe proposed Indian School near St Paul de Metis.\n\nScale: 2\" = 1 Mile.\n\nTp. 58 - Rq. 10.\nRq. 9, W. of 4th Mer.\nEdmonton, July 4, 1929.\n\nJ. S. Tempest, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary.\n\nSir,\n\nIn accordance with instructions contained in the Director's letter dated May 27th last I proceeded to St. Paul de Metis from Calgary on July 2nd and visited the area reserved in connection with the proposed Indian Residential school.\n\nOn the morning of July 4th in company with Father La Rose, the Parish Priest, I examined a number of sites on sec.11, tp.38, rge.10 which it was thought were attractive from one or more viewpoints, finally locating what was considered the most desirable site. This site is on the highest land in the section and is in the NE\u00bc at about the point indicated on the attached sketch plan. A school building erected at this point would have good drainage facilities either to the southeast or southwest.\n\nWater Supply.\n\nOn the afternoon of July 3rd and again on July 4th I personally investigated the water supply possibilities of this locality. There is no surface water supply either from lakes or streams in the locality. Lake St. Vincent located some 6 miles directly north is the only source of surface water which would be suitable but its location renders its use prohibitive.\n\nSub-surface supplies can be obtained at from 60 to 150 feet but in the majority of the wells drilled the water is very hard - quite unsuitable without treatment.\n\nIn section 12 two wells were examined at points indicated on the plan, and a sample of the more palatable water taken for examination, particularly for hardness. This well is drilled to 105 feet and has water standing 60 feet in the hole.\n\nOn the SW\u00bc of sec.10 which is owned by Mr. S. Tetreault, he has three drilled wells, two of which produce hard unpalatable water at depths of 66 to 70 feet and a third which produces excellent soft water at 60 feet. In this well a gravel stratum was penetrated at 60 feet from the surface and produced clear soft live water and apparently in quantity as it stands 30 feet in the hole, and Mr. Tetreault has never been able to lower it even when watering stock and filling tanks.\n\nIt is highly desirable that an effort be made to follow up this gravel lead into sec.11 and to locate the first drilling site on it.\nWater is found at an average depth of 80 feet in this locality, but with few exceptions is hard and not suitable for general domestic use. In the town of St. Paul de Metis, 13 miles from section 11, the local creamery has drilled three wells and after only two years in operation the supply has not entirely given out. This, it is thought, is chiefly due to silting up at the suction with quick sand and fine silt, because new wells drilled close by will produce water at this elevation.\n\nGeneral Suitability of Location.\n\nThe section under reservation was carefully examined and its general topographical features noted. Soil conditions are suitable for agricultural purposes and the section is well wooded, affording excellent shelter belts for stock. There is a three-wire fence in poor condition around the section, and I estimated there were some 200 head of stock - horses and cattle - being pastured therein. The farmer on the adjoining section to the east thought there were nearer 300 head, but as the number varies from time to time it is not material. The pasture was in excellent condition and the stock looked well. There are several ditches or sloughs but only one contained any water, and this was almost exhausted owing to the dryness of the season in this locality.\n\nTaking the following essentials into consideration it must be conceded that the section is suitable.\n\n(a) **Locality** - proximity to railway and accessibility - i.e., roads of approach.\n\n(b) **Topography** - general slope - drainage, etc.\n\n(c) **Soil** - character and depth.\n\n(d) **Water supply** - available surface water and probability of sub-surface supplies.\n\n(e) **Power** - availability and cost.\n\nThe fact that a supply of electrical energy can be obtained by the construction of only 3.77 miles of power line at a cost of approximately $850.00 per mile was a point much in favour of this location as it will obviate the necessity for the installation of a separate power plant for light, laundry, water supply, fire protection, etc.\n\nThe Calgary Power Company is prepared to furnish power at the following rates:\n\n**Power.**\n\nService charge of $1.00 per H.P. per month. For 1st 100 K.W. hours 6\u00a2 and all over this amount @ 4\u00a2 per K.W. hour.\n\n**Lighting.**\n\nService charge 80\u00a2 per month for first 500 Watts and 30\u00a2 per month for each additional 250 Watts.\n\nFor first 100-hour use of installed capacity 12\u00a2 per K.W. hour and all over at 6\u00a2.\nRecommendations.\n\n(1) That as the ultimate success and safety of the proposed institution depends upon an adequate and satisfactory water supply, no site be selected until a systematic search has been made by drilling for a water supply.\n\n(2) That should a supply of live soft water be found at a suitable depth, it be given a thorough pumping test before acceptance.\n\n(3) That provision be made for the drilling of a series of test wells with a view to the discovery of the gravel formation which is yielding such excellent water in the section to the west.\n\n(4) That if none of these shallow test holes finds a suitable supply a hole be drilled to a depth of 300 feet in the hope of striking fresh water below the existing water-table.\n\nConclusions.\n\nFrom complete enquiries made at St. Paul de Metis I ascertained that there were no well drillers available in the vicinity. There is one man with a boring machine but it is very old and he has great difficulty in boring to a depth of 80 feet. A man with a modern well-drilling machine should be secured for this work. If authority is given to carry out the above recommendations enquiries will be made immediately and estimates obtained for the work. I may say that the parties with the boring machines used on the wells in the vicinity of St. Paul de Metis have been charging at the rate of $1.25 to $1.50 per foot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReclamation Engineer.\nOttawa, Ont., July 18th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 118-0-5.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of May 23rd regarding the establishment of an Indian residential school on section 11, township 58, range 10, west of the 4th meridian, I enclose herewith copy of a report received from the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary on the proposed site. You will note that he recommends that a thorough search be first made for a suitable water supply before a final decision is reached in regard to the location of the school.\n\nThe question of the supply of power from St. Paul de Metis has been discussed with the Calgary Power Company and you will note that they will have power available at prices which compare with those being charged to the town. A total of 15 horse-power could be made available and no doubt this would be sufficient for the requirements of the school. In addition to the power charge mentioned in the report there will be a further cost of $750.00 for substation and switch equipment.\n\nI shall be glad to have your further instructions, particularly with reference to prospecting for a suitable water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Tetreault sample \"B\" is surprising, particularly as the water indicated very much higher values than expected, especially as to depth and colour. Mr. Tetreault informed me that the water was softer than any water in the district, which was proved by the fact that it was used for domestic purposes in preference to any other water in the vicinity.\n\nIn view of the desirability of having the most thorough examination possible made of the existing water supplies I have written to Father Le Rose for a further sample of each kind of water, which I propose having tested at the City of Calgary Laboratory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

I believe it advisable to immediately prospect for a suitable water supply and, in view of the fact that there is excellent soft water at 60 feet on the section to the west of the proposed school farm, the gravel lead into section II should be followed with a view to locating the first drilling site on it. If a supply of live soft water is found, a thorough pumping test should be given. If none of the shallow test holes finds suitable supply, I consider it advisable to follow your Mr. Jennings' advice and drill to a depth of 300 feet in the hope of striking fresh water below the existing water-table.\n\nAs there has been a little delay in answering your letter, I should be grateful if you would send instructions by telegram to carry out the search for a suitable water supply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Mr. Jennings advises me that the Canadian National Railway Company hesitated about releasing this equipment unless the freight charges amounting to $64.50 were paid. As he had no railway warrants he asked the railway company to forward the account to our Calgary office where it would receive attention. The Company officials ultimately consented to do this but pointed out that immediate settlement was necessary. The account has now arrived in Calgary and we have issued a cheque in settlement of the amount and with the view of recovering this amount from the Department of Indian Affairs. I am enclosing in triplicate a copy of the account and should be glad if you will arrange with the Department of Indian Affairs to forward a cheque to reimburse us for this expense.\n\nI would point out at this time that the arrangement with Mr. Douglas, the well driller, was that his equipment should be shipped in and out at our expense. As the work is still proceeding it would be advisable at this date to arrange for shipping out the equipment the expense of which will be approximately the same; i.e., $64.50. I should be glad therefore if it is possible to issue warrants in this case if you would be good enough to have some forwarded to me by mail, otherwise it will be necessary to pay the account from our funds and collect from the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWord was received from Mr. Douglas on Monday last, 20th instant, to the effect that he was down 110 feet in the first well with some water in the hole. He was, however, instructed to drill deeper with a view to locating a stronger flow.\n\nYou will be advised from time to time in regard to progress at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. B. Tempest,\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power and Reclamation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWith reference to the water supply for the proposed new Indian residential school at St. Paul de Metis, Alberta, I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation, dealing with charges for the drilling equipment shipped to St. Paul on August 17th, at the expense of the Department, in accordance with our arrangement with Mr. Douglas, the well driller.\n\nI also enclose in duplicate copy of the account received from the Canadian National Railways for freight charges amounting to $64.80, which has been paid by the Commissioner. You will note that he asks to have a cheque from the Department of Indian Affairs in repayment of this outlay, and also a freight warrant to cover the cost of shipping out the drilling equipment when the work is completed, and I shall be obliged if you will be able to comply with Mr. Tempest's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Douglas, of Edmonton, on section 11, township 58, range 10, west of the 4th meridian, for the proposed Indian school at St. Paul de Metis, Mr. Douglas reports to the Commissioner of Irrigation under date of August 30th as follows:\n\n\"I am now down 215 struck water at 200 feet again lots of it but was hard water also it would have to be screened as there was quite a quantity of fine sand mixed with the coarse sand. A screen is alright as a last resort.\n\n\"We are in favourable formation just now getting more of a dark blue clay and soapy substance. On account of the fine sand coming when we were testing I thought it better to continue on down and try to locate a better vein and the next is more likely to be soft water.\n\n\"Water veins appear to be about 100 ft. apart as this has proven out, the first was 120 then this was about 200 ft. then we should get another around 300 ft.\"\n\nThe Commissioner states that Mr. Douglas has been instructed to continue drilling, in order to secure, if possible, a flow of soft water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Stop. A good supply of suitable water apparently obtained but send rushing into casing. Stop. Driller of opinion that a good bottom may be obtained by going deeper. Stop. To proceed deeper will cost about two hundred and fifty dollars in casing and equipment. Soon. Wire instructions as to continuing at present site or starting at a new location.\"\n\nIn accordance with verbal authority received from your Mr. Curt, Mr. Tempest has been authorized to instruct the driller to continue drilling in the hope of obtaining a good bottom up to the additional cost of $250, and to report as soon as possible as to the results obtained.\n\nWe are unable here to make a definite recommendation as to what is best to be done under the circumstances and are depending largely upon the opinion of the driller but I hope to obtain more detailed information from Mr. Tempest in a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

DOUGLAS,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nTo drilling water well at the site of the proposed Indian school at St. Paul, Alberta:\n\n| Depth (ft) | Rate ($/ft) | Cost ($) |\n|-----------|------------|----------|\n| 100       | $3.00      | $300.00  |\n| 50        | $2.00      | $100.00  |\n| 50        | $2.50      | $125.00  |\n| 100       | $3.00      | $300.00  |\n| 50        | $4.00      | $200.00  |\n| 50        | $5.00      | $250.00  |\n| 61        | $7.50      | $457.50  |\n\nTotal: $1932.50\n\nCertified depth as finished 461 feet.\n\nPayments made to date: $1258.00\n\nBalance still due: $474.50\nSir,\n\nThe test well on the site of the proposed Indian School near St. Paul, Alberta, which was being drilled for the Department of Indian Affairs, has been carried down to 461 feet. This was as deep as it was possible to go and drilling has been stopped.\n\nThe well was started with 5 5/8 casing and this was carried to 300 feet. At the 300-foot depth a string of 5-inch casing was used to 400 feet and from there 4\u00bd-inch casing was run. Water was first encountered at 100 feet. This water was very hard and unsuitable for the purpose for which it was required. Another vein of very hard water was reached at about 200 feet, but this was still of a very hard quality. Between the 300 and 400-foot level a very fine quality of soft water, suitable for drinking, laundry, and boiler purposes was reached. The difficulty with this supply is that it comes through sand which runs into the casing and pump. On this account it has not been possible to make a test of the quantity but the water is under considerable pressure and stands 375 feet in the casing.\n\nIt is proposed to experiment with a sand point and a casing screen in an endeavour to keep the sand from the casing and the suction pipe of the pump. It has also been suggested that if a pump could be operated on the well for some hours a cavity might be made in the sand formation which would form a settling basin for the sand and keep it clear of the casing.\n\nThe driller, Mr. Douglas, claims that when he contracted for the drilling of the well it was not considered that he would have to go more than 300 feet and that this should be considered a reasonable depth in the terms of his tender. The drilling below 250 feet, it is understood from our engineer's reports and from Mr. Douglas, has been very difficult and extremely expensive. Herewith is enclosed a schedule of rates which will satisfy Mr. Douglas and which appear to be reasonable. Certain cable for the deeper drilling was purchased for Mr. Douglas. This is being retained for the Department. It will be possible that this may be sold to Mr. Douglas on a reduction in cost, as he has taken contracts to drill other wells in the district.\n\nMr. Douglas is claiming that he should be paid at the rate of $10.00 per day for thirteen days. This was time lost when he had to cease operations waiting for instructions re purchase of 5-inch casing and later of 4-inch casing and the shipping of this casing to the drilling site. This would appear to be a just charge and it is recommended that it be allowed.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a blue print of the log of the well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) H. R. Carssellen,\nfor Commissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe Indian school at St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter received from the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary with reference to the well which has been drilled to supply the proposed Indian school near St. Paul de Metis, Alberta, which describes the existing situation.\n\nThere is also enclosed a blueprint of the log of the well and a schedule of rates for payment to the driller, Mr. Douglas, approved by the Commissioner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

No reply has as yet been received authorizing payment of the driller at the recommended rates. The driller is very anxious that a final settlement should be made, but it will be necessary to receive the Department of Indian Affairs' approval before the final payments are completed.\n\nEquipment was purchased for Mr. Douglas to complete the well. This equipment included a length of cable at a cost of $168.00. This cable is returnable to the Department or Mr. Douglas offers to purchase it for $75.00. Fifty feet of the cable was injured beyond repair by kinking when the well blew in. It is requested that the Department of Indian Affairs express their wishes as to whether Mr. Douglas' offer should be accepted or the cable returned to the Department.\n\nIn connection with the St. Paul well, Mr. P. J. Jennings, who is familiar with the matter from the outset, is now in Ottawa, and it is suggested that he might be consulted as to the possibilities of the well and as to the final settlement with the driller.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

The Minister is anxious that tenders for this building be invited early this spring, and of course before this can be done it will be necessary to be sure of the location of the building, which depends to a great extent on a satisfactory water supply system.\n\nI shall be glad to have the recommendation of the Commissioner of Irrigation of Calgary at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.T.

It is expected at an early date, and it is hoped that if Parliament provides the necessary funds the erection of the building will be proceeded with this spring.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. J. Thibaudet, Esq.,\nSecretary, Chamber of Commerce Incorporated,\nSt. Paul de Metis,\nAlberta.\nMarch 26, 1930.\n\nDear Father Angin:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the urgent need of replacing the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. As you are, no doubt, aware, the Department is arranging for the provision of funds for a new school, not far from St. Paul. The plans provide accommodation for 140 pupils and grant for this number will be allowed when you are in the new building.\n\nThere has been considerable difficulty finding a suitable water supply, and I have not yet had a definite recommendation from the officers of the Dominion Water Power Branch of the Interior Department. They have undertaken the search for water for us. As soon as a building site and farm are approved, I will see if steps can be taken to break approximately 100 acres, so that you can begin farming in 1931.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Joseph Angin, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSacred Heart, Alta.\nCalgary, Alta.\nMarch 20, 1930.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to state that on March 12 I visited the town of St. Paul to inspect the well upon the NE\u00bc sec. 11, tp. 58, rgs. 19, W. 4th mer., drilled for the proposed R. C. Indian School at that point. It was necessary to ascertain whether that well was satisfactory for the purpose required or whether it should be abandoned and another well drilled.\n\nMr. J. G. Douglas, the well-driller, accompanied me to St. Paul and assisted in obtaining the depth to the water and to the quicksand in the well. This gentleman stated definitely to me that pumping would raise the level of the quicksand and ruin the well. However, it was considered advisable to apply a pumping test before the well should be condemned.\n\nMr. Douglass returned to Edmonton and I hired Mr. J. A. Salls, a local well-driller, and other help to install a pump and engine. It was necessary to get the loan of a new pump, pipe, rods and a cylinder from a local hardware merchant upon a ten per cent basis. Most of the other equipment such as a 1\u00bd h.p. gas engine, tent, etc., was loaned without charge.\n\nSince it was understood that the quicksand would rise rapidly it was decided to lower the cylinder only to a depth of 220 feet. The test was to be continuous day and night until definite results were obtained.\n\nTest.\n\nThe pump was started at 10:32 a.m. on Friday and discharged 2.6 gals. per minute. The water was clear until 11:15 a.m. when a thick solution of dark clay was raised. This lasted 6 minutes when the flow ceased entirely. I then went to St. Paul to discuss the situation with Mr. Sexton, Manager of the local creamery, who had had some difficulty with wells at the creamery. It was decided to continue the pumping even if it were necessary to lower the cylinder to 300 feet.\n\nWith much difficulty four men got the pump started again at 1:19 p.m. The pump discharged about 3.7 gals. per minute until 1:54 p.m. and stopped, presumably for lack of water.\n\nPumping was resumed at 2:15 p.m. and continued steadily day and night until 9:35 a.m. Sunday. The water cleared considerably and contained at the last one teaspoonful of sand per gallon of water. At 9:35 a.m. the pump stroke was lengthened from four to six inches to increase the discharge and see what would happen. The discharge then continued at 5.0 gals. per minute for 30 minutes when much quicksand was raised. The discharge slowly decreased to about 3.5 gals. per minute and the water again cleared up considerably as before.\nAt 3 p.m. the pump ceased delivering water. The engine was giving trouble and a wooden upright from the pump-jack wore out, hence it was decided to pull out the pump and discontinue the test.\n\nThe cylinder was found clogged with sand but otherwise in good condition although it had pumped in the two days probably two cubic feet of sand and mud. The water level was found to be 98 feet from the top or 2 feet higher than when the test commenced. The mud and sand in the casing was 451.4 feet from the top or 11.0 feet lower than at the beginning of the test. It was considered that the entire contents of the casing at the commencement of the test were removed by pumping and that the material in the pipe at the end of the test was fresh material that had come into the pipe during pumping.\n\nSummary.\n\n| Description                                      | Measurement |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Total depth of well                              | 461 ft.     |\n| Depth to water at commencement of test           | 100 \"       |\n| Depth to mud and sand at commencement of test    | 420.4 \"     |\n| Duration of test                                 | 53 hrs.     |\n| Average rate of discharge                        | 3.4 gals. per min. |\n| Depth to pump cylinder                           | 220 ft.     |\n| Quantity of sand pumped at 3.4 gals. per minute  | One teaspoonful per gal. of water. |\n| Size of cylinder                                 | 3 ins.      |\n| Size of pipe                                     | 1 1/2 \"     |\n| Water pumped per 24 hrs.                         | 4900 gals.  |\n\nConclusions.\n\nThe well was pumped steadily for two days at the rate of 4,900 gals. per day or 3.4 gals. per minute with apparently no injurious results. At this rate one teaspoonful of sand per gallon was lifted. Apparently 4,900 gals. per day represents the maximum capacity of the well with the cylinder at a depth of 220 feet, or 241 feet above the bottom. Since 241 feet of water represents a pressure of 105 lbs. per inch upon the bottom of the well, the capacity would no doubt be tremendously increased if the cylinder were lowered to the bottom of the well and no trouble were caused by quicksand.\n\nHence, it is my opinion that the present well will deliver for an indefinite period of time 2,500 gals. of water per 24 hours if pumped at the rate of 2.5 gals. per minute. The attached print shows a Fairbanks-Morse pump that will deliver water at this rate. It can be operated either by electricity or gasoline.\n\nThe specifications for this plant are as follows:\n\n- No. of pump: 6669\n- Power: Electricity\n- Quantity of power: 1 h.p.\n- Imperial gallons per minute: 150\n- Cylinder stroke: 6 inches\n- Size of cylinder: 1 1/2 inches\n- Depth of cylinder: 220 feet\n- Size of pipe (plugged and reamed): 2 inches\n- Wooden pump rod 7/8 in. x 1 1/8 in. to be used.\n- Use a long fine sand screen.\nIn regard to the life of this well, the data and information would indicate that it should improve with use. In conversation with Bill Morris, who assisted in the drilling and collected the samples for the geological department, I was informed that some gravel and clay were struck in the bottom of the well. The presence of even a small amount of gravel is very encouraging and would lessen the difficulty to be anticipated from quicksand.\n\nMany other wells in that vicinity have improved with use in that the cloudy condition of the water and the amount of quicksand has decreased without any lessening in the discharge of water. For fire protection, garden purposes, stock, etc., another well or two drilled to about 150 feet will probably be required. There appears to be an abundance of water in that district at about that depth. This water is hard but quite satisfactory for drinking, cooking, stock and in fact for all purposes except washing. For the latter purpose the local farmers and residents of St. Paul use rain water and snow water. At the hospital a small softening plant is used for the wash water.\n\nAmount of Water required for a School of 100 Residents.\n\nIt is noticed in other reports that a daily per capita consumption of 30 gals. is estimated. From information which I have, I believe this quantity will not be used under ordinary careful conditions of plumbing and use. Mr. C. J. MacKenzie, Dean of the University of Saskatchewan, assumed an estimated use for the town of Assiniboia of 20,000 gals. per day, or about 20 gals. per capita. The household winter consumption of water in Maple Creek with modern plumbing conditions as actually metered is between 10 and 15 gallons per day. Water should be more economically used when 100 people are concentrated under one roof than when living in 20 residences.\n\nThe amount of water required at the barn for stock is very small, probably 6 gals. per head for 40 head.\n\nFor fire protection a reservoir of about 20,000 gallons should be provided.\n\nThe water pumped for domestic purposes from the deep well should be delivered to two settling tanks before being pumped to the gravity or compression tank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. Merritt H. French.\nIn further reference to your letter of the 6th instant regarding the water supply system for the proposed new Indian school at St. Paul de Metis, I enclose herewith a report received from the Commissioner of Irrigation on a test made of the capacity of the well drilled last year by Mr. J.C. Douglas, on the North East quarter of Section 11, Township 58, Range 10, West of the 4th Meridian.\n\nFrom this report you will note that a very thorough test of the well has been made and it would appear that we can rely upon from two and one-half to three imperial gallons per minute under steady pumping. This amount of water would be satisfactory for laundry purposes and possibly for drinking. The Commissioner recommends, however, that in order to ensure a satisfactory supply for the other requirements of the school and for fire protection that provisions should be made for the drilling of two additional wells at an estimated cost of about $550.00 per well. This would be to a depth of one hundred and fifty feet where a good supply of hard water is likely to be found.\n\nThe Commissioner reports that he has obtained an estimate from Mr. J. A. Salls, a well driller of St. Paul, for this work, but this has not been received with the report, and I am writing him to supply that information.\n\nIf it is decided to proceed with the construction of the two additional wells I shall be obliged if you will advise me as soon as possible, as experienced well drillers in Alberta are usually very fully employed as soon as the season begins.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 28, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to thank you for your letter of the 26th instant, addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General enclosing a report from your Calgary office on the water supply system in the new Indian Residential School at St. Paul de Metis, Alta. You may instruct the Commissioner to arrange immediately for the drilling of two additional wells as recommended. I may say that it is the intention to invite tenders for this building as soon as possible and in order that the exact location of the building may be indicated to contractors figuring I would be obliged if you would obtain from your Calgary office a sketch showing the proposed location of the building on the property. I would like to include this information with the plans when they are being sent out inviting tenders. I may say that it is not the intention to include either the water supply or the sewage disposal systems in the main contract for this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nacting Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 12th instant advising us that the Department of Indian Affairs request a brief description of the St. Paul School by reference to its position in the quarter-section distance from deep well and from the proposed new wells.\n\nIn accordance with your wishes I have prepared a preliminary sketch which was made from my notes while making the first inspection of the property in August last. It is proposed to erect a standpipe of approximately 40,000 gals. capacity on the high ground indicated on the attached sketch, and to drill the new wells just below the proposed standpipe at the points indicated. The school buildings could be erected a little to the northeast of this isolated hill and should face south, approximately in the position shown on the sketch plan. The barn for horses and cows has been indicated on the northwest of the school some 500 feet distant. The site selected for the school is on slightly rising ground and will have drainage to the South and west.\n\nMr. French has been instructed to make a survey on the ground and to obtain the exact location of the present deep well, the high ground for the standpipe or reservoir, and the exact location of the school buildings. As soon as this plan has been received a copy will be forwarded to you for the information of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) P. J. Jennings.\n\nc/ Commissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nMay 15th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 118-1-9.\n\nIn accordance with your request the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary has had a survey made of approximately ten acres of the area surrounding the proposed location of the Indian residential school near St. Paul de Metis. A topographical plan has been prepared and the buildings, wells and proposed layout have been shown thereon. A blueprint of this plan has been mailed to you under separate cover.\n\nMr. Tempest asks to be advised as soon as possible whether the proposed layout is satisfactory so that he may proceed with the design of the water supply and sewage disposal works, and prepare a cost estimate of the same. He states that the additional well or wells which have been recommended and approved will be under way in the near future so that everything should be in readiness when the contractors arrive on the ground.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M. J. C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 21, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th with reference to the location of the new Blue Mills School near St. Paul de Metis, Alta. I also wish to thank you for the blue print showing the location of the buildings on the property. I note on the plan that it is suggested that a 40,000 gal. tank be provided for fire protection. In view of the fact that the new school building will be entirely fireproof it seems it might be possible to make a saving by erecting a smaller tank, otherwise the suggested arrangements appear to be satisfactory, and I would ask you to kindly have your Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary prepare the necessary plans and specifications for the work, which should include the installing of the necessary power line to the school property.\n\nI would ask you to kindly submit the plans and specifications to this Department before any work is done in connection with same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 118-1-9.\n\nThe following letter has been received from the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary under date May 17th:\n\n\"With further reference to the proposed water supply and sewerage disposal works for the Blue Quill Indian Residential school near St. Paul, Alberta. In giving the question of fire protection further consideration, particularly in view of the fact that the water supply must come from wells drilled in the vicinity of the school and also, because the source of power has to be brought by transmission line from St. Paul, it is thought that if arrangements could be made with the architects to provide space for two 10,000 gallon tanks, to be in the roof of the building, it would add considerably to the safety of the structure. These tanks should be so placed as to have each serve approximately one half of the building. By having this reserve of water immediately available, it is felt that incipient fire could be effectively dealt with. It is also felt that should anything happen to the power line whereby the source of energy for the pumps was cut off, it would be impossible to fight fire with the pumping equipment which would be available.\n\nWould you therefore please take this matter up with the architects of the Department of Indian Affairs and ascertain whether provision could be made at this time for this change in the plans of the building.\"\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 27, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd instant, with further reference to the water supply at the new Blue Quills School I beg to say that it is not thought advisable to install water tanks in the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDOMINION WATER POWER BRANCH,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 118-1-9.\n\nI have received your letter of May 21st with reference to the new Indian school near St. Paul de Metis and have sent a copy to the Commissioner of Irrigation drawing his attention to the fact that the new school building will be entirely fire-proof, in which case it would appear that the tank for fire protection of a smaller size rather than that proposed should be sufficient to give adequate protection.\n\nThe Commissioner has been asked to submit plans and specifications of the works proposed to your department before any work is done in connection with the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Now it is pretty late to break land, but I hope you will endeavour that this work be made as soon as possible.\n\nI am also drawing your attention to the fencing of the land. The contractor assured me that the new School will be ready for next Easter. So, the fence of the property had to be done this year.

I wish to point out, however, that you are under a misapprehension in this matter, as the item for freight was included in your invoice No 2525 and was covered by this Department's cheque No 5082 for the amount stated, consequently no deduction should have been made from the amount of the refund which you were requested to make.

Land should not be broken later than the end of July, so that this work can be done next spring if the Department so desires. I should say that it would take from $8.00 to $10.00 an acre for the breaking of sixty or seventy acres.\n\nThe fencing can be done now or next spring. It would take about 1280 posts, 5000 pounds of wire, 200 pounds of staples, and the cost of labour would be about $25.00 a mile for four miles of fencing, making a total cost of about $700.00.

BURKARD.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 22nd instant, concerning the enclosed letter from Mr. O. H. Gauvreau, of St. Paul, Alberta, I have now to state that arrangements might be made for the clearing of the farm at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School, provided the Minister's correspondent can finance the work until the spring. That portion of the farm to be cleared would have to be indicated by the Reverend Principal, and I believe the contract should be at a certain rate per acre and should be for clearing, stumping and breaking, complete. Of course, the stumping and breaking would likely have to wait until the early summer, but I believe it advisable to have the job completed by those to whom it is entrusted.\n\nI may say that Mr. F. O. Maurice, the Secretary Treasurer of the Village of St. Paul, has urged the Department to do the clearing this winter, and, in December, Mr. Hector Plante wrote, wanting to quote on the brushing and breaking of 100 acres. He stated he had been doing custom work of this kind for farmers during the past few seasons. Perhaps Mr. Gauvreau would like to have this information if the Minister decides to proceed with the work.\n\nIt would be necessary for Mr. Gauvreau to see those who are competent to do this work and who need employment and to make an offer to clear, stump and break a certain specified quarter section, as indicated by the Reverend Principal, at so much per acre. This offer should go to the Reverend Principal himself, who could forward it to the Department with his comment concerning the quotation, etc. If this suggestion is made to Mr. Gauvreau, please let me know, so that we can instruct the Reverend Principal.\n\nDuncan C.

At present no funds are available for this expenditure and will not be until Parliament votes an appropriation for the coming fiscal year, that is some time after the 1st April.\n\nWould you care to undertake the clearing of this land in a workmanlike manner for $6.00 per acre, making such financial arrangements as are necessary and waiting repayment from the Department until such time as a certificate is furnished by the principal of the school that the work has been thoroughly well done? If so, you may undertake it. You should communicate with the principal, Rev. Joseph Angin and he should designate the area to be cleared.\n\nWill you kindly communicate the contents of this letter to Mr. Gilbert La Rue, who wrote the Hon. Thomas G.

H. Gauvreau, St. Paul de Metis. Mr. Gauvreau has been requested to communicate with you in order that you may designate the area to be cleared.

Find approximately forty acres heavy brush, mostly poplar and willow, twenty-five acres light scattered willow brush and thirty-five acres clear and practically ready for plow. Consider new price asked somewhat high for amount of work to be done on the hundred acres.\"\n\nThe plot selected by Rev., J. Angin lies along the main road to St. Paul and at the South end of the section. I went over the ground very carefully and although there is some heavy willow brush near the West end of the plot, there are very few large trees, most of the poplars being under six inches at the stump. As about 75 acres of this land is open, I am of the opinion that $800.00 for the complete job would be high. A good portion of the 25 acres mentioned as having light scattered willow brush can be cleared with brush hooks as with the exception of an odd small clump of heavier brush, most of it is of light growth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

I understand that you intend to let a contract of 100 Acres to be broken, disced and harrowed and ready for seeding. I am ready to undertake this work with my Tractor as follows:\n\nI will break and disc and harrow these 100 acres and bring this land ready for seeding at the price of $11.00 an acre.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLouis Thiroux, Esq.,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nJune 2nd 1931.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the cutting of branches on the new land of the Blue Quills School is over. The work has been given to Mr. Hector Th\u00e9rien, of St Paul, by the conservative committee of St Paul, for the sum of $650.00.\n\nLast week, I went over there, with the farmer of the school, to have a view of the work, and it is my idea and even that of my farmer that, according to the winter time during which the job was made, this could not be made better. However, I will point out that many stumps, chiefly willow stumps, have been left in the ground that could resist a common breaking outfit. Mr. Hector Th\u00e9rien assures me that with his own machines, he can easily root up all these stumps, that suggests the breaking could be undertaken by this man.\n\nMr. Hector Th\u00e9rien will charge $10.00 per acre, what means breaking, disking four times, picking up roots and stones, and harrowing. I will say this is the common price and should not be undertaken at a cheaper rate, according to those who wish to have the job.\n\nMr. Hector Th\u00e9rien guarantees a very good job, and I know that he will do, because he is a honest man, and besides, knowing well the work to be done, he will not kick for the stumps left in the ground.\n\nI hope that pretty soon I will hear that the contract of breaking has been given, as it is just the time now for this work.\n\nIn my last letter, I asked you, Honourable Sir, for the fence to be made as soon as possible, stating that the grass be kept for the animals of the school. But there is another reason for having this fence made the sooner; the animals that pasture on the land gather around the new building, teased by the flies, and it is to be feared that they break the windows. Mr. Gardner Smith spent one evening to chase them out, and I guess he will obliged to do so many times.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. Jos. Anglin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 23, 1931\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\n\n118-1-9\nJuly 7th 1931.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDept. Supt of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYesterday, I went to St Paul to see about the new school, and I was surprised to hear that Mr Gardner Smith had left on account of sickness for one month and a half. Till now, nothing has been made for outbuildings, and I wonder if we can move this year.\n\nHere, at Sacred-Heart, I did not raise any crop, thinking that it was useless, having a word from you that we would move about July. Then, for next winter, I have no feed and no straw for the livestock. Besides that, I have prepared nothing for wintering here, at Sacred-Heart, no wood for fuel, etc.\n\nFinally, would it be possible to know from you where we shall winter, either here, at Sacred-Heart, and I will take steps for fuel, or at St Paul?\n\nAt the same time, I will get you remember that no breaking of land has been undertaken at the new school, and it is very time now for having it made; otherwise, I will have no crop yet next year.\n\nIn visiting the school yesterday, I remarked that many footsteps were seen on the floor, and even some black marks appeared on the walls. I supposed that people of St Paul had a dance in the school. Did you allow the school-keeper to give dances in the new school, or to admit so many visitors that they blacken the walls and soil the floors?\n\nI hope, Honourable Sir, that you will give me, as soon as possible, an answer to this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

I hope to write you in a few days regarding the arrangements for the breaking of 100 acres. As far as the fencing is concerned, please discuss this as soon as possible with Mr. Indian Agent Gullion and ask him to submit a proposal with reference to just how much fencing is required.\n\nIn the light of all the facts, I believe you should arrange to move to the new building this fall. The Department will bend every energy to this end and I know you will be prepared to cooperate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Jos.

BURKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 11th instant, with the enclosed telegram, with reference to breaking and discing 100 acres at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alta. Mr. Faucher's price is about the same as that of Mr. Therrien. Mr. Therrien's quotation in detail was as follows:\n\n- Breaking - $6.00\n- Discing 4 times - $2.00\n- Dragging with heavy harrows - $.50\n- Picking roots - $.25\n- Picking stones - $.50\n- Floating - $.50\n- Light harrowing - $.25\n\nTotal - $10.00\n\nIt is not the intention to do more than break and disc the land at this time. The school management should be responsible for the lighter work on the land, without cost to the Department. Mr. Therrien's quotation for breaking and four discings was $8.00 and I believe that Mr. Faucher, also, would be quite willing to do the work at this price.\n\nMy suggestion is that I telegraph Mr. Agent Gullion to interview both Mr. Faucher and Mr. Therrien of St. Paul and to have them divide the work. There is not much time remaining before harvest and it is necessary to take early action.\n\nPlease let me know if this meets your views.\n\nA. S.

I have no knowledge regarding the form of contract undertaken by Mr Therrien, excepting that the price was to include burning, the land to be left in condition for the plow. However, while the land has been cleared and the brush burned, there will be considerable grubbing to do if the land is to be properly prepared.

The new barn and I suppose a pigery will be built in the meantime so that the livestock be installed comfortably for winter.\n\nBut there is no talk till now about the telephone to be installed in the new school. I think that it is your idea that the school be equipped with a phone before we move and I am sure you will have it placed pretty soon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nAugust 25th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReverend J. Angin recently called regarding a communication from the Department concerning fencing at the new Blue Quill's Residential school, St. Paul. In this connection I might state that I have obtained prices on wire, gates, staples and posts f.o.b. St. Paul, Alberta, as follows:\n\nMarshall-Wells Alberta Company Ltd., Edmonton, quote on\n\nWire, barbed, (Canadian) 4 pt., per spool, - $3.75\nStaples, wire\nGates, galvanized iron, 4' x 16', ea. 11.55\n\" \" 4' x 12', ea. 9.50\n\" \" 42\"x 42\", ea. 3.05\n\nMr. J.E. Browning, Rife, Alta., Posts, tamarac, ea. 14 cents.\nHayward Lumber Co., St. Paul, Posts, split cedar, 15 \" ea.\n\nIf the section only is to be fenced, it will require 1760 posts, 48 spools of wire and 80 lbs., wire staples. However, if it is the intention to erect a cross fence in order to protect the 100 acres that is being prepared for crop next year, the following material would be required; 2200 posts, 60 spools of wire and 100 lbs., wire staples. The Reverend Principal also asks for fencing of two separate playgrounds, one for the boys and the other for the girls. The two plots would require 244 posts and 2 rolls of heavy gauge galvanized wire. The latter would cost about $7.50 per roll. The cost of material would be approximately as follows;\n\n60 spools 4 pt. barbed wire .......... $225.00\n100 lbs. wire staples ............... 5.50\n2200 split cedar posts .............. 330.00\n1 only iron gate 4' x 16' ........... 11.55\n1 \" \" 4' x 12' .................. 9.50\n4 \" \" gates 42\"x 42\", for walks .... 12.20\n244 split cedar posts, for playgrounds 36.60\n2 rolls, (100 lbs., ea.) heavy gauge wire 15.00\n\n$645.35\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe total cost, including fencing playgrounds, cross fence and labour would be approximately $945.00.\n\nOwing to heavy rains, the muskegs are mostly flooded and the best price obtainable on tamarac posts so far is 14 cents. Spruce posts would not be suitable as they last for about three years only. In view of this, unless a better price can be obtained on tamarac in the meantime, the split cedar posts at 15 cents would probably be the best purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 5, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 11th ultimo, with reference to a telephone for the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School.

BUSARD,\n\nThe Department now wishes to fence the new farm at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, near St. Paul, Alberta. It is proposed to fence the whole section and to erect a cross fence to protect the 100 acres that are being prepared for crop next year. The local management has secured a price of $284 from Marshall-Wells Alberta Company, of Edmonton, for wire, staples and gates, and a price of $330 for the posts from the Hayward Lumber Company, of St. Paul. As these firms are on the list and their prices are satisfactory, I wish to recommend that the business be awarded to them. The labour will be done entirely by Indians, under the direction of the school management.\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, September 19, 1931.\n\nMr. Farmer,\n\nRe: Fencing of the Farm at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIf the prices quoted by Marshall-Wells and the Hayward Lumber Company for wire, gates and posts are satisfactory, the business may be placed with them.\n\nA.S.W.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, September 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to fencing at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School. You may purchase wire, gates, etc., from Marshall-Wells, of Edmonton, and split cedar posts from the Hayward Lumber Company, of St. Paul. Please ask the Principal not to fence the playgrounds at the present time, as the decision regarding the layout of the school grounds should be postponed until the best possible arrangement has been determined.\n\nIndians only should be engaged for the labour required and the work may be done under the Principal's supervision. As there will be no playground fencing, the Department trusts that the cost can be kept at approximately $850.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nNov.10th 1931.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Sect General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI must inform you that the contract of breaking and disking the 100 acres of land at the new Blue Quills School is not yet over. The land has been broken, but not disked, and now it is too late to undertake this work, the nights being very cold; the lakes are frozen 5\" deep.\n\nSome time ago I wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Gullion about this, asking him to summon the contractor to complete the work, but from this time, nothing has been done. However, on the contract, it is stated that this work was to be done the soonest possible.\n\nIt will be very difficult or nearly impossible to raise crops next year on the land, and this will afford damage to the school; I will be obliged to buy feed next year as I am obliged this year, and this on account of the negligence of the contractor and of the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 19, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to breaking and discing the 100 acre farm at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School. The Department regrets to learn that this work was not completed before freeze-up. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Gullion for a report in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal.\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSacred Heart,\nAlta.\nOttawa, November 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School writes that the breaking and discing of the 100 acre farm at the new site has not been completed. I shall be pleased to have a report from you in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter No.118-1-9 of the 19th August last in regard to breaking and discing contract awarded to Mr. Jeremie Faucher, I beg to inform you that the breaking was completed some time ago but no discing has been done to date. For various reasons, but owing chiefly to stumps and roots on a portion of the plot, there was considerable delay in the work. On receipt of your letter above referred to, I advised the Reverend Principal that the Department was unable to authorize any expenditure for dragging, picking roots, stones, etc., and that the school authorities were expected to do this work. This work, however, not been done and on taking up the matter of completion of the contract with Mr. Faucher, he informed me that the discing could not be done satisfactorily over the roots and stones. On the 5th instant, I again interviewed Mr. Faucher regarding his contract. The Reverend Principal had apparently made the suggestion that Mr. Faucher pick the roots and stones and that two discings might be omitted to offset this work. Mr. Faucher did not feel inclined to do this, and when asked as to whether he could complete four discings this Fall, he informed me that he was very doubtful as there was now considerable frost in the ground and the job could not be done satisfactorily owing to this and the fact that the roots and stones had not been taken out.\n\nThere was about 10 acres of land on the main plot selected that, owing to water after the heavy September rains, Mr. Faucher could not break. However, he broke five acres adjoining the North side and the Reverend Principal asked him to break the two plots selected as playgrounds. This is also given as five acres so that the 100 acres of breaking called for in Mr. Faucher's contract has been completed. I might state that the breaking was satisfactorily performed.\n\nOwing to the colder weather which might be expected at this time of year, Mr. Faucher asks that the discing be postponed until Spring and requests that he be paid for the breaking at the rate of $6.00 per acre. I should be glad to have your advice in the matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.F. Guillon\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the Faucher contract for breaking and discing 100 acres at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School. You may submit a properly certified voucher in Mr. Faucher's favour for the breaking which has been completed, at $6 per acre.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, please discuss with the Rev. Principal ways and means for getting this broken land in shape, if possible, for a crop next year, and you will let the Department have a recommendation in this connection in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Morrow and his wife recently separated leaving a child, Victoria Cryer Morrow, aged 5 years, with an Indian Charles Cryer and his wife who live on the Saddle Lake Reserve. Mrs. Morrow is a treaty Indian woman shown as Isabel Morrow No. 165 of the Saddle Lake Band, and while her husband is not a treaty Indian, this family have lived on the reserve more or less continuously for about fifteen years.\n\nCharles Cryer and his wife are practically destitute and unable to provide for the child. In view of the conditions under which the little girl Victoria was being brought up, I considered it advisable to have the child taken out of their hands and in order to have her taken care of, I have asked the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's Residential school to take her in pending a report and further disposition of the matter. Under the circumstances, I would recommend that this child be admitted to the school. I might mention that pupil No. 232 of the Blue Quill's school is a brother of the Girl.\n\nMrs. Morrow is at present living on the Beaver Lake reserve and her husband has left the Reserve. I trust that the Department will approve of the action taken in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gillion\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 21, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the admission of Victoria Morrow to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. I note that a brother of this girl was admitted to the Blue Quills School last fall, but, I would point out that, when the application for this boy was forwarded, the Department was not supplied with as complete information as is contained in your letter of the 11th instant.\n\nPlease let me know if Morrow is a white man. Every care must be taken, in admitting children to school, to make certain that they are fully eligible. Our primary obligation is to educate treaty Indian children, and, if we accept every half-breed that applies for admission, our schools will soon be over-crowded.\n\nWhen replying, you should let me know if there are other children in this family and also with whom the mother is living at the present time and what she is doing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Blue Quills First N.E.S.

Sutherland, Esq.,\nDept of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask you that 2 months of vacations be given to\nthe pupils of Blue Quills School next summer. The Indians of\nSaddle-Lake Agency would be very pleased to have this favor\ngranted to their children, and the staff of the school would\nbe very satisfied. In fact, the 6 weeks of vacations granted\ntill now prove insufficient: from one part, the teachers are\nobliged to begin the course of studies as soon as the pupils\ncome back to school, otherwise, the parents will keep them home\nto help them in the hay working; from another part, these pupils\nfollow the same course of studies as the white children who\nhave, they, 2 months of vacations. I know that the Indians\nask for these 2 months of vacations since long ago, and I guess\nevery person concerned in this matter, viz., the staff of the\nschool and the Indians and the pupils would be very pleased\nif you grant 2 months of vacations next summer.\n\nHoping you will obtain these 2 months of vacations for\nyour wards, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 9, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, requesting the Department to approve two months' holidays at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department allows grant for 43 days' holidays each summer. This regulation applies to all Indian residential schools in Canada, and the Department is not prepared to make any change at the present time. Under these circumstances, we are unable to authorize two months' holidays at the Blue Quills School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nSADDLE LAKE, ALBERTA.\n\nMay 12th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Indians of this Agency have recently been asking as to whether the Department would consider favourably, the question of allowing the Indian children two months holidays during the year instead of the number of days allowed at present. The Indians claim that the children attending public schools are allowed two months holidays and in view of this, they are asking that their children be granted the same time.\n\nDiscussing this with the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school, I understood that the matter had been previously discussed and that the question would probably be taken up with the Department by some of the Principals of Indian schools.\n\nI should be glad to know whether there are any prospects of a change being made and if so, whether it would apply this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to allowing two months' holidays to pupils of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department allows grant for 43 days' holidays each summer. This regulation applies to all Indian residential schools in Canada, and we are not prepared to make any change at the present time. The Rev. Principal of the Blue Quills School was so informed in a letter dated the 9th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that while at Saddle Lake the Principal of Blue Quills School and the Indians from the different reserves there signified their wish that the school children should get two months' holidays instead of one and a half months as at present. I believe some of the schools in Alberta are allowed two months and the general feeling all over is that a two-month period of holidays should be given the same as in White schools. This, however, is not an important point as far as I am concerned; I merely wish to bring the matter to the attention of the Department. A considerable saving would be effected in not having to pay for the 2 extra weeks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the first instant, with reference to the request that you have received from the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School regarding holidays.\n\nIn this connection I enclose for your information a copy of circular letter of May 20, 1925. You will note that grant is only allowed for 43 days' holidays. If a principal of a residential school finds it necessary to allow longer holidays to any pupil, it should be on the distinct understanding that the Department will only pay grant for 43 days. For instance, if a pupil is allowed out on holidays on June first and does not return until September first, grant should only be requested for 73 days (30 days in September, plus 43 days' holidays). In the event of holidays longer than 43 days being allowed, the Principal should show plainly on his September quarter return the dates between which the annual leave was taken. You will note that the last paragraph of circular letter of May 20, 1925, contains instructions to this effect.\n\nAbout a month ago, the Principal of the Blue Quills School wrote the Department requesting that he be allowed to take two months' holidays. We understood from his letter that he requested two months' holidays with grant and, on this understanding, the Department wrote him on May 9th. I enclose for your information a copy of our letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnc.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nJune 23rd 1934\n\nTo the Honourable Harold W. Mac Gill,\nDeputy Supt General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI have your letter No 1-1-10, of June 15th, concerning the pupils of 16 years of age and over, and may say that I was surprised to read that the principals of schools need a special permission from the Superintendent General to keep them at school till 18 years of age. Since long time, it has been the general rule of the Department to retain the pupils at school till 18 years of age, and even farms have been adjointed to boarding schools in order to train the big boys from 16 to 18 years of age in farming, whilst the big girls should be trained in sewing and cooking.\n\nIf the pupils stay at school till they be 16 only, this means that this training in farming, sewing and cooking, will be suppressed.\n\nFor me, I have no reason to keep at school these big boys and girls who are 16 and over. However, I realize that the big girls should be retained at school till they be 18, which is the usual age of marriage, in order to prevent them from immorality on the reserves.\n\nI submit below the complete list of these pupils who are just now 16 and over:\n\n155, Louis Steinkauer\n166, John Baptist Redcrow\n171, Paul Lamirack\n172, Narcisse Houle\n176, Charles Gladu\n179, Jerry Winkyjack\n181, Robert Anderson\n186, Raymond Hunter\n191, Peter Delver\n211, Michel White\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 3rd, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo regarding children sixteen years of age and over in the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, it is noted that you give the names of these but you do not state definitely whether or not you recommend that they be kept for a further period. Please let me have a definite recommendation from you in this regard, stating the names and register numbers of the pupils sixteen years of age and over whom you consider might be discharged and, also, the names and register numbers of those whom you consider should be retained for a further period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Father Comire, and promised to bring up his children in Catholic religion. Since his marriage, he did not practice Catholic religion, but did not return back to the Protestant one, and in fact, he had all his children baptised in Catholic church.\n\nTwo years ago, he had some children to put at school, and because not practising any religion, was asked for choosing the school where to put his children, Catholic or Protestant. It is stated that he chose the Protestant school, and in fact, one of his boys was sent to Edmonton Indian school. I suppose this boy did not stay long at school, as he is home since nearly 2 years, and has not been brought back to school.\n\nNow Thomas Houle wishes to enter some children into Blue Quills school, not this one that was at Protestant school, but some other ones. What to do? Can I accept these children? According to the principle of the Indian Act, vid: that the Catholics must go to Catholic school and the Protestants to the Protestant one, all the children of Thomas Houle should have been admitted into a Catholic school, and not into a Protestant school; they have all been baptised in Catholic religion. More of that, the Department should see that the Indians keep their promise to bring up their children into the religion, where there is a promise as in the case of Thomas Houle.\n\nHoping to hear from you very soon in this connection, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. J. T. Hill,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, November 26, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your telegram, dated the 24th instant, which reads as follows:-\n\n\"Telegram signed Wm. Feran received. Ten children can be accepted and examined December 8th at Blue Quill School, St. Paul.\" - \"The Principal\".\n\nThe Department cannot understand the above telegram, as we have no record of having received a request to place ten children in the Blue Quills School. Please let me know from where the telegram was sent and to what agency the children mentioned belong.\n\nThe Department return of the Blue Quills School showed an enrolment of 136 pupils, and, if that number is at present in the school, the Department does not see how you can accept ten more, as this would mean that you would have children in excess of the number for which grant is provided.\n\nYou should let me have full particulars regarding the children referred to in the telegram, in order that the matter may receive further consideration. The children should not be admitted until the Department's approval is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jes. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSaint Paul, Alberta.\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul-Alta.\n\nDec.3rd 1934\n\nTo J.D.Sutherland, Esq.,\nSupt of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nI have your letter No.18-1-10, of Nov.26th, referring to the telegram you received from me. This telegram is the reply to a telegram coming from Ottawa, signed Wm Foran, and termed as follows:\n\n\"Principal, Indian School, Saddle-Lake, Indian Agency, Saddle-Lake, Alta. Wire if you can arrange for and supervise examination December 8th approximately ten candidates\". Wm Foran.\n\nand in foot-note this:\n\n\"Rev. Father Angin: Mr Gullion advise this telegram is for you\".\n\nI could not understand this telegram, and I do not know who is Mr Wm Foran. I thought that Mr Foran was an employee of the Department of Indian Affairs, asking me if I could accept ten pupils more, into Blue Quills School. So I termed my telegram to you in consequence. But Mr Gullion, having received a second telegram, termed as the first one, came to see me and explained that Mr Wm Foran is a member of the civil service commission, asking me to supervise the examination of the ten candidates who applied for the clerkship of the Saddle-Lake Agency, this place being vacant by the clearance of Mr Sicard. After this explanation, I saw well my mistake about the telegram you received, and you must consider it as null.\n\nAs to the number of the pupils you state to be 136 at Blue Quill School, I may say that in fact this last number appears in the first column of the last quarterly return, but in fact I received grant for 121 only, the other ones being discharged, and it is the true number of pupils we have just now. You see then there is yet place at Blue Quills School for 10 pupils and more.\n\nBeing sorry to have troubled you with this telegram, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nBlue Quill Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul, Alta.\n\nDec. 3rd 1934\n\nTo J.D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nSupt of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference with your letter No 118-1-10, of last Oct. 27th,\nConcerning the children of Thomas Hoole, Indian of Goodfish Lake\nReserve, could you please tell me what you have decided as to\nthe admission of these children into Blue Quilla School,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of October 27th, last, with reference to the request for the admission of the children of Thomas Houle to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. As yet, the Department has not received any reply to that letter and I would appreciate having your report at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Cullion has not yet submitted to the Department the information we require. He is being again written today and instructed to reply immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nLe 11 Mars 1935\n\n\u00c0 l'attention du Surintendant de l'\u00c9ducation Indienne,\nOttawa.\n\nMonsieur le Surintendant,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur de vous rendre compte que je n'ai re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse du D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes au sujet des enfants de Thomas Houle de Goodfish-Lake. Cet I., disant \u00e0 demand\u00e9 de mettre ses enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Blue Quills et je vous rappelle que ces enfants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 baptis\u00e9s catholiques. J'apprends aussi que l'agent de Saddle-Lake fait des efforts pour placer \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole protestante d'Edmonton une fille d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e Flora Lewis, orpheline, adopt\u00e9e par Joseph Gladu de Whitefish-Lake; cette fille est catholique, n\u00e9e de parents catholiques. J'ai su que les 5 petits-enfants de Sam Bull de Goodfish-Lake ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s pour l'\u00e9cole protestante d'Edmonton, bien que la m\u00e8re en mourant ait demand\u00e9 qu'ils soient \u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique. Tout cela me confirme dans mon opinion que l'Agent de Saddle-Lake travaille pour l'\u00e9cole d'Edmonton qui n'est pas son \u00e9cole et au contraire ne fait rien pour l'\u00e9cole Blue Quills qui est son \u00e9cole m\u00eame les catholiques sont envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole protestante d'Edmonton sous pr\u00e9texte que les parents le demandent. Est-ce que le principe de l'Acte Indien qui veut que les catholiques aillent \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique et les protestants chez les protestants existe encore? Ou bien est-ce que les agents ont re\u00e7u des ordres sp\u00e9ciaux pour aider les \u00e9coles protestantes et au contraire auraient re\u00e7u des ordres pour ne pas aider les \u00e9coles catholiques? L'Agent de Saddle-Lake peut se fendre en quatre pour travailler pour l'\u00e9cole protestante d'Edmonton, recruter des enfants et remettre les d\u00e9serteurs sur le train de Spedden \u00e0 Edmonton; mais il ne bougera pas pour l'\u00e9cole Blue Quills; non seulement cela, mais il enl\u00e8ve les enfants catholiques pour les mettre \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole protestante.\n\nJ'ai parl\u00e9 de cette question aux autres Principaux d'\u00e9coles indiennes \u00e0 notre derni\u00e8re convention, et ils m'ont dit que les m\u00eames faits se pr\u00e9sentent chez eux. Alors nous, catholiques, nous serions trait\u00e9s comme des citoyens de deuxi\u00e8me zone? c'est bon \u00e0 savoir et nous ferons notre possible pour faire cesser cet \u00e9tat de choses. En attendant, je vous serais bien oblig\u00e9 de me dire si je puis accepter les enfants de Thomas Houle; 2) Je demande que Flora Lewis soit plac\u00e9e \u00e0 Blue Quills 3) Je demande aussi que dor\u00e9navant les enfants baptis\u00e9s catholiques soient envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole catholique et que les enfants baptis\u00e9s protestants soient envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole protestante, et cela sans \u00e9gard pour les parents qui changent de religion plus souvent que de chemise.\n\nVeuillez agr\u00e9er, Monsieur le Surintendant, mes salutations,\n\nRev. Jos Angin,\nPrincipal\nTranslation\n\nBlue Quills Ind. Res. School\nSt. Paul, Alta., March 11, 1935\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Education\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that I have received no reply from the Dept. of Indian Affairs concerning the children of Thomas Steele of Goldfish Lake. This Indian has requested to send his children to the Blue Quills school and I wish to remind you that these children were baptised Catholics. Also hear that the Agent of Saddle Lake is making efforts to place at the protestant school of Edmonton a girl named Flora Lewis orphan, adopted by Joseph Gladu of Whitefish Lake; that girl is catholic born from catholic parents. I have learned that the 23 grand children of Sam Bell of Goldfish Lake were accepted at the protestant school of Edmonton although the mother in living farther that they be brought up in the catholic school. All this confirms my opinion that the Agent of Saddle Lake works for the school of Edmonton which is not his school and on the contrary does not do a thing for the school of Blue Quills which is his school; there are even catholics sent to the protestant school of Edmonton under the pretext that the parents are asking for it. Is the principle of the Indian Act that specifies that the catholics must go to the catholic school and the protestants to the protestant school does still exist? Or otherwise, have the Agents received special orders to help the protestant schools and on the other hand been given orders not to\nhelp the catholic schools? The Agent of Saddle Lake is rather busy to work for the protestant school of Edmonton, to recruit children to put deserted back on the train of Stephen to Edmonton; but he wants not more a finger for the school of Blue Quills; not only that, he takes catholic children and sends them to the protestant school.\n\nSpoke of this matter to the other school Principals of Indian schools at our last convention, and they told me that the same facts are happening with them. Consequently we, catholics, are treated as citizens of second rate? This is good to know and we will do our utmost to have that state of affair cease. In the meantime, I would be much obliged if you would tell me if I could accept the children of Thomas House;\n\n2\u00b0. I demand that Frank Lewis be placed at Blue Quills.\n\n3\u00b0. I demand also that in future the children baptised catholic be sent to the catholic school and those baptised protestant be sent to the protestant school, and that without paying attention to parents who are changing religion often than they remove their shirt.\n\nKindly accept this my best regards\n\n[Signature]\nRev. Jos. Augie\nPrincipal\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to requests that you have received for the admission of certain children to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nI would like to assure you that the Department gives very careful consideration whenever there is any doubt regarding the religious auspices under which a child should be educated. Such cases occur more or less frequently at practically all Indian residential schools and several factors have to be considered before a decision can be made. This involves several letters and it necessarily follows that considerable time must elapse before a final decision is made.\n\nThe Department is not yet prepared to decide where the children of Thomas Houle should be educated but the matter is receiving consideration and, in the meantime, of course, the children must not be placed in any Indian residential school.\n\nWe do not appear to have any correspondence on file with reference to the case of Flora Lewis. I note your statement that the Agent is endeavouring to place her in the Edmonton Residential School. He is being written and requested to report at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to refer you to official letters of October 27th and December 13th, last, with reference to a request received by the Department for the admission of the children of Thomas Houle to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department cannot understand why you have delayed answering these letters. Please let me have a full report at the earliest possible date. In replying, you should comment on the information received by the Department and sent to you in official letter of October 27th.\n\nThe Department is, also, informed that you are endeavouring to place Flora Lewis, adopted daughter of Joseph Gladu of Whitefish Lake, in the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Our correspondent states that this girl is a Catholic and that her parents were Catholics. We do not appear to have any correspondence from you regarding this girl. Please let me have a full report.\n\nAs directed by circular letter of November 12, 1926, the above mentioned children must not be placed in any Indian residential school until a final decision is made by the Department regarding the religious auspices under which they are to be educated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of the 20th ultimo, in which you enclosed applications for the admission of certain non-Treaty Indian children from the Whitefish Lake Reserve to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Included among these applications were those of William G. Erasmus, Beatrice Olive Erasmus and Elmer Charles Erasmus. The application forms for their admission were signed by their grandfather, Sam Bull.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of a letter from Rev. Jos. Anglin, O.M.I., which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I have learned that the three grandchildren of Sam Bull of Goodfish Lake were accepted at the Protestant School at Edmonton, although the mother, in dying, asked that they be brought up in the Catholic School. All this confirms my opinion that the Agent at Saddle Lake works for the school at Edmonton, which is not his school, and, on the contrary, does not do a thing for the school of Blue Quills, which is his school. There are even Catholics sent to the Protestant School at Edmonton under the pretext that the parents are asking for it.\"\n\nThe Department would appreciate your taking up this matter with Mr. Agent Gullion, with particular reference to the three grandchildren of Sam Bull. You should ascertain what religion the parents of these three children were recognized as professing and you should state how long they have been residing with Sam Bull.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I note the quotation given from a letter received by the Department from the Principal of Blue Quills School.\n\nI consider that Father Angin's remarks about Mr. Gullion are uncalled for; Our Agent may have many faults but one thing I can say for him is that he is honest and above-board in all his dealings and I know he wishes to be fair to both schools. This is the first intimation I have had that the Catholic Church has any call on the children whatever; Sam Bull, I believe, attended the Red Deer School, although I am not sure of this. One thing I do know is that he is a Protestant, as he is a representative from that part of the country to the annual conference of the United Church in Edmonton and when I was there in May last year, Sam Bull was attending the said conference; and he has always been considered the principal representative of the Protestant Church amongst the Indians in that section. Therefore, as the mother of the children in question was Sam's daughter, and as far as I know they have always lived with him, I presume Sam has the right to say what school they should go to; and as I have said before, I have never had any intimation that there was any question of these children going to anything but a Protestant School. I will, however, write to Mr. Gullion and get full particulars, and advise the Department as soon as I hear from him.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Blue Quills Res SCHOOL DURING January, March QUARTER, 1903\n\n| No. | NAME | Date of Admission, Age on Admission | No. of Tickets which pupils Annuity is paid | BAND | NAME OF PARENTS AND LIVING OR DEAD (Insert L for living, D for dead, after name.) | Religion of Parents | State of Education when entering the school | Places and Years of Previous Education |\n|-----|------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     |      |                                  |                                             |      | Father.

Erasmus, Beatrice Olive Erasmus and Elmer Charles Erasmus, grandchildren of Sam Bull, recently admitted to the Edmonton Indian Residential school, and I wish to submit the following in reply thereto:\n\nAlthough I was familiar with the situation insofar as these children were concerned, I have again since the receipt of your letter, interviewed Sam Bull, chiefly in order to ascertain whether or not his daughter had made a last request in connection with having the children placed in any particular school. Sam Bull stated that she had not done so and denied positively, the statement that his daughter's dying wish was that the children were to be brought up in a Catholic school.\n\nSam Bull and family are and always have been Protestants. The Erasmus family are also all Protestants. Sam Bull has been taking a leading part in matters concerning United Church affairs at the Goodfish Lake mission and has taken services at the church in the absence of the resident missionary. He has also been attending the United Church conferences and district meetings as a delegate representing the Indians of that mission. Sam Bull and his wife both attended the old Red Deer Industrial school for a time and his children have attended the Red Deer Industrial and the Edmonton Indian Residential schools. He has a son, Willie Bull, in the Edmonton Residential school at the present time. His daughter, the late Mrs. L. Erasmus, attended this school and she, like the rest of the family, belonged to the United Church. L. Erasmus and Sam Bull's daughter were married in the United Church at Goodfish Lake.\n\nI would say that Sam Bull is one of the leading\n\nM. Christianson Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nCalgary, Alta.\nProtestants at Whitefish Lake reserve and as his son-in-law is a Protestant and comes from a Protestant family, there should be no question as to their religion. Excepting during short intervals on a few occasions when the parents were visiting elsewhere, Sam Bull states that he has had these children since infancy.\n\nQuestioning Sam Bull as to whether his son-in-law might have asked or written Rev. Father Angin in regard to taking them in his school, he stated that although he did not think that he had, it was possible that L. Erasmus might have made enquiries and that if such were the case, his son-in-law, since he was not keeping the children, should not have done so without first consulting him. I might mention that these children, together with Rena Grace Whitford and Thelma Whitford, were sent to the Edmonton Resident School on the 25th ultimo, Sam Bull acting as their escort.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Sam Bull stated that she had not done so and denied positively the statement that his daughter's dying wish was that the children were to be brought up in a Catholic school.\n\n\"Sam Bull and family are and always have been Protestants. The Erasmus family are also all Protestants. Sam Bull has been taking a leading part in matters concerning United Church affairs at the Goodfish Lake mission and has taken services at the church in the absence of the resident missionary. He has also been attending the United Church conferences and district meetings as a delegate representing the Indians of that mission. Sam Bull and his wife both attended the old Red Deer Industrial School for a time and his children have attended the Red Deer Industrial and the Edmonton Indian Residential Schools.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jes. Angin, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School, ST. PAUL, ALTA.\nOttawa, April 17, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letters of October 27th and December 13th, 1934, also to official letter of March 22nd, 1935, with reference to the request received by the Department for the admission of the children of Thomas Houle to the Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nThe Department has not yet received a reply to any of these letters. Please let me have the information requested at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe Department cannot understand why you do not reply to official communications, and, if there is any further delay in this regard, serious notice will have to be taken of the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter No.118-1-10 of the 22nd ultimo in regard to the subject dealt with in your letters of the 27th October and December 15th last, I beg to submit the following.\n\nIn regard to the information received by the Department that a request had been made for the admission of Thomas Houle's children into the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school, I might say that in order to avoid any possible trouble, this question has been dealt with very carefully from the beginning. I have interviewed these people personally and recently when I had occasion to send Farming Instructor Mr. Boorse to Whitefish Lake reserve, I requested him to call and see them in order to ascertain whether or not they had changed their attitude toward the school. They discussed the question with him very much along the same lines as on previous occasions they had discussed it with me. I might mention however that while Mrs. Thomas Houle had taken very little part in the early discussions regarding their children, she had lately apparently intimated that she would have preferred having them in the Blue Quill's school as they would then be nearer home. On the other hand, Thomas Houle still maintains that they should go to the Edmonton Indian Residential school.\n\nRegarding the children of James Houle and Thomas Houle, I would also refer to previous correspondence, namely; my letter dated March 16th, 1931 and official letter No. 110-C-10 dated May 5th, 1931. Also my letter of the 20th January, 1932, with applications for admission. No pressure was brought to bear and the request that the children be placed in the Edmonton Residential school came from the parents voluntarily. Considerable time elapsed between the time the request was first made and the date of the admission of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nthe children to the Edmonton school. This is a matter on which a good deal of time has been spent and the information submitted to the Department concerning these cases was obtained from personal interviews and not from hearsay. The recruiting of Indian children on the reserves here is done by myself with the assistance of the Farming Instructor only. No efforts were made to recruit from the James Houle and Thomas Houle families during the past year.\n\nIn regard to these two families, I have endeavored to place before the Department as accurately as possible, information as obtained. Had the parents expressed to me any desire to place their children in the Blue Quill's school, I should have been glad to have placed their request before the Department. This matter will again be taken up with them later and the Department will be fully advised before any action is taken.\n\nRegarding the girl Flora Lewis, I beg to refer to my letter No.215 dated October 8th, 1928 and official letter No.39218-1 dated February 12th, 1929, in reply thereto. As instructed therein, I interviewed the foster parents, Gladu, shortly after the receipt of this letter and advised them that while the Department did not desire to disturb their relationship, it would have to be understood that the child Flora would be placed in a Roman Catholic school when she became of age. The statement made by your informant that I was endeavoring to place this girl in the Edmonton Residential school is not true. As a matter of fact, I was approached by a delegation of Indians at Whitefish Lake reserve last spring regarding this girl. The delegation headed by one Jas. Half, a relative of the girl, stated that they had been told that I had advised Gladu to be prepared to send the child to the Blue Quill's school and that as the foster parents were Protestants, they had discussed the matter and decided to ask me if it would be possible to send the girl to the Edmonton Residential school. I advised them that Gladu had been told that the girl would necessarily have to be sent to a Catholic school and that so far as I was concerned I would have to carry out my instructions. The child was unfit at that time and I advised them that the Department would be asked before anything definite was decided on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Hamilton\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, I beg to say that the children of James Houle and Thomas Houle should not be placed in any residential school at the present time.\n\nIt is noted from the fifth paragraph of your letter that you will again discuss school matters with these Indians at a later date, at which time you should report to the Department.\n\nWhen Flora Lewis is of age to be placed in a residential school, the Department considers that she should be sent to Blue Quills. The religion under which this girl is to be educated was definitely settled at the time of her father's death, and you were informed regarding the Department's ruling in official letter of February 12th, 1929 - File 39118-1.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As mentioned in my letter above referred to, cases of this nature are gone into very carefully and no pressure is brought to bear on the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.F.

Mackenzie,\nSecr\u00e9taire du D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes,\nOttawa.\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'ai re\u00e7u il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelque temps votre lettre du 17 Avril, No 118-1-10 concernant les petits enfants de Sam Bull, Indien de Goodfish-Lake. Dans ma pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente lettre, j'avais fait allusion \u00e0 ce fait que la m\u00e8re de ces enfants avait demand\u00e9 avant sa mort que ses 5 enfants fussent \u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole Blue Quills dans la religion catholique.\n\nDurant l'hiver dernier, des Indiens de Saddle-Lake ont pass\u00e9 quelque temps \u00e0 Goodfish Lake pour la p\u00eache et ont assist\u00e9 aux derniers moments de cette femme, Madame Erasmus, fille de Sam Bull. Ils l'ont entendu exprimer ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s au sujet des susdits enfants, et sont venus \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes reprises me demander d'accepter dans mon \u00e9cole ces enfants. Je leur ai r\u00e9pondu que ces enfants \u00e9tant m\u00e9tis ne pouvaient \u00eatre accept\u00e9s dans une \u00e9cole indienne sans la permission du D\u00e9partement Indien et sans l'acceptation de l'Agent. Ces Indiens sont donc venus ici sans int\u00e9r\u00eat de leur part et j'ai cru \u00e0 leur parole, d'o\u00f9 l'allusion dans ma lettre. Depuis j'ai re\u00e7u votre lettre et le rapport fait \u00e0 vous sans aucun doute par l'Agent Gullion. J'ai revu et questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau ces 5 Indiens en leur lisant m\u00eame une partie du rapport de Gullion et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 indign\u00e9s. Dans le rapport en effet, il est dit que Sam Bull a interrog\u00e9 sur les derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s de sa fille, a ni\u00e9 positivement que cette derni\u00e8re ait eu la volont\u00e9 de faire \u00e9duquer ses enfants dans une \u00e9cole catholique.\n\nJ'ai donc interroger ces 5 Indiens, Robert Houle, Lazarus Shirt, et Joseph Houle et sur leur d\u00e9sir je leur ai fait signer les affidavits que vous trouverez inclus. Ils ont entendu Madame Erasmus et t\u00e9moignent qu'elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son p\u00e8re Sam Bull que ses 5 enfants soient \u00e9duqu\u00e9s dans une \u00e9cole catholique et baptis\u00e9es catholiques. Contre ce fait, vous ne pouvez rien et Gullion qui fait l'apologie des Bull \u00e9crit en marge du fait.\n\nIl s'agit de savoir maintenant qui ment, ou bien Sam Bull ou bien l'Agent Gullion. Les Indiens ci-dessus nomm\u00e9s accusent Gullion, et je n'en serais pas \u00e9tonn\u00e9, ce ne serait pas d'ailleurs la premi\u00e8re fois qu'il ferait un faux rapport, j'en ai la preuve.\n\nJe vais continuer mon enqu\u00eate \u00e0 ce sujet pour savoir qui a menti. En tout cas, vous avez les affidavits au nombre de 3, si vous en voulez d'autres, je peux vous en procurer, car nombreux sont ceux qui ont entendu la fille de Sam Bull \u00e9mettre ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s au sujet de ses enfants.\n\nL'affaire n'est donc pas encore finie.\n\nPoville, agent, Monsieur, une salutation,\n\nRev. J. Angus, Provincial\nSir,\n\nI have received sometime ago your letter of the 17th of April No. 118-1-10 concerning the grand children of Sam Bull, Indian of Goldfish Lake. In my preceding letter I hinted to the fact that the mother of these children had asked before her death that her 3 children be brought up at the Blue Quills school in the catholic religion.\n\nDuring last Winter, some Indians of Saddle Lake have remained sometime at Goldfish Lake for fishing and were present at the last moments of this woman, Mrs. Erdman's daughter of Sam Bull. They heard her express her last will in regard to the above mentioned children, and came at different occasions back me to accept in my school. I replied that these children were half-breeds and could not be accepted in an Indian school without permission from the Department and the approval of the Agent. These Indians have consequently come here without interest on their part and I took their word that was alluded to in my letter. Since then I have received your letter and the report made to you no doubt by Agent Gullion. I saw again and questioned those three Indians and read them part of the report of Gullion and they were indignantly over it. In fact in the report it is said that Sam Bull being interrogated over the last wishes of his daughter, has positively denied that the latter had had the desire of having her children educated.\nin a catholic school.\n\nConsequently questioned these 3 Indians, Robert Houle, James Short and Joseph Houle and upon their request I had them sign the affidavits attached herewith. They heard Mrs. Graham and testify that she asked her father Sam Bull that her three children be educated in a catholic school and baptised as catholics. Against these facts you can not do anything and Gullion who stands as the vindicator of the Bull wrote in contradiction of the facts.\n\nThe question is to know now who lies, whether it is Sam Bull or Agent Gullion. The above mentioned Indians accuse Gullion, and I would not be surprised if it was not the first time he would make a false report. I have the proof of it.\n\nI will continue my investigation over this matter to find out who lied. However you have the affidavits, this of them if you wish for more, I can get you them because there are many who hear the daughters of Sam Bull express her last wishes about her children.\n\nThis matter is consequently not yet closed.\n\nKindly accept, Sir, my best regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

I am arranging, however, to have this sent to you at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSaint Paul, Alta.\nTo Philip Phelan, Esq.,\nBureau of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask you that the children of Thomas Houle of Goodfish Lake be placed at the Blue Quills School. There has been a long correspondence last year about this case, and would be pleased to get a decision.\n\nI get you remember that Thomas Houle has been baptised catholic before his marriage with a catholic woman, and promised at this time that all his children would be baptised catholics. In fact, they have been baptised in catholic religion. Four years ago, I asked to the Department that some of these children be admitted into Blue Quills School, and I received a reply from Mr Ferrier, letter No 110-0-10, of May 5th 1931, stating that the choice of the school should be given to Thomas Houle. I do not know what orders received Indian Agent Gullion at this time, but I know that Thomas Houle was not given the choice as to the school where he should place his children. He was said by the Indian Agent: \"There is place at Edmonton School for your children, you have to send them there\". In fact one boy was sent to Edmonton School but did not stay long. Last year, Thomas Houle asked me to take another boy to my school, and this year he has repeated his asking for 2 boys. More of that, he has advised Mr Gullion that he would place his children at Blue Quills School.\n\nAs you see, this case is under question since long time, and I guess it is reasonable to ask for a decision. These children have been baptised catholics, they have never been baptised protestants, and I have the right to ask that they be admitted into Blue Quills school.\n\nHoping you take the case in consideration and you give finally a decision, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 28th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to your F-85 of April 12th, last, and previous correspondence with reference to the children of Thomas Houle.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of another letter, urging the admission of these children to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. We are, also, informed that Houle has advised you that he wishes his children placed in the Blue Quills School.\n\nPlease make immediate inquiries and advise the Department if Houle and his wife are now recognized as Catholics. We are definitely informed that all the children have been baptized Catholics. If Houle is now recognized as a Catholic, there is no reason why his children should not be placed in the Blue Quills School. The Department will expect you to give this matter your immediate attention and forward your report by September 14th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

In reply, I might say that I interviewed Thomas Houle after treaty payments in July and on the 7th August regarding his children and I again saw him on the 3rd instant. He makes no definite statement in the matter of his religion, apparently giving the matter very little, if any, serious consideration. He however stated on the last two occasions when the question was discussed, that he would like to place the two boys now at home, Robert - age 13 years and Alex. Houle - age 10 years, in the Blue Quill's Residential school, the reason given when discussing the subject being, that the children would be nearer home and that he could see them conveniently should they become sick at any time.\n\nIn regard to religion professed by Thomas Houle, I beg to refer to my letter of the 16th March 1931. There is no apparent change in his attitude as reported at that time. Mrs. Thomas Houle is a Roman Catholic. As you are aware, there are two children from this family in the Edmonton Residential school. Houle states that he does not wish to disturb these but he would now like to place the two boys above mentioned in the Blue Quill's Residential school. If the Department approves, Houle will be advised that these two boys should be placed in the Blue Quill's school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Guildon\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your F-85 of the 7th ultimo, I beg to say that it has been decided to approve the admission of Robert and Alex Houle to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health should be forwarded for the Department's file.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan.\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW.

Have you ascertained recently whether or not they have carried out your instructions in this regard? The Department considers that all pupils allowed out on holidays should have returned to the school by this time.\n\nThe Department will expect you to give this matter your immediate attention and make absolutely certain that the children have returned to the Blue Quills Residential School. It is hoped that the letter which you state you are forwarding will include full explanations regarding the reasons for the children from the Beaver Lake Reserve not returning to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The latter were cases who had not had pertussis and were coughing at the time, and the parents were advised to keep them home for a week or more and that if the cough ceased, they were to be sent to school, if not, they were to report to the Agent who was to advise me so that they could be re-examined. As none of these cases reported I assumed that they only had a cold of the ordinary variety and that all had returned to school before October 1st.\"\n\nIt would appear from the above that Dr. Decosse expected the children to return to the Blue Quills Residential School much sooner than they did. The Department has not yet received the letter which you stated in your telegram of the 9th instant you were forwarding. It is hoped, however, when this letter is received, that it will explain why you did not make certain that the pupils had returned to the Blue Quills School about September 17th, which was the date Dr. Decosse informed you that the majority of them could return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

Quinn\nLazare Bearskin\nGeorge Gladu\nJoseph Lewis\n\nYou wrote to Rev. Nathan Langlois that orders had been given to have these children back to school; you can see by yourself that the orders have not been put to execution; and I am not so much surprised myself as Gullion is just good for nothing. It would be as well as to put a wood stick as agent instead of Gullion, but with this difference that a wood stick would cost nothing to the Government, whilst Gullion costs $1000.00 of salary per year. And in a few months, Gullion will retire with a pension, and the poor workers of Canada will be obliged to sweat over their work to earn money to pay taxes for giving a pension to this fellow. This is absolutely a shame. And this should be put in the papers; I don't say that sometimes I will not write this case in the papers, chiefly as I know that Gullion did not watch over his clerk Sicard who stole $450.00 from the purse of the Agency 2 years ago.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn a letter dated the 16th instant, the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School advises that the following children have not yet returned from their summer holidays:\n\nSaddle Lake:- Rosanna Cardinal\nLouise Cardinal\nCatherine Shirt\n\nGoodfish Lake:- May Patenaude\nHelen Sparklingeyes\n\nBeaver Lake:- Magloire Gladu\nJ.

Johnson M.D.\nSADDLE LAKE, ALBERTA.\nSeptember 23rd, 1937.\n\nSir:-\n\nI wish to submit the following for your consideration and advice:-\n\nOn the 13th instant, having been informed that one Belrose (Wm.) Norwest, non-treaty French half-breed, had arrived on the Saddle Lake reserve, I warned him in writing to leave the reserve at once and that upon his failure to do so, action would be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act. Norwest disappeared from the place at which he was staying but four or five days later, he turned up at another place on the reserve.\n\nDiscussing this and other matters with the R.C.M.P. Police at St. Paul, I was informed that a complaint had been made to the effect that this man had deserted his family of six children near Frog Lake Indian Reserve. The names and the ages of the children were given by the Police as follows:-\n\n| Name       | Age |\n|------------|-----|\n| Louis      | 13  |\n| Mary Emma  | 10  |\n| Josephine  | 8   |\n| Julia      | 6   |\n| Alvina     | 4   |\n| Floyd Edward | 2  |\n\nThey were said to have been living on Section 2, Township 56, Range 3, West of the 4th meridian. This matter had been taken up with the Provincial authorities and the R.C.M.P. Police were evidently instructed to refer the case to the Indian Agent, Saddle Lake Agency.\n\nOn the 21st instant, I issued a warrant to apprehend Belrose (Wm.) Norwest on a charge of trespass. In the meantime, he had again disappeared and upon making enquiries, I found that he had brought his children to the reserve.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nreserves, leaving three of them with an Indian woman, Mrs. Kakeseem of No.25, Blue Quill's Band No.127. Mrs. Kakeseem's daughter Cecile was the common law wife of Belrose (Wm.) Norwest and the mother of the children. She died last Spring.\n\nWhen I called at the Blue Quill's school on Tuesday, I was informed that Mrs. Kakeseem had taken there, three of the children, namely,- Louis, Mary Emma and Julia Norwest. These children are now at this school. The other three children are likely in the hands of Norwest who has not been located since the issuance of warrant.\n\nWhen asked regarding the status of these children, I stated that according to the Indian Act, in my opinion, these children were not wards of the Department of Indian Affairs and that under the circumstances, I could not make any recommendation in the matter of having them cared for by the Department.\n\nThe grandmother, Mrs. Kakeseem, is an elderly woman (widow) and receives rations and she could not keep any of the children without extra assistance.\n\nI should be glad to have your advice in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Gullion,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSaddle Lake, Alta.,\nNov.1, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department have asked for applications for admission into the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school of the following children from your Agency:\n\nNo. 330 - Pierre P. Janvier\nNo. 304 - Adolphe Janvier\nNo. 0301 - Lena Noel\n\nThe application forms for these children and also one for No. 0300 - Blanche McFeeters - were forwarded to you for completion with a letter dated September 25th 1939.\n\nI should be glad if you would check these and submit them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.T. Hill Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nNovember 1, 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No.118-1-10 of the 25th ultimo, I beg to submit herewith application for admission of Martin Pasquayak, No.298, into the Blue Quill's Residential school.\n\nRegarding No. 500, Pierre P. Janvier\n\" 504 Adolphus Janvier\n\" 501 Lens Noel; I wish to inform you that these children, also No. 500, Blanche McFeeters, are from Onion Lake Agency and I am attaching herewith copy of letter which I have today addressed to Dr. J.T. Hill regarding the forms.\n\nIn regard to No. 502 Miles Hunter, the members of this family are Protestants and there are two pupils now in the Edmonton Indian Residential school. Miles Hunter's parents, Cleophas Hunter and Louise Hunter (formerly Louise Quinnie of No.100-Band 125) of No.220 James Seenum's Band No.128, are Protestants and come from Protestant families. I have the application for admission of Miles Hunter but it is not signed by the father. Hunter happened to be absent on each of my visits to Whitefish Lake reserve and I have not to date been able to get an explanation as to why this boy was taken to the Blue Quill's school. However, this will be done at the first opportunity.\n\nWhile dealing with the subject, I should also like to mention the cases of Thos. Jackson and Reuben Bull, both of Whitefish Lake reserve. Thos. Jackson has on two or three occasions asked to have his children transferred from the Edmonton Residential school to the Blue Quill's Residential school.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nReuben Bull has children enrolled at the Edmonton Residential school and when I called during a check up of children to be returned to the schools after holidays, they were preparing to send a younger girl to the Blue Quill's school in the school truck which had been sent out for the children. I advised them that they could not do this and as the child had become ill in the meantime, she was kept at home. His explanation was that his older girl had been sick when sent home for holidays and that he was dissatisfied for various reasons. He also mentioned that although he was a Protestant, his wife was a Roman Catholic and for this reason, he considered that if they so desired, they should be permitted to place a child in the Blue Quill's school.\n\nI explained the regulations and I am mentioning these cases merely to advise the Department of the attitude of some of the Indian parents in the matter of placing children in schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\nSaddle Lake, Alta.,\nNov. 5, 1939.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school has asked for the discharge of pupil No. 021 Mary Louise Batoche, aged 7 years.\n\nThis girl has been sick in hospital for sometime and recovery is considered doubtful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Guillon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant you may inform the Principal of the Blue Quills residential school that the discharge of Mary Louise Batoche, No. 021, is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.

E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA review of the December quarter return of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School shows that pupil No. 226, Ernest Crane, is over the age of 16.\n\nNo application for retaining this boy in your school appears to have been received and in this connection I wish to direct your attention to circular letter of July 21, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nAs pointed out in the circular letter the Department realizes that frequently there are reasons for keeping certain children after they reach the age of 16 but at the same time the consent of the Superintendent General (Minister) must be obtained.\n\nI may add that in the past the Department has been favourably disposed to allowing certain pupils, especially girls, to remain in residential schools after they reach the age of 16 if good reasons for such action are given by the Principal and approved by the Indian Agent. However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. L. Balter, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupils mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFeb. 4th 1940\n\nPhilip Thomas Esq.,\nChief Training Division\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nYour letter Feb. 23rd (IIS-I-10) on hand. I would hereby ask the Department to allow the pupils actually of sixteen, to finish their academic year. Until to date we did not refuse yet a child, even if we had no hope to receive the grant we were expecting for, and therefore no child was deprived of education by the fact that one or two children were kept over the age of sixteen.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBlue Quills Ind. Res. School,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa,\nMarch 8, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant the pupils in the Blue Quills Residential School who are 16 years of age or over may remain in residence until the end of the current academic year; namely, June 30 next. At that time you should apply for their discharge.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. L.

Gillion,\nSaddle Lake Agency,\nAlberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am just dropping a few words to you. I intended to quit school this year but as I am to learn music, I know my parents do not know about this and as I say I do not want to quit school, in fact I hate to leave school. If you could please write to the Department to tell him if he could pay for me for one more year. I will now close my letter hoping good luck.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSgt. Rosa Favel\nMr. V. E. Gullion,\nSaddle Lake Agency,\nAlberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am dropping a few lines to you. There is a big realisation that just came to me. It is truthful to say that at the age of sixteen we begin to realize something in our home enterprise at school.\n\nI am so interested in my lessons, cooking and learning music and I have not started to learn music but I will later. So I am asking you if I could stay until eighteen. I don't care to go for my holidays either unless my mother needs me at home. I only care to go home for treaty.\n\nIf you could please properly speak to my father and mother about this I shall be very thankful. My father's name is Joshua Whiskyjack.\n\nI will close my letter hoping for good luck.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n[Signature]\nJane Whiskyjack\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\nApril 13th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith, report respecting the Blue Quill's Indian Residential School for the month of March, 1940.\n\nI might mention that while discussing matters concerning the school, the Reverend Principal mentioned that he had received instructions to the effect that pupils who had reached the age of 16 years should be discharged.\n\nWhile there are a few who are 16 years old on the roll, the Reverend Principal would like to have them in school until the end of the current term. A number of others shall have reached the age of 16 years by that time and the discharge of those who have reached this age would then be asked for at the end of the school term.\n\nOccasionally, a boy or girl wishes to remain in school after they reach the age of 16 years and in cases such as these, it would appear to be regrettable to have to discharge them. Since my visit to the school, I have received two such requests, both from girls who are 16 years of age. One of these is from Pupil No.0193, Jane Whiskeyjack and the other from No.0214 - Anna Favel. I am attaching copies of their letters in which they ask that they be permitted to remain in school for another term.\n\nThe high pressure boiler developed leaks in the tubes, the leaks being caused by corrosion. This matter was dealt with by letter of the 27th March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.M. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the March quarter return of the Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nThe Principal was written recently regarding children 16 years of age or over in the school. We have no objection to these pupils remaining in the school until the end of the current academic year; namely, June 30 next.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing, and the further consideration that due to conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupils at residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nHowever, if there are a few pupils who you consider should remain in the Blue Quills Residential School after they reach the age of 16 you should communicate with the Department stating your reasons.\n\nMr. W. A. Gullion,\nIndian Agent,\nHead Lake, Alta.\nand making a definite recommendation. The point to emphasize is that no pupils over 16 years of age should be kept in the Blue Quills Residential School after June 30 next unless the approval of the Department has been obtained. This, of course, does not apply to pupils reaching the age of 18 during the course of an academic year. Such pupils may remain until the close of that academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Blue Quills Residential School, to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Madeleine Baldhead\nEnglish name: Madeleine Baldhead\nAge: 12 years old\nName of Band: (signature) James Seaman No. 128\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 76-256\nFather's full name and No.: (signature) Joseph Seaman No. 256\nMother's full name and No.: (signature) Sarah Seaman No. 256\nParents living or dead: The father is dead\nState of child's health: Fair\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

This has been known as a Protestant family but Hunter refused to send his children to the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIn November, 1939, Hunter placed this boy, voluntarily, in the Blue Quill's Residential School. He was advised that the boy, being a Protestant, was not eligible for admission to that school. He insisted that he wanted his boy to remain in the Blue Quill's school and on the 2nd December, 1939, signed an application for admission form. On the 22nd February, 1940, the mother, Mrs. Norman Hunter, took this boy and his sister Annie (who had also been placed in this school) home. On the 23rd April, 1940, Norman Hunter called the Reverend Principal by phone from Spenden and asked why his children had been sent home. He also informed the Reverend Principal that he was sending his children back to the school by train and that he wished Reverend Father Balter to meet them. This was done and the boy Allan has since remained in the Blue Quill's school.\n\nThe parents requested that their children be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith and Reverend Father Balter states that complying with their request, he baptized Allan on the 19th May, 1940. The father, Norman Hunter, was interviewed on several occasions in regard to his children but there has been no change in his attitude toward the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nIn view of the circumstances in the case, I have not signed the application form as I consider that I should not be justified in making any recommendation before obtaining the opinion of the Department in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI send you herewith a copy of a letter just received from Mr. J. H. Boorse \"Acting Indian Agent\" Saddle Lake Alta., and my answer to Him.\n\nIn this letter he says: \"Word has just been received from Ottawa.\" As he does not give any name, I am writing to you directly asking you to be kind enough to communicate its contents to the Indian department, Ottawa.\n\nIn the letter from Ottawa, it is said: \"The father of this boy Allan Hunter, is still recognized as a Protestant\" but the fact that Mr. Norman Hunter has placed his children in a Catholic School, consenting that they become Catholics if they so desire, and be baptized, goes to show, that he is not a disbeliever in the Catholic religion, but rather belongs to that category of people who put the Protestant and the Catholic Religion on the same level, with rather a tendency in favor of the Catholic Church, and want to be free to send their children in the School of their own choice.\n\nI don't know what is the intention of the Indian Act. But I suppose it is not the intention of the Indian Act to go against the Natural Law which gives the parents the right to have their children instructed and educated in the school of their own choice.\n\nWe did not take any steps to have those people bring their child in our school. The child was brought here by his own mother and the father of the child before two witnesses Mr. Jonas Cardinal and Lloyd Cardinal signed a statement saying that he freely agreed that his son become a Catholic and be baptized if and when he desired so. This document has been sent to the Indian Department long ago. The child after instruction has asked to be received in the Church. The child thus having been baptized with the consent of his father, having made his first communion and having been confirmed, belongs to the Catholic Church and therefore being a Roman Catholic Child, his place is here in the Blue Quills School which is a Roman Catholic School, according to the spirit and the letter of the Indian Act.\n\nIs it not for the survival of a true Democracy, the freedom of the people that the whole British Empire and her Allies are fighting for? and if the father of a family has not the right and is not free to put his child in the school of his own choice, then what would such a Democracy amount to? Another remark may be made: During the holydays Mr. Hunter and his family assist at the Catholic Service in the Catholic Church whenever the Missionary is visiting the reserve. If those people were really disbelievers in the Catholic religion, they would not act that way. In conclusion, I once more make application for the admission of Allan Hunter, a Roman Catholic Child, in the Blue Quills Roman Catholic Residential School at St. Paul. Yours very truly,\n\n(Signed) \"L. BALTER,\" C.M.I., Prin.\nCalgary, Dec. 30th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter, and enclosures, received from Rev. L.

Fant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo you may inform the Principal of the Blue Quills Residential School that the admission of Peter Collins and Miles Hunter is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.H. Boorse,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing copy of letter received from Rev. L. Balter, O.M.I., Principal of the Blue Quills Residential School, with reference to the admission of three children of Norman Hunter to that school.\n\nIn order to carry out the intention of the Indian Act the Department has generally considered that a Catholic child is one whose parents are recognized as Catholics, and that a Protestant child is one whose parents are recognized as Protestants.\n\nIt is evident from the contents of Father Balter's letter that he wishes to place a different interpretation on the matter of eligibility for admission to a residential school. In other words, he desires that parents, either Catholic or Protestant, be permitted to designate the religion in which they wish their children educated. The Department has very carefully considered this suggestion of the Principal and as yet is not in a position to make a final decision. Our experience shows, however, that the recognition of the principle suggested by Father Balter would, in all probability, lead to a great deal of embarrassment to both Principals of residential schools and all others interested in education. If we admit the principle advocated by Father Balter in one case there is no reason why it should not be admitted in others. Besides, if a parent decides to have his child placed in a residential school on the first of September and then changes his mind on the first of December there\n\nMr. C.P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nwould be no reason why we should not accept his wishes and, in that event, you can easily see that there is a great probability that parents would shift their children from schools of one religious denomination to another unless they obtained all the privileges to which they might consider themselves entitled.\n\nOur information indicates that the Hunter family has always been recognized as Protestant and as you are aware the older children of this family were placed, at one time, at the request of the parents, in the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nBefore making a decision on Father Balter's request I should appreciate it if you would again communicate with him or, better still, if you expect to be in the vicinity of the Blue Quills School in the near future it would be preferable if you would personally interview him and discuss the whole situation with him.\n\nThere is another matter which should be brought to the Principal's attention; namely, that instructions have been repeatedly issued to Principals of all residential schools to the effect that pupils whose religious eligibility is not certain must not be admitted to a residential school until the Department's decision has been given. In the present instance Father Balter has totally disregarded these instructions. Besides, information received by the Department indicates that there is no scarcity of recruits in any part of the Dominion for residential schools. Consequently, it is difficult to see why any Principal should not confine his efforts to those eligible for admission. As you are aware, in too many cases Indians develop grievances against a Principal of a residential school and as a consequence they think they can punish that Principal by requesting the admission of their children to a school conducted under different religious auspices from those which they themselves practice.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn a recent letter received from Father Balter, principal of the Blue Quills School at St. Paul, Alta., the case is brought to me of young Allan Hunter whom the Indian Department has requested be sent back to his father. This decision of the Department is, in my opinion, in direct violation of the Indian Act that specifies that Catholic children shall be sent to Catholic schools, and undoubtedly this child has been baptized a Catholic. Moreover, it is the inherent right of parents to send their children to the school of their choice\u2014a right that is not sufficiently safeguarded by the Indian Act, and in this the Indian Act, in my opinion should be amended. To deny this to Indians savours too much of unjust oppression such as we are presently combatting in Europe; it is in direct violation of that religious liberty for which Mr. Roosevelt stands in his recent speech. Moreover, the cases of Indian children who had been baptized Catholics but put in Protestant schools have been brought to me in at least four cases. In these cases the parents wanted them brought up in the Protestant schools and I could oppose no just objection because I have always thought it the natural right of parents to choose their school. I believe that in the case of Allan Hunter, the same right of parents should prevail.\n\nWith every good wish for the New Year, I remain,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. [Name]\nOttawa,\nJanuary 14, 1941.\n\nDear Father Routhier:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 7th instant in which you discuss the desirability of having an Indian pupil, Allan Hunter, enrolled for instruction at the Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter relating to this matter sent forward to Inspector Schmidt a few days ago. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would appear that the policy of the Department for a number of years has been to look upon a Catholic child as the child of Catholic parents, and a non-Catholic child as the child of non-Catholic parents. This interpretation appears to have been satisfactory to the Church authorities until now. If, however, the new interpretation suggested by the Principal of the Blue Quills School were acceptable to all the Churches I feel confident the Government would be glad to review the whole matter. My personal opinion is that this new interpretation would create difficulties for the Principals of our residential schools that would prove almost insurmountable. In other words, the Indian parent dissatisfied with the treatment of his children at a particular school, or cherishing real or imaginary grievances, would immediately ask for the transfer of his children to the nearest residential school operated under the auspices of another Church.\n\nRev. H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\n9916 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nThis whole matter is still under review and it is my intention to discuss the matter with Rev. Father Plourde during one of his periodical visits to Ottawa. In the meantime it is of the utmost importance that no misunderstanding should exist with respect to the rights of Indian parents. There are few nationals anywhere in the world that enjoy greater freedom with respect to the education of their children than the citizens of Canada. We must be careful to bear in mind, however, that Indians are not citizens in the sense that we usually speak of citizens. Indians are wards of the Government and in a legal sense are minors. It can readily be seen, therefore, that the wards of a government are subject to all the limitations that wardship implies. I emphasize this because I note that the Principal of the Blue Quills Residential School, in his letter to Inspector Schmidt, discusses the rights of parents as if Indians enjoyed the full rights, advantages and privileges of full democratic citizenship. Indians can enjoy these rights, of course, by enfranchisement for which provision is made in the Indian Act.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to wish you and your associates a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nMay 20th, 1950\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Blue Quills Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Ruby Bull No. 0314\nAge: 8\nName of Band: Good Fish Lake Jas.

Boorse,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nFebruary 1st, 1941\n\nMr. H.A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI thank you for your letter of January 14, and particularly for the New Year greetings.\n\nRe \"If the new interpretation suggested by the principal of the Blue Quills School were acceptable to all the Churches, I feel confident the Government would be glad to review the whole matter.\" I believe definitely that in recent years this has been the policy of the Department and the Churches have not given another interpretation. I remember some two years ago the case of three children from the Wabamun Reserve, baptized Catholics, and of Catholic parents who had died, who were entrusted to Protestant guardians and placed in the Protestant school of Morley. I had thought this unusual and having referred the case to Father Plourde, he told me that children were placed mainly according to the wishes of the parents or guardians. I have for reference also the case of Albert Cardinal of the Saddle Lake Reserve, baptized Catholic, born of Catholic parents, his father being Baptiste Cardinal, who was sent to the Protestant school of Edmonton and remained there throughout his schooling. This Baptiste Cardinal has now two of his children at the Blue Quills School. I have no doubt, but I know well that Father Riou has told me more than once that some of his Catholic parents sent their children to the Protestant school at the Blackfoot Reserve.\n\nI realize well that the Indians should not be allowed, for imaginary grievances, to transfer their children, especially during the school year, from one institution to another, and this can easily be checked, but there is a broad margin from this to not permitting them to place them in the school of their choice when they decide to send their children to school. I understand that Indians are wards of the Government, but no guardian, even though it be the Government, may violate the fundamental rights of persons under its tutelage, although I readily admit that it can fix certain limitations in view of the common good of its subjects, especially where abuse creeps in. I think however that there is far less danger than anywhere else, in allowing Indian parents to choose their school, on account of that deep parental love innate in the human heart, which normally inclines them to follow what they think best for their children.\n\nWith regard to Father Balter, may I state that he had no doubts whatever as to the eligibility of Allan Hunter for the Blue Quills School, because Allan had been received into the Church with the consent of his parents and from pressure of ours. Moreover you are most probably acquainted with the utter negligence in some instances of the Galettes in sending the forms to Ottawa for acceptance of pupils.\n\nI feel in all this that there is need of stressing on the freedom of religious belief and instruction for Indians as well as for citizens who have all the benefits of democratic institutions. I would not for any consideration wish to insinuate that there has been infirmity, but I think there has been a certain amount of inconsistency at times in accepting or refusing pupils for certain schools.\n\nI have not yet met Mr. Schmidt - I imagine that he may have been busy with the problem of water at Cardston - but would be glad of the opportunity of seeing him when he goes to St. Paul.\n\nMay I offer my most cordial greetings to you, Mr. Hoey, and assure you of our confidence.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN. [Signature]\nOttawa, February 4, 1941.\n\nDear Father Routhier:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you discuss again the eligibility of Allan Hunter for enrolment at the Blue Quills School.\n\nYou may be interested to learn that I have this morning discussed the subject matter of your letter very fully with the Reverend Father Plourde. This is a matter which, in my judgment, requires a great deal of careful consideration. Father Plourde is anxious to have an opportunity to discuss it with a number of residential school principals and with the members of his Indian Missionary Committee. It is altogether likely that you shall hear from either Father Plourde or from the Department, just as soon as a definite decision has been reached.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFeb. 6, 1941\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI enclose copy of a letter (Feb. 1) addressed to the Minister by the Rt. Rev. J.H. MacDonald, D.D., Archbishop of Edmonton, concerning an Indian boy, Allan Hunter, who, on request of his parents (Protestants) to the Oblate Fathers, in charge of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, has been allowed to attend the said school, but who, apparently on order of the Indian Agent, has been returned from the school.\n\nNote Archbishop MacDonald's remarks - quote:\n\"I feel that it would be better for all concerned if this boy were permitted to attend the school of his parents choice\".\n\nWill you please have the letter referred to the Director of Indian Affairs for consideration of Archbishop MacDonald's representations in this case, and have a draft reply prepared for the Minister's signature.\n\nW.J. Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\nFor draft reply as requested.\nFeb. 1, 1941.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Crerar,\n\nRe Allan Hunter.\n\nI regret to have to write you regarding this matter; but similar cases occur from time to time, causing considerable discontent among those concerned. I knew nothing of this case till a few days ago.\n\nThe parents of Allan Hunter are both Protestant Indians, living in the vicinity of what is called the Blue Quills School, a residential school for Indian children in this province. They asked the Oblate Fathers in charge of this school to accept their boy; but the Fathers refused on the ground that children of Protestant parents were supposed to attend their own school. The parents persisted in their demand, and the boy was finally accepted. They went further, asking to have their boy instructed in the Catholic religion, which after much hesitation, the Fathers in charge finally did. Recently, the Fathers in charge were ordered to return the child to his parents on the ground that he has no right to be in that school.\n\nI regret very much the decision of the Indian Agent, Mr. J.H. Rees, in this case. The rule that Catholic and Protestant children should attend their respective schools, and that the religion of children should be determined by that of their parents, works well, generally speaking; perhaps better than any other rule that could be devised; but there have been occasional exceptions that could have aroused bitterness among the Indians had not the Oblate Fathers settled them on the broad basis of common sense. Not long ago, Father Balter tells me, children of Catholic parents were admitted to the Edmonton Schools; but knowing the circumstances, he decided that more good could be done by ignoring the case altogether. I realize that while wards of the Government, Indians have not the rights of ordinary citizens; but they have certain natural rights as parents which should not be denied them altogether, much as they may be circumscribed for good and sufficient reasons; and in cases like the present, I feel that it would be better for all concerned if this boy were permitted to attend the school of his parents choice.\n\nWith best wishes, I remain,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nsgd) J.H. MacDonald\n\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\nOttawa, February 12, 1941.\n\nRE: Allan Hunter.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter of December 30, 1940, and official reply thereto dated January 3, 1941.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter sent forward by the Minister to the Archbishop of Edmonton. You will note that the Minister is anxious that you should discuss this matter personally with the Archbishop, immediately following your investigation of the case at the Blue Quills School.\n\nIn your discussion with the Principal, you should point out that this case has been considerably complicated by the enrolment of Allan Hunter at the Blue Quills School. It has been the practice in the past for Indian agents and school principals to submit such cases to the Department before enrolment was permitted. It is my hope that you will find it convenient to undertake this investigation and submit your report at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nOttawa, February 19, 1841.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Macdonald:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Excellency's letter of February 1, in which you discuss the eligibility of Allan Hunter for enrolment at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would appear that there is a regulation in force, with respect to the administration and operation of residential schools, whereby the principal of a school is not permitted to enroll a pupil where the religious status of the pupil is in dispute. In such cases the Indian agent and the principal are expected to send forward, for the consideration of the officials, all the facts relating to the case. This particular regulation appears to have been overlooked in the case of Allan Hunter, and this fact explains why the Principal of the Blue Quills School was requested by the Indian agent to return Allan Hunter to his parents.\n\nSection 13 of the Indian Act provides that no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to, or enrolled at, a Protestant school, and that no Protestant child shall be assigned to, or enrolled at, a Roman Catholic school. In practice, it would appear that a Roman Catholic child has been defined as the child of Catholic parents and a non-Catholic child as the child of non-Catholic parents. This definition\n\nMost Reverend J. B. Macdonald, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Edmonton,\n10544 - 113th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nor understanding of what constitutes a Catholic child has on the whole worked out, with rare exceptions, to the satisfaction of all people concerned. In view of this fact, the Department naturally hesitates to depart from this interpretation. The officials are disposed to think that a departure such as the one suggested in the case of Allan Hunter would lead to almost insurmountable difficulties from the standpoint of administration. Indian parents frequently develop a strong dislike of the school principal, and investigation has proved that these dislikes or prejudices are wholly unfounded. However, if the Indian parent had the right to transfer his child from one institution to another when he developed a real or imaginary grievance against the principal, the task of administering our residential schools would become an exceedingly difficult one.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the case of Allan Hunter has been discussed with the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Alberta, Mr. C. F. Schmidt, of Calgary. Mr. Schmidt was instructed by the Department, in a letter dated January 5, 1941, to visit the Blue Quills School and to discuss this case thoroughly with the Principal. In that letter the Inspector was informed that no action would be taken in respect to the case of Allan Hunter until the Inspector himself had visited the school and reported on the matter. I have just learned, however, that Inspector Schmidt has been ill and confined to bed and consequently unable to undertake this task.\n\nThis case has also been discussed by the officials with the Reverend Father Plourde, who visited the Department a few days ago. Father Plourde is fully conscious of the difficulties confronting the officials of the Training Division in reaching a decision on this case. He has expressed a desire to have an opportunity to discuss the case and the principle involved with the members of his Indian Missionary Committee.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that should the representatives of the churches co-operating\nwith the Department in the operation of residential schools reach the conclusion that a different interpretation should be put on Section 10 of the Indian Act from the interpretation put upon it until now, the request would be very sympathetically considered by the Department. I have personally no desire whatever - and in this regard I feel that I can speak for the officials of the Department - to reach a decision other than a decision that will safeguard to the utmost extent possible the religious rights of Indian pupils while at the same time rendering the administration of our schools free from the misunderstanding and friction that is likely to arise from time to time when these somewhat unusual cases come up for consideration.\n\nI appreciate your interest in this case and it is my intention to instruct Inspector Schmidt to discuss the matter with you, personally, immediately following his investigation of the case, which, I trust, he will be able to undertake in the course of a few days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYours sincerely,\nOttawa, February 26, 1941.\n\nMy dear Archbishop MacDonald:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Excellency's letter of February 1, in which you discuss the eligibility of Allan Hunter for enrolment at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIt could appear that there is a regulation in force, with respect to the administration and operation of residential schools, whereby the principal of a school is not permitted to enroll a pupil where the religious status of the pupil is in dispute.

Boorse,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nI am duly in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in regard to the action of Officers of the Department respecting the admission of Indian children. The rule of the Department is as follows;\u2014\"Notwithstanding anything in these regulations contained no Protestant child shall be placed in a Roman Catholic school or in a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices. And no Roman Catholic child shall be placed in a Protestant school or in a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nIt will be seen from a reading of the clause that the regulation is absolutely just and places Roman Catholics and Protestants upon precisely the same footing. The two children to whom reference is made are entered as Methodists on account of the fact that their parents are Methodists. If their parents have joined the Roman Catholic Church, which of course it is quite competent for them to do, then\n\nof\n\nRev. H. Grandin,\nPrincipal Blue Quills Boarding School,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nof course upon evidence of that fact being brought to the Department an order will be made for the admission of the children, or if the parents while remaining Protestants are desirous that their children should be taken into and educated in a Roman Catholic school upon a written statement to that effect signed by the parents there is no objection to their admission. I think you will admit that the course indicated is the correct one and that it will involve no hardship to any denomination.\n\nI have the honor to remain, Sir\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nClifford Sifton.\nOffice of the\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER\nfor Manitoba and the North-West Territories,\nWinnipeg, March 15, 1900.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of four applications for\nthe admission of Be\u00e0la Sinclair, Edward Stamp, Louise Gladu,\nFrancis Whiskey Jack, and to return the same for the purpose of\nbeing made in duplicate. Also to have the medical certificates\nsigned by you \"to the best of your knowledge\", pending the\nregular examination which will be made I trust at the earliest\nopportunity. In the meantime all the applications are granted\nwith the exception of that of Bella Sinclair, whose father is\na Protestant. I beg to refer in this connection to a letter\naddressed to me by the Department dated Feb. 22nd, 1900, bear-\ning upon the letter written to you by the Honorable Supt. Genl.\non the 27th May last, which letter to me decides that in cases\nof children being sent to a school of a different religion from\nthat of the parents, there should be a consent signed by the\nparents (in this case the father) in the presence of the Indian\nAgent, under whose charge is the band to which the Indian\nparents belong, and must be certified by such Agent as having\nbeen understood by the Indian parents and as embodying their\nwishes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. Laird\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Boarding School,\nSaddle Lake.\nCOPY OF A CIRCULAR ISSUED ON THE 31st of OCT. 1890 AND ADDRESSED TO AGENTS, INSPECTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF INDUSTRIAL AND BOARDING SCHOOLS.\n\nNo. 237\n\nOffice of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\nNorth-West Territories,\nRegina, 31st Oct., 1890.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to inform you that representations have been made to the Department to the effect that in some places there has been a failure on the part of Agents and Employees to abstain from discrimination with regard to the treatment of and attitude towards missions and schools of various denominations and Indians belonging to same.\n\nIt is therefore thought well to remind you that this Department insists upon strict neutrality being maintained by its Officers and Employees with regard to religious matters, and will not tolerate any difference of treatment based directly or indirectly upon denominational prejudice.\n\nGreat care must be exercised to avoid anything likely to be construed into an attempt to bring pressure to bear upon parents of one denomination to send their children to a school of another, even should such other be the only available one.\n\nNo children should be received into any Industrial or Boarding School conducted under any Denomination other than that to which the parents of such children belong, without the express consent of the latter, which it would be prudent to have given in writing, and every such admission made under the sanction of the parents, should be reported to me at the time, with full particulars of the case.\n\nShould a claim be made, at any time after admission, to a pupil, by another denomination, the facts must be promptly and fully reported to me.\n\nI would further remind you that Missionaries of all Denominations should have perfect liberty to exercise their ministry among the Indians, whether Denominational or Infidel, and any application to construct Church or Missionary buildings should be transmitted to me, together with a statement as to whether the Indians concerned are agreeable to such application being granted or not.\n\nI have, etc.\n\nSgd. \"HAYTER REDD,\"\nCommissioner.\nCalgary, March 22nd, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your No. 118-1-10 dated January 3rd, last, re admission to the Blue Quills Residential School, of Annie, John and Allan, three children of Norman Hunter, No. 239, James Seenum's Band, Saddle Lake Agency; also your letter, even number, dated the 26th ultimo, with enclosure, re Allan Hunter mentioned above. In reply I beg to say that when at Saddle Lake Agency and Blue Quills School last week, I discussed the matter fully with Rev. L. Balter, the Principal.\n\nAs there have been several letters written regarding these admissions, it might be well to review the matter briefly:\n\nOn December 2nd, 1939, Mrs. Norman Hunter brought three of their children, viz., Annie - aged about 14 years, John - aged about 12 years, and Allan - aged about 11 years, to the Blue Quills School, and asked the Principal to admit them.\n\nNote: (In his letter No. 95, dated November 25, 1940, Agent Gullion gives this date as November, 1939, and states that the \"parents\" brought the children.) The Rev. Principal states that it was on December 2nd, that the mother only came, and that he then took the information required on the application forms, but refused to have the mother sign same, telling her these would have to be signed by the father, as he understood both she and her husband were Protestants. The mother insisted that he accept the children, left them there, and went home.\n\nOn January 15th, 1940, (Note: Agent Gullion in his letter gives the date as December 2nd, 1939; the Principal says it was on January 15th,) Norman Hunter, the father, came to the School, and insisted that the Principal admit the three children, and there and then signed the applications which had been prepared on December 2nd. The Principal says that he forgot to change the date to January 15th. Hunter also signed a statement -- or declaration -- whereby he agreed, that his three children be baptized and become Roman Catholics if they (the children) so desired. Both documents were signed in the presence of, and witnessed by James Cardinal, R.M., and Lloyd Cardinal, members of Saddle Lake Band. Hunter then went home, leaving the children at the School.\n\nOn February 22nd, 1940, the mother came back to visit, and when about to leave, told the Principal she was lonesome and wished to bring the children home. The Principal replied: \"Your children are not enrolled; you are free to bring them with you,\" which she did.\n\nIn April, 1940, Hunter phoned the Principal from Spedden -- a village on the C.N.R. -- wanting to know why his children had been sent home. He was told that his wife had said she wanted to bring them home, and that she had been informed she could do so as they were not enrolled. Hunter then said to the Principal: \"I left my children at your School, and I want them admitted to that School. I am sending them by train to St. Paul, and ask you to meet them there.\" The Principal told Hunter he would not\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\ntake John into the School, as the Doctor had said he had a weak chest. Annie and Allan were sent to St. Paul by train, and met there by the School rig.\n\nAt the School, Annie and Allan followed the same routine and course of studies \u2014 academic and religious \u2014 as the other pupils. Early in May, both children went to the Principal and asked to be baptized Roman Catholics. Having the parents' consent, and that of the father in writing, the Principal baptized them on the 19th day of May, 1940, after which he sent the application for admission forms to the Agent, together with a declaration signed by himself, stating that they had been baptized; also a copy of the statement signed by the father, agreeing and authorizing that this be done, if the children so wished. These were received at the Agency office and held there. When at the Agency in November, last, I visited the School with Agent Gullion, and the Principal enquired of the Agent whether the admissions had been approved by the Department, adding: \"It is some time since you told me you had sent them.\" When at the Agency office the next day, I enquired into this matter, and the applications were found on the file in the filing cabinet. The Agent had no reason to give for not having forwarded them to the Department. He then wrote his letter No. 95, dated November 25th, re Annie Hunter, copy of which I forwarded to the Department with my No. 403-11A.U. of December 24th, 1940; also his No. 85 of the same date, re Allan Hunter.\n\nBoth Annie and Allan went home for the Summer vacation, 1940, and when the School truck passed through the reserve to pick up the pupils and bring them back for the reopening of school for the fall term, they were brought to the roadway by their mother, who saw them get on the truck.\n\nNorman Hunter and his wife, nee Eva Half, are looked upon as Protestants. Rev. Father Balter states that they attend the Roman Catholic services with their family during the holidays: (Ref. his letter, Dec. 18th, 1940, Page 1, last paragraph).\n\nRe the older children having been placed in the Edmonton School at the request of the parents: (Ref. Dept. letter No. 118-1-10 dated January 3rd, 1940). From information I gathered at the agency office, an application for admission form for Howard Hunter, aged 10 years, dated August 15th, 1933, unsigned by the father and bearing the notation, \"Refused to sign,\" was forwarded to the Department by Agent Gullion, under cover of his letter dated October 15th, 1933, which letter also states that the parents refuse to sign. Application for admission form for Annie Hunter, aged 11 years, dated October 1st, 1936, also unsigned and bearing the notation: \"Refused to sign,\" was forwarded to the Department by Agent Gullion under cover of his letter No. 95, dated November 12th, 1940, which letter also states that the parents refuse to sign. The physical examination form in both these cases had been signed by Dr. G.J. Williamson, M.D. How long Howard remained in school I cannot ascertain from Agency records. Annie did not return after the June term of 1939. (Ref. Agent Gullion's letter No. 95 of Nov. 25th, attached to my No. 403-11A.U. of December 24th, 1940). It will be noted that in this letter also, the Agent states that the parents refused to sign the application for admission. I do not find any information at the office to show whether Annie attended school in 1937-38.\nThe instructions issued to Principals to the effect that pupils whose religious eligibility is not certain must not be admitted to a residential school until the Department's decision has been given: Rev. Father Halter says he does not know of these instructions, and that he has always been guided by letters written by Mr. Leyter Reed, and the Hon. David Laird, Commissioners, Dept. of Indian Affairs, and by the Hon. Clifford Sifton, Minister of the Interior. I am enclosing herewith copies of these letters, handed to me by the Principal for the purpose. I informed him that your letter stated the regulations are, that cases such as these should be discussed with the Indian Agent, and submitted to the Department before accepting the children into the School. His comment was: \"These children were brought and left here by the parents.\"\n\nOn my return to Edmonton, I called on His Grace, Archbishop J. H. MacDonald, at his residence. Our interview was short. I gave him a history of the case, as stated above. I understood him to say that he would take the matter up with Ottawa direct.\n\nIf Allan is sent back from Blue Quills School to his home on the reserve, I think that his chances of being given some education will be lost to him, and through no fault of his own. After reading what Agent Gullion has written about the case, I do not think the parents will consider at all the question of sending him to the Edmonton School, having signed the application to admit him to Blue Quills School, where he has been in attendance since April, 1940, and insisting that he be admitted.\n\nAs regards the per capita grant: The Principal says that this does not enter into the matter at all. He has other Treaty Indian children from the reserves, who are eligible as grant-earning pupils, for whom he is not paid, because the Department will not increase the quota of grant-earners for his School.\n\nThe girl, Annie, will not return after the Summer holidays, as she will be sixteen (16) years of age.\n\nThe Principal also states that the Hunters have told him that if John's health continues to improve as it is now doing, they want to place him in Blue Quills School in September, next.\n\nFrom what I can understand of this case, I think it is one which should be decided on the grounds of Natural Law: It does not appear that the Hunter's have any strong dislike for the Edmonton School or anyone there. They desire and ask to have their children educated in the Blue Quills School. As regards the question of Creed: Their remarks and actions must be some proof of what they think and believe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. Pant.

Very careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and I feel that it is advisable for you to again point out to the Principal that the circular letters to which he refers cannot, at the present time, be considered the policy of the Department. You should remind him that whenever there is any doubt regarding the eligibility of a child for admission to a residential school, either on religious or other grounds, such child must not be accepted by a Principal of a residential school until all the facts in the case have been placed before this Department and our decision has been given. I have reviewed the letters to which you refer and I find that when the Hunter children were placed in the Edmonton Residential School the father refused to sign the application forms. It would, therefore, appear that the father has not at any time been favourably disposed to their admission to the Edmonton School.\n\nIt has been decided to approve the admission of three children to the Blue Quills School provided the father makes formal application for their admission, using the usual application form for this purpose. We have received an application\n\nMr. C.F.

Then followed a number of letters dealing with this case of which your office is aware. Witness your letter 407-11A R.C., April 9th 1941, addressed to Acting Agent Booree. The dept's letter was in error in stating that they had not received the application, reference letter No. 118-1-10.

The boy Benny is now in the Alberta Provincial Reformatory, having been sentenced there for stealing in the village of Lac La Biche. Wilbert was living with his grandmother in Lac La Biche but I understand for the last two months has been living on the reserve with his mother likewise the youngest Willie.\n\nWhat is the position of these children?

This school is quarantined for a mild outbreak of chicken pox. Attached my school report, I am experiencing a little difficulty in getting the information accurate from Father Balter, but will have this straightened out in the New Year. There have been 12 runaways (boys) from this school during November, I think this is due to changes of staff at the school. They appear boys to have settled down now. There are still two boys missing, these boys are over age. The School building programme is now closed for the season, the new building being roofed and sides closed in.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter dated the 3rd inst., I beg to inform you that I informed the Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian School of the contents of your letter and that the above pupil would have to be returned to his mother.\n\nThe Principal requested me to ask your authority re retain the above Pupil, son of Mrs. Vera Lindstrom Gladue, in the Blue Quill's Indian as a non-grant earning pupil.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nDecember 23, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant with reference to Wilbert Gladu.\n\nAs pointed out in official letter of the 3rd instant, the Gladu children are not considered wards of this Department and consequently not eligible for admission as grant-earning pupils to any Indian residential school. With regard to the Principal's request to keep the boy, even though grant is not paid, I regret that such procedure cannot be approved. As you are aware, Indian residential schools are operated for the education of Indian children only and if we allowed others to be kept in the school, even though grant is not paid for them, very many difficulties would be encountered within a short time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.P.B.

Special consideration was given to the application for the latter and, while it has been decided to approve her admission, this action is not to be taken as a precedent.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health should be submitted for the following:\n\nNo. 335 Lloyd Makokis\n\" 0346 Delia E. Cardinal\n\" 0347 Albina Cardinal\n\" 0348 Sophie B. Cardinal\n\" 0351 Eva Makokis\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to suggest that when applications for admissions to Indian School are approved for School in this Agency, that the letter of approval should be written direct to the school and a copy of the letter forwarded to me for my files. It would appear that this would save a lot of duplication work, for instance when your letter of authority is received another letter is typed by this office forwarded to the School Principal and a letter and three cent stamp is used. I understand that it will be necessary to write this office if any discussion is to be entered into in regards to certain applications.\n\nRespectfully Suggested\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWP.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform the department that the father of the above two pupils has enlisted, up to the time of writing I have not been advised in what unit. The father No.91 Blue Quill's Band, Alex Doghead, enlisted I understand under the name of Alex Cardinal (also a family name) married an outsider by the name of Mary LaRose last winter, his wife is now staying with her parents at Vilna, Alberta together with her step children. Doghead stated to me that it was his desire that his two children under the circumstances should stay with his wife and go to a public school. I informed him that I was not sure of the position of the allowances of these children and I would refer the case to the department.\n\nFor your information Doghead is of the \"smart-Alex\" type of Indian and did not live on the reserve for the last couple of years.\n\nThe children are supposed to be attending Castle Park School. The children are attending school under the tax payment of their father-in-law Edward LaRose, Vilna, Alberta.\n\nI would ask the department's ruling in the matter.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWP.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the Cardinal children. I am inclined to feel that the only reason the children are residing with their stepmother is in the hope that she will be able to draw separation allowance for them. Taking everything into consideration I believe that it would be in the best interests of these children to return to the Blue Quills School. They were regularly admitted to that school on application forms signed by the father and presumably were only allowed out of the Blue Quills Residential School for summer holidays. They should have been returned upon the expiry of their leave. You should, therefore, make the necessary arrangements to have them returned to the Blue Quills School at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.P.B.

Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 28, 1943.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, you may inform the Principal of the Blue Quills Residential School that the Department approves the discharge of pupils numbered as follows:\n\nNumbers 238; 253; 262; 265; 277;\n278; 292; 312; 0285; 0310;\n0311.\n\nThe admission of Robert Cardinal to the Blue Quills School is also approved.\n\nOn the December quarter return there are shown the names of 89 pupils none of whom were present in the school during that quarter. I presume that, in the majority of cases at least, these pupils were allowed home on holidays and did not return upon the expiry of their leave.

Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 25th last and to the last paragraph in regards to the 29 pupils absent from the Blue Quill's Indian School. For your information I attach hereto a break down of the pupils absent from this Agency and Onion Lake Agency. The break down is self explanatory.\n\nFor your information the return of the pupils was most difficult last fall, what with the various families away harvesting when school opened and then the very early heavy snow fall on Nov. 12th which tied up nearly all traffic, except horses\u2014this also made the contacting of the absent pupils very difficult. However most of the pupils have now returned from this Agency. It is my intention to be more severe in the return of the pupils another fall. This last fall what with the rumors of days schools and the very heavy harvesting which was not completed before winter, it was just one difficult job to get all the children back. Now going the rounds is the rumor that the Americans are buying both Blue Quill's and the Edmonton School. It is very difficult to disperse the unrest that these rumor cause among the illiterate Indians.\n\nI might say that the education of the Indian children in this Agency has been badly neglected. There has been 18 new recruits from this Agency to Blue Quill's School this term. Any comments and suggestion that the department may make will be much appreciated.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\n\nI would ask that this letter also be taken as a further report to my letter File 95-dated Oct. 20th 1942\u2014in reply to Dept's File 110-1-10 dated Aug. 17th 1942.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th Oct. last in regards to the Mary Irene & Evangeline Cardinal children being returned to the Blue Quill's School, for your information the last report I got on these children from their Day School Teacher (White School) out of 64 school days they had attended 51 days. I have again written their teacher and asked for a report up to date, which I will inform the dept. of. I am of the impression that if we use the law to return these children to the Blue Quill's School we are liable to run into real difficulty.\n\nW.P.B.

In view of their regular attendance at the day school it will not be necessary to return these children to the Blue Quills Residential School immediately. However, a final decision should be deferred until the end of June and their attendance at the day school in the meantime should be carefully watched. If it continues in the next few months like it has in the past, the Principal of the Blue Quills School should apply for their discharge when forwarding his June quarter return.

The father did not take this boy to hospital when ordered to do so, but waited four days. This is the subject of an enquiry and a report will be submitted. Four boys again ran away on the 21st March, but have been returned. Two are still out of school from the first runaway of six; brothers of the Clarence Cardinal who had his feet frozen.\n\nI inspected the school March 19th - there had been an outbreak of flu.
