They intend taking up their residence on Beaver Creek, where they have previously located.

Recently a young man in the city and the ministerial curiosity was excited by the appearance of a stranger who seemed to be in great need of assistance. The minister had compassion upon him and gave him a substantial gift. However, his liberality of heart would permit of the children going out of their way to help others. The minister thought they had some good men among them, but unfortunately for him he could not find any who would lend a hand. Finally he hit upon a plan. He went to the preacher and tried to persuade him to give a dinner to the poor. The minister agreed, but it wouldn't work, the preacher replying, \"I've walked a long time for my legs to get stronger.\" The minister then said, \"I want to send myself.\" To a friend he said, \"I'm going to send myself.\"\n\nNEW FALL AND WINTER MILLINERY.\n\nLADIES DOLMANS AND CLOAKS,\n\nFur Caps and Muffs,\nWool Goods.\n\nLadies and Children General Furnishings.\n\nMISS MACK & CO.,\nCAMPBELL'S BLOCK.\n\nG.
