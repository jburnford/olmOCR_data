MAVETY\nPRINCE ALBERT N.W.T.\nPRINCE ALBERT\u2014The paper is in advance.\nFRIDAY, MARCH 4, 1887.\nTHE LIBERAL PARTY AND THE NORTHWEST.\nIt is said of Sandfield Macdonald, that on receiving an invitation to visit the Northwest he answered by replying to Mr. Blake, \"I have nothing to do with Strathcona; what has Strathcona to do with me?\" So now, that the Liberal party has been invited to visit the Northwest, are we justified in asking, \"What has the Liberal party done for the Northwest?\" Why should we invite Mr. Blake in? Why should we invite Sir John Macdonald? What claims has Mr. Blake upon us? Why should Mr. Blake keep faith with the British Colonists? Mr. Blake, whose \"sole policy\" would not have been completed during this century, who made the Northwest a \"sterile waste,\" and endeavored to shirk that nobody could vote for the country by inviting Macdonald and Macdonald, and Blake, for proof of which refer those who may question it to the pages of the Hansard of October 15th and 16th, especially page 1634. For two days thereafter, Mr. Blake endeavored to prove that the Northwest was only fit for Indians to live in. It is true, Mr. Blake has been endeavoring to change a charge, but only since he made a trip to the Rockies over a railway built by the Liberals, and through Liberal party, and through a country they had characterized as a \"sterile waste.\" Mr. Blake has changed his mind with regard to this country, but it is possible that he has not yet seen its merits of settlement. But it should be remembered that the pioneers and late settlers of this country owe Mr. Blake nothing. He has never been here himself, and he has not been west of Ontario, and he has not the confidence of any of that Province. On the other hand, Sir John Macdonald, Sir Charles Tupper, Sir Hector Langevin, Sir Adolph Gordon, Hon. Thomas White, Hon. John Scott, Hon. John Costigan, Hon. Mr. Foster, and other members of the present Government have been here, and visited the British Colonists, and are not only conversant with the wants of the Northwest, but are determined to see that these wants are heard by the North- west despite the opposition of Mr. Blake. No man is more desirous of the good of the Northwest than the Territorial Lord, Sir John Macdonald. No man has brought his natural schemes to greater fruition than he. If Sir Macdonald is not to be said of Saskatchewan, let it not be said of you that you chose another to follow your vote in support of Mr. Blake, that statesman whose life has been devoted to the service of his country, whose name is linked with the greatest national work of any age, and will shine a lasting name our history for all time to come.\n\nVote for Sir John, the friend of the Northwest.\n\nA WORD TO THE MEN.\nWe wish to assure you that the time is approaching when we will all have to decide whether we shall be represented in the House of Commons, to give our reasons why we think our votes should go to the Man who should vote for Mr. Macdonald in preference to Mr. Laird. As they well know, Mr. Laird has been a resident of this district nor does he propose to reside here. He simply proposes, if elected, to visit the district occasionally. He has not one cent invested in the country. He has not been in the country for five years. He is a Canadian, but he lives in a part of Canada nearly as far east of Ottawa as we are west of that point. He was Minister of the Interior for three years, but neglected the interests of the Northwest. We believe that the Hon. David Milne, did likewise. As Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest, Mr. Laird has visited this city, but he has not paid. Any gentleman of average ability could fill his position with credit. Mr. Laird, however, thinks that he can. More than this, he comes here on the invitation of the party opposite. Sir John Macdonald, the Premier of Canada. He comes here on the invitation of the party who, as Archibald Taylor says, in connection, mention of death and banishment of the Metis chiefs, and for the failure of the Government to pay them, has been offered before and which we have refused. The men who could do these things are the ones who should be here, and to which Mr. Laird belongs. He comes here on the invitation of the party opposite. Sir John Macdonald, the Premier of Canada.

The men who could do these things are the ones who should be here, and to which Mr. Laird belongs.\n\nM. N. W. in connection with this point are many. By coming here the Company will not only secure the business of the district, but will be able to open up the trails of Battleford and Edmonton during the summer season by placing their goods there. They will also be able to procure Edmonton coal at a much cheaper rate than the present rate. The coal is of good quality, if not better, quality. In fact the advantages to be gained by the Company are making themselves felt in every quarter, and so great that we think the railway cannot be built too rapidly.\n\nVote for Mr. Macdonald and a real friend of the Northwest.\n\nT.

H. Macdonald.\nELECTION NOTES.\n\nA meeting of Mr. Macdonald\u2019s Central Committee will take place tomorrow night at Sir John Macdonald\u2019s residence. The standard joke of the campaign is to get two groups together and ask them to define their Liberal principles. It rarely leads to a split in the party.\n\nVote for a member of Saskatchewan, and F. E. Land Seabrook.\n\nThe Detroit Evening News says: \u201cThe article in the Standard of Toronto, to which Sir John Macdonald ought to be attached, has become inflammatory, and will endanger his popularity. He has been accused of seeking to force down the pay of workingmen, and his concessions have been interpreted as leading to a decline in public services. Mr. and Mrs. Peter Burrows, therefore, urge Macdonald not to yield further concessions to the Labour policy.\u201d\n\nMME POLE MOFFAT ADDRESSES THE CROWD.\n\nMrs. Pole Moffat addressed the crowd at the railway station yesterday afternoon, and praised Mr. Lafontaine\u2019s speech. She said: \u201cWe are all united against Mr. Lafontaine\u2019s attacks on domestic duties.\u201d Mrs. Moffat also spoke in favour of the Liberal party, and ended her address by saying: \u201cMr. Lafontaine\u2019s remarks were offensive to women, and we shall unite to oppose him.\u201d\n\nGO TO CANN\u2019S BOOK STORE FOR Stationery, School Books, etc.\n\nELECTION NOTICE.\n\nElectoral District Affairs of Saskatchewan.\n\nInformations pour les \u00c9lections.\n\nMay be had without delay through the members of the electoral division affecting the district that a poll has been granted for the election of persons to represent the constituency of Southland.\n\nTuesday, the 15th day of March, at noon.\n\nThere will be a special session for the purposes of the party at the Union Hotel, Fort William, which will be held at 3 o\u2019clock.\n\nHon.
