These will be forwarded, addressed to the Principal, and the account, in triplicate, will be sent to you. On receipt of the extinguishers, if in good condition, you should certify the account in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $25.00 in the purchase of the plank flooring required for the repairs in the horse stable. It is noted that you instructed the Principal to have the timing gears of the Lister lighting plant repaired. Please forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the plank flooring and the repairs to the lighting plant.\n\nIf possible, all these accounts should reach the Department before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year, viz.: March 31st, next.\n\nWith reference to the request that a large pump be supplied, to be used in emptying the septic tank, I would ask that you inform the Department concerning the\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\ntype of pump recommended by the Principal and yourself and also the approximate cost. I would request, further, that you submit an estimate of the cost of erecting a small ware-house, with cement floor, to be used for the storing of flour. Our funds are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to authorize the supplying of the pump or the erection of the ware-house until the Department is advised definitely concerning the cost involved. When this information is received, consideration will be given as to whether funds can be provided.\n\nRegarding any refills that may be required for the fire extinguishers, I would request that you arrange for the purchase, locally, of the chemicals necessary, if the refills are required at the present time. If you make the purchase, you should see that the Principal has the extinguishers overhauled and the refills installed and that all extinguishers on hand at the school are in good condition, ready for immediate use.\n\nI am not aware as to the circular referred to by you regarding refills for fire extinguishers. The latest circular with reference to fire equipment and the prevention of fire hazard was addressed to Principals of schools, in February, 1932. A copy is enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Purpose of Report.\n\nInstructions were received from the Director, dated May 31, 1934, stating that the water supply system at the above named school is nearly shut off by quick sand and requesting that the matter be investigated. The writer made an inspection on June 16.\n\n2. Requirements of the School\n\nThe number of inhabitants of the building consist of 110 pupils and 30 on the staff with families, a total of 140. There are also 20 horses, 110 head of cattle and 15 or 20 pigs. The total water for the people and stock has to come from this well as there are no lakes or suitable sloughs near. This occurs especially in winter, when the greatest danger exists. The total requirements, as a general average, amount to 6000 or 7000 gallons.\n\n3. History of Water Supply\n\nThe original well (No.1) was excavated by hand to a depth of 40 feet and is cribbed with concrete pipe 3' diameter and 3' long. This well was excavated about 1910, when the original frame school was constructed on the same site now occupied by the new...\nschool (1930). It was apparently fed by practically surface water and now contains 2 feet of water and is entirely unused. The surface supply dried up as is the case with many Western wells.\n\nWell No.2 was drilled in 1930. It is a 6\" hole 5-5/8\" casing 3\" pipe, with a 3\" cylinder. It is equipped with a Beatty pump. This pump has a tested capacity of 400 gal. per min. It really consists of parts of two pumps which were on hand as the school Engineer claims that the pumps did not \"stand up.\"\n\nThe school Engineer states that rain water and leakage enters the pit rendering efficient work by the motor difficult. This pit cannot be heated. The pump was placed in a 10' pit so it would not freeze. However, it cannot be kept dry or warm.\n\nPrevious experience would tend to show that wells and pumps should be constructed contiguous to the buildings (but not in them) so that the basement containing them can be heated by direct connections.\n\n4. Detailed History and Behaviour of Well No.2.\n\nThis well was drilled in 1930. Mr. Dempsey, the driller, working for McPherson & Thom of Regina, who is not now available for interviewing, drilled to 92 ft., found hard water, pumping 240 gal. per hr. This was not enough, besides being hard, so he drilled to 145 feet and found 420 gal. per hour. When he used the baler everything was all right, but when a pump with a\ncapacity of 600 gal. per hr. was used the well \"plugged\" with sand and \"mud\". Dempsey thought that if a smaller pump had been used, allowing the water to enter the casing more slowly, it might have been better as the mud would not have been drawn in by the pressure. However, this is only supposition. Dempsey then quit. The well \"plugged\" shortly afterwards so he tried again. He could not do anything so he drilled to 204 feet and then to 225 feet. He found it dry at 225 feet. He then pulled the casing to the 90-foot vein and filled the hole from 225 ft. to 90 ft. with gravel.\n\nA 7 foot screen was placed at 142 feet but plugged so it was never replaced. It at present is stored in its original box in the implement shed. This was examined by the writer and it was found that the slits were enlarged by a hacksaw in an attempt to prevent plugging.\n\nThe casing now stands at the 91 foot vein, consequently the water at present obtained is possibly a mixture of the 142 ft. and 90 ft. water.\n\nThe 142 ft. water analysed 22 grains of hardness per gallon of water, making it good for general use.\n\nWhile the writer was present the engineer pumped about 400 gallons in 3\u00bd hours. This about 100 gallons per hour, corroborating his statements.\nBehaviour\n\nThe well was not fully plugged on June 16 at the time of visit, although it produced only 100 gal. instead of 400 which is the least that the school should have, at present the water is shut off the toilets etc., in order to conserve water. A sample of the mixture of fine sand and silt, collected from the fixtures upstairs is being sent to you under separate cover.\n\nThe well pumped some mud near the beginning of its life. It was hardly ever clear for the first year. Then it cleared up in 1931. Then every six months or so it pumped a little mud. However, the supply was always more or less sufficient until May 1 when it went down to 100 gal. per hour. This lasted 3 or 4 days, pumping mud, then it cleared for a week and then pumped mud for 3 weeks. It has been opened up for 3 weeks now, without pumping mud. The school Engineer stated that the general yield at present is 250 to 300 gals. per hour. There has been no mud lately and the well is at present behaving fairly well.\n\nIt might be noted that at the time this well was drilled pumping was continued for 96 hours. It cleared up. No blame whatever can be attached to any one, including the representative engineer from this office (not the writer) for misbehaviour of the well. The mud is in the water and no engineer or driller can foretell what will happen or what is the nature of the material or the conditions appertaining at that depth. An examination of the sample will indicate the difficulty of excluding it by screen or\nby any other method. It will also be noted by an examination of the log of the well, which is enclosed, that dynamite was used in an endeavour to enlarge the basin. It is the considered opinion of the writer, judged from previous experience, that trial and error must be used under these conditions.\n\nThe tank has been cleaned several times since 1930. It was found to contain a coating of \"mud\" 1/4\" thick or so. No doubt the whole system throughout the building is coated as evidenced by the sample. One confesses that the alternate plugging and clearing of the well is a matter difficult to explain. If the mud appears, why does it not permanently plug the well? The gravel inserted from 225 ft. to 90 ft. may have some effect.\n\n5. Recommendations.\n\nAt the immediate present the school can carry on with some difficulty and with a depleted supply, but if and when the well fails a serious condition obtains. This would be really serious in winter when the stock have to depend entirely on the well. The following data might be considered rather as opinions than as recommendations at the present stage.\n\nIn the case of Blue Quills Indian School several hundred dollars was spent in trying to rehabilitate the old well. It was at last improved about the time it was decided to abandon the attempt. This well now works well, at least semi-permanently.\n\nTwo possible methods are available in the\npresent case, as follows:\n\n(a) Clean Well No.2.\n\nIf this be done the school would be without a source of supply while the experiment was being tried. This would be a serious condition as no other supply is available, although the tank could be filled. This contains only 1000 or 1200 gallons, portion of one day's requirements. This method could be tried however at a cost of $150 or more, depending on the distance a driller had to take his outfit.\n\nInquiries were made regarding available drilling outfits. Mr. S. Dempsey who drilled the well is at present running his own outfit. His home was, and probably still is, at Indian Head. A well-driller named Planchot (given name unknown) who lives at Punnichy, has a boring machine, and could probably obtain a drilling machine, if necessary. No other well-drillers could be found in this area.\n\n(b) A new well No.3.\n\nThis should be constructed in the alcove contiguous to the power house and near the air compressor on the outside of the power house. This new well could be\nentirely drilled as a 6\" hole to the 142 foot vein or it could be bored and concrete-lined to, say 60 or 70 feet, to act as a reservoir and then drilled to the 142 foot vein. The bored portion would also act as a stilling basin to minimize the \"pull\" of the pump and prevent stirring up of the sand. The capacity of a 3 foot bored hole would be 70 ft. less 30 feet (the depth of water table) or about 1700 gallons.\n\nIt appears to the writer that, judging by the behaviour of the present well, that two wells are needed, providing a proposed additional well behaves as the present one. They could then be used alternately. As yet this can only be considered as a suggestion as one is diffident about advising the construction of another well under the circumstances. It might be added however that in the opinion of the writer, an additional well will be the only permanent solution of the difficulty. Estimates for a new well are as follows:-\nBoring 70 feet @ $2.50 $175.00\nDrilling 80 feet @ $2.00 160.00\nConcrete pipe for bored well 70'@ $1.00 70.00\nCasing 80 feet @ $1.50 120.00\nPipe 90 feet @ $0.75 72.00\nRods 90 feet @ $0.40 36.00\nCylinder 28.00\nDrive shoe and drive head 30.00\nPump (deep well) 200.00\nBasement 300.00\n\nTotal 1191.00\n\nAdd 15% Contingencies. 178.65\n\nGrand Total 1369.65\n\n6. Conclusion.\n\nAs before mentioned, no blame should be attached to any one for partial failure of the well. The inspector tested the well to as great an extent as was practical and found the well to be a good producer. This matter of combatting inflow of silt and sand is difficult to overcome and cannot be foretold.\n\nAs in the case of the Blue Quills School, the Indian Department may have had previous experience in this type of well and may have suggestions as a result.\n\nP.A.

In reply a letter has been received from Mr. Hoover dated the 4th instant in which he states that there has been some delay in locating a reliable well driller. He has, however, been in communication with the Canadian Well Supply Co., Ltd., of Regina, and has received a letter from that Company dated the 2nd instant, copy of which is attached. It is stated that this firm is recommended by Mr. Miles, the Divisional Engineer of the C.P.R., at Moose Jaw, who has had considerable experience with well drillers in western Canada and we expect in the course of a day or two to obtain from this Company a price for cleaning out the well, which will be communicated to you as soon as received.\n\nI might point out that if it is necessary to obtain a well driller from Regina it is not likely that the cost can be kept down to $150, as stated in your letter of July 28th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Hoover.\n\nPrepaid.\nCOPY.\n\nRegina, August 4, 1934.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nFurther to my letter of August 2 regarding the well at the Indian School at Lestock, I drove over there yesterday, to get all the information possible on this well.\n\nI find that the 92 ft. water supply comes from a very shallow layer of sand and gravel, being only one foot in thickness, and then again at the 142 ft. level there is only 3 ft. of sand and gravel.\n\nAbout the first paragraph in your letter said that you were asking to have this well cleaned out not a new well put in. I believe it is impossible to do anything with the present well and every dollar spent on it, is just that much wasted.\n\nI will try to explain how I have come to this conclusion. In the first place both of these water bearing stratas are very shallow and would be, more or less, stirred up with mud, before the driller would realize he was in sand. Then the lower level at 142 ft. was pumped at 600 gallons per hour. It was more than the capacity of the well. This drew in a certain amount of sand and mud and allowed the overhanging layers of clay to mix with the sand part. The same thing applied at the 92 ft. level when the casing was pulled back to that point. I believe that the sand is practically all pumped away for a small area around the bottom of the casing and then every little\nwhile some more clay from above drops down shutting off the water. This is what happened when the supply drops down to 100 gallons per hour. Then it gradually increases when this clay is washed away by the action of the water. Another thing that helps so spoil both these water layers is the fact that drilling was completed down to 225 feet. It is very seldom a good well is left after driving the casing down any great depth below the water supply as the couplings in the pipe both coming down and going back help to stir up the sand and mud together. Another thing should any work be started on the present well you would be entirely without a water supply while the work was under way and it is just possible after the bottom of this well was stirred up at all the water might be shut off completely.\n\nWhen at Leestock yesterday, I looked up your agent there, Mr. Waddy, and explained very carefully to him why it was impossible to get any satisfaction from this well. I told him the only thing that could be done was a new well and I suggested two ways of finishing this -- either to use the 142 ft. water by itself, or to use a screen part way up the casing, and use both supplies, that is, at 92 ft. and 142 ft. He said they would much rather only use the water from the 142 ft level, as it is much better than what was secured higher up.\n\nWhat I recommended to him yesterday was an 8 inch well, down to 142 ft. explaining that the 8 inch screen in the shallow layer of gravel and sand would give a much greater area for the inlet of the water than it would be possible with a smaller screen.\n\nI am quite satisfied that what Mr. Dempsey said\nwas correct, that the well was plugged originally by being pumped too fast. The bailer test at this depth was apparently around 400 gallons per hour. And I am quite satisfied that with careful pumping this might have been increased, through time, but the fact that it was pumped at 600 gallons per hour, completely ruined it.\n\nEven though you did not ask for a new well, I am taking the liberty to submit the following quotation for an 8 inch well as discussed with Mr. Waddy.\n\n$6.50 per foot. This included casing, drilling and transportation, plus well screen at $100.00\n\nThis price may look high to you on the drilling end but transportation is a large item considering the amount of footage there will be in this well.\n\nAnother thing, an institution of the size you have at Lestock should never be left with only one water supply, as no one knows when the pumping equipment may be broken down. As long as the present well is left as it is, you would always have that to fall back on as a temporary supply, should anything go wrong with the equipment in the main well.\n\nShould you decide that the 8 inch well is too big, and ask for an 6 inch instead, there would be a saving of approximately $150.00. I don't believe this small saving would warrant putting in the smaller well.\n\nI have tried to cover this subject as fully as possible, but if anything has been overlooked, let me know and I will try and explain. I appreciate very much your offer of this work.\n\nThanking you, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\nCanadian Well Supply Company\nD.E. Marshall (sgd.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thanking you for giving us an opportunity to check up on this work, we are\n\nYours truly,\n\nCANADIAN WELL SUPPLY CO.LTD.\n\nPer D. Marshall.\nSir,\n\nIn response to my recent enquiry from several sources for a reliable well-driller in the vicinity of Regina, the name of your firm has been received.\n\nThe problem I have on hand at the present time is not the drilling of a new well but the cleaning out of a well supplying water to the Muscowequan Indian Residential School near Leestock, Sask., about 85 or 90 miles northeast of Regina.\n\nSome of the history and behaviour of this well known as No.2 at the above school is as follows:\n\nThe well was drilled in 1930 by Mr. S. Dempsey, working for McPherson & Thom. Drilling proceeded to 92 ft. where hard water was found pumping 240 gallons per hour. This was not sufficient, so drilling proceeded to 145 ft. where 420 gallons per hour of softer water was found. When the bales was used everything appeared O.K. but when a pump with capacity of 600 gals. per hour was used the well plugged with mud and sand. Mr. Dempsey thought if a smaller pump with had been used allowing the water to enter the casing more slowly, it might have been better as the mud would not have been drawn in by the pressure. However, this is supposition. Dempsey then quit. The well \"plugged\" Shortly afterwards, so he tried again. He would not help matters so he drilled to 204 ft. and later to 225 ft. he found it dry at 225 ft. He then pulled the casing to the 90 foot vein and filled the hole from 225 feet to 90 feet with gravel.\n\nA 7 foot screen was placed at 142 feet but plugged so it was never replaced. It at present is stored in its original box in the implement shed at the school, and on recent examination found that the slits were enlarged by a hacksaw in an attempt to stop plugging.\n\nThe casing now stands at the 91 foot vein consequently the water at present obtained is possibly a mixture of the 142 foot and 90 foot water.\n\nWhile our engineer was present on June 16 about 400 gals. was pumped in 3\u00bd hrs., or about 100 gals. per hour showing that the well was by no means completely plugged, and yet badly short of 400 gals. as desired.\n\nThe well pumped some mud near the beginning of its life. It was hardly ever clear for the first Canadian Well Supply Co., Regina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nyear. Then it cleared up in 1931. Then every six months or so it pumped a little mud. However the supply was always more or less sufficient until May 1, 1934, when it went down to 100 gallons per hour. This lasted three or four days pumping mud, then it cleared for a week and then pumped mud for three weeks. Specifically the well will apparently supply from 250 to 300 gals. per hr. and the Department is desirous to have this well cleaned out in an attempt to recover the original supply.\n\nIt is also desired to have this work done before the present holidays are over so that if possible the water supply may be normal by that time.\n\nI have enumerated the above history to save unnecessary delay and I would be pleased if you could submit a price on cleaning out this well and also inform me of how soon the work could be started. I require to submit your quotation to Ottawa, but if accepted very little delay is anticipated.\n\nThe well comprises a 6\" hole 5\" casing, 3\" pipe with a 3\" cylinder. It is equipped with a Beatty pump. This pump has a tested capacity of 400 gallons per hour.\n\nI will therefore be pleased to hear from you with your quotation as above requested as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO.H. Hoover,\nEngineer in Charge.\nAugust 10, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 8th instant regarding cleaning out of the existing well at the Muscosekan Indian Residential School I enclose herewith copies of some further correspondence between Mr. Hoover and the Canadian Well Supply Company of Regina. These copies are as follows:\n\nJuly 31st letter from Mr. Hoover to Canadian Well Supply Co.\nAug. 2nd \"   \"Canadian Well Supply Co. to Mr. Hoover.\nAug. 4th \"    \" Aug. 6th night letter from Mr. Hoover to Canadian Well Supply Co.\n\nYou will note the suggestion of this Company, which is apparently reliable and has had considerable experience in well drilling, is to the effect that money spent in cleaning out the existing well would be money wasted and that the only solution is to drill a new well as suggested in Mr. Fetterley's report of June 29, 1934. A price has been requested from this Company for cleaning the old well, notwithstanding the report and Mr. Hoover will forward the same as soon as it is received.\n\nMr. Hoover states that a price is also being requested from McPherson and Thom, who drilled the existing well in 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

This price quoted covers six days work on your well. If it is seen at that time that the well is being improved and it would be advisable to continue our price would be $20.00 per day for any further work done.\n\nIn our previous letter I explained that there was very little hope of making a satisfactory job and if any improvement was noticed it would only be temporary. We will not be held responsible for the results obtained, or any damages should this well quit entirely on account of the work being done, as it is a dangerous proposition to start stirring up the bottoms of a well in the condition this one is in. We are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADIAN WELL SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nper D.E. Marshall (sgd).\nAugust 13, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 8th instant regarding cleaning out of the existing well at the Miscowequan Indian Residential School I am advised by Mr. Hoover that he has received the following telegram from the Canadian Well Supply Company dated the 7th instant:\n\n\"In reply your wire we will quote price of two hundred and fifty dollars to clean old well this includes transportation and all expenses for six days work on well.\"\n\nA letter of the same date has also been received from the Canadian Well Supply Company Limited, copy of which is attached.\n\nMr. Fetterly is expected to be in Regina at this time and will visit the Company as well as MacPherson and Thom who drilled the well now proposed to be cleaned out and possible others for the purpose of obtaining any additional information that may be available. In the meantime if it should be decided to carry out the cleaning operations Mr. Hoover recommends that the offer of the Canadian Well Supply Company Limited, as stated in the telegram and letter above mentioned, be accepted.\n\nIn view, however, of the warning which we have received from this Company and our experience in connection with similar wells it would appear desirable to reconsider the situation and decide whether it would not be better to leave the well as it is and drill a new well as soon as money can be obtained for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

The Dominion Water Power Branch was asked to have their District Engineer examine the well and report as to whether it would be possible to clean it out or if necessary to drill a new well.\n\nInformation has been received from the Dominion Water Power Branch that it would cost $250.00 to clean out the old well, but that the two firms whom they asked to figure strongly advised against this procedure as they feared that the well would be completely ruined if disturbed. It therefore appears that a new well is necessary, and the cost of same will probably be in the neighborhood of $1,000.00.\n\nIt is rather difficult to make an estimate as to the depth to which they would have to drill as not known.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch Engineers obtained estimates from the Canadian Well Supply Company Ltd. of Regina and McPherson and Thom of Saskatoon.\n\nThere are no funds provided in this year's estimates for this work. The only funds that could be found at present would be to utilize some of the money provided under the Public Works Construction Act. There are two day schools, estimated at $5,000 each; - one of these schools could be left over for the present and the money used to meet emergencies such as now exists in the water supply system at the Muscowequan School.\n\nIf the work is to be proceeded with I would ask you to please advise me if the Canadian Well Supply Co. of Regina may be employed for the work.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoover,\n\nRe Muscowequan Indian School\nLestock, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWe have received your letter of August 2nd and we are pleased to advise that we could arrange to have one of our outfits shipped in immediately from Regina to that point, and send an experienced operator to clean out the well. As referred to in your letter, we might state that Mr. Dempsey at the present time is living thirty or forty miles north of Nipawin, somewhere in the bush country.\n\nAs it is necessary for us to send one of the outfits up, we would naturally expect you to pay the freight on the outfit to and from Regina to Lestock, and arrange to have it hauled out to the well. We would charge at the rate of $15.00 per day while working on the well, and we do not expect that it would take over two or three days to clean it out, unless something happens to be dropped into the well, or some unforeseen trouble comes up.\n\nThe operator whom we would send out has had years of experience and there would be no trouble whatever from that particular point.\n\nWe hope therefore to receive shipping instructions from you in the course of the next ten days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcPherson & Thom.\nAugust 7, 1934.\n\nRe Muscowequan Indian School near Lestock, Sask.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant and will state that I would prefer to obtain an overall price for cleaning out the above well. We have only a certain amount of money available for this work and if it would be as satisfactory to you I would be glad to have a price for the completed work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) O.H.

Hoover,\n\nRe Muscowequan Indian School,\nnear Lestock, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWe have received your letter of the 7th instant, in which you ask that we give you a price for this work.\n\nFrom the information which we have on this well, we believe that we can perhaps save you some money as we feel that it may not be necessary to ship one of our outfits up from Regina. In case that we do not find it necessary to use the machine, we would make charge of $125.00 it being understood of course that you would arrange to take the men to and from the depot in case that we do not use the car.\n\nThen, of course, we would naturally expect that the board and lodging of the men would be cared for by you while they are on the job.\n\nWhile there is a slight possibility of us not being able to put this job in a satisfactory condition without the machine, it would then be necessary to ship the outfit from Regina to Lestock, and the extra expense of the shipping that is, the freight to and from Regina would be extra.\n\nThese machines are loaded on flat cars and shipped out under an L.O.L. figuring on approximately eight thousand pounds. While we make mention of the extra expenses which might be incurred by having the outfits shipped up, we are reasonably sure that it will not be necessary to take this machine up, as we will send bailers, cables, and the necessary tools to be used on the job without the machine in fact we cleaned out two deep wells during the past two weeks this way.\n\nWe will be in a position to start this work immediately, and we hope to hear from you by return mail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMcPherson & Thom\nper D.C. Thom.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the cleaning of the well at Muscopegan Indian school, I enclose herewith copies of letters from McPherson & Thom of Regina to Mr. Hoover dated August 6 and 10 respectively and one from Mr. Hoover to McPherson & Thom dated August 7.\n\nMr. Hoover considers the offer of the Canadian Well Supply Co.

Fetterly, B.Sc., R.P.E.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\nA preliminary Report, dated June 22, 1934, was prepared by the writer on this subject, containing descriptions, estimates, and accompanied by plans. It ended with alternative recommendations (1) cleaning the old well, (2) constructing a new well. The latter method was mentioned as the most permanently satisfactory method.\n\n2. Correspondence and Interviews.\nSince that time a considerable amount of correspondence has occurred among the Director, the Calgary Hydrometric Bureau and with McPherson & Thom and the Canadian Well Supply, both of Regina, regarding cleaning the old well and drilling of a new one. In addition, the writer personally interviewed the two Regina firms on August 13th regarding both proposals.\n\nIn addition to the above, a letter has arrived today, dated August 17th, from the Director, stating that \"in view of the adverse reports with respect to attempting to clean the existing well, means will probably be found (by the Indian Department) to\nappropriate sufficient money to drill a new well ....... Further action awaits the decision of the Superintendent General.\n\n3. Results of Interviews.\n\n(a) McPherson & Thom, of Regina\n\nCleaning old well.\n\nIf a rig is not needed the price is $125 and we board men.\n\nThey quoted to the writer a flat price of $150 with all expenses such as board, transportation, gas, etc., paid by them plus freight both ways, Regina to Saskatoon, if machine is found to be needed, plus cartage to the school; $150 for job + freight + $25 cartage = $279.00.

Can anything be done before unpleasant consequences fall upon personal here?\n\nA prompt attention, please.\n\nYours truly,\nRev. Geo. Leamotte, A.M.\nPrincipal\nAugust 15, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Honourable, the Superintendent General,\n\nThey are experiencing considerable difficulty with the water supply system at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School near Lestock, Sask., due to shortage of water in the well. The Dominion Water Power Branch was asked to have their District Engineer examine the well and report as to whether it would be possible to clean it out or if necessary to drill a new well.\n\nInformation has been received from the Dominion Water Power Branch that it would cost $250.00 to clean out the old well, but that the two firms whom they asked to figure strongly advised against this procedure as they feared that the well would be completely ruined if disturbed. It therefore appears that a new well is necessary, and the cost of same will probably be in the neighborhood of $1,000.00.\n\nIt is rather difficult to make an estimate as the depth to which they would have to drill is not known.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch Engineers obtained estimates from the Canadian Well Supply Company Ltd. of Regina and McPherson and Thom of Saskatoon.\n\nThere are no funds provided in this year's estimates for this work. The only funds that could be found at present would be to utilize some of the money provided under the Public Works Construction Act. There are two day schools, estimated at $3,000. each, - one of these schools could be left over for the present and the money used to meet emergencies such as now exists in the water supply system at the Muscowequan School.\n\nIf the work is to be proceeded with I would ask you to please advise me if the Canadian Well Supply Co. of Regina may be employed for the work.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSept. 12, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th ultimo, with further reference to the water supply system at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the department has decided to have a new well sunk for this school. I would ask you, therefore, to instruct your Calgary office to proceed immediately with the sinking of the new well. The Canadian Well Supply Company of Regina are to be employed for this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSept. 12, 1934.\n\nRev. and Dear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the water supply system at your school, I beg to say that the Dominion Water Power Branch have today been authorized to proceed with the drilling of a new well.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

The materials for the well consist of casing, pipe rods working head cylinder etc., in fact everything necessary for proper functioning of the water supply including all necessary electrical and pipe connections. The well is to be plumb and properly drilled and is to supply from 6000 to 7000 gallons per day of 4 hours.\nCONCRETE\n\nIn addition, a reinforced concrete pit is to be properly and firmly attached to the existing brick work and stone work.\n\nThe footing is to be firmly constructed one foot wider all around than the walls. The walls and roof are to be water tight, being covered with an asphalting material.\n\nThe concrete shall consist of clean screened gravel, clean sand, with the addition of good Portland cement in the proportion of 5 of gravel, 3 of sand and 1 of cement for bottom and sides, and 4 of gravel, 2 of sand and 1 of cement for the roof. It shall be properly mixed before pouring in shallow layers and then well tamped and smoothed.\n\nReinforcement will be lapped and wired especially at corners. The ends should be bent. Care should be taken that correct lengths of reinforcing be obtained to prevent waste in cutting.\n\nA hole with proper ridge and cover 20\" square shall be left in the roof immediately above the well for possible future cleaning.\n\nConnections shall be made with the existing system.\n\nA properly sized door is to be cut into the powerhouse for ingress into new basement.\n\nC.A. Guttery\nAest. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nCanadian Well Supply Co., Limited,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nPer D.E. Marshall (sgd).\nSec.Treas.\n\nCALGARY, Alta., September 17, 1934.\nRe Muscowequan Indian School\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, dated 14th instant, regarding improvement of the well supply at the above named school, I wish to inform you that Mr. E. A. Setterly of this staff proceeded to Regina on 13th instant to prepare a contract with Canadian Well Supply Company, of which Mr. Marshall is Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nSpecifications were also prepared and signed.\n\nIt has since been ascertained that the working head may have to be changed to suit a D.C. Single phase circuit but Mr. Marshall was prepared for this possible change at the conference. The price may be therefore slightly changed. The Fairbanks-Morse people will obtain prices.\n\nThe prices are in accordance with the original offer, of which there were two, viz:\n\n(1) $6.50 per foot including drilling casing and drive shoe only.\n\n(2) $4.00 per foot for drilling and indicated prices for material.\n\nAs Mr. Marshall figured one price from the other, there is no difference in the offers.\n\nAs indicated in the contract, Mr. Marshall's drilling employees will construct the basement, this being a simple operation and they being quite capable of doing this kind of work, having done it before.\n\nMr. Marshall stated that an attempted cleaning\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nout of the old well would be a simple operation and a necessary one, as an alternative, although diminished, supply would then always be available. This is considered by Mr. Fetterly, in fact by all parties concerned, to be absolutely necessary for smooth operation of the water supply. Mr. Marshall stated that it would cost less than $100 as the men and plant would be at the site.\n\nTherefore, unless otherwise advised from the Indian Department, I will instruct the drillers to clean out the old well on completion of the new one.\n\nMr. Marshall intends to begin work about October 1. I am sending him official notification today to begin work as soon as possible, Mr. Fetterly not having power to do any more than to discuss and prepare the contract and to obtain his signature.\n\nIt might be repeated from the original report that the working head in the present well, a Beatty, is now partly composed of parts of another pump. It does not appear to have been very satisfactory. In addition to this fact, this old pump should remain in the present well for future use. This is the reason for purchase of a new working head.\n\nI am enclosing the following documents:\n\n(1) Two copies of specifications.\n(2) Two copies of the contract.\n\nMr. Marshall is in possession of one of each of these documents together with a blueprint of the plans.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSeptember 28, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 24th instant with enclosures regarding improvement of the water supply at Muscowequan Indian School, but before sending the material to the Indian Department there are one or two points on which I should like some further information, in case explanations are asked for.\n\nThe price for drilling the well to 145 feet is $4. per foot, the men to provide their own bed and board. On the other hand, at Thunderchild Rahrick is to be paid on the basis of $1.50 for the first 50 feet and 50 cents additional per 50 feet thereafter. This would be without bed and board. How are living expenses being paid in the case of Rahrick and his men and at what rate? Will you please give also the cost of well drilling at Thunderchild and Muscowequan on a comparable basis.\n\nIn the case of the basement it is stated that unit prices are to prevail, the total price being subject to the depth of the well, but it is understood that this note applies to the well rather than the basement, as it is not clear how the price of the basement can in any way depend on the depth of the well.\n\nI should like to know also how the cost of the basement is to be determined, as no prices are given for the materials and if it is to be paid for on a time basis, do the specified labour rates include contractor's profit?\n\nIt is noted that, unless otherwise advised from the Indian Department, you will instruct the drillers to clean out the old well on completion of the new one. As this will involve an additional $100, an explanation will be required, more especially as we were under the impression that it would be dangerous to touch the old well and attempt to clean it out. See, for example, Mr. Marshall's letters of August 4 and 7 and Mr. Fetterly's reports on the subject.\n\nP.S. Extra cost of excavation in basement, 4 of Mr. Fetterly's report of Sept. 10, $50, is approved by Indian Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nO.H. Hoover, Esq.,\nPublic Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\nRe Muscowequan School\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of last instant regarding the interpretation of the contract in connection with the above-named school, together with a copy of the Director's letter dated Sept.28 on the same subject.\n\nRe price for Drilling (Paragraph 2 of the Director's letter)\n\nThunderchild School; according to contract with Rahrick\n\n| First 50 feet | 1.50 per foot |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Next 50 feet (100' altogether) | 2.00 \" |\n| \" 50 feet (150' ) | 2.50 \" |\n| \" 50 feet (200' ) | 3.00 \" |\n\nand so on, i.e.: 50\u00a2 additional for each additional 50'.\n\nThe two drillers (Rahrick and helper) were to provide their own bed and board. This well was expected to be about 300 feet deep. However, the cost, at this rate, for the first 145 feet (the probable depth of the Muscowequan School) would be $267.50. This is smaller than the other school at this depth but the price would increase fast for lower depths.\n\nMuscowequan School\n\nThe price per foot in this case is $4.00 per foot flat price, as this well is only 145 feet deep. The drilling rig has to be shipped a long distance for a shallow well hence the unit price is greater. The 145 feet would therefore cost $580.00.\n\nIn this case also the two drillers will look after their own bed and board. This is the better plan when it can be arranged. Father Allard allowed Rahrick to use the old rectory free of charge. In the case of the Muscowequan School I expect that the men will board at the school as the village is several miles away, but they will make their own arrangements.\n\nParagraph 3\n\nThe statement \"unit prices will prevail\" referred to the well proper, the amount of casing, rods and pipe needed obviously depending on the depth of the well. It was included in order that there would be no misunderstanding regarding total price.\n\nThis statement possibly should have been placed immediately after \"screen\" as it has nothing to do with the basement itself. I did not notice this apparent fallacy when\n\nO.H. Hoover, Esq.,\nEngineer-In-Charge,\nCalgary.\nwriting the contract but Mr. Marshall of the Canadian Well Supply thoroughly understood what was intended, consequently no difficulties will occur in the matter.\n\nParagraph 4.\n\nIn the absence of any instructions from the Director regarding personnel of staff to build the basement (only a few days' work at most, and a simple job at least, because of the shape and size) it was necessary to attempt to make arrangements with Mr. D.E. Marshall of the Canadian Well Supply, to use his two drillers, together with one or two local men if needed, to construct the basement. Neither the necessary labour or material is sufficiently large to necessitate special arrangements.\n\nI consequently instructed Mr. Marshall, in your name, to buy the small amount of lumber, cement, gravel and reinforcing steel necessary at a local point, the bills being sent to the Dominion Water Works Board. Both of these drillers are also experienced men at this sort of work and could do the job. The prices for material will be those prevailing at Lestock. The price of 50\u00a2 per hour for foreman (the present head driller) and 25\u00a2 per hour for labour (the present helper together with one or two local men if needed) includes the contractor's profit together with bed and board. I quoted these prices as those paid at Duck Lake School and Mr. Marshall was satisfied.\n\nParagraph 5.\n\nThe inconsistency of the latter report when compared with the former is only apparent, not real. When it was the only well available, tampering with the old one would be very dangerous in case the whole supply would be cut off. It seemed to me, however, that when a new well was drilled it would be advantageous to try to rehabilitate the old one.\n\nI was aware of my former suggestion together with Mr. Marshall's, but the presence of a new well will improve the critical conditions.\n\nWe did not wish to tamper with the old well when it was the only one available.\n\nIt may be that the old well has more or less temporarily improved since my last visit, as no complaints have been received. If so, improvement will probably only be temporary and with a new well it might be a good move to attempt cleaning the old one. It is quite possible that the Indian Department will not agree with me and may wish to leave the old well as it is, hence my statement - \"Unless otherwise advised\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) P.A. Fetterly.\n\nP.S. It will be remembered that the instructions from the Director implied that all of the materials such as rods,\ncasing, pipe, engine, cylinder, etc., were to be purchased through Mr. Marshall in accordance with his original offer. This was therefore included in the contract after he and I visited several firms, including Fairbanks-Morse, Crane and Duro, and examined their material and prices, especially the working head.\n\nP.A.F. (sgd)\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of September 12th regarding the water supply system at the Masowequan Indian Residential School I enclose herewith letter received from Mr. Hoover dated September 24th, together with specifications and contract with Canadian Well Supply Company for the drilling of a new well at this School. As there were certain features of this contract which appeared to require some explanation I wrote to Mr. Hoover on September 28th and received a reply from him, to which was attached a letter from Mr. Fetterly, dated the 3rd instant, covering the points raised in my previous letter. Copies of my letter of September 28th and Mr. Fetterly's letter of October 3rd are also enclosed.\n\nFrom the material now being supplied you will see that the contract for drilling the well has been awarded to the Canadian Well Supply Company of Regina and that work was to begin about the first of the month.\n\nI should like to draw your attention to the suggestion now made to clean out the old well at an estimated cost of less than $100. You will recall that it was previously considered too dangerous to clean this well but it now appears that if a new well is successfully drilled the old one may be cleaned out without much danger. Mr. Hoover accordingly says: \"Therefore, unless otherwise advised from the Indian Department, I will instruct the drillers to clean out the old well on completion of the new one.\"\n\nI would suggest that no instructions be given to clean out the old well until the new one has been satisfactorily completed, but it might be well to take advantage of the men and plant being at the site to clean out the old well provided the well driller is satisfied that this should be done.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions on this point as soon as possible in order that no delay may occur after the new well has been brought into use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Fetterly, B.Sc., R.P.E.,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\n\nThis report deals with the progress of the new well as ascertained during a visit made to the School on November 6, 1934 and follows an Interim Report dated August 20, 1934.\n\n2. Present Condition.\n\nThe drillers were absent, having gone to Regina on November 5 to consult with D.B. Marshall of the Canadian Well Supply Co. re conditions found on the previous day. However, the writer proceeded to Regina after examining conditions around the well and consulted with all parties.\n\nThe log which is enclosed, in duplicate, will indicate the materials penetrated and may be compared with that at the old well drilled in 1930, two copies of the log of which are also attached.\n\nThe drillers of the present well found only a slight amount of water at the points indicated in the log. They then went on down to the 142 feet vein but found no gravel 3' thick as in the other well. Instead, the drill dropped abruptly as if through a hollow space or through very soft clay, probably the latter, according to the\ndrillers. They thought it was water at first. They found 60 feet of water in the hole on Sunday morning, November 3, after reaching this point but this was quickly bailed out and more returned very slowly; entirely too slowly for practical purposes.\n\nIt was thought that there are two possible reasons for the non-appearance of gravel at 142' - 5', viz:- either the gravel stratum is a lens which peters out before getting to the new well or that the gravel stratum dips between the two locations and that if they go, say 15 or 20 ft. more, they may strike the gravel stratum.\n\nIf this fails the new well can be drilled to 205 feet. It might be mentioned again that the old well was originally sunk to 205' and then filled with gravel to 92 ft.\n\nAfter consultation at Regina, the driller returned to the School with the intention of drilling 15' or 20' more, then if there be no success, to continue to the 205'.\n\nThe casing in the new well is at present at 92 ft. Possibly the water in the old well from the 42' level goes down and joins the 142' water and also the 205' water which must come up. The drillers think that the bulk of the water in the old well comes from the 205' level up through the gravel. This gravel filling must be handled carefully with proper sized gravel. The hole being drilled is 8\" in diameter, although Mr. Marshall thinks it is nearer 10\" because of the bit.\n\n3. Possible Operations.\n\n(a) Drill another 15 or 20 feet in an effort to\nintercept the 142' gravel stratum of the old well, or to prove that it has petered out.\n\n(b) Go to the 205' level, similarly to the old well to find this water.\n\n(c) Drill another well on the other (west) side of the old well at least 10' away to intercept the gravel seam. The drillers think that a cave has probably been formed for a short distance around the old well.\n\n(d) Find another source. No sloughs or lakes are in the neighbourhood. The Canadian National Railway has a tank at Touchwood, five miles to the south west. The water for this tank comes from a source (spring or lake probably) 3 miles further south of the railway. It would appear that this would be only a last resort because of the expense.\n\n4. Materials.\n\nMr. Marshall has not ordered the working head nor anything in connection with the pit until water is found. They can be quickly obtained when needed. He has ordered pump rods Cylinder 3\" pipe. These materials are at Regina ready to be shipped.\n\n5. Notes.\n\nIt might be mentioned that the toilet traps, etc., in the plumbing system are continually being choked and stopped up with fine sand and silt, necessitating constant attention.\nMeanwhile the drillers are drilling further, possibly to the 205' point as water has to be obtained somewhere and in some way.\n\nThe water situation is similar all over Saskatchewan.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\n\nCalgary, Alta., November 12, 1934.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the new well now being drilled at Muscowequan Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith a report dated the 12th instant by Mr. P.A. Fetterly of our Calgary office, from which you will see that the drillers are finding considerable difficulty securing a sufficient water supply. Since that was received a telegram dated the 15th instant has been received from Mr. Hoover, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Received wire from Canadian Well Supply quote re well at Lestock drilling done down to two hundred and five feet no sign of sand quite an increase in water supply somewhere below casing which is still at one hundred and thirty one feet water evidently broke in at the one hundred and forty five feet level but no sign of sand or gravel what are your instructions letter following unquote we are wiring Marshall for information regarding present capacity.\"\n\nI am consulting with the Borings Division of the Geological Survey, as has been done on previous occasions, to find out what they would suggest by way of instructions and for any relevant information that can be secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRegina, Sask., Nov. 14, 1934.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nD.M. Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRe Muscowequan School Well.\n\nFurther to conversation with Mr. Betterly when he was here last week. The well has now been drilled down to two hundred and five feet. For the first few days after drilling was continued below the one hundred and fifty foot level there seems to be no change in the water supply and then suddenly being increased considerably rising to between thirty and forty feet from surface. There was no further sand layer struck between one hundred and fifty and two hundred and five, and no indication of sand and gravel and anytime even though the water supply increased.\n\nOur driller is of the opinion that this water is breaking in from the side somewhere between one hundred and forty feet and one hundred and fifty feet, but on account of no showing of sand and gravel, it is impossible to finish it satisfactory. He is quite satisfied there is a fair supply of water but the question is how are we going to get at without it being mudded up and closed off at the bottom which has apparently been the trouble with the old well.\n\nWhat we would suggest doing is setting casing down between 140 ft. and 150 ft. then pouring gravel into the hole, this would prevent the clay from pulling into the pipe but we would still have the danger of the clay closing out on the outside of the gravel, nearly shutting off the water. What seems like the dangerous point to me is that we do not know how far from the present hole this sand layer extends and it might be anywhere from the present hole up to 20 ft. and still start leaking in. Our gravel fill might work satisfactory for a considerable time, then suddenly this might collapse and shut the water off anytime and there would be nothing we could do to help it.\n\nOur experience in finishing wells must be in a sand or gravel layer to leave free passage for the water, otherwise this is likely to be shut off at any time and nothing we could do would help it.\n\nI will expect to hear from you shortly with instructions. We are\n\nYours truly,\n\nCanadian Well Supply Company, Limited.\n\nper D.E. Marshall.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 21, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI have received your letters of the 15th and 16th instant with enclosures and your telegram of the 15th instant with reference to the well situation at Muscowequan Indian School, and Mr. Johnston of the Geological Survey has been consulted to find out what is the best plan to follow under the circumstances.\n\nMr. Johnston's advice is to the following effect. To begin with he does not think that there would be any advantage in deepening the well, as at a lower depth the water, if found, is likely to be saline and unfit for use. He suggests that the procedure to be adopted should be somewhat as follows:\n\n(1) Test the well by bailing to find out the amount of water which it is likely to produce.\n\n(2) Find out as nearly as possible the point at which the greatest flow of water is coming into the well. This would represent the level at which the well should be developed.\n\n(3) If the well drillers are satisfied that the well is likely to produce a sufficient flow of water for the requirements of the school it will probably be necessary to insert a casing inside the present casing down to the level at which the water is entering the hole and at this point have a screen fixed on to the inner casing. (The type of screen recommended is that supplied by Edward E. Johnston, Inc., of 2304 Long Avenue, St. Paul, Minn.)\n\n(4) It will probably also be necessary to lower the present casing to about the same level to prevent the well caving in on the inner casing and screen. The well drillers would be able to give an opinion on this point.\n\n(5) The lower part of the well below the point at which the water is coming into it should be blocked up by a wooden or concrete block as may be found most satisfactory.\n\nThe cost of the inner casing and screen would probably be in the neighbourhood of $1,000, but I should be obliged if you would obtain prices for this material as delivered to the school.\n\nO.H. Hoover, Bsc.,\nEngineer in Charge,\nCalgary,\nAlta.\nYou will understand that the foregoing suggestions are based only on such information as we are able to make available to Mr. Johnston and it may be that the well driller will be able to find a simpler and less expensive solution of the difficulty, but I should be glad to have his views and your recommendation as to the plan above suggested. A great deal depends upon the yield of the well in deciding on the expense which would be justified in completing it.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to the Department of Indian Affairs and no additional material is to be purchased until authority is received from that Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 19th instant regarding the drilling of the new well at Muscovegan Indian School, Mr. Hoover reports, under date of November 16th that a telegram has been received from the Canadian Well Supply Company of Regina, reading as follows:\n\n\"In reply to your wire our driller is of the opinion that there is ample water but lack of sand makes satisfactory finish impossible STOP We will proceed with test as that cannot do a great amount of harm.\"\n\nMr. W.A. Johnston of the Geological Survey of Canada has been consulted as to what is best to be done under the circumstances and I enclose herewith copy of a letter to Mr. Hoover of even date, which sets out his suggestions. If the well when tested is found to give a sufficient yield for the purposes of the school, I shall be glad to receive authority from you to purchase the inner casing and screen as suggested by Mr. Johnston and such other material as may be necessary to complete the well.\n\nMr. Hoover has been asked to obtain prices for this material which will be furnished you as soon as they are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEngineer-In-Charge\nDom. Water & Reclamation Service,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFurther to our wires of the end of last week regarding the well at MacGregor School. We started the pump test on Monday to try and find out what volume of water there was, we had considerable trouble with mud plugging the pump at first, but eventually Tuesday afternoon it cleared up enough for a straight four hours, pumping 450 gallons per hour with only 3 feet of a draw down, then Wednesday morning the water was shut off entirely, later it broke in but did not come near as strong as Tuesday.\n\nThe part that puzzled me was that pumping the new well had no effect whatever apparently on the present well you were using, I expect that this would have been the case if the water had broke in at the 145 foot level, which is apparently the main source of supply in your present well, when pumping was again started we started to check up on Well No.1 the old 40 foot well and we found that the new well lowered the old No.1. This proves conclusively that all the water we were getting was passing down the outside of the casing from the 40-foot level, and I am also satisfied that, that was where all the water was coming from in No.2 well, which you are using at present.\n\nI am very disappointed that this well has turned out as it has, we were basing on our conclusions on the log of Well No.2 which was to say the least very misleading. I was in touch with our driller on the phone a few minutes ago, and he reported by pulling up the pipe a little the water broke in again today as strong as ever but that does not still help the situation.\n\nI suggested to Mr. Fetterly the night he was here that it was possible all the water you were getting was coming from this level, but he was rather inclined to think it was coming from the lower veins, this proves conclusively that the water we are taking from the new well is very hard and similar to what they are using. I am sorry to have to make a report as this but it is the only thing I can do. We are\n\nYours truly,\n\nCanadian Well Supply Company Limited.\n\nPer D.E.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nCanadian Well Supply Co., Ltd.,\nRegina, Sask., Nov. 30, 1934.\n\nDom. Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nRe Muscowequan Indian School,\n\nIn reply to yours of November 28 regarding the well at Lestock, I got in touch with the Engineer there, after I phoned you Wednesday morning and he promised to send a sample of water to you at Calgary. I had a letter from the Assistant Principal, this morning, advising that this sample had been sent forward.\n\nIn reply to your first question, which is in connection with the supply of water. Our 4 hour test run 450 gallons per hour, and I firmly believe that it would be considerably more than this, if pumped from the 40 foot level. That is, if a well were properly finished at 40 feet as what we were getting was falling down the outside of the casing to 135 ft.\n\nYour second question was finding out the depth of greatest flow. We decided this point was 40 ft. on account of our check up of the lowering of the water in No.1 well.\n\nYour third question in regard to using a smaller casing and screen, Mr. Johnston's suggestion to use the smaller casing for screening, would only be feasible providing the water had been coming in at a lower level than our 6\" casing. Even then, I could not see the advantage of using this casing as the surface water was flowing down around the 6\". The idea to prevent seeping was all right, but it would not work with the flow of water. There would no advantage to think of a scheme of this kind, if the well were to be finished at 40 ft. The blocking of the hole below the casing would be to prevent loss of water, providing there was a sand layer further down. This also answers Question No.4.\n\nYour fifth question--I have already answered the reason for the wooden or concrete block. If a 6\" casing were used, price of pipe f.o.b. Regina is $1.50 per ft. When I wrote to you last Thursday, I did not take the liberty of making any suggestions but, as you have asked for ideas on this subject, I would suggest the following:\n\nWhen you were in the office here, about 3 weeks ago, I suggested that if no gravel was found in the hole we were drilling, that we would have to drill another well slightly west of the present No.2 well. My idea would be to put a 4 or 4\u00bd\" test hole down there to 150 ft. and find out definitely if there was any gravel or water supply near that level. To do this successfully, we would use 8\" casing to the 40 ft. level, driving this pipe without a shot to prevent the water was absolutely shut off and then continue with the small hole. If we found we had a water supply at the 140 or 150 ft., as stated in the log of the Well No.2 we would proceed to drill the 8\" well at the regular price of $4.00 per ft. If nothing was found in the test hole, the price is $1.50 per ft. for drilling the small hole. Then again provided the water sample that we sent in is not too hard and can be handled with a softening plant, I would recommend using the old No.1 well, as I am quite sure the water is identically the same as that which we are getting out of the present drilled hole. This well has a first class concrete crib with pipe connections running into the powerhouse, and the only thing that might be necessary to do there, would be to deepen it slightly, probably 20 ft., to give a little more submergence for the pump. My idea would be to put in a 20 ft. length of pipe with the top end drilled or hack-sawed with a screen part at the top and with the openings left in the gravel formation. Then the pump and pumping equipment could be set above the surface over this well.\nI believe this would be a more satisfactory arrangement than trying to finish the present 5\" well and put in a concrete pit and all necessary connections from there. If this suggestion of the 4\" test hole sounds reasonable to you, wire at once, and we will get the men started on this hole. In the meantime the authorities at Ottawa can decide definitely what should be done.\n\nI will expect to hear from you shortly,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCANADIAN WELL SUPPLY CO., LTD.\n\nD.E. Marshall.\nSir,\n\nMuscowequan Indian School.\n\nI received a letter from the Canadian Well Supply Company of Regina this morning regarding the well at the above named school.\n\nI am enclosing two copies for your information. While waiting for other information I wrote them on 26th ultimo asking certain questions which followed your letter of 21st ultimo. I have not had time to study his present letter thoroughly. Meanwhile, I requested a sample of water from the 40' level for analysis. I asked for a quart but an 8 oz. bottle only was sent. This was for possible use of a water softener. However, I requested the Calgary City Chemist to analyze it. He phoned a few minutes ago announcing his results as follows:\n\nEncls.\n\nAlkalinity 326 parts per million (calculated)\n\nHardness 810 parts per million or 56.7 grains per gallon.\n\nHe also found the sodium sulphate content high but could not find the exact amount because of insufficient sample. He stated that the content was rather high and a water softener would leave the sulphate in. Consequently it would not be very satisfactory.\n\nOn my mentioning that we had another small supply of good water (well No.2, 145' deep) he suggested using the old water for drinking and the new one for general purposes after softening it as much as possible.\n\nYou will note that the Canadian Well Supply Co. requests an answer by wire. I of course cannot do this until you and the Indian Department have had a chance to study the matter.\n\nOn enquiry at the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse I find\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Johnston of the Geological Survey in the light of the information supplied by Mr. Hoover in his letter of December 1st and that from the Canadian Well Supply Company dated November 30th, copies of which were sent you a few days ago.\n\nBased on such information as has been made available to him, Mr. Johnston's suggestions are as follows:\n\n(1) Finish the new well at the 40-foot level or at the point where the greatest flow comes into the hole.\n\n(2) If after this has been done, it is found that the new well will supply sufficient water to take care of the needs of the school, at least temporarily, then the old well may be reconditioned in the way suggested by the Canadian Well Supply Company in the sixth paragraph of their letter of November 30th, that is by deepening it slightly and putting in a new length of pipe with a screen at the top and with the openings left in the gravel formation.\n\n(3) A further analysis should be made of the water from the new well.\n\n(4) Until the two existing wells have been thoroughly dried out it is not considered desirable to drill another well slightly west of the present number two well, as suggested by Mr. Marshall.\n\nThis program has been discussed with the Departmental Architect and verbally approved by him. I have accordingly sent to Mr. Hoover, the following night letter:\n\n\"Re Muscowequan suggest new well be finished at forty foot level or where greatest flow is found STOP If this well then supplies enough water for temporary needs of school old well may be reconditioned as suggested in Marshall's letter November thirty STOP Letter follows.\"\n\nA copy of this letter is also being sent to Mr. Hoover for his information.\n\nThe program now recommended has the advantage of being less expensive than other which appears feasible at present.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nand there is good reason to believe that it will provide a fairly satisfactory supply of water, although it is unfortunate that the water in the new well is not of a better quality. It is not recommended at present to install a water softening apparatus, as this should be left in abeyance until both wells have been thoroughly tested.\n\nI trust that the foregoing recommendations meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nA. Purpose of Report\n\nIt was decided that the writer should proceed immediately to Lestock to investigate the water situation at the above named school in accordance with the urgent request of Mr. Marshall of the Canadian Well Supply of Regina. Accordingly the writer proceeded to Regina on Wednesday, December 12, and then went by automobile with Mr. Marshall to Lestock 100 miles north east of Regina, arriving Thursday morning.\n\nIt was found that the drillers had been unable to do any constructive work for three weeks, at no cost to the Government.\n\nB. Activities\n\nThe general situation was inspected, discussed and argued nearly all day with Mr. Marshall; the School Engineer, and the drillers. As you are aware, the 4\" test hole nearer Well No. 2 to 150' depth was vetoed by Ottawa, by implication in the Director's letter to the Secretary of Department of Indian Affairs dated Dec. 6.\n\nA personal visit was found to be the only\nmethod of deciding on procedure. After many plans had been suggested and discarded it was decided to proceed on the following line, closely following the suggestions contained in the Director's letter of Dec.6:\n\n(1) Finish the new well (No.3) at the 40' level or at the point where the greatest flow occurs. It was apparently intended by Ottawa that the complete concrete pit should not be constructed with machinery installed therein, but that a temporary installation should be made until the well was proved. The driller had inserted 40' of 8\" casing and 3\" pipe in the well with a cylinder installed and activated by the drilling machine, to be used as a temporary pump for testing purposes. Water was pumped for about 10 hours, and showed no signs of failing. The water was slightly silty. Two one-quart samples were obtained after pumping had proceeded for 6 or 7 hours.\n\nThe driller was then instructed to install the working head on the surface of the ground and to construct a temporary frost-proof structure over it very little larger than enough to cover it. The discharge pipe, about 4' long, would extend through the wall and downward 4' to connect with the existing system. Everything would be protected from frost. The cost of this temporary arrangement will\nbe very small.\n\nThe character of the water will not be known until the Calgary City Chemist performs the analysis, so that care will have to be taken in mixing this new water with that from Well No.2 which supplies the water for the boilers. This latter water does not appear to affect them. The waters cannot be kept separate as only one system of boilers and pressure tanks exists.\n\nThe writer tested the capacity of Well No.3. A 45 gallon barrel was filled in 6 min. 10 sec. This is nearly 450 gallons per hour.\n\nIt might be mentioned here that the pumping of water from No.3 lowered the level of the water in No.1, 20 feet away by nearly 4 feet temporarily. It did not affect No.2 well, which is 46 feet from Bo.3.\n\nThe question of a water softener for this water will best remain in abeyance as mentioned by the Director until the nature and amount of alkali salts in this water (No.3) are known. A water softener removes the Ca SO\u2084 and Mg SO\u2084 but does not help the Na\u2082SO\u2084 content to a great extent. This is because zeolite already contains Sodium ions.\n\n(2) Recondition the old well.\n\nThis refers to the latter portion of the sixth paragraph of Mr. Marshall's letter of November 30, not to the first part referring to the 4\" test hole experiment, the latter being vetoed by No.4 paragraph.\nAs it would not be possible to hold the drilling rig until No.3 had been proved, it was determined to prepare No.1 well for production of water. The Director's letter was not clear on this point. After No.3 had been conditioned the rig would either have to be removed to other work waiting for it or demurrage would have to be paid for since Mr. Marshall could not hold it idle any longer.\n\nThe driller was therefore instructed as follows:\n\nDrill 1/4\" holes 3/4\" centres in the first 3 feet of a 20' length of 8\" casing. Sink this in the bottom of the 40 foot hole of well No.1 which is lined with concrete tile 3' diameter by 2' long. Then replace the cover and leave until the results of No.3 are known. It may later be found that, instead of constructing a concrete pit at No.3 we may have to construct a house over No.1. The cost would be about the same. A quart sample of this water was obtained for analysis.\n\n(3) Analysis of Water\n\nAdequate samples were obtained from each of the three wells. These were taken to Calgary and to the City Chemist. He will not be able to perform the work until about Dec.22. Two copies will be sent to Ottawa and one to the school so the Engineer will know how to apportion production from the wells in order to protect his boilers.\n\n(4) Another Well.\n\nThis refers to Mr. Marshall's suggestion in the\nfirst portion of the 6th paragraph of his letter, and states that another well should not be contemplated at present.\n\nC. Fate of No.2 Well\n\nThis matter was admittedly difficult to decide upon. This well is flowing fairly freely at present, although it diminishes at times. It also produces water which does not appear to harm boilers pressure tanks, plumbing, etc. Until the results from Nos.3 and 1 are fully known it is not considered desirable to interfere with this well. Mr. Marshall was of the same opinion although he would receive $100 for cleaning or attempted cleaning. No attempt will therefore be made to rehabilitate this well at present.\n\nD. Additional Cost\n\nMr. Marshall was requested to give an estimate of the additional cost over the present total invoices of $1352.34 and $9.83. It was as follows:\n\nDrilling and hacksawing \"homemade\" screen composed of 8\" well casing, as above. 10.00\n\nDrilling 20' in Well No.1 below 40' level 2 or 3 days @ $20 60.00\n\nCost of Working Head, already provided for but not in above invoice. 385.00\n\nInstalling Working head at Well No.3 including Shelter. 15.00\n\nE. Conclusion\n\nA difficult situation has been handled to the best of one's ability and judgment. Nothing is being\ndone that may afterwards prove harmful. Providing the water from Well No.3 is not too hard, a judicious mixture from Nos. 2 and 3 may prove to be the solution of the difficulty. If it were possible to keep the waters separate No.2 should be all right for boilers, etc., and No.3 for most domestic purposes. The analyses will decide this.\n\nP.A. Fetterly,\nAsst.

If it should not be convenient for you to have the City of Calgary make another analysis, if you would care to send the sample to us we would be glad to analyze it for you at no charge.\n\nIn any event, we feel that an analysis should be at hand so that any recommendations we might make could be made with certainty.\n\nThanking you for your letter, and looking forward to hearing from you further on this matter at your early convenience.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nW.J. Westaway Company Limited.\nper J.C. Westaway.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the water supply system at the Muscokegan Indian School, our Engineer in Charge at Calgary has been endeavouring to secure further information as to the best way in which to use the water from the three wells now available so as to avoid as much as possible injury to the plumbing and also to determine whether a water softener should be installed.\n\nIn this connection a letter was addressed to the W.J. Westaway Company of Hamilton sending them a copy of the chemical analysis of the water from the three wells. The question was asked whether a softener would help in this case and also whether there would be any advantage in mixing the waters.

After all permissions required, we took it to Regina in two parts, by means of two hired automobiles for lack of truck around here. As it was a case of emergency, Regina shipped it back to the School by Express collect. So we paid both bills for Autes and Express on behalf of the Indian Department.\n\nI would very much appreciate the reimbursement for same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 15th 1935\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn account with Muscowequan Indian Residential School\nRe - Generator\n\nTo transportation Regina by 2 autos $15.00\nover 200 miles, go & return\n\nTo expenditures and divers 2.00\n\nTo Express bill 19.89\n\n$36.89\nReferring to my telegrams to the Department dated the 20th December and the 8th January, in regard to repairing the generator for the 6 volt Oyster lighting plant at the Muscowequan Residential School, I beg to advise the Department that the Reverend Principal brought this generator to Regina on December 20th. His arrival here was the first intimation I had that the system was not working. I at once obtained an estimate for rewinding the generator and putting it in a proper state of repair and before authorizing the work telegraphed the Department for authority. The original estimate was $65.00. Subsequently it was found that the generator required new bearings and the total cost would be $85.00. Authority for the expenditure of the additional $20.00 was obtained, leaving a balance of $25.00 for the purchase of a rheostat.\n\nThe Reverend Principal submitted an account to the Indian Agent for $19.89 for express charges returning the generator to the school and $16.50 being his expenses incurred in bringing the generator to Regina. I returned this account to the Indian Agent stating that it was my impression that the school authorities were to come for the generator without cost to the Department. However the Reverend Father has again submitted his account and insists that it should be paid. I am therefore forwarding the voucher for your consideration. This brings the total expenditure to date to $121.39, being $11.39 in excess of the amount authorized and makes it impossible for me to purchase the rheostat unless authority is given to pay the expense charges of $36.39. I feel that it is very important that the rheostat be installed to control the current, as without its use there is a great danger of the generator burning out again. I would be glad to be advised with regard to this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nOttawa, March 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A R.C. of the 26th ultimo, with reference to repairs to the generator of the lighting plant at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School and enclosing an account covering the cost of transportation and express charges.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is making payment, to the Principal of the School, of the express charges only, to the amount of $19.89. As there is no receipt covering the amount of $16.50, paid by the Principal for the transportation of the generator from the school to Regina, it is considered that the school authorities should be responsible for this expenditure, without cost to the Department.\n\nYou may arrange for the installing of a rheostat, to control the current, in order to overcome the danger of the generator again burning out. Please keep the expenditure for this purpose as low as possible and forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. I shall be pleased if this account is received before the 10th of April, next, in order that payment can be made from the appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to report that when I was at Muscowequan School this week the cook was asking if the Department would consider providing some heavy oilcloth for the floor of the kitchen; the Principal was with me at the time and said he had no extra funds himself to provide the floor cover required.\n\nThe kitchen here has a cement floor, is hard on the footwear and should be covered with suitable material.\n\nIf there are any funds on hand I would be much obliged if the Department would favorably consider the request; it would amount to about $40.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantity of heavy oilcloth required for the floor of the kitchen in the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. It is noted that the cost of this oilcloth will not exceed $40.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to report that the vertical boiler used at the Muscowequan School needs re-tubing, at present it leaks so badly that it puts out the fire, the engineer has used the flue expander until he can get no further results from it.\n\nThe boiler is made by Vulcan Iron Whs,\n9 H.P., #12460.\n\nI recommend that it be put in shape as soon as possible. We cannot figure any of getting this boiler out of the building without tearing out the cement wall, a mechanic will have to bring his tubes and do the work on the premises. I do not know any mechanic who is on the list for work of this sort, he would most likely have to come from some firm in Melville.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Mr. Agent Waddy, reporting that the vertical boiler at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School needs re-tubing. He states that, at present, it leaks so badly that it puts out the fire and that the engineer has used the flue expander until he can get no further results.\n\nThis boiler was made by the Vulcan Iron Works and is 2 h.p., No. 12460. It will be impossible to remove the boiler from the building without tearing out the cement wall, and it will be necessary to have a mechanic do the work of re-tubing on the premises. I would request that you make enquiry regarding the work required and arrange with a firm on the approved list in Regina to supply the work and have them installed. It is thought that you will be aware of a firm in Regina on the approved list, who could do this work, as Mr. Waddy states he does not know of a firm to whom it could be offered. All costs should be kept as low as possible. After the boiler has been re-tubed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. Mr. Agent Waddy is being informed that the matter of repairing the boiler has been placed in your hands. You might consult him in the matter.\n\nThe Department would like you to make discreet enquiry regarding the qualifications of the engineer and other members of the staff who are responsible for the looking after of the equipment. During the past year, there have been a number of requests from this school for repairs to equipment, and we are in doubt as to whether there is any mismanagement in the handling of the boilers, lighting equipment and pumps.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 121-5-5, dated March 18th last, authorizing me to make arrangements to have the hot water boiler at the Muscowequan Residential School re-tubed, I beg to forward herewith Touchwood Agency voucher amounting to $160.00 covering the cost of re-tubing the boiler.\n\nI may advise you that upon receipt of your letter I immediately made enquiries and found that it would be necessary to get the tubes from Winnipeg and that it would be cheaper to have a man go from there to do the work. I placed the matter in the hands of Messrs. Potts and Miller Limited of this city and the work has been done at much less cost than I anticipated when making my first enquiry.\n\nI have visited the school and examined the boiler and find that the work has been well done. I also examined the tubes that were removed from the boiler and found them in places very thin and generally badly eaten by some chemical contained in the water they are using. I am quite satisfied that the engineer who is operating the plant is in no way responsible for its condition. This is a condition which would have occurred irrespective of the qualifications of the operator. The engineer at this school, Mr. Doull, has had twelve years experience in operating equipment at our residential schools and is a very careful and conscientious worker. I have every confidence in him so far as the work and operation of the machinery is concerned, but I am not so sure of his ability in so far as the electrical equipment is concerned.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhen at the school I enquired into the cause of the burning out of the generator last December, I took along with me the foreman from the Magneto Service Station in this City and he examined the electrical plant and batteries and he strongly surmises that the cause of the burning out of the batteries is not through faulty operation, but may have been owing to the condition of the batteries which have been in use for four years, some of the plates were found cracked and badly warped, and there was considerable sediment in the jars. I have instructed the Agent to have three of the cells sent in to Regina for examination with a view to ascertaining the cause for deterioration and when I am in a position to do so I will submit a report in connection with the plant. The Magneto Service supplied a rheostat in March, but upon examination it is found to be too large and not the proper unit. I have returned it and expect to be supplied with the proper rheostat at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nREGINA, SASK.\n\nJune 1, 1935.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWhen checking your plant at the Muscowequan Residential School, we find the batteries incapable of the services required of them. There has been some question as to why this battery has become inoperative and upon close inspection of some of the cells it appears that these cells have been allowed to become under charged and thus in a sulphated condition. A heavy over charge was given this battery to bring it back to normal instead of slow charge which caused the plates to warp and break and to dislodge active material, thereby shortening the life of the battery. We therefore recommend a new battery, the price of which is as follows:\n\nOne 54 cell type KNNS-13 Exide, 160 ampere hour capacity sealed glass jar type cells complete, including\nInter cell connectors\nBolt connectors\nLead tank for series connections between rows of cells\nOne hydrometer\nOne thermometer\nTwo lift hooks\nTwo socket wrenches\n\nPRICE $594.00\n\nAn allowance of $27.00 will be allowed for old battery making\nNet price of $567.00\n\nThe above battery is identical to the one now in use at the Muscowequan School, but due to the load which the battery has to take from the time the plant is shut down in the evening until it starts again in the morning we strongly recommend the use of a larger battery rather than the one\nyou have been using, and submit the following:\n\nOne 54 cell type XXHS-19, Exide, 240 ampere hour capacity sealed glass jar type cells complete, including\n- Inter cell connectors,\n- Bolt connectors,\n- Lead tank for series connections between rows of cells\n- One hydrometer\n- One thermometer,\n- Two lift hooks\n- Two socket wrenches\n\nPRICE $853.20\n\nAn allowance of $27.00 will be allowed for old battery, making net price of $826.20.\n\nBy using this size of battery your cost over a period of years will be much lower than with the smaller battery because of the greater capacity available and if battery is properly cared for you will receive much longer life and more satisfactory operation.\n\nThe above prices are net F.O.B. Regina and we can make shipment of either battery approximately three weeks after the date we receive your order.\n\nWe might also submit a price of $306.90 for rebuilding, the old cells, but we in no way recommend this operation and you would be required to take full responsibility as we could not guarantee the work. This price is an approximate quotation only.\n\nWe understand that the Gordon School near Lestock requires a battery and although the present batteries are not of our represented manufacture we are pleased to make the same allowance on these cells, the quotation on replacement battery being the same as stated above.\n\nThe labor for installing the battery at the Gordon School would be $18.00, travelling expenses would be $9.00, making a total of $27.00 which would be additional cost on the battery.\n\nWith reference to the Muscogeean School, the plant there needs adjusting as well as new battery. Total labor for installation and checking plant would be $36.00. Travelling expenses would be $9.00, making a total extra charge of $45.00.\nThe plant will require certain new parts, the price of which cannot be quoted definitely without a more thorough check of the plant and obtaining manufacturer's price lists which we have not been able to do to date.\n\nThe above labor does not include work on the gasoline engine proper, but includes all automatic control adjustment and attendance while batteries are being given their primary charge.\n\nWe trust that the above estimates will meet with your approval and will gladly give any further information you may require although we think this a complete estimate with the exception of the items mentioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMAGNETO SERVICE STATION LTD.\n\nG. S. Fanning,\nShop Foreman.\nReferring to my letter of the 15th ultimo, in regard to the condition of the batteries at the Muscowequan Residential School, I may advise you that I have had the three cells brought in to the Magneto Service Station and examined. I enclose herewith copy of a report received from the Magneto Service Station with reference to their findings and opinion as to the cause of the batteries becoming in the condition in which they are at present. Their opinion is that the condition of the cells may be because the batteries have been allowed to become under charged and thus in a sulphated condition and in order to bring them back to normal a heavy over charge was given instead of a slow charge, which caused the plates to warp and break and to dislodge active material, thereby shortening the life of the battery.\n\nI have obtained from the Agents of the Lister units running instructions in connection with their plants which I am forwarding to the school authorities in order that they may study it and have a better understanding of the construction and operation of their unit.\n\nThe Magneto Service Station give prices on two different sized batteries and also give a price on the cost of labour and expenses in connection with installing same both for this school and the Gordon's school as well. They do not however give an estimate on the cost of overhauling the engine. I think, should it be decided to replace these batteries, the engine should be thoroughly checked over at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 11, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: Schools Branch.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Marison's letter regarding the lighting plant for the Muscowequan School, I would recommend that a battery with capacity of 240 ampere hours be provided, also that Mr. Marison be instructed to have the Engineers of the Lister Company check over the plant and make any adjustments or repairs necessary.\n\nArchitect.\nJune 13, 1935.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Inspector Hurison, Regina, has reported on the condition of the batteries at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, Muscowequan Reserve, No. 86 - Electoral District of East Mountain Bank. He had these batteries inspected by Magneto Service Station, Limited, Regina, who state the present batteries are now practically useless. They were not heavy enough to carry the load. It will be necessary to supply new batteries.\n\nMr. Orr, Architect of this Department, recommends that new batteries, with a capacity of 240 ampere hours, be provided, and also that Humford-Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, who are agents for the Lister Company, be authorized to check over the plant and make any adjustments or repairs necessary.\n\nMr. Hurison forwarded a quotation from Magneto Service Station, Limited, Regina, for the supplying of a 154 cell type Exide battery, 240 ampere hour capacity, at the net price of $820.20, f.o.b.

Fetterly, B.Sc.,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nPurpose of Report\n\nThe writer combined an inspection visit to the above-named school with a hydrometric trip to Regina, on June 13, to ascertain progress. The Contractor, D.E. Marshall of Canadian Well Supply of Regina, accompanied him.\n\nResults of Inspection\n\nIt was found that the driller had been ill for three weeks or more and had been unable to work. He expected, however, to begin on June 17 and to finish the concrete pit and installation of the pump in a short time.\n\nThe inspection, together with recent developments as to salt content of the water (from Well No.3) resulted in slight changes in design.\n\nOwing to the nature of the water it was decided to make a direct connection between the pump on the new well and the outside open stock-watering tank in order that this water, at least, would not have to pass through the pressure tanks. As a considerable amount of water is used for this purpose a large saving in the potential deposit of salts in the plumbing system should be made. Livestock will not be\nlikely to refuse this undiluted water.\n\nThe change necessitated the extra purchase of two check valves and some piping. This will of course not obviate the necessity for using some of the water from Well No.3 in the school itself but the amount mixed with Well No.3 will be greatly lessened.\n\nFather Jeanotte, the Principal, stated that, although they had been compelled to use the water sparingly, they had not actually suffered to any great extent. Rains are at present supplying some water in the sloughs for the stock. He also stated that he is constructing a concrete tank for conservation of rain water from the roofs.\n\nThe acute water situation at this school should be solved for some time to come when the present well has been connected with the water system.\n\nIt appears to one that a school having only one source of supply is in a precarious situation, particularly if this sole source consists of a well.\n\nCALGARY, Alberta, June 20,1935.\nSir,\n\nRe: Muscovequan Indian School\n\nI enclose herewith a report by Mr. Fetterly, of our Calgary staff, describing the present situation of the water supply at the Muscovequan Indian School. You will note that the concrete pit and the installation of the pump previously ordered are expected to be finished in a short time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTouchwood Agency,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nJune 25th 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would be obliged if the Department would consider the following requirements for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nPaint, varnish, oil and turpentine for cottage and sheds at the school\u2014value $70.00.\n\nSmall galvanized warehouse for flour total cost about $150.00\n\nBricks to brick up garage which is attached to the school\u2014value $50.00.\n\nDifferential pulley block\u2014value $30.00\n\nGranary\u201430 x 50 x 12, material $900.00, the old one here was built of logs in 1914 and is falling down.\n\nLaundry building 25x50x12.

Eaton Co., Ltd., Regina, Sask., for paint and brushes for Muscowagan School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental D.R. #3425\n\nLetter No. 121-5-5 dated June 29/35\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMR. WILLIAMS,\n\nThe Department is inviting prices for batteries required at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, near Lestock.\n\nThe Minister's instructions are that in addition to the firms already furnished, prices are to be invited from the Electric Equipment Company, Limited, of Saskatoon.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, July 26, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to official letter of the 4th instant, regarding the supplying of new batteries for use at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. The Minister's instructions now are that, in addition to the firms already mentioned in the letter referred to, prices are to be invited from the Electric Equipment Company, Limited, of Saskatoon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReferring to my letter No. 312-11A RC dated June 5, with reference to the condition of the Batteries in conjunction with the electric lighting plant in the Muscowequan Residential School, in the Touchwood Agency.\n\nI may advise the Department that I have again been approached by the authorities at the School, who inform me that the Batteries are becoming very poor and it is extremely difficult to keep them functioning. I had three of the cells brought in for examination and find that it is not possible to have them brought back to normal. The plates are in a badly sulphated condition and warped. This is due no doubt to the Batteries having been allowed to become over-charged and thus in a sulphated condition. A heavy over-charge was given these Batteries to bring them back into service instead of a low charge, which caused the plates to warp and break thereby discharging active material and shortening the life of the Batteries.\n\nThe Battery recommended for this plant is the same as that which is being purchased for the Gordon Residential School and will cost practically the same, about $577.00. I am of the opinion that the engine should be examined and over-hauled. This unit has been in use for a considerable time. It was transferred from the Edmonton Residential School to Lestock.\n\nIn the event of authority being given for the purchase of the battery, I would advise that the matter be placed in the hands of the Mumford, Medland Limited, of Winnipeg who are the Western Agents for the Lister Plants. They submitted the best bid on the Battery for the Gordon School and recently over-hauled the engine at that point for a very reasonable figure.\n\nI would be glad to have the Department's decision regarding this matter as soon as it is convenient as it is important that this work should be done before the children return from their holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 31, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A R.C. of the 23rd instant, with reference to the batteries in connection with the electric lighting plant at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. In this connection I would refer you to official letter of the 4th instant, authorizing you to obtain prices for the supplying of new batteries from the firms mentioned in that letter.\n\nFrom the contents of your letter I am in doubt if you received the communication above referred to, and I am enclosing a copy.\n\nBesides the firms mentioned in letter of the 4th instant, you were informed on the 26th instant of the Minister's instructions that, in addition, prices were to be invited from the Electric Equipment Company, Limited, Saskatoon. I would therefore request that you give the matter your early attention.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

Construction of a building for laundry, I estimated for $2,000.00, however if the laundry is to be built the architect will have to say what sort of place will be constructed. Some years ago a laundry was being fitted up in an old building here at the time the place went off fire, since then the work has been done in an old hen house, entirely unsatisfactory and unhealthy. I beg to recommend that this building be considered. The principal already has the soft water tank constructed as a foundation on the site against side of the school.\n\n2. Construction of building for granary with drive way down centre, I estimated for $800.00. This building is required as the old place in use is falling down.\n\n3. $25.00 of cement for foundations for the pig pen. I did not estimate for this item but the cement is required.\n\n4. Paint, brushes, oil etc to amount of $100.00 for use on various places throughout the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 26, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the request of the Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, that funds be provided to erect a building for laundry purposes and a granary.\n\nOwing to definite instructions from the Treasury Board for a drastic cut in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year, no funds were provided to cover the cost of erecting the laundry and granary. The total amount that will be available for miscellaneous repairs, painting, etc., at this school during the next fiscal year will be $300. If the Principal considers that it would be in the best interests to utilize this money in the purchase of the cement for the foundations of the pigpen, to the amount of $25, and paint, brushes, oil, etc., to the total amount of $100, you may arrange for the purchase. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. I may add, however, that payment cannot be made until the funds are available in the coming year's appropriation. This will likely be about the middle of April.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L.

After the repairs have been made to the generator, you should obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost. It might be well to have the firm who make the repairs prepay all transportation charges, obtaining a receipt for the amount, which they could include in their account, and attach the receipt. It is noted that the cost of the repairs will be approximately $120 and the transportation charges, $40. It is hoped, as this is an unforeseen expenditure, that the cost will not exceed your estimate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. R. L.

The\nreadings on the switch board charging were Amperes 10, Watts 112.\nThe generator was cool and all connections tight and cool.\n\nAfter an hour's run at 10.30 the readings were Amperes\n10 Volts 121. The generator commutator was luke-warm Armature\ncool, field coils cool. At 10.35 the readings were the same.\n\nThe readings at 11.35 were Amperes 25 Volts 135\ngenerator luke-warm Armature luke-warm field coils luke-warm.\nAll connections tight and cool.\n\nThe readings at 11.40 were the same as at 11.35.\nAt 12.40 the readings were Amperes 45 Volts 145 Generator\ncommutator was warm, the armature warm and field coils very\nwarm. All connections were tight and cool.\n\nOur volt meter I tested on the town plant and it\nappears in good condition.\n\nIf the generator is wound to stand the above readings,\nwill the 110 volts storage batteries and the different motors\nstand the strain. All the connections are as when the plant was\nfirst installed.\n\nI beg to be given the authority to use the said gen-\nerator, as I do not feel that I should take the responsibility to\nrun it in this condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. Frank Doll\n(Engineer)\nSgd. Rev. Fr. Jeannotte\n(Principal)\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOn October 31st, 1935, your Mr. Montgomery wrote Mr. Morrison, then of this office, advising him that he had just returned from a trip to the Muscowequan Indian Residential School at Lestock and had over-hauled their Lister Generating plant.\n\nMr. Montgomery is no doubt quite familiar with this plant and I therefore wish to place this matter before him for his opinion and recommendations.\n\nWe have had considerable trouble and expense in connection with this plant and wish to arrive at some solution to the question. In December, 1934, this generator burned out and had to be re-wound at quite an expense and again in January of this year at a cost of $160.00. I am today in receipt of a report from the Engineer at the school, stating that the generator is apparently running too hot and may again burn out. I am enclosing a copy of the Engineer's report.\n\nIn your letter referred to you state that \"no doubt if rheostats were installed they would eliminate the difficulty experienced with regulations of voltage, if the speed of the engine was not altered at the governor, as the light load varied\". Do you consider that the installation of rheostats will eliminate our trouble? I shall be glad if you will please write the Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa direct, giving them your views, forwarding me a copy of your letter, setting out the type of rheostat required and cost F.O.B.

Robertson, D.D.S.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 22nd, 1937.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 5th, which we must apologize for not answering previously, due to Mr. Montgomery being out of town. The writer has discussed the situation with him on his return in order to get the complete picture and history.\n\nApparently the work done by Mr. Montgomery was subsequent to the first rewind but prior to the second rewind, and since this rewind job was done external to our firm, it is of course impossible for us to take any responsibility for it. Providing, however, that this was carried out satisfactorily both from a point of view of workmanship and material put into it, the Generator should operate entirely satisfactorily.\n\nThe report of the Engineer and Principal at Lestock dated January 28th appears to be in order and just what we would expect to happen. Both Battery and Generator would be designed for a voltage around 150 or 180 volts.\n\nYour letter states that the Plant is apparently running too hot and may burn out again. However, from the Engineer's report it would appear that the Generator is running fairly cool and in this connection it should be borne in mind that a Generator has a temperature rise of 72 deg. F. over and above the surrounding atmosphere, so that if the atmospheric temperature of the room is 70 deg. F. then 70 plus 72 is 142 deg.

He had not operated the big engine all winter; he was waiting to get these appliances, however, in view of the opinion expressed by the Mumford, Medland Limited I told him to use the plant but to be careful and watch it when in operation.\n\nYou may not know it so I will give you more history of this plant. At one time it was the plant used at the big school near Edmonton; it was taken out and stored away. I heard the school got the high power or some other means of obtaining electricity, it may have been giving trouble at that time for anything I know. They about six years ago it was sent here and put in the Muscowequan School and has been giving trouble ever since.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos Robertson, D.D.S.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to report upon the lighting plant at the Muscowequan Residential School, Touchwood Agency.\n\nIn 1931 the Lister lighting plant formerly in use at the Edmonton Residential School was transferred and installed in the Muscowequan School. It is a 6 K.W. plant. Since its installation it is reported that it has never given satisfactory service. In December, 1934, the generator burned out and again this past winter at an expense of $160.00. There has been considerable correspondence between this office, the Mumford, Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, (Agents for the Lister equipment), the Magneto Service Station, and the Engineer at the School as to whether or not the installation of rheostats would eliminate some of the trouble. At the present time the 6 K.W. plant is not being used, as the Engineer is afraid of the generator again burning out, and they have a small 3 K.W. plant there which they are using. I am enclosing herewith a letter received from Mr. Waddy today in this connection.\n\nThe Mumford, Medland, Limited have not inspected this plant since the generator was rewound this winter and are therefore not in a position to state whether the rheostats would be of benefit. Would it be in order for me to have their Inspector visit the Muscowequan School if he is near Lestock in the near future?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 312-11A R.C. of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the lighting plant at the Muscovequan Indian Residential School.

Five of the children are sitting at small tables quite unsuitable.\n\nIf front desks are supplied for the front row of seats it would overcome this trouble. We require the following:\nTwo #5 front desks.\nThree #4 \"\nTwo #3 \"\n\nThis class room also requires more blackboard space as noted in my letter of Nov 15th last, 30 feet X three and a half feet, complete with chalk trough and trim, shipped to the Principal at Lestock, Sask.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nWINNIPEG, January 10, 1937.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Mother Superior of the Lestock Indian Residential School in which she states that the stocking knitting machine which the school has is completely out of order and too old to be repaired. If it is the policy of the Department to supply such knitting machines to Residential Schools, I would appreciate your sending one to Lestock. The Mother Superior informs me that in view of the great utility of this knitting machine she would forego, for the time being, the \"tailor\" machine which has been promised the School in return for a knitting machine.\n\nIt may be said that knitting machines will not be provided our Indian girls on the reserves after they leave the School and that, therefore, they should not be supplied to Boarding Schools and that the girls should rather be taught how to knit. The argument has, no doubt, a great deal of value. On the other hand, it must be remembered that it would be too great a burden to impose on the School girls to ask them to knit stockings for a staff and pupilage of over 100 individuals. In any case I am leaving the decision in your own hands and will be quite satisfied whatever it may be.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir;\n\nI beg to advise that the principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School is asking when the Department will contract a new laundry. This matter has been under consideration for years, and the principal is under that impression that it is to be built this season. He has already hauled the sand and gravel for the foundation.\n\nWill you kindly advise if it is the Department's intention to build this year, it is certainly badly needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\n266 Holmwood,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing Plans for the proposed laundry building for the Lestock School. Mr. Hoey expressed the opinion that it might be better to put up a separate building for this purpose, but the Sisters in charge of the school refuse to listen to this plan; and you know what women are like! You can refuse a request of theirs for a short time, but in the end they always win out. That is what happened at Lestock. In order to satisfy the Sisters, and possibly their viewpoint is the right one, we shall have to build the laundry alongside of the school, on the East side of the chapel. If I remember well, it will be very convenient on account of the proximity of the boiler room and the soft water cistern. The reason I am sending you the Plans at home is that I would like you to break the news gently to Mr. Hoey so that we may not meet with any opposition on his part.\n\nIn view of the fact that the estimates may not be voted before June, and that considerable time might elapse after they are voted before we can proceed with the construction of this new laundry, Very Reverend Father Lamontagne suggests going ahead with the building as soon as the ground has thawed out and advance the money out of the Provincial funds, and have the Department pay the accounts after the Indian estimates have been passed by the House. I did not want to send my letter directly to the Department for fear that it might get in the hands of some of the higher officials and from there into the hands of the Engineers' Dept.; if that happened you know what would be the consequences as far as the laundry building is concerned: It would not see the light of day before 1939. I hope that you will do all you can to meet with the wishes of Very Reverend Father Lamontagne.\n\nWe are all extremely pleased in our Oblate circles with the appointment of Very Rev. Father Langlois to the See of Grouard. He knows the Indian problem better than most, and his permanent presence on our Committee will be a great source of strength for us all.\n\nWith renewed thanks and good wishes, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 4)\nOttawa,\nApril 14, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to the accounts which you left with me, and also those which you recently sent to me, I may say that as far as I know at the present time I will be able to have all of them paid with the exception of the enclosed two. Under the circumstances I consider that you will feel satisfied.\n\nI am sorry that it was not possible to arrange for the paint which you suggested. There were a number of unexpected demands on our appropriation in the last month and our total Vote was exhausted. As a matter of fact we had to secure a transfer from the Welfare Vote in order to clear up the old year.\n\nMight I again point out the importance of your drawing the attention of the Principals to the recent regulations issued in connection with purchases. I cannot see how we can pay accounts for purchases made by the Principals. All requests will have to be forwarded here and if funds are available the purchases will be made through the Purchasing Branch. I feel certain that you will appreciate our position in the matter.\n\nI also received your letter regarding Muscowequan and will take it up with Mr. Hoey early next week. We will do our best to meet your wishes but in the meantime the Principal should not incur any expense for which he wishes us to pay.\n\nWith best wishes for Easter and with kind regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 28, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nMr. Phelan and I have carefully considered your letter of the 9th instant, also the plans which you forwarded for the proposed laundry building at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are obliged to consult the Surveys and Engineering Branch with regard to all construction of this nature. This does not mean that the work would be done under their direction. If we have a good proposal to submit to them, it is quite likely that they would not insist on supervising.\n\nHave you received any estimate of the cost of erecting a laundry building in the manner shown on the blue print which you forwarded to me?\n\nIf possible, you should state the approximate cost of the material and the approximate cost of the labour to carry out the work in the manner which you have apparently considered.\n\nAs I previously informed you, the amount of $2,500.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Muscowequan School, and our appropriation is so controlled this year that it will be impossible to provide any larger amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

He has already run the cement for the floor and walls and has on the ground a lot of hollow tile for the walls of the superstructure, quite a big job.\n\n\"He told me some time ago he could not wait any longer for the building as the health of the staff and pupils was suffering under the conditions existing at the school, this was correct.\n\n\"I thought it best to let you know what is going on as no doubt the Department will be asked to refund the cost of this building.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Saskatchewan.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO. 312-11A RC\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs/Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFather Poulin, O.M.I., who is looking after the Muscowequan School during the absence of the Principal who is on holidays, called on me yesterday and informed me that the roof of the school was leaking in several places and should be repaired. The Father was accompanied by a Brother Gauthier who is a competent builder. They informed me that within a week or ten days they were taking men from Regina to put the roof on the Laundry they are building, and asked authority to have the roof of the school repaired while these men were there, as it could then be done at a much lower cost.\n\nI questioned Brother Gauthier as to its necessity and cost. He informed me that the roof started to leak this Spring. Water comes through the plaster and drops on the floor when it rains, and he states that there will be considerable damage done to the plaster unless the roof is repaired. With regard to the cost, he stated that it would be impossible to give a definite figure as the work necessary could not be ascertained until the repairs were under way. He stated, however, that he did not think it would be in excess of $50.00.\n\nThey also took up the matter of the necessity for a drier for drying clothes being supplied for the Laundry. The Brother stated that the driers in general use were very expensive, costing in the neighbourhood of $1800.00, but that there was a drier being manufactured in Winnipeg under the name of the \"Utility Drier\" which would serve the purpose and which could be purchased at a cost of $700.00. He asked that this drier be supplied to the school.\n\nI would recommend that authority be given for the repairs to this roof at the earliest possible date in order that the work may be done while the men are there. With regard to the drier, there is no doubt that it is necessary, and I would recommend that it be given consideration if funds are available.\n\nI might state further that Father Poulin brought me a letter from Mr. Waddy, Agent, covering this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Saskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant you may authorize an expenditure not exceeding $50.00 in repairing the roof of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nI have noted the information contained in the third and fourth paragraphs of your letter regarding a drier for drying the clothes in the laundry at this school. Until we are aware of the exact claim that the school authorities will likely make on the Department toward the cost of the new laundry building which they are erecting we are not in a position to decide if our funds will permit the purchase of a drier. The request of the Principal for this machine will be kept in mind and considered later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nRef: Your 121-5-5 of July 27th,\nRepairs, Roof, Muscowequan Residential School.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Waddy advising that the A.B.O. Heating and Plumbing Company, Regina, who were doing the work on the new laundry at the School, made the repairs authorized in the latter above referred to. These repairs, he states, were mostly on the garage and chapel. Mr. Waddy proceeds as follows:\n\n\"To-day the Principal asked me to go to the school as we had heavy rain here yesterday and a number of leaks developed in the roof of the main building. I went to the school to-day and went right up on top with Mr. Wilks of the roofing company. In many places on the roof of the main building and the two large dormitories the material is curled up, pulled away from the building walls proper, leaving a space for rain to get through. The asphalt has run with the heat, the roof looks like an elephant's hide, all ridges and hollows. There are a lot of leaks in it, and around the walls and drains the roofing material is gone.\n\n\"I told Mr. Wilks to measure the place up, make out a report of what is required and let you have it when he gets back to Regina in a day or so. It looks like a $1300.00 job so I am not acting as an expert on it, the Department probably will send an architect before making a decision on a job this size. All I can say is that the roof is in a bad mess and should be fixed or re-roofed.\n\n\"The specifications of the original roof are enclosed, you will note the roof was guaranteed for five years. This time is up.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\n.....It is eight years....\nIt is eight years since built.\"\n\nI am attaching specifications referred to above and would recommend that the Provincial architect be asked to submit a report on this roof.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Mr. Waddie, Agent requested us to report to you regarding the state of repair of the roofs of the main building.\n\nWhile our men were inspecting and making repairs to various roofs at the School, we attended and inspected or Mr. Waddie's request to the roof of the main building. The three roofs show many leaks which can be overcome only by the installation of a new roof. In some instances the present roofing materials have left the roof boards bare. As the roof now stands the snow and rain will cause expensive damage to the plaster and decoration below.\n\nWe here quote the sum of $1996.56 for the installation of a 20 year smooth surfaced asphalt roof. This main roof consists of the center three storey section and the two two storey sections.\n\nThis quotation includes the installation of galvanized corrugated so installed as to convey the roof waters clear of the brick walls and properly on to the lower roofs, preventing further existing damage. The present roofing (tar and gravel) is to be removed by us.\n\nThe School is to provide accommodation for our men during the time required to make installations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.B.C.

Their representative claims that it would be impossible to repair this roof by patching, as it is all raised up and broken, and you can take hold of it anywhere and tear it off. He also points out that the brick walls are becoming damaged by the water running down, and claims that considerable damage has been done to the ceilings through melting of snow in Winter.\n\nI notice Mr. Waddy has allowed only one thousand dollars in his Estimates for repairs to that school for the coming year. If the money is not available to have this work done this Fall, the Estimates should be amended to allow for it next season.\n\nIn submitting this offer I might point out that I do not know anything about these people except that they do the repair work for the school, and being on the ground were asked by Mr. Waddy to submit a report.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

In view of the information contained in your letter it is evident that the amount available in the current year's appropriation for the Muscowequan school will be totally required to provide the cost of a laundry. Under these circumstances it will not be possible to provide funds for a new roof about which you reported in your letter of September 20. When preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 consideration will be given to providing an item to cover this expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nREPORT re: REPAIRS TO ROOF\n\nMUSCOGEQUAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nLestock, Saskatchewan\n\nThe roof of the Muscogequan Indian Residential School was inspected on September 24th, 1938, and I found the following conditions:\n\nThe roof on the main building and the two large dormitories is in poor condition, which will require replacement. The roof on the powerhouse, though somewhat better in appearance, has also several leaks through which water finds its way and in turn has caused cracks to develop in the ceiling from the interior. The roof on the chapel is also in a similar condition and will require repairs.\n\nThe roof on the garage and approximately one-third of the area on the bakery has been repaired this year with an application of new asphalt and repairs to flashing at the walls. However, if the flashing acts as it has done on the main building, this repair work may be only considered temporary. The enclosed photograph taken during the inspection clearly shows what has taken place.\n\nThe flashing at the walls is in very poor condition. Much of the solder at the seams is gone, leaving open joints; and in many places the flashing has pulled out of the wall, allowing water to get in between the flashing and the brick wall. Due to the fact that this flashing has only a 3/4\" face set in the wall, this is not of sufficient width to be held by the mortar.\n\nAt these sections of the roof, where the flashing has pulled out, ridges and hollows have formed in the roofing after movement had taken place down towards the drains. At these portions of the roof in particular some of the tar and gravel has been lost, requiring replacement of the roofing.\n\nIt appears that some of the water flowing between the wall and the flashing soaks underneath the roofing felt, causing the formation of the ridges and hollows in it. Furthermore it may be said that the cause of the roof damage is due to the flashing pulling out of the walls. To substantiate this it was noticed that at sections where the flashing is intact and still held in the wall the roofing surface is in much better condition, with no wrinkles in it. On the other hand where the flashing is no longer serving the purpose much damage to the roofing has been done.\n\nThe drains are in good condition and will not require much repair, with the exception of providing new copper wire screens and gravel stops.\n\nTo properly repair the roof, new roofing felt and asphalt should be put on the whole roof, replacing the present one, as it does not seem possible that only portions of the roof could be replaced to have a waterproof and durable surface.\n\nTo prevent a similar re-occurrence in the roofing, however, new flashing, with a wider face embedded in the brick mortar, should be used. The enclosed sketch shows a suggested type of flashing to be used. A 4\" bearing surface should be provided as the wall is 6\" wide, built of two rows of bricks, which will permit this change. The mortar can be chipped out with a special...\nwith a special tool and, after the new flashing is set, new mortar will be well tamped in. This new flashing should stand up. All flashing seams should be locked and soldered from the outside. The felt roofing should be laid as per original specifications. However a 2\" x 4\" cut diagonally into a wedge and laid as shown on the sketch should be used as at present only a ship lap set an angle to the sheathing supports the ends of the roofing felt.\n\nThe following is an estimated cost of replacing the roofing on the various portions of the building:\n\n(1) Main Building and the two Dormitories\n\nMaterials\n\n- 15\u00a2 roofing felt ........................................ $290.00\n- Asphalt .................................................. $296.40\n- G.I. Flashing ........................................... $97.00\n- Cement, nails, etc. ..................................... $50.00\n- Freighting ................................................ $25.00\n\nLabour\n\n- Taking present roofing, flashing, etc. off ......................... $78.00\n- Laying new roofing, setting flashing, soldering .................... $500.00\n- Contingencies ........................................... $162.60\n\nTotal ............... $1500.00\n\n(2) Power House\n\nMaterials\n\n- 15\u00a2 roofing felt ........................................... $25.00\n- Asphalt .................................................. $23.50\n- G.I. Flashing ........................................... $15.50\n- Cement, nails, etc. ..................................... $8.00\n\nLabour\n\n- Taking present roofing, flashing, etc. off ......................... $9.60\n- Laying new roofing, setting flashing, soldering .................... $38.50\n- Contingencies ........................................... $34.10\n\nTotal ............... $150.00\n\n(3) Chapel\n\nMaterials\n\n- 15\u00a2 roofing felt ........................................... $1.00\n- Asphalt .................................................. $2.50\n- G.I. Flashing ........................................... $1.50\n- Cement, nails, etc. ..................................... $15.00\n- Freighting ................................................ $10.00\n\nCarry forward .. $220.10\n(3) Chapel (Cont'd)\n\nBrought forward $250.10\n\nLabour\n\nTaking present roofing, flashing, etc. off ........................................... 25.00\nLaying new roofing, setting flashing soldering ........................................... 143.00\nContingencies .................................................. 61.90\n\n$450.00\n\n(4) Garage\n\nMaterial\n\nG.I. Flashing .............................................. 6.00\nCement, solder, etc. ......................... 2.00\n\nLabour\n\nTaking 40 lin.ft. of old flashing out and replacing with new one ............ 7.20\n\n$ 15.20\n\nNote:- The garage roof was repaired this year, as already mentioned, new asphalt being applied to the surface, but the same flashing was left in. The flashing was set into the wall with new mortar; however it is anticipated that in time it will pull out as it has done in other places having only the 3/4\" face set in mortar and water will find its way along the wall. This may in time damage the roofing and the newly applied asphalt. Therefore the flashing should be replaced with new one of the type already described.\n\nThe total estimated cost of replacing the above roofs is $8115.80.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that this is quite late in the season and cold weather has been experienced, it is felt that a job of this size could not be attempted this year, especially the application of asphalt. There would be no danger in leaving the re-roofing till next year, provided temporary repairs to the present flashing were done.\n\nThe following estimated cost is for minor repairs to the flashing this fall:-\n\nMaterial\n\nCement, etc. ............................................. $ 5.00\n\nLabour\n\nSetting flashing in place and cementing it .................. 15.00\n\n$20.00\nOctober 22nd, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Dr. McGill\n\nRe: Repairs to roof, Muscowequan Indian Residential School, Lestock, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn accordance with a request of the Acting Director of Indian Affairs dated the 2nd September Mr. Dempster, our Engineer at Prince Albert National Park, inspected the roof of the above school, and a copy of Mr. Dempster's report is enclosed. It will be noted that the total estimated cost of work required on the roofs of the four buildings, is \u00a32115.20; that on account of the lateness of the season Mr. Dempster does not recommend that this work be done this fall, but states that minor repairs to the flashing, estimated to cost \u00a320.00, should be done, the remainder of the work being left over until next year.\n\nA photographic print and a blue print are attached indicating the conditions and the work required.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of July 21 and August 29 with reference to the roof of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a report from Mr. Dempster who recently visited the school and inspected the roof. He states that extensive repairs will have to be made in the near future but owing to the lateness of the season he recommends that only minor repairs to the flashing be done at the present time.

J. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nMUSCOWEQUAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nLestock,\nSask.\n\nFeb. 17th, 1939.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter regarding the Lestock School Laundry.\n\nA word of explanation, regarding the laundry building which we have just erected, may be in order and may help to clear the atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty which has prevailed in Ottawa, regarding its necessity as well as regarding its cost.\n\nThe Lestock or Muscowequan School was erected by the Department in 1929-30. It is a very substantial building and fully answers the purpose for which it was erected. For reasons I do not know no laundry quarters were provided in the new building. The machinery then in use was housed in the old school building and, to a certain extent, this arrangement was satisfactory; at least the school authorities did not lodge any formal complaints with the Department. Unfortunately, the old school building was destroyed by fire in 1931 and the laundry quarters were, of course, destroyed at the same time. A formal request was immediately placed before the Department for a building suitable for laundry purposes. The request was totally ignored although the ordinary phrase used in such circumstances was made use of, i.e. favourable consideration was promised the request. In the meantime what laundry machinery could be procured were housed in an old chicken house which had been discarded because it was deemed unfit for chickens. It was temporarily and very inadequately repaired and served the purpose of a laundry until our new laundry was put into operation last September. This old building was so unfit for the purpose for which it was used that one of the Sisters on the school staff contracted tuberculosis from repeated attacks of the grippe contracted during her work in the laundry and several of the girl pupils were seriously ill at different periods during the time this building was in use. The Reverend Sister has had to be confined to a sanatorium and is still under treatment.\nThe above facts are recited to explain to some degree the haste that took place last spring when it was understood that it was the intention of the Department to provide funds for the construction of the laundry. While your present purchasing system may have some advantages, it has a very decided tendency to delay receipt of purchases made through this system. I was afraid that this would happen in the case of the Lestock School laundry, so I took the bull by the horns and as soon as I was informed that it was your intention to provide funds for this project I went ahead, bought the materials, hired workmen and proceeded with erection of the building. As a consequence by the end of August, the laundry was fully completed, a real good job had been made of it, the laundry machinery was installed, and everything was in first order for the beginning of the school year. Had I waited for your system to get into motion I am inclined to feel that supplies would not have arrived in time to permit the building being erected in the fine weather -- which I feel you will admit is most desirable in Western Canada.

(RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe above facts are recited to explain to some degree the haste that took place last spring when it was understood that it was the intention of the Department to provide funds for the construction of the laundry. While your present purchasing system may have some advantages it has a very decided tendency to delay receipt of purchases made through this system. I was afraid that this would happen in the case of the Lestock School Laundry, so I took the bull by the horns and as soon as I was informed that it was your intention to provide funds for this project I went ahead, bought the materials, hired workmen and proceeded with erection of the building. As a consequence by the end of August, the laundry was fully completed, a real good job had been made of it, the laundry machinery was installed, and everything was in first order for the beginning of the school year. Had I waited for your system to get into motion I am inclined to feel that supplies would not have arrived in time to permit the building being erected in the fine weather\u2014which I feel you will admit is most desirable in Western Canada. I think that in acting as I did I rendered the Department real service and I should be blamed but rather congratulated for my quick and decisive action.\n\nThe laundry, which I have put up conforms in every respect to the fine school building which your Department erected; it is fireproof, well lighted, well ventilated and I doubt if your Engineers' Department could have done as well. They certainly could not have put up the building for the amount which I spent. For instance, the supervisor, a first class mechanic, received only $15.00 per week, the bricklayer received the same rate of pay and all the common labour was done by the old boys of the school assisted by some former pupils.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter regarding the Lestock School Laundry:\n\nA word of explanation, regarding the laundry building which we have just erected may be in order and may help to clear the atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty which has prevailed in Ottawa regarding its necessity as well as regarding its cost.\n\nThe Lestock or Muscowequan School was erected by the Department in 1929-30. It is a very substantial building and fully answers the purpose for which it was erected. For reasons I do not know no laundry quarters were provided in the new building. The machinery then in use was housed in the old school building and, to a certain extent, this arrangement was satisfactory; at least the school authorities did not lodge any formal complaints with the Department. Unfortunately, the old school building was destroyed by fire in 1931 and the laundry quarters were, of course, destroyed at the same time. A formal request was immediately placed before the Department for a building suitable for laundry purposes. The request was totally ignored although the ordinary phrase used in such circumstances was made use of, i.e., favourable consideration was promised the request. In the meantime what laundry machinery could be procured were housed in an old chicken house which had been discarded because it was deemed unfit for chickens. It was temporarily and very inadequately repaired and served the purpose of a laundry until our new laundry was put into operation last September. This old building was so unfit for the purpose for which it was used that one of the Sisters on the school staff contracted tuberculosis from repeated attacks of the grippe contracted during her work in the laundry and several of the girl pupils were seriously ill at different periods during the time this building was in use. The Reverend Sister has had to be confined to a sanatorium and is still under treatment.\nWESTERN STEEL PRODUCTS,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nCRANE LIMITED,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\n$189.53\n23.14\n185.07\n13.89\n84.65\n1.92\n2.88\n7.59\n16.38\n9.00\n3.61\n5.25\n28.12\n1.22\n\nCredit notes $9.11\n13.54\n\n538.19\n22.65\n\n515.54\n\nFREIGHT BILLS\n\n50.90\n\nWAGES AS PER PAYLISTS\n\n813.15\n\nTOTAL $4,171.87\n| Company                                      | Amount   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|\n| CANADIAN GENERAL ELECTRIC CO., Winnipeg, Man.| $14.13   |\n|                                             | $56.84   |\n|                                             | $8.56    |\n|                                             | $17.56   |\n|                                             | $4.08    |\n|                                             | $.97     |\n|                                             | $1.78    |\n|                                             | $7.43    |\n|                                             | $9.41    |\n|                                             | $2.83    |\n|                                             | $2.53    |\n|                                             | **$126.17** |\n\n| CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE CO., Winnipeg, Man. |          |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                             | $102.20  |\n|                                             | $21.40   |\n|                                             | $46.46   |\n|                                             | $4.23    |\n|                                             | $1.96    |\n|                                             | $1.25    |\n|                                             | **$257.50** |\n| Credit note                                 | $1.96    |\n|                                             | **$255.54** |\n| Paid by Principal                           | $20.90   |\n|                                             | **$276.44** |\n\n| J.H.

Flourde, O.M.I., fully discussed with officials in the Minister's office the method followed in the erection of this laundry.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe - New laundry, Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nI am returning herewith copy of your memorandum of the 22nd ultimo. The Minister has approved of this expenditure. Referring to the last paragraph, Father Plourde only discussed this matter with me recently. We did not approve of what was done prior to the time the work started.\n\nEnclosure (1).\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n## To The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co.

Ironer in the amount of $150.00 which was delivered to this institution on September 15th, 1938.\n\nWe were advised by the Rev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., that this account was to be paid by the Department of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch and he requested us to write to you personally as he implied that you were conversant with this particular transaction and that we would receive payment of this account from your Department, in due course.\n\nUp to the present time we have not received any advise from you in connection with this matter, nor have we received a remittance from your Department to cover this account.\n\nHowever, may we hear from you as to when we can expect payment of this account and in the event that our invoice has not been passed by your Department, we would ask you to kindly notify us in order that we shall be able to make the necessary arrangements for the payment of this account from the Oblate Catholic Indian Missions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHARRISONS & CROSFIELD, PATTERSON, FRASER LTD.\n\nL.

You may purchase 700 lin. ft. No. 8 weather-proofed wire which can be secured at a cost not exceeding $25.00. You may also purchase 13 sacks cement, 150 lbs. lime and 12 lbs. plaster at a cost not exceeding the estimate given by the Reliance Lumber Company; namely, $18.00.\n\nIt is noted that there will be an expenditure not exceeding $20.00 for the wages for the plasterer.\n\nArrangements are also being made to have our Purchasing Agent secure the 12 beds.\n\nThe total amount provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school for the current fiscal year is $600.00 and when we have completed the purchases mentioned in this letter there will be a very small amount left. However, there will no doubt be sufficient to pay for the pump cylinder which you state you have ordered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. W.

Just after he spoke to me the principal was admitted to hospital in St. Boniface with typhoid and it is probable that he never wrote about the mattresses.\n\nAs I know it was his intention to write will you please consider the matter and if possible arrange that the school be supplied with 12 mattresses for the beds. You will know the size from the beds ordered, I think they are six foot by thirty inches, but not certain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAugust 28, 1939\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Muscowequan Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 18-415\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

It is noted that the cost of the repairs will probably amount to $500.00. You may have the necessary work done immediately.\n\nPlease give the matter your personal supervision with a view to keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been asked by Rev. Father Jeannotte, Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, who is now in the St. Boniface Hospital recuperating from an attack of typhoid fever, to acknowledge your letter addressed to him and dated September 12, 1939. Father Jeannotte informs me that the refrigeration system which was installed in the school by the Department is in operation, but that ice is used for refrigeration instead of the ice-making machine. The reason for this is that there is no electrical service in that district and that electricity is generated by a gasoline engine which it is too expensive to operate in conjunction with a refrigeration plant.\n\nThe outbreak of typhoid fever which took place in the school could hardly have been caused by the use of ice in the refrigerator as no food, butter or milk comes in direct contact with the ice. It has been well established by the medical authorities of the province of Saskatchewan that this outbreak of typhoid fever was caused by drinking ice water made with ice taken from a slough, the water of which was found upon analysis to be infected with typhoid germs.\n\nAll the ice which was left in the ice house, after its analysis had proven it to be affected, was thrown away and no more ice will naturally be taken from the infected slough. Next winter the ice for the school will be taken out of a nearby lake, the water of which, I am informed has been analysed and found to be free of all germs.\nShould the province of Saskatchewan extend its hydro service along the highway into the village of Lestock, it is to be hoped that the Department will agree to install it in the school so that the present refrigeration plant may be put in use.\n\nHoping that the above explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would ask you to bear in mind that the Muscowequan School is a Government-owned institution, that all the furniture and equipment were supplied by your Department. The frigidaire is therefore your property. You may have no record of it but we know for sure that we did not purchase it, much less did we pay for it.

This matter is being taken up with the Surveys & Engineering Branch and on receipt of their reply you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. Thos.

It is stated that the motor overheats to a point where the water in the system is changed into steam. The school engineer does not feel sufficiently competent to take charge of the necessary repairs as the mechanism of this frigidaire is sealed and apparently only experts can undertake repairs.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would make further inquiries regarding the repairs required to the frigidaire and let me know the approximate cost of having it fixed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

We wrote to Indian Agent Waddy and I enclose for your information a copy of his reply, also a sketch which he forwarded.\n\nNo doubt you have the original plan of this building and I should appreciate your advising if you consider that the window could be installed and give any other information that might be useful for our agent.\n\nDirector.\nPunnichy, Sask.\nApril 9, 1940.\n\nDear Sir;\u2014 Last summer when making up the estimates the principal at Muscowequan School was in the hospital and I could not consult with him as to what he had in mind for improvements this year. I therefore placed an item of $1,000.00 in the 1940-41 estimates under this heading.\n\nThe principal now writes me and requests consideration for following construction or repairs at Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\n| Material       | Gravel | Labor | Total   |\n|----------------|--------|-------|---------|\n| Ice house      | 524.70 | 16.50 | 129.75  | 670.95 |\n| Granary        | 1135.90| 12.75 | 185.50  | 1334.15|\n| Silo shed      | 131.35 |       | 25.00   | 156.35 |\n| Cesspool at barn | 253.10| 11.25 | 95.00   | 359.35 |\n| Floor for cattle shed | 269.10| 27.75 | 52.00   | 348.85 |\n\nHe also asks for $15.00 material for fixing roof, this must be tar product.\n\nI have full details here of the lumber and material, and if you consider that you could allow any of above items I will have the list prepared so you could ask for tenders.\n\nHis idea of a granary is much more elaborate than anything I use on a reserve. He was told to use his refrigerating plant last summer, there is an up-to-date plant right in the school.\n\nThe cesspool at the barn is actually very necessary, so is the roof material, and the floor for the cattle sheds is required.\n\nAs I know how you are fixed for funds we will get along with what you allow at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is hoped that an amount of $800.00 will be available for this purpose, but a definite assurance in this regard cannot be given until our estimates are presented to Parliament.\n\nThe amount requested by the Principal approximates $2,900 and consequently, from the information contained in the first part of this letter, you will realize that only the most necessary work can be considered this year. You are aware of present conditions and it is of the utmost importance that those in charge of our Indian schools maintain a sense of proportion and request only the repairs and improvements that are absolutely essential.\n\nIn order to save time, you might forward details of the lumber and material required for the necessary repairs at this school, keeping in mind that the amount that the Department can allow this year will not exceed $800.00 and may possibly be less.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

The information shown on this drawing is based upon the original plans of this building.\n\nRegarding the number of windows required, it is assumed from the information and plan submitted by the Indian Agent, that additional windows are required because the existing windows adjacent to the area marked 'A' on the drawing have been cut off from the classroom by the installation of a partition at 'B'. Under such circumstances, it is considered that the provision of two new windows would be sufficient for the resultant classroom, and would allow installation of windows of the same size and in the same manner as those already in the building.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 29 addressed to the late Inspector Robertson with reference to extra lighting for the junior room at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School I enclose copy of memorandum received from the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, also a blueprint prepared by that Branch.\n\nIn connection with repairs and improvements at the Muscowequan School I would refer you to official letters of the 17th and 27th ultimo in which you were informed regarding the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school.

Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nMuscowequan Indian School continued.\n\nThe reason we believe that this would give satisfactory results is due to the type of service before mentioned and also the fact that the box is insulated with 4 inches of cork, has only one door and only one side exposed to the kitchen temperature, in addition the box is located in the basement which has a lower room temperature than a ground floor location.\n\nWe have used the word recommendation at the beginning of this paragraph, we should have said suggestion as we are sure you will realize that in order to make a definite recommendation, we would have to go into the matter more fully than we have done up to the present, however on our visit to the school we took all the data and figures necessary and will be glad to submit a definite proposition to you if you so desire.\n\nTrusting that the above, while of a somewhat general character will be sufficient for you to give further consideration to the matter, however if there is any other information which you require please write us.\n\nYours truly,\nChapman Electric Co., Ltd.\n\nP.S.\n\nWe should have mentioned that we have been continuously in the refrigeration business for the last twelve years during which time we have sold, serviced and installed all types of equipment as well as all makes.\nMr. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you we have made an inspection of the refrigeration equipment at the above school, and beg a report as follows:\n\nThis installation was originally automatic in operation and as the power units in the powerhouse are also automatic it meant that when the one-half power motor operating the refrigeration compressor was cut in by the automatic valve, it automatically started the operation of the smallest of the gas engines units, which I believe is a 6 hp. (am not absolutely certain on this size so perhaps it had better be checked) with the consequence that during the day at least this gas engine would be running for no other purpose than to supply current to the one-half hp. motor on the compressor; naturally this would put the monthly costs rather high, in fact too high, we believe to be warranted.\n\nOur recommendation is that the automatic feature of this installation be discontinued, and that the one-half motor be supplied or operated either by a small gas generator or a small gas engine of the required size. It will of course be possible to retain the automatic features if an automatic gas operated generator is installed, however we doubt very much if the retaining of automatic operation is of any great importance due to the fact that the walk-in box is not in constant use all day as it is in say a restaurant, our idea is that with a small individual plant manually operated this could be run during the preparation and serving of each meal and the hold over in the urine tanks should be sufficient (except in very hot weather) to take care of the food properly in between these runs, the only other run would be the night run at from 9 to ten o'clock.\n\nAuthorized\nHome Appliance Dealer\n\nIndian Affairs.

My figures indicate that it should have a 3/4 hp motor and not less than twice the present brine tank capacity with this set up the following operation would be necessary six hours in the morning and six hours in the late evening say from five to eleven. I did not go into the job as fully at first as I just assumed that it originally gave proper results, and now I am wondering, however I may be wrong and of course you will know.\n\nIn view of the above do you think my letter dated yesterday should go forward to Ottawa or should we submit another proposal? That will depend of course on what sort of a job was done before by the unit, and how long it ran. Perhaps it may be as well to let it go forward and in this way open the matter up and if we get the go-ahead signal we can then submit a more detailed proposition. The only objection to this is that Ottawa may take from the letter already sent you that we propose to use the existing compressor (although we do not say so definitely) while if my figures are correct as given above, we may have to state in our subsequent proposals (if any) that the capacity of the equipment would have to be increased, which might not sit well on their minds in the least. However as we say this all hinges on whether or not it was originally satisfactory, if it was, then the suggestions we have made are in order.\n\nI will be glad to hear from you as to what you think.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nRe letter 121-5-5 of April 8th last about frigidaire plant at Muscowequan Indian Residential School you say you were informed that the motor overheats to a point where the water in the system is changed into steam etc.\n\nOn making enquiry into this matter I feel you must have been misinformed, in fact when you read the enclosed report you may think you are reading about some other place, there is no motor there at all, how could it heat?\n\nHere is part of the report.\n\nSome years ago the principal found that the cost of running the frigidaire plant was too high, the little motor at the frigidaire place was very small, but to start it running the large gasoline lighting plant had to start up, it turned on automatically. Therefore whenever the door of the frigidaire room was opened on went the plant.\n\nThe principal therefore disconnected the electric part and put the brine tank out of commission, he placed an ordinary tank in the room used for refrigeration and kept it full of ice, not very satisfactory but cheaper than the other system. This kept on till last year when the ice was contaminated and the staff got typhoid; the plant is still using the ice system.\n\nI had two inspections made here by Mr. Chapman of the Chapman Electric Co. Ltd. of Yorkton, Sask., he made the inspections when he was in the district. I told him I had no money to spend but to look the place over and then give me a short report and if you thought fit he might be authorised to make full report of cost of starting the place going again, and might get the work, but that I could promise nothing.\n\nNow about that heating motor. That is good. Some time ago the principal had a man working on the laundry or some other work; the man saw the motor\u2014\u00bd horse power\u2014said he would like it, and he got it. Simple as that. The principal gave it to him. The motor is missing altogether.\n\nTo make a long story short, this place needs a small gas engine to run a small motor that runs the compressor; also the place needs one or two more brine tanks. Mr. Chapman thinks the motor should be run occasionally, not every time the door opens, therefore run the engine a certain number of hours daily, start it manually not automatically.\n\nThe principal asks that if this system is operated that the room be divided so it is all one now. He says some food tastes the milk and butter when they are all in one place, his idea seems reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMay 14, 1940.\n\nDear Father Flourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 16 in connection with the frigidaire plant at the Muscowequan Residential School I enclose copy of letter just received from Indian Agent Waddy.\n\nMay I direct your special attention to the statement made in the sixth paragraph of the Agent's letter with reference to the disposal of a \u00bd horsepower motor. I feel that there must be some explanation for the Principal taking this action. It would be appreciated if you would communicate with him at once and obtain complete information about this matter. We can discuss the whole question further on the occasion of your next visit to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. O.

This matter was taken up with Mr. Waddy who was asked to investigate and report on it. His report was submitted to the Department on April 2nd under our File No. 312-11A R.C.\n\nI now have a letter from Mr. Waddy with respect to the same school stating that he is much concerned about its leaking roof. Mr. Waddy states that he has been informed that the Department got out blueprints for the proposed installation of these extra windows. However, he suggests that if funds are not available, the matter of enlarging upon the lighting system in the junior room be postponed and the money made available for repairing the roof.\n\nI am attaching a letter that Father Jeannette, Principal of the Muscowequan School, has received from the C.G. Snowdon Company, Calgary, Manufacturers of semi-plastic roof cement. This is a tender to supply material consisting of Semi-plastic to repair the roof. You will note that the price of this material is $1.50 per gallon and that 90 gallons would be required. Ten percent discount is being allowed, making the total cost for repairing the roof $121.50. The Principal further states that the work will be done by themselves at no extra cost to the Department.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Waddy's request be given consideration and if money is at all available Mr. Waddy be advised with as little delay as possible as the weather is satisfactory for this type of work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

(RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 5)\nPunnichy, Sask.\nFeb 12 1941\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the batteries used in the light plant at Muscowequan Indian Residential School are used up. I checked up at this place yesterday with an electrical engineer to find what was wrong.\n\nThese batteries were purchased in August 1935 from Mumford Medland, Winnipeg, Man., voucher 397 dated Nov 20 1935 settled this account.\n\n56 cells, 13 plate, 252 amp hours, heavy duty.\n\nOn inspection we found the complaint was that the batteries would not hold electricity, each morning they were dead. The batteries are full of the sediment which deposits in them and are used up. They have given good service and have not been abused except that they have had to stand up to a lot of work.\n\nThe engineer at the school and the man I had with me both say that if new batteries are supplied they should be of the 300 amp hour type.\n\nGlobelite Batteries Limited informed me some time ago that they charge about $455.00 for a set of the 252 amp hour batteries F.O.B.Winnipeg,Man., this is quite a lot lower than we pay elsewhere, the charge for 300 amp hour batteries would be higher and we would have freight to pay, we could get a local engineer to install the batteries much cheaper than having a man come from the factory and put them in.\n\nI beg to recommend that the school be supplied with the batteries before the old ones stop charging altogether.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nFebruary 18, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the batteries at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. It is difficult for the Department to understand your statement -- \"The batteries are full of the sediment which deposits in them\". This condition is due to overcharging and it would appear that the member of the staff whose duty it is to look after the batteries is not very competent. Please let me know exactly who is supposed to do this work and what are his qualifications.\n\nI also note your statement -- \"They have given good service and have not been abused except that they have had to stand up to a lot of work\". What do you mean by the latter part of the sentence just quoted from your letter? Do you mean that these batteries have been overloaded and, if so, why was this permitted?\n\nIs there an automatic control on the batteries at the Muscowequan School and, if so, has it been functioning properly?\n\nThe management of our residential schools must realize that in critical times such as those we are experiencing just now it is more important than ever that the plant and equipment is properly checked and every endeavour made to keep it operating properly.\n\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nfor the longest possible time. Our funds are so limited that it will be impossible to renew equipment which has been allowed to deteriorate due to neglect of some member of the staff.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFebruary 26th, 1941\n\nTo Mr. J.W. Waddy\nIndian Agent\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy,\n\nYour letter to the Department seems to me very exact and clear, but as you say, they like to know more explanations before granting them.\n\nRegarding the batteries full of sediments which deposit in them, this is natural when batteries are used up. This is the consequence when these plates are decomposing for being too old. So this is not due to overcharging nor overloading; because life of batteries is over.\n\nOur engineer Brother F. Jasmin, who is in this work for over 10 years in our Indian School of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and as Mr. Alex Shaw said, he cannot do better, even with his papers, for the batteries are used up.\n\nAbout the automatic control, there is one and it is in good working order. So I think with these few explanations, it will be easier to obtain them, for they are nearly done now.\n\nThanking you for all your trouble - We remain your Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 657-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter 121-5-5 of the 18th inst. regarding request from the principal of Muscowequan Indian Residential School that a new set of batteries be supplied, I beg to say that my remark that batteries are full of sediment which deposits in them is correct; this is the natural thing when batteries are old. Of course it also happens through abuse but such is not the present case.\n\nThe engineer is Bro. F. Jasmin, he has had ten years experience on this work; he keeps his machinery in good shape and this can be seen by the small upkeep cost of the plant at this place.\n\nThe remark that the batteries have had to stand up to a lot of work is also correct. In the daytime there is machinery of various sorts to operate, all a drain on the batteries; then we have the large school to illuminate; in winter this is a steady drain. I do not say or mean that the batteries were overloaded.\n\nThere is an automatic control and it is in good working condition.\n\nThe principal of this school is on the job all the time; he watches over the operation of the machinery and knows how it runs; he does not at any time allow any neglect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nMarch 4, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Muscowequan Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 12-482\n\nSHIP TO: Rev.

A copy of purchase order No. 6343 has already been forwarded to you. If the battery has reached the school and is in good condition you should certify the account and return same for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G. Jeannotte, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nMuscowequan Indian Residential School,\nLestock, Sask.\nReport on the Muscowequan Indian Residential School\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that while I was at the Touchwood Agency I visited the Muscowequan Indian Residential School on the 10th instant, where I spent about four hours.\n\nI found everything in very good shape at this Institution. Everything was in good order, the main building in good state of repair, and the furnishings and furniture well taken care of. The only complaint I had there was regarding the roof of the building. This, as you know, is a flat roof and was guaranteed for seven years but since it is longer than that when the School was erected the guarantee does not hold any longer. Last Fall we purchased 125 gallons of mixture with which to repair the roof but it has not as yet been put on. However, when completed the roof will probably do for another year or so but it will not be long until the roof of this Institution will have to be renewed.\n\nThe out-buildings at this School were built years ago and some of them are getting the worse for wear and paint, but all are kept in fair shape by the Principal. The only new building that has been erected is the Laundry. When funds are available a new granary will have to be provided as the one they have now is becoming practically useless, but by repairing it every year we can make it do until the money is easier to obtain than it is at the present time. The only thing that has to be supplied is linoleum for the kitchen. The linoleum that has been on this is pretty well worn out and the Sisters informed me that it is very hard on their feet walking around on the cement floor. Fifty-five square yards of \"Settleship\" linoleum will be required and I hope that this will be allowed before another winter sets in.\n\nI was in the dining room when the children were having their lunch and they seemed to be well fed and all looked happy and bright. There was no one sick, and there are 111 children in residence.........\nThe children have an ample supply of milk as they have 68 head of cattle at the School, 26 horses, 26 pigs, and 300 chickens. The School operates 2\u00bd sections of land.\n\nTaking everything into consideration I think this is a very well managed Institution and from the appearance of the children I consider that they are well taken care of by an efficient Staff.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nPunnichy, Sask.\nJune 18, 1941.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe your file 312-11A RC of October 24 1936\n\nThis refers to roof of Massowequan Indian Residential School. At time letter was written I understand that the engineer branch had made a report on the condition of the school roof. I had reported it in my letter to your office on August 25th 1936 after having made an inspection myself.\n\nFunds at that time were low and the Department gave us about $20.00 for repairs. Last year they again spent about $100.00 for roofing cement.\n\nIn meanwhile the roof has been getting worse, the covering is pulled away from the side walls of the flat roof, covering itself in bad shape, and the rain is coming in and damaging the plaster of the interior of the building.\n\nI guess the time has come to put a new covering on the roof unless we intend to let the interior of the school peel off and another bill of expense come up. This is no small job as you know, in fact one roofing firm told me we could expect to spend up the $1500.00 when we start in to put on the new cover. Will you look over your old file and see what the engineering branch people told Dr. Robertson, and please try to get the department to have the roof put in shape.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

Mr. Gow states that the roofing on the main building, consisting of a central block and two wings, is in a very bad state of repair, the roofing being wrinkled and cracked, with considerable separation between the layers of felt; in spots the roof boards under the roofing are exposed. Much of the gravel has been removed by school employees, in attempting to carry out repairs which have proved ineffectual. The roofing is not properly bonded to the walls and other vertical surfaces, and as a result has pulled out from under the flashings. Mr. Gow considers that new roofing over the whole area will be necessary.\n\nThe flashings, while loosened and out of position, are in good condition and for the most part can be re-used. The condition of the bevelled cant strip will not be known until the roofing is removed.\n\nLeakage has occurred through the roof and has become evident in the dormitory ceilings, but up to the present the damage has not been extensive or serious.\n\nMr. Gow estimates that the expenditure involved in replacing the existing roof on the main building only, with a four ply felt and gravel roof, having a guaranteed life of 15 years, and re-laying existing flashing as far as practicable, to be in the neighbourhood of $600.00. This amount would include all new materials required, labour, freight and engineering expenses. Repairs to interior plaster work, necessitated by roof leakage, are estimated to cost approximately $50.00, and are not included in the above figure.\n\nTo obtain the best results, it is recommended that the roofing and flashing work be carried out by contract under supervision of an engineer, and that Mr. Gow be authorized to obtain tenders from at least three approved contractors from Regina. The tenders would be based on specifications prepared by this service, and would include the provision of a bond covering the life of the new roofing.\n\nAs regards..........\n\nJ. M.

I went to the school and found he had disconnected the boiler altogether, had taken out one of the tubes and the condition of the boiler could be seen. The tubes are eaten out about half way in, they should be replaced. When looking at the boiler the engineer remarked that the crown sheet, which holds the end of the tubes better, was also about finished through action of minerals in the water.\n\nThis meant that just putting in tubes would be a waste of money.\n\nE.H. Carter of Yorkton is sending two boilermakers to Gordon School tomorrow and they will call in at Muscowequan School and report to me on this boiler, which is the high pressure boiler with 48 tubes, 2\" x 3\", we may have to buy a new boiler if the crown sheet is gone.\n\nFurther report will be made to you when the men examine the boiler.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa September 6 1941\n\nJ W WADDY\nIndian Agent\nPunnichy Sask\n\nAUTHORITY GRANTED FOR RETUBING\nBOILERS MUSCOEQUAN SCHOOL AT TOTAL COST\nOF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS\n\nChg Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\n\nR A Hoey\n\nSECRETARY 982\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH OTTAWA ONT\nMUSCOEQUAN SCHOOL BOILER WILL COST TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE\nDOLLARS FOR RETUBING BY CARTER YORKTON PLUS TRANSPORT OF\nBOILER TOTAL LIMIT TWO SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS MAN COULD DO\nJOB IMMEDIATELY CROWN SHEET SEEMS ALL RIGHT WIRE REPLY\n\nJ W WADDY\n\nThis is a collect message, and will be charged to your account unless we are notified at once to the contrary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is leaking considerable at the bottom, being more or less pitted. It has got to the stage now that it is beyond repairing.\n\nWe had the same trouble at the Yorkton Queen Victoria Hospital and they discarded the tank and installed a new one. When we purchased the tank for the Hospital we had it copperised on the inside and this adds considerable life to the tank.\n\nAn extra heavy tank of the same size 5/16 shell and 3/8 heads with man-hole in one end and four openings for jacket and side-arm heaters, installed, as near as can be figured, would be around $850.00. (Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars). This, of course, is not guaranteed, on account of war materials and adverse weather conditions. However, if the Department sees fit to go ahead with this, no doubt we can arrange with the Vulcan Iron Works to rush this through.\n\nHoping this report is to your satisfaction,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

Get me something in writing, size if possible, and a guess at approximate cost of a new one, and some remarks about the old one, then I will write Ottawa about it. Get this out as soon as you can, I know you are pretty busy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nE.H.Carter, Esq.,\nYorkton, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nFor some months we have had trouble with the large heating boiler at Muscoweguan Indian Residential School, Lestock, Sask., which appears to be used principally for the bath water. When I started in check up on costs the price quoted me looked so out of reason that I stalled on the whole matter till we could get further details, besides I know how your funds lack much balance just now.\n\nThe principal and the plumbing people who know the boiler say it is pitted too badly to be repaired, all I know is that it is dripping water from many spots all the time.\n\nThe last proposition we took up and have discussed with all concerned is that a 500 gal tank instead of a 750 one be put in, that the school be supplied with certain shower bath piping etc and the work done by the school engineer. This would entail supply of following materials etc.\n\n1- 500 gal hot water tank with man hole etc.\n200' \u00bd\" gal pipe\n16- \u00bc\" x 4\" long galv nipples\n20- \u00bc\" galv Tees\n40- \u00bc\" 90 degrees gal elbows\n20- \u00bc\" 45 \"\n20- shower heads 4\" for \u00bd\" pipe\n5- shower drainers \u00bc\" pipe\n12 globe valves \u00bc\"(pemberthy'COMPODISK' with removable seat)\n\nI still dislike recommending all the above but there does not seem to any way out of it.\n\nWould you consider writing a hard up letter to the principal and asking him if it is not in some way possible to get along with present outfit till after next April 1st, I know you have just paid out for complete new roof for this place. Rev. Jeannotte is reasonable at all times, but I have stood him off so long now that it might be well for someone else to taffy him along for a time, though I hate to ask you to do it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the boiler at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. We have already expended an amount of nearly $2000.00 for repairs and improvements at this school this year. This is considerably more than the amount we intended to expend and under these circumstances it is practically impossible for us to consider the installation of a new heating boiler at the present time.\n\nThere is also the additional fact that due to present conditions it is unlikely that the delivery of a boiler could be secured for several months. The Surveys & Engineering Branch point out that it is doubtful if a 500 gallon tank would meet the requirements of the school. Taking everything into consideration I hope that the school will be able to carry on with the present boiler until the next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith requisition in duplicate for paint etc required for the Muscowequan Indian Residential school, also for fixtures etc required to instal electricity in the chicken house, granary and shoemaker shop, and for repairing the refrigerator at the school.\n\nOn October 13, 1943, your file 121-5-5, you wrote Mr. Davis advising that $900.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and the purchase of new equipment at the Muscowequan Residential School.\n\nMr. Davis forwarded a requisition for material under date of November 23, 1943 but I understand this was never supplied and the requisition going forward with this, is in place of the first requisition sent you.\n\nAs I have very recently arrived at this Agency, I know nothing of the circumstances as to why these repairs etc are necessary but am forwarding for your consideration.\n\nG.A. Havers,\nClerk.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 22, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. G.A. Havers, In Charge Indian Agency, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing requisition for materials for the Muscowequan Residential School. As you state in your letter, Mr. Davis forwarded a requisition on November 23 and we wrote to him on November 30 pointing out that we did not favourably consider the request made on the requisition and at that time we asked Mr. Davis to discuss the matter very carefully with the Principal. We also instructed him in the last paragraph of our letter of November 30 to let us know the name and address of the firm from whom any quotations were obtained. There has been so much delay in replying to our letter of November 30 that it is almost impossible for us to favourably consider such a large expenditure at the Muscowequan School at the present period of the fiscal year. I note from your letter that you have not discussed the requisition with the Principal and I should appreciate it if you would do so. For instance, the first items cover paint for farm buildings. While painting these buildings would no doubt give them a better appearance, I doubt the advisability of doing such work at the present time.\n\nWith regard to the repairs requested for the Kelvinator refrigerator, I should appreciate your advising when this was installed and the name of the firm from whom it was secured. The amount of lumber etc. requested is comparatively small, but the total cost amounts to over $50 and consequently purchase will have to be made through our Purchasing Branch. Consequently we will have to know the name and address of the firm from whom you obtained the prices mentioned on the requisition.\nYou may authorize the purchase of the following material required for installing electricity in the chicken house, granary and shoemaker shop:\n\n3 Service entrance switches\n12 \" insulators\n6 Entrance caps \u00bd inc\n3 Conduit switch boxes - type FS of Marshall-Wells cat.\n3 Cast iron cover #FS 108\n1 Coil Loomex - 2 wires #14\n6 Porcelain outlet box (keyless) #1353\n6 Galvanized octagonal boxes #241451\n1 Package Loomex connectors\n1 \" cable straps #1\n3 Flush push button switches\n40 Ft. \u00bd in pipe\n\nThe school will have to supply the wire.\n\nOn receipt of your reply the requisition will have further consideration.\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThere is an old Heider tractor about 30 years old, at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.

The H.P. required would be at least 17-30.\n\nI understand that some of the flying schools are being closed up and no doubt the equipment is being disposed of.

Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1944.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, enclosing voucher for $283.80 in connection with repairing the frigidaire at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nIn your letter of April 17 you enclosed a quotation that you had received from Marshall-Wells Company Limited showing that the expenditure required would be $101.75 and purchase order No. 23771 was issued as a result of the recommendation contained in your letter.\n\nWithout authority I note that an expenditure of $283.80 has been incurred. It is simply impossible for the Department to control expenditures if school principals assume the responsibility of exceeding the amount which they are authorized to expend on repairs and improvements. Consequently we are forwarding Marshall-Wells Company a cheque for $101.75 and the Principal of the Muscowequan School should forward them a cheque for the balance; namely, $182.05.

(RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that the Saskatchewan Power Commission are extending their power line which will pass the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, and in all probability the school's source of electrical power will be changed from the present use of the lighting plant there connecting it with the power lines.\n\nI have a letter from Mr. Simpson, our Indian Agent at File Hills, drawing this part to my attention and stating he would like to have the 110 volt plant that is now at the school transferred to the Agency. At the present time there is a 32 volt lighting plant at the Agency operated by an old type one-cylinder Delco engine connected to a set of 16 cells. Also, another plant of the same voltage is used at the File Hills Residential School which is operated by 3 K.W. 1-cylinder Delco engines attached to 16 cells. The Agent notes that it is difficult to get repairs for 32 volt plants as they are not as common as the 110 volt plants and he feels that more efficient service could be procured from the 110 volt plant. It is his understanding that if the plant from Muscowequan School could be transferred they could have sufficient power to supply the school as well as the Agency particularly if l/o or possibly 4/o weatherproof copper wire was used to carry the current from the plant to the buildings. The distance from the office to the residential school is about 550 yds. The plant could be installed in the old office building which is about 40 yds. from the present office, in fact this old building could be moved to any location that might be more suitable. The only work that will be necessary in this building is the construction of a cement foundation for the plant, also 1100 yds. of copper wire, 30 heavy insulators and brackets therefore and 15 telephone poles would be required. The Agent estimates it would cost $91.10 to do this work.\n\nBefore submitting this proposition to our Branch I have asked Mr. Simpson to contact the Inspector of the Saskatchewan Power Commission to look over the electrical wiring both at the school and at the Agency to see whether it would be in order to install this plant. I have a copy of the results of their inspection at my office and I notice that whether we transfer the plant and change the power to 110 volts or not some repairs would have to be made to the wiring at the Agency and school before continuing in the matter and I would like to be advised......\nto be advised whether our Branch are prepared to recommend the transfer of the plant from the Muscowequan School after they are connected to the power line.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nOttawa,\nOctober 11, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to transferring the electric light plant from the Muscowequan Residential School to the File Hills Agency.\n\nWe have no definite information to the effect that the Muscowequan Residential School is now receiving electricity from the provincial power line. The only reference to the matter on our file is a letter from Agent Davis dated March 15 in which he intimated that the Muscowequan School intended to have electricity placed in the barn.\n\nI note your suggestion that if the power plant were transferred power could be provided both to the agency building and to the File Hills Residential School. We have had considerable experience with such installations in other places, particularly at Norway House, and they have always been a source of trouble and worry to our officials. Our experience in this regard is that separate installations prove much more satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRegina, October 17th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA\n\nRe: Yours No. 191-3-S of October 11th.\n\nWith respect to the transfer of the electric light plant from the Muscowequan School to the File Hills Agency I have made enquiries and learned that the power line which the Saskatchewan Power Commission is constructing to the town of Punnichy will be passing by the school and in all likelihood connections will be made to the school.\n\nOf course you will understand it is difficult to get this line constructed because of war priorities. However, I understand that they expect to finish it by the middle of December and in all probability it will be in use by New Year's.\n\nI imagine when Mr. Davis intimated about having electricity placed in the barn this is what he had in mind.\n\nM.

The clothes basket is 26 inches in diameter. It is in very good shape and must have been bought about 1930. Manufactured by the Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. Ltd., Toronto, Ontario. If you could obtain from this company the motor (ad hoc) with the necessary starting switches, it will be very well. I believe, that it is easier to buy the new machine from them, or the Canadian Laundry Co.

I have found a few in Montreal and telephoned him immediately. At the same time, I wrote here to Rather Robideaux who had found some from the Fairbanks Morse who have sent us the following motors and have promised to send within one month the balance with the exception of the vertical 2 H.B. motor for the extractor.

It appears from this letter that you have secured the following:\n\n1.

Please let me have a list of these motors and the horse power of each and also the amount which Fairbanks-Morse will allow for each of them. We are obliged to have\n\nRev.

Mines & Resources, Regina, Sask.\n\nAs you are aware the Muscowequan Indian Residential School is now getting power and light from the Sask. Power Commission and no longer need the wet battery cells for the Delco plant.\n\nThe batteries at the Gordon Indian Residential School are in bad shape and will have to be replaced very soon. As far as I can find out, they are six years old.\n\nWould it be possible to have the batteries from the Muscowequan School transferred to the Gordon's school?\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nAttention Mr. Phelan,\n\nRegina, February 28th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Electric Power Plant, Muscowequan Indian Residential School, your File No. 121-1-5.\n\nHerewith is a letter received from Mr. Davis, Indian Agent, Touchwood Agency, requesting if it would be possible to transfer the batteries from the Muscowequan School to the Gordon's School. Mr. Davis states that the batteries at the Gordon School are in pretty bad shape and will have to be replaced at an early date.\n\nI called the Muscowequan School and was informed that the batteries are in excellent condition but the two engines that operate the plant are old and will need repairs. I am given to understand that the motors at the Gordon School are in excellent condition and if Mr. Davis' suggestion is approved then their electric plant should be in good working order.\n\nYour attention is drawn to Mr. Christianson's letter of October 3rd and your reply of October 11th, file No. 121-1-5. You may wish to give further consideration to Agent Simpson's request.\n\nIf the batteries are transferred to the Gordon Indian Residential School you will have two surplus Lester engines. One is a 27.5 amps, 5 h.p. which, according to report is in fair condition, and the other is a 55 amps, 10 h.p. which requires minor repairs. If the plant can be used as a unit in some other school it would not be wise to transfer the batteries to the Gordon School. However, the decision should be made at an early date as to what should be done with this plant as it is now not required at the Muscowequan School and will undoubtedly deteriorate if it is neglected. I am given to understand that one engine is being used to keep the batteries up. I should be pleased, therefore, if you would advise this office of your decision.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nActing Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to the recent hookup of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School with the Saskatchewan Power Line, some new wiring will have to be installed, and this together with labor etc changing the motors will cost in the neighbourhood of $300.00.\n\nSome of this work has already been done, but I do not feel like going ahead with all the work until I receive authority for the expenditure.\n\nWill you please wire reply so that I may have the work continued without interruption.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, March 8, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. R. S.

E. Morris, Acting Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the electric power plant surplus to requirements at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nYour letter was very fully discussed with Mr. Hoey, and for the reasons stated in my letter of October 11, 1944, to Mr. Christianson, we do not feel it advisable to transfer the whole plant to File Hills.\n\nApproval is granted for the transfer of the batteries to the Gordon's Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the two surplus Lister engines, we are communicating with another residential school where a new engine has recently been requested. Possibly one or both of these engines will suit their requirements. In the meantime it is hoped that the engines will be carefully stored so that they will be available when we find a place to transfer them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Fairbanks tells me they will have some shortly on hand.\n\nOne Fan for the Kelvinator Unit was trade-in by Marshall-Wells. One \u00bc HP was landed to Cowessess Indian School for their Pump pending your approval for selling or granting. Gordon's School would like to buy one \u00bc HP.\n\nOn hand for Sale: 1-\u00bd HP unit connected with Rotary Pump, 4-1HP., 3-2HP. (one of which Vertical for the Spinner) 1-3HP., 1-\u00bc HP. 2 Fans 12\" Blade.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nRev. V. de Varineau\nPrincipal\nMOTORS ON HAND AT MUSCOGEQUAN SCHOOL:\n\n1 \u00bd H.P.

While the account stated that the freight receipt was attached, I may say that this receipt was not with the account when we received it at this office. We have therefore issued a cheque for $112.20, and it would be appreciated if you would forward me another freight receipt in order that we may issue a further cheque for $5.03.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCanadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., Limited,\n980 St. Antoine St.,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa, March 29, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nRe: Electrical Equipment for Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nI desire to refer you to your memorandum of February 26, (File 56, 851-15-16).

It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

This covers the two items at the bottom of the third page of the account and amounts to $218.45.\n\nBy doing so the account for the material will be reduced to $356.49, and a separate voucher should be issued for this amount.\n\nYour kind attention to this matter and the prompt return of the account will be appreciated.

Morris, who was then acting Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask., advised this office that owing to the Muscowequan School securing electrical power from the Provincial Power service, there were two surplus Lister engines at the school.\n\nOne of these engines is stated to be 27.5 amps. 5 H.P., in fair condition, and the other, 55 amps., 10 H.P., requiring minor repairs.\n\nIt is our intention to ship these engines to the Cariboo Indian Residential School in British Columbia, but, before doing so, we would like to have them placed in good condition. Can you have the necessary repairs done in Regina or some other place close to the Muscowequan School. The Department would appreciate it if you would make inquiries and let us know where you can have the work done, the approximate cost and the probable length of time it would require to place these machines in good condition. As soon as we hear from you, further instructions will be given to you and at that time we will also inform you of the correct address to which these two engines should be shipped.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.

However, although our stock of parts is fairly good, there may be some parts in the overhaul of these plants which we do not have in stock and may cause considerable delay in the overhauling of same until we can have them possibly made locally. This condition may not arise, but we thought it advisable to point it out at this time.\n\nRe cylinder referred to. We would suggest installing a new cylinder and piston rather than reborning as to rebore it would necessitate an oversize piston which we would be unable to supply from stock.\n\nWe regret that we are unable to give you any approximate cost for doing this work, but we will be pleased to give you any further details you might require.\n\nCont'd.\nWe trust this covers the information asked for, and that we may look forward to receiving your business, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MELAND, LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 18, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAt the Muscowequan Residential School,\nnear Lestock, Sask., we have two surplus Lister engines.\nOne is 27.5 amps., 5 H.P. and the other 55 amps., 10 H.P.\nThe former is stated to be in fair condition and the\nlatter only requiring minor repairs. They are surplus\nto requirements at this school, as they have recently\nsecured Hydro power.\n\nWe have had considerable correspondence\nwith the Cariboo Residential School regarding their\nrequirements and we are considering transferring these\ntwo engines to that school, free of charge as far as\nthe school is concerned.\n\nAs shipment of these machines would have\nto be made via Vancouver, it occurred to me that possibly\nwe could have them overhauled in Vancouver rather than\nsending them back to Winnipeg, where we can have them\ndone by Mumford Medland.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me\nknow as soon as possible if there is a firm in Vancouver\nwho would overhaul these engines before sending them\nto Cariboo.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRegina, May 17th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWe just had a telephone call from Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent, from the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. The boiler at the school started leaking through faulty flues and, being an emergency case, it was decided to have the boiler sent in to Regina for repairs. However, it is the understanding that all of the flues in this boiler will have to be changed. We have the flues, 48 in number, and these will be sent in together with the boiler, but we would like to have authority from you for changing all of them as it will cost $1.25 a piece for taking them out and putting the new ones in, plus the freighting of the boiler from the school to Regina and back.\n\nThe total cost for repairing the boiler will, therefore, come to $60.00 plus the freight, but we are not prepared to state the cost of the freighting. This boiler was repaired last fall but not completely, and it seems that it will be necessary to change all the flues.\n\nMay I have your authority immediately as the boiler will be brought in on May 18th and we are trying to arrange with the Northwestern Iron Works to repair it immediately.\n\nJ.P.B.

Phelan,\n\nRe use of Shavings.\n\nWe wanted to use shavings for the Barn, Stable and Pig Pen which are very cold and damp, and by that fact cause a bad ventilation on account of the frost sticking on the walls.\n\nWe have experienced that empty walls are worst for fire hazard because there is more draught.\n\nThe Regina Sash & Door, Regina Sask.\nThe Bird Construction Co., Regina, Sask. are selling shavings. We had quotations from the Reliance Lumber Co., Lestock Sask. at $0.50 a bundle.

Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Kerley, Crooked Lake Agency, in which he states that he has been informed there are two 1 horse power surplus motors at the Muscowequan School. These could be used to advantage at the Cowessess Residential School.\n\nPlease consult the Principal, and, if the motors mentioned are not required at the Muscowequan School, it will be in order for you to transfer them immediately to the Cowessess School. You should let me know what action you take in this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept., Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter #121-5-5 dated June 12 last I understood from the Principal of Muscowequan School that he had taken this matter up with you direct, but as you are aware, the school has recently hooked up with the Power line and parts are required to connect the washing machine with this.\n\nThe Lister engine is working the washing machine on D.C. and until the parts to change to A.C. are obtained the school will need to use the Lister engine. However, as the school closes on June 20, I intend to have the motor shipped at once.\n\nThe Principal of the school always refers to this particular piece of machinery as the \"Spinner\". This is the machine which dries the cloths after they come through the washing machine.\n\nI understand the \"Spinner\" is Type 24.33, serial 4435, made by the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company and a Square \"D\", 115 volts, class 7107 2 H.P. D.C.\n\nThis has to be replaced by the following:\n\nNo 180126 Type N.A. Ampre 17.2 Motor Compound winding\n\nVertical motor 1750 revolutions by the Louis Allis Co. Milwaukee, U.S.A.\n\nI do not know just what is required to make the changeover, but possibly the Electrical Company could send any necessary parts required for this.\nThe school is also in need of a part for the Jacket heater made by the Taylor Forbes Co. Ltd of Guelph, Ont.\n\nNo 22 B - 11393 - 43003\n\nA rough sketch of the part required is enclosed.\nA set of grates are also required.\n\nR.S. Devis,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, June 26th, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing our recent conversation, I wish to submit a quotation from a letter received from the Indian Agent at Punnichy, for your consideration:\n\n\"I understand the \"Spinner\" is Type 24.33, serial 4435, made by the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company and a Square \"D\", 115 volts, Class 7107, 2 H.P. D.C.\n\nThis has to be replaced by the following:\n\nNo. 180126 Type N.A. Ampere 17.2 Motor Compound Winding.\n\nVertical motor 1750 revolutions by the Louis Allis Co. Milwaukee, U.S.A.\n\nI do not know just what is required to make the changeover, but possibly the Electrical company could send any necessary parts required for this\".\n\nApparently what this extractor needs is a new 115 volt A.C. Motor. This school which operated under its own electrical power has recently hooked up with the Saskatchewan Power Commission which furnishes an alternating current, hence the need of the new type of motor.\nThe Department is desirous of finding out if a motor can be obtained for this particular type of extractor and if the installation could be done by a local electrician.\n\nYour attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lighting Plants\n\nKindly refer to yours of June 19th on the subject of lighting plants, one of which we have received at our shops.\n\nOn dismantling this engine we found the cylinder badly worn and the valves in bad shape, this apparently due to the fact that water had been leaking into the cylinder head.\n\nIt would appear that if the work as detailed below is carried out, this engine would give a number of years of useful life but as no doubt you will understand we have not had an opportunity to check the generator as this would not be possible until the engine has been reconditioned but its condition looks good.\n\nWe would propose to re bore the cylinder, supply and fit a new piston complete with rings and wrist pin, reface cylinder head which is now badly pitted, supply two new valves and machine valve seats, re-assemble and test. We estimate this would cost the sum of $214.00, f.o.b. our warehouse.\n\nWe have a promise from a foundry on the new piston which would enable us to finish the job in about three weeks.\nAwaiting the favour of your instructions,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nB.C.

This school which operated under its own electrical power has recently hooked up with the Saskatchewan Power Commission which furnishes an alternating current, hence, the need of a new type of motor.\n\nWe would like to know if a motor can be obtained for this particular type of extractor and if in your opinion the installation could be done by a local electrician.\n\nAn early reply to this letter would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co.\n393 Sorouen Ave.\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Apparently you were out of town. I, therefore, take the liberty of writing you the following information.\n\nWe have checked over the extractor which we supplied you on Ser. No. 4435, but now as you state that you have changed the motor power from D.C. to A.C., the voltage which you give in your letter is not procurable, and I wish you would kindly check with your Department a little further, as we believe that you will find that 220/550 volts, either 60 or 25 cycle would be quite satisfactory.\n\nAs soon as we have this information we will advise you as to the advisability of sending the extractor back to us, as we believe that in view of the special mounting on the machine that it should be done in the factory.\n\nWill you please let us have your reply by return if at all possible.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.L.

I quote:\n\n\"We have checked over the extractor which we supplied you on Ser. No. 4435, but now as you state that you have changed the motor power from D.C. to A.C., the voltage which you give in your letter is not procurable, and I wish you would kindly check with your Department a little further, as we believe that you will find that 220/550 volts, either 60 or 25 cycle would be quite satisfactory.\"\n\nYou will notice that they recommend the 220 volts instead of the 115 which you are using. I wonder whether the school is wired to carry the 220 volts. I would imagine that it is since you have a great number of appliances.\n\nThe agent for this Company, Mr. J.L.C. LeCours has just been in the office and suggested that the best way would be to ship this Extractor to the Company in Toronto where they would make the motor change necessary and overhaul the Extractor at the same time if it should be necessary.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\nMr. LeCours has been unable to give me a quotation as to the probable expenditure but will do so in a few days.

We\nwould have to know the alternating current which you are now\ngetting in this institution, whether it is 60 cycle or 25\nand whether the voltage is 550 or 220. This would have to be\n3 phase.\n\nWith regard to the voltage you state in your letter\nthat this motor would be 115 AC which they require. This is\nnot a usual current unless it is that you are going to operate\non single phase, and if so it would take us approximately six\nto seven months to get a motor of this type.\n\nPlease advise us by return giving this information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY COMPANY Limited,\n\nCDE/f\n\nVice-President and Sales Director.\nOttawa, August 30, 1945.\n\nDear Father de Varennes:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the extractor at the Muscowequan Residential School, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter received from the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company.\n\nPlease arrange to ship this machine at the earliest possible date, addressed to the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company, Limited, Toronto, Ont. As soon as you have shipped it, you should notify me, in order that we can again communicate with the company.

Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 6278\n\nMr. Ostrander forwarded to this office on October 16, 1945, your requisition of October 12, for 3 fans for the Muscowequan Residential School. The purchase order mentioned above was sent to the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Regina, on October 30, 1945. We have a letter from them today, requesting payment of the account. On reviewing our files, we cannot find any record of the account having been sent to this office.\n\nIf you have the account, please certify and forward it for payment, but, if it has been mislaid, please obtain another account from the company, certify and forward it to this office. Your immediate attention to this matter would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your wire of Monday last regarding additional wiring at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, I have gone into this matter and find that the extractor recently rebuilt for an A.C. (previously D.C.) is equipped with a three phase motor and the power line which runs into the school from the transmission line in, is equipped to run single phase motors.\n\nAs the present installation is for a single phase wiring, it will require extending two wires from the high power line to the school and adding transformers with possible erection of a substation. This will cost approximately $1000.00 and for changing the wire within the school, including material, will cost approximately $225.00.\n\nThis seems to be a very large expense for changing over one piece of machinery.\n\nI would suggest that you get in touch with the Beaver Laundry Co. who have just recently overhauled and converted this piece of machinery over from D.C. to A.C., to find out if there is no other way this can be equipped to be run by a single phase motor.\n\nThe spinner is badly needed at the school and if you could advise me what to do, as soon as possible, it would be very much appreciated.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 27, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Edgar:\n\nYou will recall that a great deal of correspondence has taken place with regard to the extractor for the Muscowequan Residential School. On reading over this correspondence, I have noticed that some misunderstanding has occurred. The Muscowequan school is wired for 220 volts, A.C., single phase, 60 cycle. In order to wire it for the three phase, the labor and material would cost approximately $1200.00. I imagine that it would be less expensive to have the motor changed to a 220 volt A.C. single phase, 60 cycle. To do this would the whole machine have to be shipped to Toronto or could the motor be sent out and installed locally?\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nMr. C.D.

This leaves an amount of $1,300.00 available, and the requisitions which you forwarded will involve the following expenditures:\n\n1. Cement pipe - - $487.50\n2. Ejector pump - - 200.75\n3. Building material - - 195.15\n4. Labour by Oscar Nordin - - 100.00\n5. Small items with reference fixing cistern - - 51.80\n6. Mr. Brown, Electrician - - 175.00\n\n$1,210.20\n\nItems 1, 2 and 3 will be ordered by the Departmental Purchasing Agent, and when they reach the school the expenditure required in connection with Items 4, 5 and 6 is approved.\n\nYou will note from the above that the total amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs,\n\n....... improvements\nimprovements and the purchase of new equipment at this school will be practically exhausted when the above mentioned expenditures are made.

The Beatty Company cannot guarantee delivery. You will see by the above that it is practically impossible to obtain a domestic washer at present. I can, however, secure a post wringer. This consists of a stand supporting the wringer and also supporting the motor. This unit is therefore movable and can be used in any section of the room. There is a plug-in cord, which makes it an independent unit. This, I believe, would help the situation until the motor for the extractor is changed.\n\nBy the way, I wish you would crate the motor on the extractor and send it, prepaid, to the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company. As you know, the single phase motor, to replace this 3 phase, has been ordered, with a special plea to expedite delivery.\n\nKindly reply by wire if this post wringer will answer your purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

The new motor would have to be fitted to the machine. This no doubt could be done on the job.\n\nThere would be a difference in the price of the single phase motor and starter amounting to $96.45 and the delivery offered on this is 6 to 8 months.\n\nWe wish to state at this time that operation of an extractor by single phase motor is not as satisfactory as with a three phase, as the high starting torque required caused these motors to spark at the brushes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY COMPANY Limited,\n\n[Signature]\nPresident.\nLe 25 mai 1946\n\nM.

Adverting to the above, confidential information having been received at this Detachment to the effect that one Andrew ALBERT, a treaty Indian of Muscowequan Indian Reserve had been observed with a team which was harnessed similar to that which was missing from the above mentioned school.\n\n2. Pursuant to the above, the writer patrolled via Prov/Car Road Codes 1849 to the Touchwood, Lastock, and Bunkend districts and investigated in the above regard. Andrew ALBERT was located in the Lastock district when it was ascertained that he had attended a wedding on the Muscowequan Reserve on Tuesday June 11th, and that wishing to make a good showing he had painted the harness of his horses a bright yellow and had borrowed a set of harness from McKenzie BLUE-EYES of the Poorman Reserve and had been driven to the wedding in his buggy. It was ascertained that part of the harness was at present with his people who were working in the Bunkend district and the patrol continued to that point where upon arrival at the Indian camp the harness at that point was checked over by an employee of the Muscowequan Indian School, who was familiar with the harness and who had during the winter months repaired same; however, none of the harnesses at this point was found to be that missing from the above mentioned school and the patrol returned to Lastock.\n\n3. Upon arrival at Lastock, Sask., the writer remained at that point to attend the Inquest held by Judge HAJDUK against Death of, Lastock, Sask., and Sgt. J. P. DOUGLAS continued the patrol to the Poorman Indian Reserve to check the Harness of McKenzie BLUE-EYES, upon arrival at the Poorman Reserve, a further check revealed that the harness in possession of BLUE-EYES was not new and not the missing harness. It was further ascertained that BLUE-EYES had purchased this set of Harness in 1945 through the Dept. of Indian Affairs and he was therefore ruled out as a suspect.\n\n4. No further information being forthcoming at this point Capt. Douglas returned to Lastock and contacted the writer, and the patrol returned to Punichy, arriving at 12.30 P.M.\n\n5. This subject will receive further attention the result of which will be the subject of a report to meet the marginally noted diary date.\n\nGABRIEL FORBARD,\nDEPENSE SHOWN ON P.93.\n(T.H.

Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of vouchers Numbers 227 and 241. On both vouchers you request payment for labour for erecting a pig-pen. I am unable to locate any authority for this work. However, as you have forwarded the vouchers, I presume you considered the erection of this building necessary, and the vouchers will be paid. Please let me know if these vouchers cover the full expenditure for which we will be expected to provide funds.\n\nBernard F.

It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 657-76-09-615.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnclosure:\nOttawa, July 19, 1946.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 172. Stanley Brock's account dated May 10 includes an item on the bottom of the account for one pinion at a cost of $15.00. Presumably that was intended for the 45\" Troy ironer.\n\nYou also attach the account dated June 5, covering the cost of a pinion for the same machine. Is this latter account a duplicate of the item included on the account of May 10 or were two pinions necessary?\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter #121-5-5 W.T.I., dated July 15, 1946, regarding my vouchers 227 and 241, labor on pig-pen at Muscowequan Indian Residential School, I would advise that no authority from the Department to have this work done, has been received at this office, but in a number of cases the Principal apparently receives authority direct from Ottawa to have work done.\n\nThese accounts for work on the pigpen were sent to me by the Principal and I forwarded them on for the consideration of the Department.\n\nThe only authority for work at the Muscowequan School I have received from the Department, is contained in letter #121-5-5 dated May 4, 1946.\n\nThe Principal has not advised me if there will be any further accounts for work on the pig-pen.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Department letter #121-5-5 W&T.1. dated July 19, 1946 returning my voucher #172 in favor of Stanley Breck Ltd., Winnipeg, Man., and would state that I have checked up with the Principal of Muscowequan School and find that two pinions were purchased. The voucher is therefore correct as rendered, and returned herewith.\n\nR.S.

Item No. 4, labour by Oscar Nerdin, would be for well digging.\n\nThe Principal stated they had trouble getting enough water to supply the school, and needed a well at the barn for watering the stock, and also to supply a certain amount for use in the school when the supply from the school well is not sufficient.\n\nIn the new well they have a ten feet supply of water which the Principal states is adequate for all their needs.\n\nG.A.

At times we have trouble with these and if a fire occurred during one of these periods, or the electricity happened to be off, there would be nothing to stop a small blaze from spreading and burning the school.\n\nThe Principal feels that the buildings are fire proof, which they are, but we all know that fires can start in buildings of this kind in the furniture, bedding etc., and do an awful lot of damage.\n\nSince Mr. Laker's report the Acting Principal, the Reverend Fr. Robidoux has started fire drill weekly and as soon as these requisitions are approved, I will have the changes made as requested.\n\nThe children will be home for the holidays on the 1st July so there will be no-one in the building at that date, until September.\n\nR.S.Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nEnclosed herewith are requisitions forwarded by Mr. Davis for equipment necessary to have the Muscowequan Indian Residential School comply with the standard set by the Provincial Fire Commissioner.\n\nOn his recent inspection of this school the Commissioner insisted that these changes be made.

The number of beds and mattresses now on hand is insufficient for such a large number, and the Principal is urgently asking that 25 small beds not more than 5' in length and 2\u00bd' in width be forwarded immediately, along with mattresses of equal size, pillow cases and blankets.\n\nI have neglected to write to you about this matter and I hope that you will expedite this shipment so as to cause the least inconvenience possible to the school.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

This means that we should be able to ship your motor and starter before the end of November. We are truly disappointed at the long delay in getting delivery and would like to assure you that we have done everything possible with letters, wires and phone calls and have received promises which have not been kept due to inability to secure delivery of materials.\n\nWe definitely realize the seriousness of your position and will do everything we can to try and get this equipment shipped in November.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nThis is a personal letter to you, Mr. Phelan and not intended for filing.\n\nDo you know that for over two years now we are waiting for the single phase motor for the Extractor in our Laundry? The Beaver Laundry who has the matter in hand has sent us a motor over a year ago but not the proper one. Ever since, we get letters such as the one I include here, but no motor.\n\nNo one seems to realize what the lack of an Extractor for washings such as ours can mean to those in charge of this work!\n\nIt is really unfair to let things go this way.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nway any longer and I told the Principal yesterday that I was writing to you and to the Beaver Co. this morning and in fifteen days' time if our Motor has not arrived, he will get me one through any Company and send the bill to the Department. \u2014 What do you think of these arrangements?\n\nMay be, you believe that being hard up for the washing we do not change the children's clothing as we should! \u2014\n\nWe now have hundred and fifty-one children in the house and we wash an average of 3,297 pieces of clothes a week not counting dish towels etc etc....\n\nHaving only a small Tumbler for the drying how do you think we manage with all those clothes half wrung in a hand wringer running on a big pulley and so dangerous we can't trust a girl around it? Well, besides looking after the washing business I feel that wringer without the girls help getting awfully wet every time.\n\nTo dry the clothes we have to spread them all over the house on radiators, beds, chairs, tables etc making a mess of the whole place and\nnotice this is a very tiresome work.\n\nWould you like to know that on the washing business at Lestock we have killed three of our young sisters? One died shortly after she left the school and the two others are dragging in the infirmaries after months at the hospital and even at the San and having spent thousands of dollars for operations, X-Rays and hospital bills.\n\nNow, since three years I have taken the job as mine, finding it too hard to give it to any of my sisters. Though very healthy a few years ago, I see myself condemned by the Doctor to nothing but very easy work for a ruined heart and sore throat.\n\nI can't give it away before I see the Laundry properly equipped with an Extractor and a Dryer. For the last item mentioned you will receive a requisition in due form very soon. I believe we will also have to ask for a new washing machine as the one we use was a second-hand one from the Lebret School and is now so old it can break apart anytime.\n\nIt wouldn't be wise to wait any longer for without the machine we couldn't wash at all...\nFather Clourde on his last visit seemed to realize the Laundry situation but I guess he forgot all about it on his way back to Ottawa.\n\nNow Mr Phelan, I tell you all these things to make you understand what makes our life so hard sometimes in our schools and I believe that if you understand, you will be glad to help us.\n\nWe do so much extra work for the sole sake of the children that we like to feel that those in charge are happy to do the same.\n\nMay I hope in real help from you Mr Phelan in my Motor problem and may I also count on you to back my requisition for a dryer and washing machine as well as for a kitchen range, ours being completely ruined and creating a three times a day problem?\n\nWith my personal thanks and wishes accept those of my twelve sisters who are all happy at their work with your little Indian.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary Arthur,\nSuperior.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nDecember 1st, 1947\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF House Equipment\n\nSHIP TO Muscowequan Indian Residential School\nLestock, Sask.\n\nPurpose for which required\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------|------------|-------|\n| 1 only   | Kitchen Range, with 2 Fire Boxes cf.sample | ?          | ?     |\n| 1 only   | Typewriter, Carriage 18 inches. | 90.00      | 90.00 |\n| 2 only   | Typewriter Tables No.52 Moyer School Supplies Saskatoon | 19.25      | 38.50 |\n| 1 only   | Potatoe Peeler, Mid-West Soap, Winnipeg. | 400.00     | 400.00|\n| 1 only   | Darning Machine, Singer Machine Co.

Derby regarding this.\n\nHe states that an Agent (of the Company) is entirely responsible for any trade-in of reconditioned equipment which he sells. He also states that the equipment purchased will carry the same guarantee as new equipment.\n\nIn a letter received later he states that there must have been some misunderstanding in the order, but it can be adjusted at their Regina office and asks to have the cheque made payable to the Company.\n\nI have corrected the voucher to make it payable to J.R. Stephenson & Co., C/o C.H.

Indian Agent Mr. R.S. Davis has made arrangements to loan to the Muscowequan School this necessary equipment from the Gordon's Indian Residential School, which cannot be opened for some time. Quite probably it will not be open until the first of September, 1948.\n\nIf it is decided that the Department will supply the additional equipment to the Muscowequan School I shall instruct Reverend Father Robidoux to submit the necessary requisition.\n\nPlease instruct me in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B.

School\nLestock Sack.\nFeb. 25th 148\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief Training Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nAfter waiting two long months to thank you for my motor I have nothing but bad news again today. The motor sent on December the 30th by the Beaver Co was too weak and had to be sent back. It was found in perfect order and sent back again with a bill of $27.18 for looking it up but it still doesn't work.\n\nTo-day the Company wired asking for the whole thing, extractor and motor.\n\nAll this business has been made by wire except the \"transportation\" that took almost three months.\n\nHere comes my part. I just can't go any further like this, my second hand small\nwinger sent by the Department three years ago being completely ruined and another one, put on a pulley by Father, also finished, I just have to keep on washing till my extractor comes back and that will be when??\n\nWhat would be the best for me is a small electric washer with attached wringer that I could use even after I get my extractor. It would save time and soft water, so hard to get here, giving small batches of clothes the chance to be washed apart.\n\nIt would be very handy right now with the epidemic of jaundice we have in the house, and so many bed clothes to disinfect and wash away from the rest.\n\nAfter almost three long years of hard work and patient waiting I feel assured the Department can't refuse me this favor and help\u2014and I count on you Mr Phelan, to be my intercessor.\n\nIf it's just the question of finding a washer that bothers you, give permission to Father Principal to get me one and I'll have it for my next washing day.\n\nI'm lucky my high pressure steam boiler is\nin his hands for repairs right now instead of in a slow Company's like Beaver! Too bad the extractor was not left in his hands too, I would have had it years ago! and with big saving to the Department.\n\nIf he were not so short of money he would buy me a machine and wringer right away but at the present time it wouldn't be fair to ask him for that.\n\nHe is making so many extra expenses and working so hard all the time to make our work easier that we feel sorry for him. Your Muscowequan School is in capable and devoted hands and you may be sure that all you do for its sake is greatly appreciated.\n\nTrusting in God's help and yours\n\nI am your truly,\n\nSr Mary Arthur\nMarch 1st, 1948\n\nTo the Depa.

Ottawa.\n\nThe motor on the extractor at the Muscowequan Residential School which was originally purchased from the Beaver Washing Machine Co., burned out approximately three years ago. We returned the extractor to the Beaver Machine Co., to install a new motor but they installed a three phase motor instead of a one phase motor. Since that time we have been in constant communication with them and they claim that they could only secure the type of motor required in the United States.\n\nFinally, last fall they secured a motor which we considered would be suitable and it was sent to our school. We have just been advised that this motor does not operate the machine properly and as a consequence, the extractor will again have to be sent to Toronto. In the meantime, the school is left without adequate washing facilities. This school has an authorized pupilage of 103. It is essential that some washing facilities should be made available as it may take several months before the extractor is returned to the school.\n\nWe have received an urgent request from the principal this morning to supply the type of machine mentioned above which will handle the work temporarily.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

In the meantime, arrangements have been made to secure a Connor Thermo Monel Washer and this is going forward to you immediately and I hope it will reach you in the near future and will be of assistance to you temporarily until your own washer is returned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Ostrender, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe received your telegram of March 16th with reference to the beds supplied for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. The beds were requested on your requisition of November 12, 1947 and later purchase order 24963 was issued.\n\nWe cannot understand why the company should forward hospital beds to you as we ordered the usual institutional beds.\n\nFor your information I enclose specifications of the beds and springs which we ordered and if they are not in accordance with these specifications, you may return them to the company. At the same time you should advise us so that we can communicate with the Globe Bedding Company and arrange to have the proper beds and springs delivered.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nc/o to R.S.Davis.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nOn November 13, 1947, I forwarded a requisition for supplies for the Muscowequan Indian Residential School in which was included 25 beds and mattresses.\n\nOn or about December 20, 1947, 25 beds size 2ft 6\" by 5 ft 6\" and mattresses for same were received at the school and vouchered for by my voucher #1080 dated December 20, 1947.\n\nThe order number shown on the account from the Globe Bedding Company, Winnipeg, Man., was #24068.\n\nAnother shipment of 25 beds and mattresses from the Elebe Bedding Company Ltd Winnipeg, Man., has been received at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School as enclosed accounts. As you will see, these beds are 3 ft wide and too large for children, and in any case are not required by the school. These appear to have been ordered by Purchasing order #24963.\n\nThe beds appear to be for an older person. Is it possible these have been ordered for some other place and sent to the school by mistake.\n\nPlease advise me by wire what you would like done with these as I am still holding them at the station.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, March 23, 1948.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the beds and mattresses which recently arrived at Lestock, Sask. When we received the message from Mr. Ostrander on March 16th we understood that the point at issue was that hospital beds had been supplied instead of institutional beds. No doubt you have received by this time the copy of our letter to Mr. Ostrander dated March 19th.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of March 20th I reviewed our file and find on the request of the principal we ordered 25 beds and 25 mattresses in October and as you state, these reached the school and the account covering their cost has been paid. When we received your letter of November 13th, we overlooked the fact that we had already ordered beds and mattresses and consequently another order was placed for them.\n\nPlease consult with Mr. Ostrander and ascertain if there is any other residential school that requires beds and mattresses and if so, you may ship them to them. The account may be certified and returned so that payment can be made from our appropriation.\n\nBernard F.

According to your figures, the total cost of the paint is approximately $1,067.85. We would also like more information regarding the dryer. The amount involved in this particular instance is apparently slightly over $402.00.\n\nWhile you give prices for the various items requested, you do not state in all cases from where these items can be secured at the prices mentioned.\n\nIf all the items requested on this recent requisition are supplied, the total expenditure will be in the neighbourhood of $1,500.00. It should be distinctly understood by the principal of the Muscowequan School that if we proceed with the purchase of the items just mentioned at the approximate cost shown above, it will mean that the total amount provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 for repairs and improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Muscowequan School will be exhausted and we will not be in a position to consider any further requests from them during the balance of the current fiscal year.\n\nBernard F.

Robidoux, Principal of the Muscowequan School, phoned the office this afternoon stating he had received a wire from Mr. Neary, requesting that the account be forwarded by airmail at once. The range had been received at the school this afternoon.\n\nAs this appears to be urgent, I am forwarding voucher without the receipted freight bill for $32.50 and will send this on when received here.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Department letter 121-5-5 (El) dated April 22, 1948, I have taken up the matter of the expenditure of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School with the Principal, as requested, and he has reduced the amount of paint required as he will not do some of the work this year.\n\nI am enclosing herewith amended requisition for the paint. Fr. Robidoux has taken his prices for this from Ashdown's catalogue. However, if this was ordered from Sherwin-Williams Paint Company, Winnipeg, it would reduce the cost considerably as they allow us manufacturer's price, which is below the wholesale price.\n\nWith reference to the dryer. I am enclosing herewith a drawing of the dryer. A lot of work has been done already by the Father on this as it is necessary to have some place to dry the cloths. These were hanging all over the engine room, halls and everything else. When completed I consider it will cost quite a bit more than shown on the requisition as Fr. Robideux and Brother Boulet have been doing a lot of work on this which cost will be born by the school.\n\nI would recommend that if possible this expenditure be approved.\n\nR.B.

The Reverend Principal would now like authority to forward this account for payment in order to reimburse the School.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nJuly 13, 1948.\n\nMr. S.H.

As you are aware of our purchasing regulations expenditures over $100.00 have to be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nIt is noted that the principal has ignored our regulations and has purchased a unit heater and paid for it from school funds.

Electric current is supplied to the motor from an electric light socket through a cord as shown in Fig. 210. Any desired speed, up to 1000 stitches a minute, may be obtained by varying the pressure of the foot on the lever of the controller, which is placed on the floor next to the treadle, as shown in Fig. 212, or by the pressure of the knee lever shown in Figs. 216 and 219.\n\nWhen running at full speed the motor consumes about the same current as a 50 watt electric lamp. As most sewing is done intermittently and at various speeds according to the nature of the work, the average cost of operation is about one cent for four hours of sewing.\n\nAll working parts of this motor are entirely enclosed and absolutely safe. The wiring is the same as on other electric appliances such as fans, toasters, irons, etc., and may be handled in the same manner.\n\nElectric Lights for Sewing Machines\n\nThe problem of proper illumination for sewing has been solved by the use of a small electric lamp attached to the machine and arranged to throw the rays of light on the bed of the machine without glaring into the eyes of the operator. Fig. 211 shows this ingenious device, known as the \"Singerlight,\" attached to the back of the arm and connected by a short cord to the cord supplying electricity to the motor. When\nthe machine has no motor attached, a longer cord is furnished for the light. The lamp consumes only 15 watts, making the cost of electricity negligible. The amount of light is just right for either light or dark goods and the location of the lamp is such as not to interfere with the free passage of goods under the arm, even on bulky work.\n\nWith such a light, sewing may be done without eye strain in any part of the home at any time. It is unnecessary to move the machine near a window to get good light or to wait for a bright day to do your sewing. Artificial illumination usually found in homes is generally unsatisfactory for sewing, being insufficient or casting shadows on the work. The practice of placing oil, gas or electric lights on the leaf of the machine or a nearby table is dangerous, as they are so easily knocked off.\n\n**Various Types of Electric Sewing Machines**\n\nElectric sewing machines are of three principal types: treadle machines with a motor attached, portable machines and cabinet table machines.\n\nThe older form of electric sewing machine is the ordinary treadle machine to which a motor has been added, as shown in Fig. 212. The motor is attached with a single screw to the seat on the arm below the balance wheel, the regular belt removed, the motor belt put on its place, the motor cord screwed into an electric light socket, the foot control box connected to the motor cord and the treadle machine has become an electric. The whole process takes only a few minutes and can be done by anyone without electrical or mechanical skill. Should it ever become necessary to revert back to treadle operation, this can be done by removing the motor belt and putting on the belt running from the band.\nKuscowequan Indian Residential School,\nLestock, Sask.,\nNovember 8, 1948\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI thank you for giving your kind attention to my previous letter, and will try to give a satisfactory answer to your favour of the 5th instant.\n\nI believe it is necessary to attach Singerlights to the sewing machines to give proper illumination to each operator, especially during the long winter months, the regular sewing hour being from 5 to 6 p.m.; our pupils being now allowed to attend class all day, giving them, thus, the opportunity to achieve their school grades.\n\nIt is not that our sewing room is not conveniently illuminated; but, the bulbs suspended at 18\" from the ceiling that is 5 ft. from the sewing machines, don't give enough light to the students; and, if they were lowered their rays would glare in the eyes of the operators, which, of course, would not be of any help.\n\nI've always wondered myself why the sewing instructors of our Indian Schools have never thought of asking the Department for those wonderful singerlights so justly appreciated in all sewing circles and obtainable as per illustration herein enclosed - at the reasonable cost of $2.50 from any of the Singer shops. And, since I'm now appointed to teach sewing to the Indian girls, I think it fair to try to have my pupils share the benefit of the singerlights.\n\nWe have actually 12 sewing machines all in fairly good condition on which 36 of our older girls take sewing lessons.\n\nWe would be deeply grateful to you, dear Mr. Phelan, if you could possibly supply our School with a good electric Darning machine; we have been unsuccessfully asking for one since several years ago; we understand that during the war these machines were unavailable, but, if you could now be favoured with one, it would help so much of the pupils to get rid sooner of the tedious chore of the mending and enable them to learn many pleasant things so useful for their future home life.\n\nPlease excuse me, dear Mr. Phelan, for the length of this letter, but I thought these details might help to convince you that my request for the \"singerlights\" was not, after all, quite so extravagant as it may have seemed at first.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nSister St. Michael,\nSewing instructor\nNovember 30, 1948.\n\nRev.

Nixon,\nA/Supt., Indian Agency,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant with further reference to a request for lighting fixtures at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. We understand from your letter that the Principal and yourself consider that there should be better lighting arrangements in the sewing room. We are not satisfied that the items mentioned on the Principal's requisition are what is required.\n\nNo doubt the representative of the Saskatchewan Hydro Commission would be prepared to give expert advice and advise the Principal exactly what is needed.\n\nPlease advise the Principal accordingly and if the Hydro official is prepared to recommend what is really required, another requisition can be forwarded.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5 part 8)\nOttawa, April 21, 1949.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Muscowequan Indian Residential School #657, Touchwood Indian Agency, Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to Major MacKay's memorandum of April 12th which bears your marginal notation of the 13th instant in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nA study of the original plans reveals that the building was erected in 1930-1931 and that the original heating system was designed for two pipe low pressure steam with two 5000 square foot capacity return tubular low pressure steam steel heating boilers. The layout of piping according to the plans, is along conventional lines and the accessories including steam traps, valves, etcetera, are of a type in general use at the time the work was installed. No return pump was called for. Condensation is returned to the boilers through a combination boiler return trap and air eliminator assembly.\n\nIf this assembly is still in use, it can be reasonably assumed that the interior mechanism would not be in good operating condition after so many years of service as there is a tendency for rust and scale to develop.\n\nMr. MacKay's memorandum contains a suggestion to convert this system to a vacuum return type as a means of improving the performance of the heating system.\n\nIn a building which has been up for nineteen years, this operation would involve work of a major character and it is questionable at this time whether such a changeover would be warranted. In order to convert to a vacuum return system, not only is a vacuum pump required but every section of piping and all fittings including valves, traps, etcetera, must be thoroughly checked for minute air and steam leaks. It is possible that all the radiator traps would have to be replaced, and it is a certainty that new traps would have to be provided at the ends of all steam mains.\n\nWe are writing to Mr. Perrie requesting him to carry out an inspection based on a questionnaire prepared by this Division. It is expected that following receipt of this survey, we will be able to make recommendations designed to improve the heating system without the necessity of changing over to a vacuum design.\n\nWhen Mr. Perrie's data is received and analysed you will be further advised.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n28th April, 1949.\n\nMr. J.F.B.

All moving parts of 1-A are interchangeable and function by the physical law of centrifugal force, rather than by any mechanical means pervious to wear.\n\n1-A IS EASIER, FASTER\n\nThe perfect efficiency with which the double directional spray lines of Model 1-A and other Jackson Models function, distributing water under high pressure over every square inch of the machine's inner surface, increases the speed of the dishwashing procedure, because of the thoroughness with which it washes, rinses, and sanitizes dishes, glasses, and silverware. The revolving hood of 1-A provides the operator with a means of using the machine without regard for his own position. Correctly installed, with basket supports flush with level of drainboard or dish table, operators do not have to lift wet dishes from the beginning to the end of the dishwashing process. However, if desired it is compact enough so it can be set on a drain board.\n\nThis view of Model 1-A shows simplicity of construction in three prime essentials: Body, a one-piece casting containing built-in wash and rinse reservoirs; revolving hood, suspended from natural pivot point of top piping connection; circulatory system\u2014single hot water intake supplies water for both wash and rinse reservoirs, part of which is routed from rinse reservoir to upper rinse spray through supporting pipe shown on right.\n\nBasket for glass and silverware is part of 1-A's standard equipment; sturdy all-steel wire welded construction.\nJACKSON DISHWASHER\n\nPIVOT SUPPORT \u2014 A\nAllows suspended hood to revolve freely through its full circumference and in either direction, so that container baskets may be inserted from one side of the dish table and removed from the other\u2014which also includes upper revolving rinse spray.\n\nBASKET \u2014 B\nAll-welded steel wire construction has proven its ability to hold as many dishes as other baskets twice its size, are easier and lighter to handle, more sanitary and will not rust like other makes. Coated with a protective compound which will not mark dishes.\n\nMOTOR \u2014 C\n\u00bc horsepower electric motor.\n\nPLUGS \u2014 D\nRemovable so that electric immersion heaters may be installed.\n\nSINGLE CONTROL VALVE \u2014 E\nControls the entire water system. Both for filling reservoirs and doing the rinsing.\n\nSINGLE PUMP ASSEMBLY \u2014 F\nWhich incorporates shaft, bearings. Easily interchangeable.\n\nREVOLVING HOOD \u2014 L\nContains a slide panel opening which may be turned to any position in the hood\u2019s orbit, thus providing for ease and convenience in operation.\n\nRINSE RESERVOIR \u2014 K\nIncorporated into the single-piece casting which is the body of the I-A machine, the rinse reservoir is always full with 3 quarts of fresh hot water under pressure which may be brought up to desired temperature during the brief period of the washing operation if sufficient hot water is not supplied from the tap.\n\nWASH RESERVOIR \u2014 J\nCapacity, approximately 3 gallons. It is supplied directly from the rinse reservoir, receives a constant supply of fresh hot water during the rinsing operations.\n\nDRAIN \u2014 I\nPlaced 1\u00bd inch directly underneath so that connections may be made at any angle.\n\nINTAKE \u2014 H\nThree-fourths inch threaded inlet for hot water is the only water inlet on the machine.\n\nLEG PLUGS \u2014 G\nTapped for three-fourths inch standard pipe. Tubular legs can be extended to desired height.\nCompact DISHWASHING COMPARTMENT with in-and-out openings makes possible use in Limited Space\n\nIN ONE SIDE \u2014 OUT THE OTHER!\n\nModified closure of Jackson Model 1-A Dishwasher permits convenient installations in small spaces. This type closure, opening in both sides as shown, is an exclusive Jackson 1-A feature which greatly facilitates operations. Speedier, cleaner, more convenient, it also safeguards dishes; they do not have to be lifted from table or drainboard from start to finish of washing-rinsing process.\n\nCOMBINATION STRAINER-OVERFLOW-DRAIN PLUG \u2014 A\n\nAn exclusive foolproof feature insures against flooding of machine and prevents damage to parts through clogging. No foreign matter can get in pump or sprays as long as strainer is in position, and water will not circulate through system when strainer is not in position.\n\nAUXILIARY STRAINER \u2014 B\n\nAdded protection; to be placed in front of pump.\n\nBASKET SUPPORT RODS \u2014 C\n\nSturdy steel rods may be brought flush with surface of dish table when machine is countersunk in it, thus allowing baskets to be slid in and out without lifting.\n\nDOUBLE-REVOLVING WASH SPRAY \u2014 D\n\nDistributes water with even pressure to every square inch of the interior surface. These spray tubes are accessible and may be taken out for cleaning without the need of special tools.\n\nLOWER RINSE SPRAYS \u2014 E\n\nANOTHER NEAT INSTALLATION\n\nWhen use of the space-saving revolving hood on Jackson Dishwasher Model 1-A is not desired, it may be installed as shown here. The width of the table here illustrated is sufficient to allow the operator to insert baskets from the front of the machine's hood. For convenience, counter surfaces may be built up behind hood supports to bring flush with the table surface during the installation process. This facilitates handling of baskets by permitting operator to insert and withdraw them without lifting. This type of installation requires a table not less than 30 inches in width. However, if desired it is compact enough so it can be set on a drain board.\nThe JACKSON METHOD of dishwashing cleans more pieces per hour with less water, less power, less labor.\n\nBY FORCE-SPRAYING, RECIRCULATION\n\nAll Jackson Dishwashers function on a principle of hydraulic force applied through a designated area. This is not a random force, as built up in the regular \"spinning\" method of mechanical dishwashing, but is carefully calculated and directed against every bit of exposed dish surface. Spray arms of Jackson machines are staggered to direct forceful water streams outward, upward, through the basket-container area, from the orbits through which they revolve both clockwise and counterclockwise (to cover the front and back areas). Although the Jackson Method features a constant play of solution water over the entire inner surface of the machine, yet it does not consume any more than the modest amount of water used during the 10 second rinsing operation. This is due to the water's being recirculated through the machine, which not only assures thermal stability, but permits use of a minimum amount of dish cleanser compound. Wash water may be recirculated through a Jackson machine without becoming contaminated due to the fact that the greasy water cannot get out continuously. You see, the Jackson combination strainer-overflow-drain plate seizes all particles of food and residue. A basket of glasses may be alternated with a basket of greasy dishes and yet they will come out sparkling clean. Hot water should be held at not less than 140 degrees for washing. Rinse water should be not less than 170 degrees. Temperature drop of only 30 degrees occurs in its passage to the wash reservoir and through the machine's circulation system, so that no other thermal control is needed. The heavy one piece casting once heated helps to maintain the proper temperature in both the wash and rinse reservoirs.\n\nJACKSON DISHWASHER \u2014 Model 1-A\n\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT\n\nMotor: 60 cycle, 110 volts, AC (DC optional at slight extra cost).\nTwo Dish Baskets, coated to protect dishes.\nOne Combination Glass and Silver Basket of all steel wire, welded construction.\nOne Extension Cord ready to plug in.\n\nDIMENSIONS\n\nHeight: 33\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\".\nDiameter: 20\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\".\n\nCLEANING OPERATION\n\nA \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) h.p. motor operates a centrifugal pump, recirculating the water from the reservoir through double spray arms, each with four nozzles alternated on each, revolving in opposite directions.

This is not a random force, as built up in the regular \"splash\" method of mechanical dishwashing, but is carefully calculated and directed to wash every bit of exposed dish surface. Sprays around Jackson machines are staggered to direct forceful water streams outward upward, through the basket-container area, from the orbits through which they revolve both clockwise and counter-clockwise (to cover both front and back areas). Although the Jackson Method features a constant stream of solution water over the entire inside surface of the machine, yet it does not consume any more than the modest amount of water used during the 10 second rinsing operation. This is due to the water's being recirculated through the machine, which not only assures thermal stability, but permits use of a minimum amount of dish cleanser compound.

A basket of glasses may be alternated with a basket of greasy dishes and yet they will come out sparkling clean. Hot water should be held at not less than 140 degrees for washing. Rinse water should not be less than 175 degrees.

Perrie, Supervising Engineer, on his inspection of the roofs of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, dated June 23rd, 1949, his file I A 556-6.\n\nThe Acting Superintendent of the Touchwood Agency had forwarded to this office a quotation of Messrs. F. Steele and Company, Yorkton, Saskatchewan for material $1475 and labour $1,000 for repairing the roofs in question. The requisitions were held up pending Mr. Perrie's report. Upon receipt of Mr. Perrie's report, which gave an estimate of $1250 for the same work, I asked Mr. Nixon, Acting Superintendent, Touchwood Agency to get in touch with Messrs. F. Steele and Company, and if possible other contractors to endeavor to get a quotation somewhat nearer to the estimate of Mr. Perrie.\n\nMr. Nixon again discussed the matter with Messrs. F. Steele and Company, and their only suggestion was they would take the job on a cost plus an hourly basis and that it might be somewhat less than the total cost of $275, but they could not guarantee any less. There is no other contractor in the Pimicikamik area who would be interested in this work, therefore, I discussed the matter with Mr. Perrie today, and he informed me that the figures were obtained from Westeel Products Limited of Regina, at their regular prices, for the finished job.\n\nAs Lestock comes in the Saskatoon territory of the Westeel Products Limited, I would recommend that a roofing man of Westeel Products Limited, Saskatoon be asked to visit the Muscowequan School on a date suitable to Mr. Perrie or his Assistant, with a view to securing from that company a definite tender for the work, which I am sure will be a reasonable price.\n\nMay I be given instructions in this case at the earliest possible date, please, as some parts of the roofs are in very bad condition resulting in bad leaks in rainy weather and in further damage to interior plaster and other materials.\n\nJ.P.B.

The complaint was that there was unnecessary delay in obtaining approval for the purchase of such machine even though Reverend F.O. Robideaux of this School was most anxious to have it. May I have your comments or does this come under the church organization?\n\nJ.S. Levy,\nPrivate Secretary\n\nMr. MacKay\nFor report, please.\n\nJuly 20 - 3:30\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\n- DEPUTY MINISTER -\n\nAttention: Mr. J.G. Levy,\nPrivate Secretary\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of July 20th, the Muscowequan Indian Residential School is a Government-owned building and is operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nWe have reviewed our file and cannot find any record of having received a request to supply an automatic stoker. Such equipment is only supplied after careful investigation has been made of the requirements at the school.\n\nIf the Principal, Reverend F.O. Robideaux, considers that a stoker is necessary, he should submit the matter to Acting Superintendent A.R. Nixon, who in turn will communicate with Regional Supervisor Ostrander. The latter will then make a recommendation to Head Office.\n\nPP/ST Acting Director.\nOttawa, July 18, 1949.\n\nRe Roof Repairs, Muscowequan Residential School, Touchwood Agency, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe are in receipt of a report dated June 23, 1949, from Mr. W.W. Perrie, Supervising Engineer at our Regina office. He states Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs, Saskatchewan, requested an inspection of the roof of the above school, which was reported to be leaking badly.\n\nThe first report of roof leakage appears to be on September 24, 1936, when the building had been erected for some eight years. The roof was reported to be in bad condition and at that time, it was recommended to be relaid.\n\nThe roof of the main building was relaid in 1942 at a cost of $1,725.00. It now appears that the roofs of the entire establishment are leaking, causing distress to occupants, and damage to ceilings, partitions and interior walls. The main roof seems to be holding up with the exception of flashings around drains, ventilators and parapet walls.\n\nThe report contains no reference to any structural defects in the roof construction, undue settlement or shrinkage, so it must be assumed that workmanship and economical use of flashing and roofing materials are at fault. We have checked the original plans for structural strength, and if installed as shown, no fault can be found with the structural steel design, which plans indicate as web steel joists and steel beams.\n\nThe essentials of the report show that certain roofs must be entirely relaid, others will be satisfactory with portions of roof relaid, while considerable repairs to the flashing is required. The estimated cost of the work is $1,250.00 plus contingencies $125.00, and engineering services and inspection of $350.00, a total of $1,725.00. Mr. Perrie advises that the work should be done immediately as the leaking from roof areas was very bad during recent heavy rains.\n\nWe attach a copy of Mr. W.W. Perrie's report and white print showing itemized roof areas for the information of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nFor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A.

Leaking on side against main building. Water apparently works up under flashing.\n\n13. This roof leaks badly and should be renewed.\n\n14. No surfacing cover over the paper on this roof. Not leaking at present but should have seal cover.\n\n15. Leaks badly. Should have new covering. Stone capping loose and should be reset.\n\n16. O.K. at present.\n\n17. Leaks badly and should be renewed.\n\nUnder separate cover I am forwarding to you the original and two blue print copies of a plan showing the above roof areas. The hatching shows the repair areas.\n\nThe cost of the repairs and new roofing required at this School is estimated as follows:\n\nComplete surfacing roofs 2, 3, 5, 6:\n8, 13, 15 and 17 - $593.58\n\nSealing roof No. 14:\n900 sq. ft @ $9.00 per 100 = $81.00\n\nRepairs around flashing:\nApprox 500 lin. ft @ $70 = $350.00\n\nPatching various locations:\nApprox 400 sq. ft @ $20.00 per 100 = $80.00\n\nNew flashing, 100 lin. ft @ $60 = $60.00\n\nReset capping, etc. = $11.12\n\n$1250.00\n\nThese repairs could be made by a Regina or Saskatoon roofer and the work should be done immediately as the leaking from the roof areas at the School was very bad during recent heavy rains.\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6319, file 657-5 part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. J. P. R. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor, Indian Affairs, Saskatchewan, interviewed me some time ago and requested that, when inspection work was being carried out at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, an inspection be made of the roof, which was reported to be leaking badly.\n\nThe roof of the school was inspected on June 10, 1949 and the following notes are forwarded for your consideration:\n\nRoof No.\n\n1. This roof seems to be in good shape but leaks badly at times, especially around the drain. Sides below flashing are not sealed tight. Flashing loose along top in places.\n\n2. Roof, at present, apparently only paper, covered by tar. Leaking very badly. Requires proper bonded roof. No drain cover. Flashing not tight.\n\n3. Old roof patched some time ago but new roofing is required over entire surface. Flashing in good shape except for two or three places.\n\n4. Water lies on north side around drain. Needs repair on north side and around flashing.\n\n5. Paper exposed. Needs patching. Should clean off gravel and recover whole surface.\n\n6. Needs cleaning off and refinishing. Not leaking at present but should be done while working on other roof areas, to prevent leaking in near future.\n\n7. Not leaking at present but paper bare in places. Drainage poor.\n\n8. Over verandahs. This roof leaks badly. Should be recovered.\n\n9. New in good shape. 4 inch drain pipe from roof above empties directly on to this roof and water from drain is washing off gravel cover.\n\n10. Main roof. This roof was resurfaced in 1942 but is leaking badly around drains and ventilators. Was apparently not properly sealed around flashing on walls and ventilators.\n\n11. Not leaking at present but paper exposed in places. Needs maintenance.\n\n... to page 2 please ...\nFurther to our memorandum of April 21st with reference to the above, you are advised that we are in receipt of a report from Mr. Perrie dated July 6th covering his inspection trip to this school. Mr. Perrie's report may be summed up as follows.\n\nFrom his observations together with advice received from the Principal and the operating engineer, the heating system appears to be fundamentally sound in general. It is stated that the Sewing Room and Girls' Classroom on the ground floor and the Boys' Dormitory on the first floor are difficult to heat in the cold weather. It is the unanimous opinion of Mr. Perrie, the Principal and the operating engineer that this difficulty is not due to faulty traps. Mr. Perrie reports that the condensation from these areas does not return freely to the boiler return trap. He also states that the \"injector\" which we take to be the boiler return trap does not function satisfactorily. It was also noted that the return lines in certain sections of the building showed signs of sagging which would account in some measure for the retarded circulation. The report states that the pipe gradients are generally satisfactory as far as can be observed. We are advised that the high pressure boiler which serves several items of laundry equipment has been condemned by the Provincial Boiler Inspector.\n\nAfter a careful study of Mr. Perrie's report together with a thorough examination of the original heating plans, we can offer the following comment and recommendations:\n\nThere is no reason to doubt that the heating system was installed in accordance with the original plans. These plans are well laid out in general and with one or two minor exceptions, can be considered to contain the elements of good design. Upon calculating the heat loss in the Girls' Sewing Room, Boys' Classroom and Boys' Dormitory it was found that additional radiation will be required to bring these rooms up to 70 degrees F. against the recognized 35 degrees F. below zero outside base temperature. It will also be necessary to check the gradient of all the return mains and to re-grade some where necessary down in the direction of flow 1/4\" in 10'-0\". All run outs from steam and return mains to ground floor radiators and risers must also be checked for proper gradient. These lines should be graded back to mains 1/4\" per foot.\n\nR.A.

This will entail some minor piping revisions at the boilers.\n\nA new vertical high pressure boiler is needed for the laundry services. In conclusion it is therefore recommended, on the strength of Mr. Perrie's report together with data obtained from the original plans, that the following operations be carried out in order to bring the heating system up to a reasonable standard.\n\n(a) Install an additional 40 square feet E.D.R. in the Sewing Room.\n\n(b) Install an additional 30 square feet E.D.R. in the Girls' Classroom.\n\n(c) Install an additional 60 square feet E.D.R. in the Boys' Dormitory.\n\n(d) Check return mains throughout and re-grade where necessary by means of shortening some connections, adjusting hangers, etcetera. Check and adjust grade of all run outs and spring pieces to ground floor radiator connections and to risers.\n\n(e) Install new horizontal condensation pump and connect to boilers using the Hartford loop arrangement.\n\n(f) Provide new 10 H.P. high pressure vertical steel boiler for laundry services.\n\nUntil a layout can be made it will not be possible to provide an accurate estimate of the cost of the above work, but it is felt that the sum of $3,000.00 will be required.\n\nChas.

So far as the pamphlets are concerned I could not check this, as the pamphlets were said to have been sent with the requisition. However, I cannot imagine anyone making an error to the extent that the requisition did not agree with the pamphlets.\n\nI do not know of a residential school needing a dough mixer at the present time, and I do not like to circularize the schools with that in view, as I do not consider it a very good policy.

School,\nLestock, Sask.\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI just received your letter of the 12th inst (File No. 121 - 5 - IO) regarding the discharge of Dan Kennedy's son.\n\nI would object to Gordon's discharge, for the false reasons Mr. Kennedy has given and the discredit he is throwing upon our School.\n\nWhen this boy came to our School in Oct. 1932, he could not follow our 3rd Grade, so he had to pass a year and a half in the same class, then he was promoted to the 4th, then to the 5th, where he now stands, contrary to what Mr. Kennedy wrote.\n\nNow regarding their remark about the \"over emphasis Religious Instruction we are giving here, to the detriment of Academic Instruction\". This is absolutely false. The boys of Grades 4 and 5 are together for religious Instruction and they receive 1/2 hour a day of Religious Instruction. Should the Rel.

This is absolutely false. The boys of Grades 4 and 5 are together for religious instruction and they receive 1/2 hour a day of religious instruction. Should the Rel. Inst. be to the detriment of Academic Inst. - as Mr. Kennedy said - we would not have been 2nd for the province of Sask. for the prizes of Class-Work won at the Regina Exhibition this Summer. Our School won 70 prizes for Class Work only. Mr. Murison and Mr. Moir - our School Inspector - could tell you what they think regarding the good standing of our School.\n\nThe only reason, Mr. Kennedy has is to distinguish himself from the others and to keep the boy at home but my opinion is that he should have said it frankly without throwing any discredit upon our School. I would like very much to have the boy return until he'll be 16, then he would be prepared for his admission to High School.\"\n\nThe Department is not prepared to allow any amount for the tuition of Dan Kennedy's son at the public school at Montmartre. It is considered that he should continue attending the Muscowequan Residential School during the coming academic year, and his discharge from that school at the present time cannot be approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.H.

I am verily informed that to comply with the Education Act, that so long as my children are receiving the proper education as prescribed by the Saskatchewan School Act, that this ten mile grant at any place set apart for the education of pupils. Therefore it is my intention to discontinue to send my children to the Muscowequon Indian Mission School, and to send them to the Virag School District, where I verily believe that they will obtain better education than they have been getting at the Mission. For your information I myself did attend at this same Mission School when I was a boy for twelve long years, and can scarcely read a newspaper now, I do not wish to go into this matter, but, I am not satisfied with the education my children are getting, there: I respectfully beg for a permit to avoid further trouble with the school principal with regard to the attendance of my children at the said school.\n\nYour reply will be earnestly awaited.\n\nYours truly\n\nJ. B. Desjarlais\nOttawa, September 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from J. B. Desjarlais, in which he applies for the discharge of his two children from the Muscowequan Indian Residential School. Please inform Desjarlais that the Department is not prepared to grant the discharge of these children at the present time and that they must remain in the Muscowequan School.\n\nIn his letter, Desjarlais complains that his children are not making satisfactory progress in their studies. The Department does not place much reliance in this statement, as the report of Inspector R. C. Moir, who inspected the school on January 9th, last, read in part as follows:\n\n\"The work in all three classrooms shows continued expansion. The problem of oral language is being attacked on many sides. Written language and drawing continue to be the 'show' work of the school. I found need of systematic drill in the mechanics of arithmetic, a need which has already been felt by the teachers and is being met. Among the junior pupils I noted a freedom and happiness, a spontaneity which I thought desirable.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland.\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. W.

Information supplied at that time indicated that Folstrom is an American Indian, who, previous to 1931, had resided for about twelve years near Lestock, Saskatchewan.\n\nAt that time Mr. Waddy was informed that the Department did not consider these children our wards and therefore we were not prepared to consider admitting them to any Indian residential school. After carefully considering the present application, I can see no reason for changing the decision made in 1931.\n\nFrom the information we have received, I am inclined to feel that Folstrom is entitled to send his children to a \"white\" school. If he has lived in the Province for some 15 years he is entitled to the same privileges in regard to education as to any other resident.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

No-one by the names above mentioned was known to be on the reserve, but an Indian or half-breed living near the reserve by the name of Magnus COURTOIS, was interviewed who had a brother attending Leestock school by the name of Alex COURTOIS, which is possibly the person referred to as missing.

There are no Indians on Valley River Reserve named FLATFOOT, although there are Indians by that name living at the Pine Creek Reserve, not in this detachment area.\n\n3. The Indian overseer from the Valley River Reserve called at this detachment on the evening of 5-11-37, and said that three boys were seen by an Indian getting on a box car, on a train (freight) going east on the afternoon of 4-11-37, from Dauphin, on the Indian reservation.\n\n4.

On the 21st ultimo this office was notified by Cpl.

The three boys described as follows: Telegram received from Mr. J. Jeannette Lestock and received by J. White, Indian Agent this point.\n\nAlex. CONTIS: 15 Years, Tall and Thin, from Longplains Reserve, wearing: Overalls, Sweater, Smock, Light Blue cap- Leather Boots.\nAugustin Flatfoot: 14 Years, Short from Flatfoot Reserve transferred from Lebret School, wearing Overalls-Black Cap- Leather windbreaker & boots.\nAlbert McGregor: 11 Years, 4' 10\" from Lestock wearing Overalls- Gray Cap-Sweater and Smock-Rubber boots.\n\nOn the 11-11 and acting on instructions received from the M.C.O., this Detachment the writer patrolled to the Westbourne district per P.C. #1666 where enquiries were made among the local Indians with respect to the boys above mentioned but in this connection replies were in the negative no boys as described having been seen by any of the Indians interviewed. These inquiries were instructed to notify this or Gladstone Detachments by telephone should the boys show up. In view of the fact that the Indian families at this time are very few in the Westbourne district, the majority having left for their respective reserves, it is doubtful if the boys would show up in Westbourne, not being known by the Indians still remaining.\n\nOn the 3rd instant while in the Westbourne district on other duties further enquiries were made by Cpl. Alcock with negative results. This information was given to the Indian Agent who stated that he was in receipt of further information to the effect that these boys may have gone to Shortdale, Man., and he has communicated direct with Inspector i/o Dauphin S/Div., with a request for a check at that point.\n\nAs no trace of these boys could be found in this district and it is possible they are in the Dauphin S/Div area this file is being considered as:\n\nThe G.C.

While in Lestock on this date on other police\nduties I was met by the Rev.Father Jeanotte- Principal\nof the Mescowegan Indian Residential School- Lestock,\nSask., who advised me that six of the Indian school boys\nof the said school had run away, and it had been uncertain-\ned that the boys had boarded a freight train and gone East.\nAs a result Father Jeanotte telephoned direct to the RCMP,\nat Melville for a look out to be kept for the boys and\ndetained if located. One of the boys, Hilliard Borm was duly\nlocated at Melville and held, I was in turn notified and\nadvised Father Jeanotte who went for the boy and returned\nhim from Melville back to the school (please refer to rept.\nof Capt.Shank-Melville-dated Oct.26th/37. Reg:Hilliard worm-\nRunaway Indian boy- Lestock,Sask.)\n\n2. A few days later I was further advised by Father\nJeanotte that two of the other boys (Salter Wolf- and\nAlex. Asdechonah) had also been returned to the school, and\nat this time I was advised by Father Jeanotte that the other\nmissing boys had gone to the Reserves in the district of\nPortage la Prairie- and that as he was going to that point,\nhe would endeavour to locate and bring the missing boys\nback with him. Father Jeanotte made his visit to the Portage\nla Prairie area while there reported the location of the boys to the\nIndian Agent who in turn notified the local RCMP, and\nfrom report received I was surprised to learn that the\nboys had not been located. Father Jeanotte failed to advise\nme on his return as to whether he succeeded in locating the\nboys, as I expected that he would do, and as a result I was\nof the impression that the boys had been brought back by\nhim.\n\n22.11.37.\n\n3. On this date while on other police duties in Lestock\nI called at the aforesaid Indian school where I further\ninterviewed Father Jeanotte. In this connection, in express-\ning his regrets in not having advised me previously of his\nunsuccessful effort to locate the boys on his journey to\nPortage la Prairie, Father Jeanotte stated that the boys were\nstill missing, and I received from him the description of\nthe said boys which is as follows:\n\nAlex.

I told the father this would be considered when the time comes I could promise him nothing. Ewenin took all of his children out of the school and put them in public school some years ago with consent of the Department, he now finds he cannot feed them at home so he is putting one boy in school now, he wants to save his face by being foxy and putting him in for one year. I will not fool with him at all and if he gives any more trouble I will recommend that he be made to educate them himself, he does not fight with me at all but is an awful misery to the priests.

The Principal informs me that the older boys of the school are given work with pay on the school farm every fall. This year, owing to the crop failure, there was no work for them. Several enquiries from the adjoining reserve having heard that the crops in Manitoba were very good and that there was work for harvesters, induced the older boys of the school to join them in a proposed journey to Manitoba. Of course, this appealed very much to the older boys of the school and they readily joined the party. Unfortunately, they found very little work and, in some cases, were not even paid for the few days that they did work.\n\nThe escape of these boys was made very easy owing to the fact that the regular disciplinarian, Mr Schmidt, was at the time in the hospital. The boys are now all back in school and seem to be the wiser for the hardships and sufferings endured during their absence from school.\n\nMy intention, in giving you the above explanation, is to dispel the impression that the authorities at Anicinapeau might have been laxed in enforcing discipline or that the general conditions of the school were so poor as to prompt these boys to run away.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Edgar MICKLE is short and stout, and the principal of the school thought he may try to get to Kenora, Ont., and therefore requested that all trains eastbound be checked at this point; and should the exceptionally noted be found, have him held at this detachment and advise Father Jeanette by L.D. telephone.\n\nOn receipt of the above phone call, I contacted the Cst. on night patrol of the Town of Melville, and acquainted him with the facts in this case.
