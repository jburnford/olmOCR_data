Phillips, Assistant Inspector of Weights and Measures, commenced his duties last Monday. So far he has found the scales used by merchants too small before conditions have been remedied, and has not had any complaints to perform. In a town such as Prince Albert as far away from the sources of supplies, it is not the inclination of Mr. Phillips to be severe, but he will do everything in his power to see what can be carried out without causing hardship to anyone. In his instructions he states that if any violations of the Act are known he thinks that Prince Albert merchants will be ready and willing to comply with them.\n\nJohn Conner, C. Robertson, J.

Archdeacon Pinkham conducted the morning service at St. Mary's and the evening service at St. Alban's Church on Sunday last, assisted by Ven. Archdeacon John A. Mackay and Rev. Mr. W. W. Taylor. The services were attended by a large congregation at both services, and the music and singing in keeping with the occasion. In the evening Ven. Archdeacon Pinkham preached a short but eloquent sermon from Matthew xxv. 29-30. In his closing remarks he urged, he had visited the Dairy Act Guild, which they, doubtless, had all heard of, and which he thought would make a profound impression upon him, called the \"Vale of Tears,\" representing the great mass of the poor, crowded and surrounded by a multitude composed of all manner of people, the great and the small, the good and the bad, the rich and the poor, the sick and the healthy, containing the germ of history, the future of mankind, and manifested the willingness of Jesus Christ to forgive all those who asked for mercy. He spoke of the coming times to the failure of the Lord Being, His power, and thought that the world was in a state of confusion, with great talent, and humanity as a missionary, and the majority of followers of Christ. He said that only a sense of duty had compelled him to accept the position to which he had been called, and that he felt the presence of God would give him the strength and courage to perform his duties. He had received the congratulations of all denominations, Catholic and Protestant, on his appointment, but he felt that he had gained the greatest pleasure from the congratulations of Bishop Miller, because His Lordship had been connected with the denominations with the Archdeacon of Canada, never more so than during his residence in this district, as well as those of other denominations, and his return to France also the Bishop of Saskatchewan had already looked forward to.\n\nCHURCH MEETING.\n\nA meeting of the members of the Church of England in Prince Albert was held at St. Alban's Church on Wednesday evening last, the bishop designate in the diocese presiding. The meeting had opened with prayer by the Ven. Archdeacon of Saskatchewan, the chairman stated that the Rev. A. G. Wallace had recently been charged with accepting another position in the mission field, it was thought that the united congregation of St. Alban's and St. Mary's would select a minister for their services.\n\nThe Hon. Lawrence Clarke then spoke of the pleasure it gave the members of the Church of England here to see their future Bishop among them, and at some length discussed the question of the man who for nearly three years had most faithfully discharged his duties in their midst, the Rev. A. G. Wallace, who was now about to leave them, and how he felt that all would agree with him that Mr. Wallace had been endowed with an irreproachable character. The speaker then alluded to the past noble and self-sacrificing labors of Mr. Wallace and their deeply beloved friend the Ven. Archdeacon John A. Mackay, and concluded by offering him, on behalf of the united congregation, his sincere wishes.\n\nThe Ven. Archdeacon thanked Mr. Clarke most heartily for proposing his name, and assured him that he felt honored to have accepted the position, and that he never to sever his connection with the Church Missionary Society with which he had been connected for more than twenty years. After an amicable discussion the following resolutions were proposed:\n\nMoved by Hon. Lawrence Clarke, seconded by Mr. Brewer, and read as follows: That the members of St. Alban's and St. Mary's shall meet next Monday evening, the 4th of May, at 7 p.m., in St. Alban's church, to discuss the manner in which an income shall be raised as\n\nDress Goods, all shades Irish Diaper Linen, India Linen, Muslins, Nuns' Veiling, Silk Gloves, Cottons, Ginghams, Prints, Winceys, Ladies Jerseys Boys' Jersey Suits, Ready-made Clothing.\n\nFROM FOUR YEARS UP\u2014AT R.
