As I note from your letter referred to that you wish me to certify to the correctness of the certificate I enclose signed copy sent to me by Mr. Taillon, duly certified to by myself and trust that payment will be made upon receipt thereof as the contractors are desirous of receiving payment not only of the amount of this final estimate, but of the amount of their deposit cheque when they submitted the original tender.\n\nIn regard to the second paragraph of your letter asking for a copy of the agreement made with Mr. Matthew Wylie as to the payment of 10% for work supervised and performed by him. I beg to state that no formal written agreement was entered into the agreement being merely a verbal one. You will recall that it was the intention to accept Mr. Wylie's tender to perform certain electrical work at the school. However, I thought it would be a better arrangement to buy the equipment direct from those who were in a position to furnish it and make separate arrangements with Mr. Wylie to install the equipment and provide the necessary labor etc., on a 10% basis and this arrangement I entered into with him verbally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to the conversation held in your office on the 10th inst. re-accessory buildings which are very badly needed close to the new school, I beg leave to ask the Department that:\n\n1. A new hen-house be built to accommodate 250 chickens. The old one is 1300 ft. away, it is a long building in bad shape, too small and not sanitary. The school will furnish most of the material as you can see on the sheet of specifications attached to this.\n\n2. Two Indian houses be moved close to the new school. The two buildings are on the grounds about 1200 ft. from the site of the new school. With little cost for the moving, a new concrete foundation and a few repairs, they would accommodate the Indian visitors for many years.\n\n3. A new modern cow stable be built. The old one is nearly half a mile away and in a very bad shape. It is built on the ground without concrete foundation, practically no roof and very far from the water supply; said barn should be large enough to accommodate at least 30 cows. You know better than I do what the cost will be. There is lots of material in the old barn which could be used but I think there is no contractor who would like to use second hand lumber.\n\nI would ask, dear Mr. Graham, to recommend these estimates and we will start the work as soon as we are allowed by authorities.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) Rev. H. Delmas,\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., March 24th, 1925\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the 11th November last I wrote you on the subject of additional accommodation being required at the Duck Lake School for stabling at least thirty head of cows. I also referred to the necessity of providing a store house and on the 21st Iden you wrote that at that time there were no funds available.\n\nI have just received a communication from the Rev. Principal on the subject of additional buildings, a copy of which I enclose, and I shall be glad to know if funds will be available to undertake the work outlined.\n\nA barn to provide accommodation for thirty cows could be built at a cost of $3,000.00. A chicken house, asked for by the Principal, will cost in the neighborhood of $255.00, and the moving of the two Indian houses referred to would cost about $350.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. W. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\nIndian C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 6, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 305-11A of the 84th ultimo, with reference to outbuildings at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. In reply I regret to inform you that the appropriation for this fiscal year will provide for no building activity at this institution, but the principal's requests will be noted for future estimates. I hope that the school can get along nicely without new outbuildings for the time being.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Duck Lake Indian School:\n\nDuring March you forwarded us a cheque for $4940.73. There appears to have been deductions made on this cheque from the estimate, which we presume were as follows:\n\nHoldback for Fan: $150.00\nMetal Ceiling under Gallery in Chapel: $44.00\nDeduction on Temporary Heating Account: $81.80\n\n$275.80\n\nThe fan has now been fixed, and we enclose herewith a certificate from your Inspector to that effect. With reference to the deduction of $44.00 for the metal ceiling, as explained in our previous letters, we are willing to leave this to your Department for final decision. The deduction on the temporary heating account, as we consider this charge is fair and just, and same has been authorized by the Department, we do not consider the deduction was warranted.\n\nWith regard to these last two items, we might say Commissioner Graham was in communication with us and we explained both matters fully to him, and we were under the impression that he was perfectly satisfied with our explanation. Might we ask you, therefore, to be good enough to again look into these items, and we trust you will see your way clear to allow same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\nper\n\nL/B.\nEnc.l.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Delmas\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith and recommend for payment Regina voucher #3133 in favor of J. B. Bichon, representing the purchase of bolts for the engine and generator at the new Indian School at Duck Lake. The account is duly certified to by the Rev. H. Delmas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to the engine and generator that was recently installed at the Duck Lake Boarding School. It has been brought to my attention that they are too small for the amount of work they are called upon to do. The engine should be at least 5 H.P. more than the one we have, and the generator should be a 7\u00bd K.W. instead of a 5 K.W.\n\nIt seems to me that it would be the proper thing to transfer this engine and generator to the Onion Lake School and buy a 15 H.P. Type 'Z' engine and a 7\u00bd K.W. generator for Duck Lake. Fortunately, the engine and generator that we have at Duck Lake is just what we require for Onion Lake, so that nothing has been lost through installing them.\n\nThe cost of a 15 H.P. Type 'Z' engine will be $975.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg, and the 7\u00bd K.W. Generator $325.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg. I would be glad to have your authority to place this order with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse people at the earliest possible date. They will charge approximately $100.00 for taking down the present engine, crating it and installing the new one, and the freight charges will be approximately $100.00.\n\nIf you decide to act on my recommendation I would hold the engine at Duck Lake for some time till the school at Onion Lake is ready to receive it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJune 14, 1925.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th ultimo with reference to the electric lighting plant at the Dark Lake School, I would say that I approve of your recommendation to install a larger generating plant at the school and to move the plant now at this school to the new Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6305, file 652-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending you a rough sketch of the building with the Statue of St Michael on the top of it.\n\nThe cross being white and of a small size does not show; the building by itself from a certain distance looks low and flat. The statue being 6 ft 4 inch high, its looking, is going to repair that defect.\n\nThe cost of the new base in concrete and the installation of the statue will cost $40.00 only.\n\nMr J. Ferret from the town of Duck Lake was the best man on the job. Smith Bros. asked him many times to join their firm or to work for them as foreman. You can depend on him for any kind of work.\n\nI would like to have also a commemorative plate to cover the niche.\n\nThe inauguration and formal opening of our new building will take place on July 15th. On that date the parents come to take their children home for holidays. I would like to see you on that occasion.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nAttached hereto is a letter and a sketch received from the Rev. H. Delmos, principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, with reference to the placing of a statue of St. Michael on the top of the new residential school. The reverend gentleman wishes to replace the present cross on the building with the statue.\n\nHe has purchased the statue and is asking the Department to pay the cost of installing same. This will be approximately $40.00 and I would recommend for your consideration that the work be authorized.\n\n[Signature]\n\nArchitect.\n30th June, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the placing of a statue of St. Michael on the top of the Duck Lake School; I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay for the cost of a suitable concrete base for this statue, providing the cost does not exceed $40.00\n\nAccounts in duplicate covering the cost of labour and material should be forwarded in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Father Delmas,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that the Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding School has asked for authority to erect fences to enclose playgrounds for the boys and girls at the school. I think if $200.00 were authorized, suitable fences could be erected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have just returned from the Duck Lake Indian School, where I went for the opening. While there, several matters were brought to my attention.\n\nThe necessity of building a cow barn is very great, in fact we will have to build a barn before winter sets in. My suggestion is that we build a barn similar to those erected at the Edmonton and St. Paul's schools. This can be erected at the same cost at Duck Lake. I have not got the exact figures, but it will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of $5000.\n\nIt will be necessary to move two of the existing frame dwellings to a point near the school and convert them into places for Indians coming from a distance to reside in while visiting the school, especially during the winter time. This work can be done for $700.00. I would recommend this also.\n\nThe Father would like to have an ice house and slaughter house at the school. Of course these are necessary and if there are funds available we could convert one of the old buildings there into an ice house and slaughter house at a cost of probably $400.00.\n\nThere are one or two other minor matters which I shall bring to your attention later on after I have secured full details.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I have to refer you to letter of the Deputy Superintendent General of April 6th. I regret that I have nothing to add to this communication.\n\nI have also your 305-11 A of the 20th instant and funds can be found for fencing the playgrounds at this school. You are authorized to expend the sum of $200.00 in this connection. Please be guided by the regulations concerning purchasing and the engagement of labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

He was paid at the current rate for carpentry labour of 70\u00a2 an hour.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. H. Brown, Esq.,\nActing Auditor General,\nAuditor General's Dept.,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRe: Contract of Smith Bros. and Wilson for school at Duck Lake\n\nUnder authority of Order in Council P.C. 1035 of June 21, 1924, a contract was entered into with Smith Bros. and Wilson for the construction of an Indian residential school at Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, for the sum of $126,840.\n\nThis contract is apparently completed, but copies of the specifications and contract have not been furnished to this Office.\n\nItems of extra work have been included to the amount of $7,517.85 for which the written authority of the architect is lacking.\n\nIt will be necessary to have these documents available on our files, in order to make a proper audit of these accounts.\n\nWas competition sought by public advertisement before the award of this contract?\n\nHave the contractors furnished a security deposit and if so what disposition has been made of it?\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAuditor General.\nOttawa, Sept. 16, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Smith Bros. & Wilson's contract for the building of the new Indian Residential School at Duck Lake, I would ask you to be good enough to furnish me with a statement showing in detail the cost of the extra work that was performed, amounting to $7,327. In submitting this statement please indicate the authority in each case for the extra expenditure.\n\nI will be glad to have this information at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSt. Michael's Indian Boarding School\n\nDuck Lake, Sask.,\nSept. 3rd, 1925\n\nW.M.Graham, Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit to you the following report on the sewerage of the Duck Lake School.\n\nBefore we redugout we tried water pressure and found that from one pipe the water comes out and goes in the other line of pipes. There are two lines; one from toilets and one from kitchen and washing machines.\n\nWe redugout from the first to the second manhole, about 510 feet and found that there are leaks practically to all joints.\n\nI will advise you to have an Inspector from the Department of Sanitation to come and let us know what should be done in the present case. Last summer an Inspector came from Regina and obliged the men of the contractor to reopen the pipes and make the joints not leaking.\n\nAs far as I know we need two other manholes. It is nearly impossible to make a rod of 500 feet long. We have in town a man who is able to build manholes and to do any kind of work according to the advices of an Inspector.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Rev. H.Delmas,\nPrincipal.\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LIMITED\n\nGeneral Contractors\n\n1420 Eighth Ave.,\nRegina, Sask.,\nSept. 11th, 1925\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nCanada Life Building,\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have made an examination of the Sewage System at Duck Lake on the 9th of September, and although we understood you had ordered a plumber to come down, and cleaning rods to be supplied some two weeks before this date, we find that all that has been done is to uncover the drain pipes for about 500 feet, but none lifted, and an attempt to force water through from manhole #1 to manhole #2, and all this time the system is being used by the School.\n\nWe examined manhole #1 and found sludge up to level of the 6\" outlet and water flowing over into the 6\" sewer line. We examined manhole #2 and found it normal, but understand it had been washed out during the present difficulty by the school representative. We examined manhole #3, next to Septic Tank, and found it filled with sludge up about 24\" above the sewer outlet to Tank.\n\nWe pumped water into this manhole and disturbed the sludge until we had it down to proper level, but the sludge was heavy and hard to flow.\n\nWe broke up one length of pipe taken at random and found the joint packed with oakum and apparently in good condition and well cemented. The school representative showed us some joints that were leaking and there is evidently a slight leak in a few joints, but in our opinion no more than any other tile drain would leak, and in any event the school representative has had 60 lbs. pressure of water on this line and it is possible for this pressure to have forced some of the joints.\n\nIn our opinion the stoppage was caused by paper and other heavy matter clogging around the iron grid at manhole #3, next to Tank, and the whole system filling up before any person was aware of the condition at manhole #3.\n\nThe iron grid should be cut away and the system should have regular attention to see that it is flowing normally.\n\nThe extreme length and the very slight fall per foot make it necessary to use a lot of water, and also to examine the manholes regularly.\n\nAnother manhole should be installed between #1 and #2, as over 500 feet is too much without a manhole, for cleaning and examining the line.\nWe wish to emphasize the fact that the joints are as tight as any drain tile would be and this is proven by the fact that the open ditch had several inches of rainwater due to recent heavy rain, and the pipe failed to take off the water from the ditch in spite of the fact that the six inch pipe is flowing only about 1\" of depth.\n\nWe believe Mr. Poiret is going to attempt to clear the line with rods, but some time has already been lost and the longer the system is left the more trouble it will be to put it right.\n\nWe have not seen anything which would indicate negligence on our part or by our sub-contractors, and the system was installed under the constant supervision of the Inspector Mr. Taillon, who made it his business to see that all the joints were properly cemented before the back-fill was done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.,\n\nPer (Sgd.) Geo. Johns\nSuperintendent.\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the sewerage system at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter that I received from the Principal, Rev. Father Delmas. I am also enclosing a copy of a report received from Mr. Johns, Superintendent of the firm of Smith Bros. & Wilson, whom I asked to go up there and look into the matter.\n\nIn speaking to Mr. Johns further on the subject he tells me that the work of cleaning out the pipes has been neglected and the sewage has been allowed to accumulate. When he went there he advised them very strongly to get to work and get the drains cleared.\n\nYou will notice from his report that he attaches no blame whatever to the construction of the system. I fear that we are going to have serious trouble at this point if the matter is not attended to. I called up the Sanitation Division, Department of Health and asked that an officer be sent to Duck Lake to see what could be done. I also instructed Father Delmas some time ago to get rods made and see if he could clean it up.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI fear that we are going to have continual trouble with the sewerage system at this school. A very serious mistake was made in locating the school 1400 feet away from the point of sewage disposal. I would never have recommended that it be placed so far away had I been consulted and the Department must take the responsibility for this. It could easily have been placed about 600 feet away. 1400 feet of pipe with a drop of only one inch in twenty-five is bound to make trouble, especially when there is a limited supply of water.\n\nMr. Johns tells me that when he visited the school the Principal was away, but he did see him for a few minutes before he left.\n\nI have done all that I think can be done in the meantime.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 25, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th instant, advising me of the defective condition of the sewage system at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to say that you may arrange to have one or two concrete or brick man-holes constructed on the line of the sewer pipe. These man-holes may be built of similar construction to the existing one.

Graham,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nCanada Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nAt your request I arranged for Mr. T. A. Reid of this Department to visit Duck Lake on the 18th inst. for the purpose of reporting on the operation of the sewer and sewage disposal plant at the Duck Lake Indian School.\n\nMr. Reid has had considerable experience in the construction of sewers having been a contractor himself and you may therefore place full confidence in his findings.\n\nIt would appear that there are two sewers from the new school to the disposal plant, which run side by side for a distance of approximately 1370 feet. One sewer is a six inch sewer which conveys the water from the laundry and the run off from the roof, and discharges direct on the ground surface, the other sewer is 8 inches and carries the sewage, from the toilets, baths, and basins, discharging into the disposal plant.\n\nI am unable to understand why there should be two sewers and Mr. Reid cannot throw any light on this matter.\n\nThe 8 inch sewer is in itself quite large enough to take all waste liquids from the school, including wash water from the laundry. If the wash water from the laundry had been excluded from this 6 inch storm sewer, I could understand its purpose for it would then convey only clear and harmless water which would be discharged without treatment, but the waste liquids from the laundry should certainly be run through the disposal plant.\n\nThere are three manholes between the school and the disposal plant, and Mr. Reid found that the outlet pipe for number 3 manhole had been blocked by three vertical strips of metal which were acting as a screen and causing the sewage to back up in the pipe.\n\nThe sewer pipe appears to have been choked for the following reasons:\n\n(1) The strips of metal above referred to at manhole No. 3.\n\n(2) The bases of the manholes have not been properly finished off. Sewer manholes should be provided with a proper concrete channel at the base and this channel should be so finished that it will be impossible for solids to lodge at the base of the manhole. This has not been done, the manholes being perfectly flat at the bottom with the result that the solids have spread over the floor of the manhole and have caused stoppage in the pipe line. This is obviously bad workmanship on the part of the contractor.\n(3) There is not sufficient water coming down the 8 inch pipe to flush and keep clean the pipe line. The waste water from the laundry should be turned into this 8 inch pipe leaving the 6 inch pipe for storm water only.\n\nMr. Reid suggestions therefore, which I endorse, are as follows:\n\nThe base of the manholes to be reconstructed by providing a proper concrete channel or a split pipe channel. This should be done in all three manholes.\n\nIt would be well to cover the pipe line and manholes with straw during the winter as some of the manholes and positions of the sewer are only about six feet deep.\n\nMr. Reid also points out that the disposal plant is in a very bad state of repair. The distributing trays need adjusting. The filter bed required to be cleaned and rebuilt with broken stone. The roof needs repairs and the outlet channels and ditches require to be cleaned out.\n\nThis matter was brought to your attention on September 9th, 1924, and on September 11th of that year you advised me that you were arranging for the plant to be overhauled. This has apparently not been done and I would be glad to know that some definite action will be taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. H. Murray,\n\nDirector\nDivision of Sanitation.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter of the 14th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter that I received from the Rev. Father Delmas in connection with the sewage disposal system at the Duck Lake Indian Boarding School; also a report from Mr. Johns, Superintendent of the construction firm of Smith Bros. & Wilson, who had the contract for the work of installing the system.\n\nI now enclose a report from Mr. R.H. Murray, Director Division of Sanitation for the Government of this Province, on a visit of their Mr. T.A. Reid to Duck Lake. This report would indicate that there is not much blame to be attached to Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson. They claim that they built according to specifications, and that the manholes should have been provided with a concrete channel at the base, but instead of this, I understand it is just a flat slab. They also object to the metal strips which have been placed over the drainage in the three manholes. I believe that the contract called for these metal strips at each manhole. Mr. Johns told me that these should never have been put in, and you will see that Mr. Reid is of the same opinion. You will also note that there is not sufficient water going down to properly flush the 8\" drain, and the suggestion is to turn the water in the 6\" storm sewer into this drain. You will note that this suggestion comes from an engineer of the Division of Sanitation of the Government.\n\nSomething\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary\n\nSomething will have to be done with regard to this system at once. If the suggestions outlined by Mr. Reid are carried out it would not cost a great deal of money.\n\nI am at a loss to know why the Department allowed this building to go up 1370 feet away from the point of the sewage disposal when it might just as well have been placed within 600 feet of this point and have saved all this excavation, besides affording a more satisfactory slope for the drainage. If I had had anything to say in the matter the school certainly would not have been located where it is.\n\nKindly advise me as to what you wish done in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOctober 5, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, together with a copy of a Report by Mr. R. H. Murray, of Regina, with regard to the defective condition of the sewage disposal system at the Duck Lake Indian Boarding School and the location of the site where the main building has been actually erected.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the choosing of the above mentioned site was made after a complete survey of the property had been obtained. The long distance between the points of discharge of the sewage and the building was necessitated in order to obtain the required difference of elevation between these two points so as to ensure proper drainage of the basement and make use of the underground disposal system which was already installed, thus saving the expense of a new complete installation.\n\nWith reference to the recommendations made by Mr. Murray as to the alterations required to remedy the present conditions to this sewage system, it is considered that the following repairs should be made:\n\n(a) Lowering of the base at the man-hole 18\" below present level.\n(b) Cleaning and reconstruction of the filter beds with crushed stone, also cleaning of the outlet channels and ditches where so absolutely required.\n\nI shall further give instructions to the Principal of this school, that the man-holes be inspected once a month and cleaned out if necessary. It is considered that if this precaution had been taken, the actual condition in the sewer pipe would not have resulted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. M.

M.

Murray, Director of Sanitation for this Province. I note what you say regarding the choosing of a site for the school. I still am of the opinion that the site is in a wrong location, and it could have been four or five hundred feet nearer the existing cesspool, and I am not alone in this opinion. People who know the situation well, agree with me in this. This would have saved having the long sewage drain and would have made it much easier to handle the situation. As a matter of fact the sewage drain has got to pass through a low section, and in order to get the drop it brings those pipes about four feet from the surface, which is going to cause trouble all the time. I think that I am quite right in what I have said regarding this matter.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I could not understand what you meant by \"lowering of the base at the man-hole 18\" below present level.\" This is the last thing we would do, according to the contractors, Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, and according to Mr. Murray and his Sanitary Inspectors. By carrying this out you are merely putting a cesspool at each manhole. What is needed is a channel leading from the intake at the manhole to the outlet on a level with the drain. No excavation whatever should be made; simply a grooved channel.\n\nI am not acting on these instructions until I hear further from you, as it is hard to understand what is meant by your letter.\n\nWith reference\n\nSecretary,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith reference to the cleaning and reconstruction of the filter beds, this will be attended to without delay. I quite agree with you that the manholes should be inspected at least once a month.\n\nKindly reply by wire, as the season is advanced and I can possibly get the Sanitary Department of the Government to assist me in getting this matter cleaned up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, October 13th, 1925.\n\nH.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter dated August 21st last, in which I informed you that I was holding back a voucher in favour of Matthew Wylie of Regina, representing the moving of an Engine and Generator at the Duck Lake Residential School, pending an endeavour to arrive at a settlement, as I considered Mr. Wylie's account for labour and material, amounting to $673.85, was altogether too high in view of the services performed.\n\nI am supported in my belief by the Principal of the School and one of our Inspectors who has examined the work and both these men agree with me that too much time was spent in performing this work. However, I have gone thoroughly into the matter and find that Mr. Wylie's receipts for the payment of material and labour are all in order and in view of this, feel that we are helpless and have no other alternative but to pay the account.\n\nI took the matter up with Mr. Wylie with the hope of having the account reduced but have been unsuccessful as Mr. Wylie asserts that the account is not too large in view of the work performed.\n\nI may inform you that the Engine and Dynamo were first installed in an inner room at the school in which there was no ventilation and it was found that the gas evaporated from it caused a great deal of annoyance and was sufficient to suffocate anyone going into the room. It was therefore necessary and very important that the Engine and Generator should be moved to an outer room where there was adequate ventilation. Mr. Wylie was the electrician employed by the Contractors and it was a most natural thing to employ him, as he was familiar with the situation. My arrangement with Mr. Wylie was that he was to do the work on a cost plus 10% basis.\n\nI trust that the foregoing information will enable the Department to clear the matter up. I am enclosing herewith full details of the account, and would recommend that it be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEstimates for 1926.\n\nThere are at the old site four buildings which with some repairs might be of good service for many years to come:\n\n1o-Old Indian House to be removed from the old site to the new one\n\n| Estimates | $   |\n|-----------|-----|\n| Moving    | 60.00 |\n| Gravel    | 14.00 |\n| Cement    | 27.00 |\n| Sills     | 15.00 |\n| New Shingles | 42.00 |\n| Work      | 60.00 |\n\nTotal: 218.00\n\n2o Old sewing room to be used as Indian House also with beds and bedding for Indians coming by train:\n\n| Estimates | $   |\n|-----------|-----|\n| Moving    | 75.00 |\n| Gravel    | 14.00 |\n| Cement    | 27.00 |\n| Sills     | 15.00 |\n| Work      | 80.00 |\n\nTotal: 211.00\n\n3o Converting old washing house into slaughter and ice house:\n\n| Estimates | $   |\n|-----------|-----|\n| Gravel    | 56.00 |\n| Cement    | 80.00 |\n| Changes inside | 100.00 |\n| Work      | 75.00 |\n\nTotal: 311.00\n\n4o Old pig house to be removed near the slaughter house:\n\n| Estimates | $   |\n|-----------|-----|\n| Moving    | 25.00 |\n| Gravel    | 16.00 |\n| Cement    | 30.00 |\n| Sills     | 21.00 |\n| Work      | 20.00 |\n\nTotal: 112.00\n\n5o New Cow Barn for 28 or 30 cows\n\n6o New poultry house for 300 chickens\n\n7o New house for farmer instructor and family\n\n8o Store house; two stories high\n\n9o Roof on septic tank to be renewed\n\n10o A double door on each of the recreation rooms to keep the noise and dust away.\n\n11o A barrel of paint for the old buildings which are to be removed.\nCONSTRUCTION OF OUTBUILDINGS.\n\nThe annexed copy of Rev. Fr Delmas' request in view of the Estimates has been prepared for the consideration of the Department. It is the latter's desire to make a complete unit of its schools and accessory buildings and we believe that to realize said unit in the case of Duck Lake the alterations and constructions suggested by the Rev. Principal would be necessary.\n\nI may add that Duck Lake School which has just been installed in its new quarters is one of our foremost schools and in order to keep it up to its present standard and even to make progress it must be provided with proper outbuildings and fully equipped.\n\nI do not ask for any special amount leaving to your own good judgment to determine the necessary appropriation.\nOttawa, November 26th, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your memorandum of the 30th ultimo relative to the moving of the 4 old buildings to the new site of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, the repairing of same and the erection of new outbuildings.\n\nWith reference to the moving and fitting up of the old Indian house, sewing room, wash house and pig house, I beg to say it is considered that the school management should be responsible for the cost of the moving, labour and gravel required. The Department would provide the cement, sills and shingles, and I should be pleased if you would inform the Rev. Principal accordingly.\n\nFunds to provide the erection of a new cow barn, poultry house, house for farm instructor, store house and new roof for septic tank, as well as the two other items mentioned, have been noted for inclusion in our appropriation for Indian education for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This work was authorized by departmental telegram dated October 13th, 1925.\n\nThis work has been carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Sanitation Bureau of Public Health for the Province of Saskatchewan. The cost was in the first place estimated at $1200.00. I sent an Inspector from this office to get the work under way and it has been completed in a satisfactory manner for considerably less than the estimate. The amount charged for labour in Messrs. Beaton & Brady's account was not sufficiently supported by Time Sheets and I have amended the account rather than keep these men waiting any longer for their money. I am taking the matter up with them and if they have made a mistake and omitted a Time Sheet, the matter of the small difference can be adjusted.\n\nI would recommend that this account, as submitted, be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Principal, St. Michael's Residential School, Duck Lake, covering payments made by him for freight charges, I beg to state that an overcharge of $2.00 was made by the C.N.Ry. Co. in W.B. No. 21064 for freight shipped May 4th by the T.Eaton Co. Ltd., Regina. This is the last item in the voucher paid at $15.30 whereas the correct amount is $13.30. I herewith return the original bill to enable the Principal to obtain a refund from the C.N.R. which he should forward to the Department through your office as soon as received by him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, March 22, 1926.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nReverend Father Delmas, who was in the Department recently, brought to our attention the advisability of placing some insulating material on the ceiling of the boiler room immediately over the smoke pipes leading from the boilers.\n\nI would ask you to please communicate with the school authorities and ascertain the amount required and then purchase same and have it shipped to the school. It is understood that the work of installation will be done by the staff of the school.\n\nIt is suggested that the covering consist of three thicknesses of heavy asbestos paper, covered with galvanized iron sheets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

This was not bought at the time as it was thought that a refrigerator of suitable size could not be obtained. The Rev. Principal is very much of the opinion that we should have a special refrigerator and cold storage built, the cost of which would not be much greater than that of a large refrigerator which would not hold a whole carcass of beef. The proposed cold storage room will cost about $884.00 and will hold a carcass of beef, as well as that of a hog, and will also furnish a cool room for other supplies.\n\nI should be glad to have your authority to go ahead and have such a cold storage room erected.

(RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI forward herewith and recommend for payment, the under-mentioned Duck Lake Agency Vouchers, representing material purchased for providing suitable quarters for the Farming Instructor at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI wrote you on the 17th of July last, asking if it was the intention of the Department to erect, this year, a residence for the Farming Instructor and on receipt of your reply, dated the 23rd idem, I communicated the information to the Principal of the School that no such provision had been made. In submitting the vouchers for payment, the Acting Principal states that since the burning of the old school, the Farming Instructor and Mechanic have been living in two Indian houses, the occupation of which, the Indians now wish to resume. Material was therefore purchased to provide convenient quarters for the Farming Instructor in the top story of the old wash house, but the School undertook to perform the labour. The vouchers are as follows:\n\n| No.   | Description               | Amount |\n|-------|---------------------------|--------|\n| 3467  | The Monarch Lumber Co.    | $104.50|\n| 3468  | E.D. Bady                 | 11.20  |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that Inspector Murison recently visited the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, and reports that the drainage system is not satisfactory, and that the work that was done last Fall does not clear up the situation there, although we carried out the instructions furnished us by the Engineer of the Provincial Government here.\n\nThe drain from the School to the septic tank is about 1350 feet long. The first manhole is 325 feet from the building; the second one is 574 ft. from the first, and the third is 444 ft. from the second, this latter one being right at the septic tank. The general opinion of the Inspector and those at the school is that the pipes are not properly connected and cemented, and that a lot of the fluid escapes, causing clogging. I am told that the drop from the School to the septic tank is only 2\u00bd ft. over this 1350 feet of piping, and if the pipes are not properly cemented the chances are that we will always have trouble. It is thought also that there are not sufficient manholes along the line to permit of cleaning the pipe out with rods. It is suggested that there should be a manhole every 100 ft. Your Engineer will be able to decide as to the number there should be in a drain of this length.\n\nI do not believe anything further can be done this year. I should not be surprised if it were found necessary to dig all the piping up and cement the connections, and perhaps deepen the drain at the far end. The contractors, Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson state that the work was properly done and there is no way of finding this out without digging out the whole line. However, nothing can be done during the present winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDec. 30, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, advising me of the present condition of the sewage system at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. As suggested in your communication, the Department will proceed next spring with the installation of the necessary number of manholes to enable the proper inspection and cleaning of the sewer pipe to be made. I would ask you to kindly bring this matter again to the attention of the Department, as soon as weather conditions will allow this work to be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Williams,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mrs. Murison. You will notice that he speaks well of Mr. Goodman, the teacher of the North Day School on James Smith's Reserve, and the good work that is being done by Mrs. Goodman the Field Matron. The residence of the teacher at this point requires exterior painting. It would take very little money to do this work, and if it were available in the Spring I think possibly we could have the work done by Indians. The request of the Field Matron to have a pasture for her ponies and the cow is one that I think we should grant. It would cost about $50.00 to have a suitable pasture provided, and if funds are available for this purpose I will have the matter attended to first thing in the Spring.\n\nThe attendance at the South Day School does not seem to be all that it should. Out of an enrollment of 28 there were 16 present. I am not very much impressed with the practice of supplying children with second hand clothing; they never look well and a boy of fourteen going around with an adult's coat on, and girls wearing discarded dresses of all colours and styles does not give a very good impression to a person visiting the school.\n\nThe John Smith's Day School seems to be doing satisfactory work, although the attendance does not seem to be as good as it might be. I am not taking any notice of the difficulty they are having with the hot air furnace. It seems to me that the Agent or the teacher could look after this.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt., General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWith regard to the Inspector's remarks dealing with the sewage disposal system at the St. Michael's Boarding School, I have your authority to have this system thoroughly overhauled in the Spring, and this will be done as soon as the weather permits. The necessity for outbuildings at this school is pointed out. An item of $5200.00 has been placed in the Estimates to provide a cow barn and root house, but I doubt very much whether this will be sufficient to supply a henhouse, piggery and killing house. The necessity for these buildings was not brought to my attention at the time the Estimates were being prepared. We may, however, save some of the $5200.00 and apply it on these extra buildings which are apparently necessary.\n\nYou will note that the Principal has 105 head of cattle. Surely we are not going to be expected to put up a barn to accommodate this number. At our largest schools we provide for about thirty head of live stock. We must have an understanding regarding this before any expense is incurred. They should have shelters for the young stock and we should only provide for the milking cows. I think you will agree with me in this.\n\nThe school is suffering considerably through lack of vegetables this year. You will note in the report that the crop was an entire failure and that it has been necessary to bring in potatoes. All our reserves in the northern part of the province, including the northern part of Alberta, suffered severely from the August frost.\n\nOn the whole the reports on the Duck Lake Agency and Schools appear to be very satisfactory, and if we get through the present winter with our stock I feel that there will be a substantial increase in the cattle and also in farming operations next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nST. MICHAEL'S R.C. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on November 24th.\n\nInspector Murison's Report on Schools, Duck Lake Agency.\n\nST. MICHAEL'S R.C. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd)\n\nI examined the sewage disposal plant and the outbuildings. I also went through the school building and noted conditions. I did not examine the children in the class room.\n\nThe Principal, who is the Rev. Father Delmas, was absent but was expected back by Christmas. His place has been taken during his absence by the Rev. Father Chevallier. There are 140 pupils on the roll, 76 boys and 64 girls. The health of the children was particularly good at the time of my visit. I was present at the evening meal and noted that an abundance of wholesome food was provided. This includes all the milk the children care to have. There were 20 cows being milked at the time of my visit which provides sufficient milk and butter for their requirements.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDINGS.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to describe the main building; it is quite new and in excellent condition. The Principal, however, complains that the windows fit badly and the North and East rooms are hard to keep warm on this account. He complains particularly of the difficulty in heating the sewing room. I have already reported to you verbally regarding the condition of the septic tank and you have brought this matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nThe out-buildings, with the exception of the horse stable, are very old and inconvenient. An up-to-date cow barn, root house, hen house, piggery and killing house is required. They have very poor accommodation for butchering animals, in fact they have none. They were killing hogs on the day of my visit, a cold day; the hogs were killed outside and taken into the blacksmith shop to be scalded and dressed and I could see the necessity for a proper\nInspector Murison's Report on Schools, Duck Lake Agency.\n\nST. MICHAEL'S R.C. RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd)\n\nproper building to do this work in. The old laundry building is being used temporarily as a Farmer's residence. This building is very old and the arrangement can only be considered as a temporary one.\n\nThere is a good farm in operation at this school. They have 700 acres of land in the immediate vicinity of the school and 400 acres of hay land a few miles away. They threshed in 1926, 3500 bushels of wheat from 210 acres, 3400 bushels of oats from 70 acres and 800 bushels of barley from 20 acres. The yield off their wheat crop was affected by the frost; a year ago they had over 7,000 bushels. Their live stock comprises 105 cattle, 26 horses and 41 hogs. They have a large garden at the school but this year they have no vegetables as their garden stuff was destroyed by frost in August. Their potato supply is being shipped in from outside points.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nJanuary 21, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your letter No. 305-11 of the 10th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Murison's report on the schools of the Duck Lake agency. In the spring, you may arrange to paint the teacher's residence at the James Smith's School and to expend approximately $50 fencing a suitable pasture.\n\nI note that you will arrange to have the sewage disposal system at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School overhauled as soon as weather permits. An item has been placed in our Estimates for the outbuildings considered most necessary. I regret to learn that an early frost robbed this school of its vegetable crop.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 17th, 1927.\n\nSirs:\n\nThis Department has today received a report from our Inspector John Merchant of Prince Albert, showing that two 35 H.P. Kewanee Boilers and a 10 H.P. Vertical Boiler belonging to the Department of Indian Affairs at Duck Lake, Sask. were inspected by him on the 7th instant. We shall be pleased, therefore, if you will arrange to forward cheque for $18.00 covering these inspections, made up as follows:\n\n$7.50 for each of the 35 H.P. Boilers - $15.00\n$3.00 for the Vertical Boiler, above described - $3.00\n\n$18.00\n\nUpon receipt of this amount we shall be pleased to forward the Inspection Certificates, which are on file in this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

It is noted that there is a charge of $18 for this service. Please forward an account, in duplicate, showing in whose favour cheques should be issued. On receipt of this, payment will be made.

Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe matter of outbuildings that it is proposed to build at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School is one that I think should be attended to without delay. The difficulty we have experienced in the past has been in getting our authority rather late in the season, at a time when most of the carpenters and tradesmen have arranged for their summer's work, and you will appreciate the difficulty in getting men under such circumstances. Then again, the season is so short here that if we do not get the work started in May we are usually working late into the Fall, and never get a satisfactorily completed job - usually carrying over some of the work until the following year. I should be glad, therefore, if steps could be taken to have our building programme arranged as soon as possible.\n\nA cattle barn, to hold 28 to 30 head is badly needed at this school. A poultry house is also required, as one was not built at the time the school was erected. There is urgent need for outside quarters for the help. In a conversation with the Principal, Father Delmas, he tells me that he would like to have two small cottages to accommodate two married men and their families. You will appreciate that at a school of this kind where farming is done on such an extensive scale it is necessary to have a staff of men. It is estimated that the two cottages could be built for approximately $4500.00, as the Father would undertake to do a certain amount of the freighting and excavating, as well as any other work which could be done by the staff and bigger boys\n\nat the\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nat the school. The other buildings which are required are a niggery and a root cellar. A root cellar at an institution of this kind is rather an important thing to have, as a great many roots are grown and used. As you know, it is necessary to have a separate root house, as roots cannot be stored in the main building, and besides, there is not room for them.\n\nThere is another matter which I was told to bring to your attention in the Spring, i.e., that of the drain leading from the main building to the septic tank. Something will have to be done to put this in shape, as it has never worked properly since the time it was first put in.\n\nI shall hope to hear from you at the earliest possible date regarding the foregoing matters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nMay 6, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 305-11A R.O. of the 27th ultimo, with reference to outbuildings and improvements at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that $6,800 is available for the purpose of erecting a cow barn, a root house, a hen house and a combined hog pen and slaughter house. You may proceed with this work, on a day labour basis. Please be guided by the general instructions in my 1-1-5 of today's date.\n\nThere is also an appropriation of $400 for the purpose of effecting improvements to the sewage disposal system. You might see your 305-11 A of December 11th, last, in this connection. I regret there are no funds for the two small cottages.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Hurison recently went to Duck Lake to make an inspection there and I requested him to look carefully into this matter. In the meanwhile I received a letter from the Director, Division of Sanitation, of the Saskatchewan Department of Public Health, pointing out that an official of the Department had visited the School and recommended certain work being done to put this plant in proper working order. He also pointed out that its unsatisfactory condition since installation was to be attributed to the fact that a qualified drainage engineer had not been employed on the work when it was originally done. Inspector Hurison went over the ground again with the official of the Department of Public Health and has found that the drain pipes, which he uncovered in five places, had not been properly laid and that the pipes in three instances were leaking, owing to defective joints. He found also that no fluid was passing into the filter in the septic tank and the distributing pans were dry. This was owing to the drain pipe.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ndrain pipe being frozen between the disposal plant and one of the manholes, which no doubt was due to the fact that part of the pipe line was no more than two feet below the surface of the ground. The roof of the disposal plant is not of sufficient strength to carry the covering which has to be placed on it in the winter months.\n\nThe recommendation of the Department's Engineer involves the taking up of the old pipe and relaying under the supervision of a competent engineer who will see that levels are taken. It is not considered that more than 25% or 30% of the old pipe can be salvaged as vitrified tile is of such a brittle nature. Four manholes should also be constructed and the present roof replaced by one of reinforced concrete. The cost of the manholes, the vitrified tile, labour and cement and taking up and laying pipes, the building of the reinforced concrete roof, the services of a qualified engineer, and finally the purchase of proper sewer cleaning tools will involve an expenditure of approximately $1600. Some other work such as covering a portion of the pipe line with a sufficient quantity of earth to protect it from freezing in the winter will be done by the School children. The Principal will also take care of the cartage and the cost of excavating and back filling, provided the work is done before the 15th July when his big boys will go home for their holidays.\n\nI shall be glad, therefore, if the Department will sanction the additional expenditure necessary to place this plant in proper operating condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDuck Lake Indian Residential School\nDuck Lake Sask. June 13th. 1927\n\nTo The Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to call the attention of the Department, to the fact that since we have moved into our new School, we are in need of all the outside buildings to carry on the work properly.\n\nLast year an amount of money was voted for some of these buildings, but nothing was done. This spring under the supervision of J. Mayoh, the cow barn, the poultry house and the pigery are nearly finished. We cannot wait another year for the root cellar. But we are very badly in need of two houses for our two families with their families.\n\nWhen we moved to the new building 1925, our Farmer Instructor took up a few rooms for himself, his wife and his six children in the old School. When Brother John died we were obliged to hire another man to look after the mechanic work who in turn took a few rooms also in the old building. Both stayed there until the 3rd of May 1926, when the building burned down.\n\nThen a part of the old wash house was roughly appropriated for the farmer and his family, but it is very far from being a decent dwelling for them all.\n\nAs for our Mechanic man, being obliged to rent a house in town, one mile away from his work, he is moving from one place to another every three months, being unable with his salary to rent a decent house.\n\nOur Indian Agent, Ch. Pant. Schmidt, Inspector W. Murison and the Indian Commissioner W.M. Graham see by themselves the necessity of having these two houses erected this season. I will object to see the erection of small cottages with only four rooms on the basement. Our farmer has six children and consequently needs a house with cellar, kitchen, dining room and living room on the basement and four bedrooms upstairs. The Mechanic man has only a child but he is a new married man and young.\n\nAccording to Mr. J. Mayoh, the cost of these two houses would be $2600.00 each.\n\nAnother thing also of no less importance is the question of our sewerage which never gave satisfaction and on which the Department of Health of Saskatchewan made a full report with suggestions to Mr. W. Murison.\n\nAll that correspondence is held at the Indian Office of Regina.\n\nWe would appreciate very much in seeing the Department taking necessary steps to have the two houses erected this season and the sewerage rebuilt.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. M. De Lisle\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 22, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, urging the provision of two cottages for the use of the married members of the staff at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. I regret that there are no funds for this purpose at the present time, but I shall cause a note to be made in connection with the Estimates for the coming year.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that the Department is in correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Graham concerning the sewage disposal system, and I am hopeful that, in a few days, authority to put it in good condition will be directed to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. H.

Pant. Schmidt, Inspector W. Burison and the Indian Commissioner W. M. Graham, see by themselves the necessity of having these two houses erected this season. I will object to see the erection of small cottages with only four rooms on the basement. Our farmer has six children and consequently needs a house with cellar, kitchen, dining room and living room on the basement and four bed rooms upstairs.

H. Delmas\n\nPrincipal.\nRight Honorable Sir,\n\nI am taking the liberty of sending you a copy of my letter dated June 13th, addressed to the Indian Department, re-erection of two dwelling houses for our two employees and re-reconstruction of our sewerage.\n\nBy my letter's content you will see that having new barn, new poultry house and a new piggery built up, it looks like the Department shows more interest for the stock than for our hired men.\n\nYou can easily understand also how great would be the responsibility of the Department in refusing or neglecting the reconstruction of our sewerage. Supposing an obstruction happens in it during the cold season, the only issue would be the closing up of the School and the sending of our 150 pupils to their homes in the winter time. What also would be the damage done to our new building?\n\nI am asking you Right Honorable Sir, to use your influence in bringing the Department of Indian Affairs to have the two houses erected and the sewerage reconstructed during this summer season.\n\nYours very obedient\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nRight Honorable Lyons MacKenzie King\nPremier of Canada.\nHouse of Commons\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 16, 1927\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.

No Abstract of Tenders - only one lumber firm at Duck Lake who have allowed special discounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON LIMITED\nGeneral Contractors\n\nRegina, Sask. July 11th, 1927\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nCanada Life Bldg.,\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe Duck Lake School.\n\nIn answer to your letter of July 8th., we beg to state that our letter of Sept. 11th, 1925 covered most of the ground on this matter.\n\nAs far as the laying of the pipes is concerned this was done by the same man who laid the sewers at Lebret Punnichy, Cardston, and a good many of the sewers in Regina and was laid under the constant supervision of Mr. Taillon the inspector who established all the levels.\n\nWith reference to leaky joints, we do not think it usual to expect tile drains to be laid subject to temperature changes, and with cement joints and still expect them to be absolutely water tight under pressure. In any case this sewer was subjected to approximately 60 lbs. water pressure by the school representative Mr. Foirlet, at the time he was attempting to clear the line, and he could very well have started some of the joints at that time.\n\nWe are of the opinion that this 1370 feet of sewer will always be troublesome at the grade it had to be laid. The plans are somewhat misleading to the ordinary man as the fall appears to be good but the plans are drawn to vertical scale of 4 ft. to the inch so that the actual grade is one tenth of the grade on the drawings and actual conditions were that even less grade could be got than that shown on the plan. All this was pointed out to the Inspector and he placed the levels and lived on the job all the time.\n\nThis installation is not and never will be entirely satisfactory under its present conditions. It requires a lot of water and constant supervision but we do not consider any responsibility rests on us on this account.\n\nAs stated above the system was laid under Mr. Taillon's supervision and to his instruction. He accepted the system after seeing every foot of pipe laid and we must repudiate any responsibility for the present conditions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSMITH BROS. & WILSON, LTD.\nPer (Sgd.) George Johns\nSuperintendent.\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo No. 109-1-5 regarding the sewage disposal system at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, I have taken the matter up with Messrs. Smith Bros. and Wilson, of Regina, and they take no responsibility whatever in connection with the condition of the system. I am enclosing copy of a letter from this firm, from which you will note that the installation is not and never will be satisfactory under present conditions, and that it requires a lot of water and constant supervision. They point out that the system was installed under the supervision of the Department's Inspector, Mr. Taillon, who established all the levels and accepted the installation after seeing all the pipes laid. I am not sure that 60 lbs. of pressure was ever used on these pipes; I have never heard that it was. I quite agree with Messrs. Smith Bros. and Wilson when they say that this 1370 feet of sewer will always be troublesome at the grade it had to be laid. I believe there is only a fall of 2\u00bd feet to the entire length of 1370 feet.\n\nI would recommend that the work as suggested in the penultimate paragraph of my letter of June 9th, be carried out by the Department at the earliest possible date, so that we will be sure to have it completed before there is any possibility of frost. The figure which I have had quoted for the work is $1600.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJuly 26, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI wish to draw to your attention Mr. Commissioner Graham's letter of June 9th, with reference to the unsatisfactory sewage disposal line at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. The Department's reply of the 24th ultimo asked Mr. Graham to inform Smith Brothers and Wilson, of Regina, that they should effect the necessary improvements without cost to the Department. Their reply, which is now to hand under cover of Mr. Graham's letter of the 14th instant, repudiates any responsibility for the present conditions.\n\nSixteen hundred dollars is required to put the sewage disposal system in proper working order. Four hundred dollars is specifically provided for this purpose. The work should be done, of course, and the General Appropriation would have to stand the difference. Do you wish further steps taken with Smith Brothers and Wilson?\n\nEdward Hanna\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nAugust 1, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant, concerning the present defective condition of the sewage disposal system at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, Duck Lake, Sask., I beg to say that after giving this question due consideration it has been found advisable that the recommendation made by the Provincial Engineer, mentioned in your letter of the 9th of June, be carried out. You may, therefore, arrange to have the work proceeded with as early as convenient, under the supervision of a qualified engineer, with the understanding that the expenditure is to be kept within the estimate, namely $1600.00. It is expected that the work will be performed in such a manner as not to require further maintenance expenses, and so that it will provide adequate service for this Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSt. Michael's Indian Boarding School\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDuck Lake, Sept. 9th, 1927\n\nTo the Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nRE: Sewage Disposal System.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of June 22 No I09-I-5, which reads: (I am pleased to inform you that the Department is in correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Graham concerning the sewage Disposal System, and I am hopeful that in a few days authority to put it in good condition will be directed to him.) I beg to call the attention of your Department, that nothing has been done so far.\n\nI am asking the Department to have that work done before the cold season comes.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nRev. H. Selma\nPrincipal\nSept. 14, 1927.\n\nRev Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, concerning the proposed improvement of the sewage disposal system for the St. Michael's Indian Boarding School, and to advise you that Indian Commissioner Graham has already been authorized to arrange that a qualified engineer undertake the proposed repairs to the above mentioned system.

The capacity of the pressure\ntank, although sufficient for our usual needs, would be\naltogether inadequate in case of fire. The out-building\nhave no protection whatever. A stand-pipe of a large\ncapacity is necessary to remediate to this deficiency.\n\nExcept for the hoses, we have no fire fighting\napparatus. Two dozens of five-gallons fire extinguishers,\none dozen of pick-axes and one dozen of fire pails are a\nmost urgent necessity.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSdg. Rev. H. Delmas.\nPrincipal.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a communication which I received from the Rev. Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Boarding School, on the subject of fire protection at that institution. I do not know whether the Department would be prepared to install the large standpipe which the Principal speaks about or not. I would judge from his letter that it is to be in the centre of the grounds, and not in the building. His request to be supplied with two dozen five-gallon fire extinguishers is, to say the least, excessive; this could be cut down to one dozen, and I think the number of fire axes might be reduced to half a dozen. I would recommend that the fire pails asked for be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis is a large school, with 150 boys and girls in attendance. The class room work is carried on in four class rooms. Mr. E. Seissens is in charge of the older boys, and I consider him a splendid teacher. He holds a Second Interim Saskatchewan Certificate. His manner is good and he certainly has the class room well under control.\n\nThe other three class rooms are taught by Sr. St. Melaine, Sr. St. Boniface and Sr. St. Ulric. I must say the children all read well, as though they understood, and in the other subjects examined, they answered quite freely. Their books were all well kept and the work neatly done. The pupils were neatly dressed, clean, and apparently healthy. The class rooms were spotless well lighted and well aired.\n\nThe sewing room was in charge of another Sister and the work exhibited is certainly a credit to the school. I have seen no better work in any school inspected.\n\nThe laundry was not in operation, but everything was in splendid order.\n\nThe kitchen department, as usual, was busy, but everything was in such splendid order that one could hardly credit that the work required to feed 175 people was being carried on.\n\nThe building, as the Department knows, is new so I need not discuss it further than to say it is the finest building of its kind I have seen. As far as being clean, it was practically spotless, and every room seen showed that care and labour is not spared.\n\nThe school\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nThe school, I understand, is built fireproof. Just before I visited it, a shipment of fire extinguishers had arrived which the Rev. Father will have placed at various points within the building. The fire escapes are well built and in good condition, as is the hose, which is practically new. The only weak point, as considered by the Rev. Father, and I believe he is right, is the pressure tank. This tank will only hold between 700 and 800 gals., which, in the case of a big fire, would certainly not be sufficient. The Rev. Father suggested that a tower tank be erected outside so that the barns and other outbuildings might also be protected. The supply of water appears plentiful, so that it is simply a matter of storage from which it can best be obtained when needed.\n\nThere are two large barns, one for cattle and one for horses. The one is new, while the other, although older, is in splendid repair. It is, however, badly in need of paint. A new building was erected this year, part to be used as a slaughter house and part as an ice house. The Rev. Father was allowed $900.00, and I consider the Department has certainly received value. The building is well built, with a well equipped slaughter house and, adjoining it, an ice house. This building, which is under one roof, is not painted and should receive paint this coming year. There is also a well built pig pen and chicken house, both of which are painted. The same remark applies to the outbuildings as I made in regards to the school. They are the best I have inspected. The other outbuildings are old and of little use. The old laundry is used as a residence for the Farming Instructor, but certainly is not satisfactory. A residence is badly needed. Two other old houses are nearby, which are used to accommodate\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nto accommodate Indian parents who visit the school. The mechanic is a married man and resides in Duck Lake.\n\nRev. Father Delmas considers this man should be within call at any time and desires a residence for him.\n\nThe Rev. Father complained about the lack of a storehouse for vegetables. It is useless to grow large quantities and have no place in which to keep them, and yet I think we must admit that they are essential and some suitable place should be provided.\n\nA large herd of cattle is kept, from which milk and meat are provided for the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., December 17th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Hamilton during his recent visit to that agency.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the baking of bread by Mrs. Bird, teacher at the North Bay School, James Smith's Reserve, it seems to me this is rather heavy work for her in addition to teaching school. The proper thing would be to supply them with biscuits, and if you will authorize this I will see that it is carried out. With regard to the interior decorations that will be needed at this point, I may say we have placed an amount of $75.00 in the Estimates for general repairs at this school.\n\nAt the South Day School on James Smith's reserve I note that the teacher, Mrs. Burbridge, prepares a midday meal for the children and that she also bakes bread. This work is too heavy and I would recommend that they be supplied with biscuits at this point also. The Inspector points out that the children eat in the classroom at this school, as no other place is provided. I may say that a note of this was made in the Estimates but no amount was fixed; it was left for the Department to insert the amount which they considered would be necessary.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe John Smith's Day School is taught by Mr. Waite, who is reported to be doing good work. The Inspector points out that the school is in good condition, but that the teacher's residence needs some repairing. I may say that I placed an amount of $75.00 in the Estimates for repairs at this school. However, I have written a separate letter to the Department asking, if the funds are available, that we be allowed to go ahead with this work now.\n\nThe Moose Woods Day School is a simple institution and we are not getting very far with our school work here. The children would be much better in a Boarding School. I have asked for a new heater for the classroom and also one for the teacher's residence.\n\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School is one that the Inspector speaks very highly of. I question whether the Department will be inclined to put up an outside tank for fire protection only at this institution. The tank in the school, with the additional fire protection appliances might meet all the requirements. However, this is a matter for the Department to decide. The matter of painting the old outbuildings at this school should receive consideration. Nothing was placed in the Estimates to cover this work, but if it is not too late I think it might be well to insert an item of $1200.00 for this purpose.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding residences for the Farming Instructor and the Mechanic, amounts have been placed in the Estimates to provide for these buildings, as well as an amount to provide for a storehouse.\n\nThe report on the whole would lead one to believe that the Duck Lake School is in splendid shape and well managed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 22, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your No. 305-11 of the 17th instant, enclosing the reports of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the various schools in the Duck Lake Agency.

(RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sirs,\n\nIn reply to your telephone message regarding water tank at the Penitentiary, the particulars are as follows:\n\n- Capacity: 80,000 Gals.\n- Tank is 22 feet in diameter.\n- Height from bottom to eave: 30 feet.\n- Eave is 110 Feet from the ground.\n\nYou will note from the above dimensions that even if it was possible to take it down whole, it could not be transported and we think that it would be an enormous task to cut all the rivets which will run into thousands, 100 feet up in the air. We believe also that it would be quite a job to make the tank tight again. The sections would bound to be distorted with all that pounding and a torch would not be any good if the tank was to be used again.\n\nThe governor of the Penitentiary wants the tank out of the way and does not know how to get it away, so he thought that if he offered it to some other department, they would move it for him. We should think that the best way to get it down would be to pull it over onto a large pile of straw, or something like that & then start to take it apart. Anyway, it is a job for a bridge gang. It was erected by the Chicago Bridge Co, and in the course of its erection, six men were very severely hurt.\n\nWe enclose a sketch of tank and tower.\n\nYours very truly,\nSmith Bros & Wilson Ltd\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., January 12th, 1928\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to your telegrams of the 4th and 7th instants, and my replies of the 6th and 10th respectively, I beg to say that I am now in a position to give you all the information you wished to have regarding the taking down and removing of the water tank from the Prince Albert penitentiary and erecting same at Duck Lake.\n\nThe first offer I received was from the Dominion Bridge Company, Winnipeg, who gave a price of approximately $3600.00, plus freight. The next was from Friel Bros., of Saskatoon, General Contractors, who quoted a definite price of $3700.00, plus freight. I had this tank examined by a practical man who is in the employ of Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson of this City, and who is looking after the erection of the new Court House in Prince Albert and I am submitting herewith his report, together with a rough sketch of the tank.\n\nI am also in receipt of a report from Mr. Murison, in which he states that he made an examination of the tower in company with a practical constructional steel man who was sent up from Saskatoon by Mr. Friel. However, he merely gives a description of the tank and states that it is in good condition.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A tank of half the capacity would cost approximately the same I believe, and would undoubtedly give much better satisfaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

This power thus conferred either on the Agent or the Principal would make possible the employment of local labor men and the money spent in the localities in which the constructions or reparations are made.\n\nIf his demand is granted, Father Delmas would like to be notified as soon as possible, so that the works might be done immediately after the seeding, as it is the proper time to get workingmen at low wages, whereas later in July, August and September the wages are higher owing to the great demand from the farmers paying big wages.\n\nI heartily recommend to your favor these wishes of father Delmas who is doing such a splendid work for the honor of the Department and the benefit of the Indians.\n\nYour's faithfully,\n\n(Signed) J.A.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. H. Delmas, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, August 9, 1928.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease ship to Rev. Father H. Delmas, O.M.I., Indian Residential School, Duck Lake, Sask., one weighing and measuring scale, suitable for school use. The scale required is the type used for weighing hospital patients. You should supply this article at the best price to a government department. Your account, in triplicate, should be forwarded to Father Delmas, who will certify to it upon receipt of the scale, and will send it to Ottawa for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. E. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChristie School Supply Co.,\nBrandon, Man.\nDuck Lake Residential School\n\nI visited this school on two occasions in connection with the erection of the two cottages for employees. This work is now well under way, and the cement foundations were being put in before I left. The Reverend Principal has the work in hand, and understands what is to be done. He requests that the payments in connection with the labour shall be made by the Indian Agent, who is familiar with the procedure in that connection. As this school was visited by yourself, Dr. Scott, and Mr. Ferrier during the month, it is unnecessary for me to make any comment regarding it.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 39237 Rosettes Concealed                 | 20       | 16\u00bd        | 330         |\n| Key Sockets #700                         | 20       | 32         | 640         |\n| Snap Switches #240                       | 8        | 28\u00bd        | 228         |\n| Main #42869                              | 2        | 57         | 114         |\n| Single Fuse Blocks #61935                | 2        | 21         | 42          |\n| 10 Amp Fuse Plugs                        | 12       | 4\u00bd         | 51          |\n| Solid Knobs With Nails & Washers         | 1        | 78         | 78          |\n| Porcelain Tubes                          | 2        | 72         | 144         |\n| 8 Oz Tire Tape                           | \u00bd        | 46         | 23          |\n| Cartage                                  |          |            | 39          |\n| Packing                                  |          |            | 45          |\n\nTotal: 140.71\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 1 1/2 GALV/D PIPE 62'2\"                         | 60       | $1.58      | $94.80      |\n| T E A 11845 SASH LIFTS                          | 4        | $37        | $148        |\n| 1076 X 2 CELLAR WINDOW BOLTS                    | 1/3      | $1.38      | $0.46       |\n| PR 838 X 2\" BUTTS                               | 1/3      | $62        | $21         |\n| 804 - 3 1/2X5 1/2\"                               | 1/3      | $1.50      | $0.50       |\n| 241F-4X4                                        | 4        | $34.50     | $138        |\n| 3 1/2X3 1/2\"                                    | 16       | $24        | $384        |\n| 3 X 3                                           | 4        | $23.50     | $94         |\n| #1750 SCREEN DOOR SETS                           | 1/3      | $3.75      | $1.25       |\n| 2 SUPERIOR CATCHES                              | 1/3      | $1.65      | $0.55       |\n| 45X2 JAP DOOR BUTTONS                            | 1/12     | $1.06      | $0.09       |\n| 1717 STORM SASH HANGERS                         | 2-1/12   | $1.03      | $2.15       |\n| T N 34 HAT & COAT HOOKS                          | 1/3      | $8.60      | $2.87       |\n| KA 620 - 064 INSIDE SETS                         | 1-2/3    | $11.00     | $18.33      |\n| 810 F D                                         | 1/3      | $30.35     | $10.12      |\n| 1240 BD LATCH                                    | 1/12     | $6.10      | $0.51       |\n| 3\" HOOKS & EYES GATE                            | 1/12     | $2.28      | $0.19       |\n| 1/2\"                                             |          |            | $0.24       |\n| 10\" CORR T HINGES IN CARTONS                     | 1/3      | $8.83      | $2.94       |\n| PR 6\"                                            | 1/12     | $3.94      | $0.33       |\n| 16 X 24 W L EN.

This expenditure arose out of a complaint made by the Sisters at the Duck Lake Residential School that the radiators in front of the windows through which access is made to the fire escapes were so high as to render it difficult for the children to reach them. The Reverend Principal secured an estimate and price from a Prince Albert plumber and, in view of the circumstances, I directed him to have the work done. Attached to the voucher is Mr. Daisley's quotation dated September 7th, 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the schools of the Duck Lake Agency which were visited between February 19th and March 16th, during which time I inspected the Agency.\n\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI inspected this school on February 19th, and found everything in its usual good condition and spotlessly clean.\n\nThe school work is carried on in four classrooms, and I believe progress is being made. The children were not afraid to speak out and apparently understood their work. The books were all well kept and their work neatly set down. The pupils were neatly dressed and clean. The classrooms were well aired and all the rooms presented a cheerful appearance.\n\nThe sewing room is large and well lighted. It is well equipped with tables, sewing machines and cupboards for the storing of new garments and material. The work in this department is almost beyond criticism, and the girls certainly receive a splendid training which should be of great service to them.\n\nThe laundry is well equipped with a power washer, drier and roller for pressing or ironing clothes. The work in this department is heavy, but with such splendid equipment neither the Sisters in charge or the girls appear to find the work hard.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe kitchen is well equipped, and I found it very clean and tidy. The work in this Department was carried on without any fuss or excitement and one could hardly credit that meals were being provided for 160 to 175 people.\n\nThe dormitories were well aired and the beds neatly made and covered with white spreads.\n\nThe building is well equipped with fire extinguishers which are placed in convenient places. The water pressure is low and on the top floor the pressure is practically nil. There is only one tank in the school, the capacity of which is about 600 gals. of water. This is certainly not a large supply in case of fire. The approach to the fire escapes is through windows from each flat. The windows are the ordinary windows with outside sash which are hooked on. This is a very awkward arrangement. These windows should be made in one sash and put on hinges so that they could be opened as a door. The exit windows are above the radiators, which have recently been changed, so that now they are even with the window sills, and if the window sash were placed on hinges, the exit to the fire escape would be greatly improved. The cost for this change would not be great. The day I inspected the school the children were just recovering from the Flu, and as the weather was extremely cold, no fire drill was carried out.\n\nThe barns were all tidy, and well cleaned. 20 head of milk cows were stabled, and of this number about 10 were fresh, so that the school had abundance of milk.\n\nThe new\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe new machine shed was filled to capacity, and the two new houses built for the Farmer and Mechanic presented a good appearance and, I understand, are quite comfortable.\n\nThe school, as a whole, showed that the Principal, the Rev. Father Delmas, had the situation well in hand, and undoubtedly the children are receiving the best of instruction and care.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., March 23rd, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Inspector Hamilton's report on the St. Michael's Indian Residential School and on the Day Schools on the John Smith's and James Smith's Reserves, as well as the school at Moose Woods, all under the jurisdiction of the Indian Agent at Duck Lake.\n\nThe report on the St. Michael's School shows that everything in connection with the work is very satisfactory. There is one matter, however, that I might draw to the attention of the Department and that is the Inspector's remarks regarding fire protection. Do the Department think we have adequate protection so far as water is concerned? I think that the window sashes opposite the fire escapes should be altered, and I am giving the Principal instructions to do this. I also think he should have a small step ladder, to be placed under the window when the alarm rings, as it seems to be quite a climb over the radiator to the window for small children.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the fences at the John Smith's Day School, I might say an item of $50.00 was placed in the Estimates for this.\n\nThere is also an item of $50.00 in the Estimates for repairing the teacher's residence at the North Day School, James Smith's Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the Moose Woods Day School, I note that the Inspector doubts if any progress has been made. In fact, the last Public School Inspector's report on this school, made in October last, was very critical. I may say there is nothing\n\nDuncan C.

The funds for the purpose will be noted in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nIt is noted that you have arranged to have the window sashes opposite the fire escapes altered, as suggested by the Inspector.\n\nYou will be informed in separate communications regarding the repairs, etc., required at the day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Each tank is about 4 feet in diameter and 14 feet long giving an approximate capacity of 1,000 gallons for each tank or say 700 gallons of water. Light and power are generated in the institution by a 15 horse power gasoline engine which charges batteries. There is one, 5 horse power motor operating the washing machine in the laundry and one, quarter horse power motor operating the soft water pump.\n\nSoft water is collected in a concrete tank immediately behind the building, the tank being about 20 feet in diameter and 9 feet deep. There are two wells, one of which is connected up to the main building and the other supplies two houses and the two barns.\n\nThe well first referred to is about 100 feet deep and has an 8\" casing. The pump is operated by a two horse power motor, the pump house being connected up by overhead wires to the power plant in the main building. There is also in this pumphouse a six horse power gasoline engine which is not used at the present time but can be connected with the pump should the power break down.\n\nThe pump is made by Goulds Manufacturing Company and on a test made on April 22nd 1929 it was found that water was being pumped at the rate of 8 gallons per minute.\n\nThe cost of operating the power plant is represented by the consumption of about four barrels of gas per month. Gas costs the institution 27 cents per gallon and at 45 gallons to the barrel, this would mean a monthly maintenance cost of about $48, one quarter of which it is estimated is chargeable to pumping.\n\nThe water is pumped to the institution through a 2\" pipe for a distance of 955 feet as shown on the plan. The other well has also a depth of 100 feet with a 6\" casing. It is fitted with a pump operated by a 1\u00bd horse power engine, the capacity of the pump is stated to be 3 gallons per minute. Pipe lines supply two houses and the two barns as shown on the plan. The number of stock watered at the barns is about 40 in winter and 20 in summer.\n\nThere is in addition one six horse power gasoline engine which is at the present used for sawing wood.\n\nThe proposal is to provide an elevated tank of say 25,000 gallons capacity and connect up both wells to this tank in order to provide suitable pressure and storage for fire fighting purposes both at the main building and at the two barns. The school is equipped with hose pipes on each floor but in the event of fire there is only a matter of 700 gallons of water available at the present time.\nWith an elevated tank to provide storage and fire pressure for the building, it is necessary that better pumping equipment be provided so that in the event of the tank being emptied for fire or other purposes it may be filled again within a reasonable period and also may be kept filled in the event of fire. It is therefore suggested that two new pumps be provided as follows:\n\nAt well No. 1 a pump with necessary piping, fittings and valves having a capacity of 1200 to 1500 gallons per hour and operated by a ten horse power gas engine; cost $1,265.\n\nAt well No. 2, 16 foot wind-mill with 40 feet tower, pump with necessary piping, fittings and valves having a capacity of 650 gallons per hour; cost $895.\n\nOne, 25,000 gallon wood storage tank on 60 foot steel tower with equipment for preventing water from freezing; cost erected $3,935.\n\nSeven hundred feet of supply and connecting pipe including labor; cost $1,055.\n\n$7,150.\n\nWith the equipment above suggested the wind-mill would probably keep the building supplied with water at no maintenance cost. The pump at well No. 1 with the ten horse power motor would be required for filling the tank and maintaining the water level in the event of fire and could be regarded as emergency equipment.\n\nThe water in well No. 2 is of practically the same quality as in well No. 1 and the use of a wind-mill to operate the pump at this well is considered more economical. This well would also be connected up with the overhead tank, and pipe lines would be taken to the two barns and if necessary the two residences adjoining, which would permit of all buildings having the required pressure at all times.\n\nThe wooden storage tank is suggested in preference to a steel tank inasmuch as the former can be obtained for about $2,000 less.\n\nRegarding the additional maintenance cost of operating the new equipment, the consumption of gasoline for the proposed engine at well No. 1 would be about one gallon per horse power per day of 24 hours, so that if the engine were running six hours, two and one-half gallons would be consumed. Normally, however, the wind-mill will keep the elevated tank filled and well No. 1 will not be in use, which will result in a saving of about $12.00 per month instead of an additional maintenance cost.\n\nThe protection against fire at the Indian School at Duck Lake is at the present time nil, and it is most desirable that the lives of the pupils and the property of the Department be protected by some scheme similar to that above proposed.\nSir:-\n\nThe question of supplying an elevated tank at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School for the storing of water for use in connection with fire protection, laundry work and general consumption, is one that has been brought to the attention of the Department before, and at one time it was thought we might be able to move to the school site a water tank that belonged to the Penitentiary at Prince Albert. I sent an Inspector up there to look at this tank but it was found that to remove it to the school would be impracticable. I have had a competent man go over the situation at the school and I am enclosing herewith his report, which contains an estimate of the cost of a proposed system. The Department might consider putting in a wooden tank instead of a galvanized iron tank. I should be glad to see this work undertaken, as I think it is absolutely necessary; we should have an adequate water supply at this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

You will remember when I was at the school last summer, you promised to write, indicating which you considered the more urgent - the water tower or the root cellar at the back of the building. As no representations were made in this connection and as there were many really pressing items, there was nothing put in for your school. Since the estimate was prepared, however, Mr. Commissioner Graham has written that he believes the water tower is of prime importance, and I am pleased to state that, with the approval of the Deputy Superintendent General, there will be an item in the estimates next year for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. H. Delmas, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDuck Lake, Sask.,\nAugust 14th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast week we noticed that our supply of feed for our stock got heated and spoiled. The roof of our granary, having been built eighteen years ago, with long pieces of tin on rafters, without any lumber, neither shingles, is very leaky.\n\nTo protect our coming crop, it is necessary to have a new roof on the granary being waterproof, built with lumber and shingles on it.\n\nThe dimensions of the granary are 46 x 31 and the cost of the new roof will be approximately three hundred and fifty dollars ($350.00), including lumber, rafters, shingles, nails and work.\n\nSo I am asking you, Dear Sir, to recommend to the Department the erection of that new roof as most important and obtain the necessary authority to have that work done as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Signed) Rev. H. Delmas,\nPrincipal.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nDuck Lake, Sask.,\nAugust 19th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward attached hereto copy of a communication I have received from the Principal of the Duck Lake Residential School.\n\nThe tin roof of the granary referred to is now useless, being perforated by rust and loosened from the rafters by wind and rain.\n\nIn order to safely store the light crop which they hope to harvest at the school this autumn it is necessary that the roof of the granary be renewed i.e., the tin removed and the rafters recovered with boards and shingles.\n\nAs stated above the crop at the school is light, very light because of the poor weather we have had; cold during the Spring and early summer, and very hot and extremely dry in July and August. One hundred acres of their wheat crop was mowed down not being fit to harvest in the usual way, this will be fed to the stock in lieu of hay, the latter crop not yielding 50% of what it did last year.\n\nI strongly recommend that the request be granted and that I be authorized to have the work done as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. P. Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing a copy of a communication from the Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School relative to the repairs required to the roof of the granary.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $350 in having a new lumber and shingled roof placed on the granary. It is expected that the school authorities will carry out the greater part of the labour and any freighting of the material required, and, if possible, the cost to the Department for material, etc., should be kept at a lower amount than that authorized above. You should forward a certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for the material and labour that it is really necessary to engage. The school authorities should arrange to have this roof completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. B.

You might designate the well: number 1 and number 2, number 1 being the well which is at present connected up with the school and number 2 the well which supplies the house and the two barns.\n\nI have been discussing the question of pumps and wind mills with the maker's representatives in Regina and they have confirmed the opinion that I expressed, that it should be unwise to recommend any larger size of pump until the two wells had been tested out. Would you therefore arrange for the following test to be made on each well:\n\n(1) The distance from the ground surface to the water level in the well to be noted.\n(2) The pump to be started up and kept operating continuously for a period of say four hours.\n(3) At the end of this period the distance from the ground surface to the water level in the well to be again measured. By making the above observations it will be possible to estimate what size of a pump can safely be installed without danger of closing up the well by admitting too much sand.\n(4) The capacity of each of the two pumps is also required. This may be arrived at by disconnecting the pipe line and pumping direct into some large vessel and recording the number of seconds or minutes required to fill a tank of known capacity.\n\nIf you will be good enough to arrange for this information to be forwarded to me in the course of a few days it will be of considerable assistance in enabling me to give you reliable advice.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRegina, May 29th., 1929.\n\nDear Father Delmas:\n\nI received your letter of the 27th, and was glad to know that the report which I sent you seemed to be what you wanted.\n\nRegarding the best location for the proposed water tower, I would recommend the location which we discussed on the ground, namely just south of the two houses used by the Indians and south of the existing two inch water line from number one well to the building.\n\nI think you will see the spot marked in pencil on the blue print.\n\nWith reference to the guarantee that the water will not freeze, the firm who supply the water tower will provide for this. There is special heating apparatus arranged for under the water tower at a cost of about $300.00 which is included in the price which I gave you and the firm who install the tower should be asked to give a guarantee on this matter.\n\nI am quite satisfied that the water from number two well can be made perfectly safe for drinking purposes. It is true that the examination showed the presence of B. Goli, but this is simply due to some surface contamination entering at the top of the well and this can easily be prevented in making all connections perfectly watertight when the wind-mill is erected.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly.\nREPORT ON WATER SUPPLY AT INDIAN SCHOOL AT DUCK LAKE.\n\nThere are about 150 pupils resident in the school, both boys and girls and 20 of a Staff, making a total of 170.\n\nIn the basement there are two pressure tanks, one for soft water from the roof and one for the well water. Each tank is about 4 feet in diameter and 14 feet long giving an approximate capacity of 1000 gallons for each tank or say 700 gallons of water. Light and power are generated in the institution by a 15 horse power gasoline engine which charges batteries. There is one, 5 horse power motor operating the washing machines in the laundry and one, quarter horse power motor operating the soft water pump.\n\nSoft water is collected in a concrete tank immediately behind the building, the tank being about 20 feet in diameter and 9 feet deep. There are two wells, one of which is connected up to the main building and the other supplies two houses and the two barns.\n\nThe well first referred to is 100 feet deep and has an 8\" casing. The pump is operated by a two horse power motor, the pump house being connected up by overhead wires to the power plant in the main building. There is also in this pumphouse a six horse power gasoline engine which is not used at the present time but can be connected with the pump should the power down.\n\nThe pump is made by Goulds Manufacturing Company and on a test made on April 22nd, 1929 it was found that water was being pumped at the rate of 8 gallons per minute.\n\nThe cost of operating the power plant is represented by the consumption of about four barrels of gas per month. Gas costs the institution 27 cents per gallon and at 40 gallons to the barrel, this would mean a monthly maintenance cost of about $48, one quarter of which it is estimated is chargeable to pumping.\n\nThe water is pumped to the institution through a 2\" pipe for a distance of 956 feet as shown on the plan. The other well has also a depth of 100 feet with a 6\" casing. It is fitted with a pump operated by a 11/2 horse power engine, the capacity of the pump is stated to be 3 gallons per minute. Pipe lines supply two houses and the two barns as shown on the plan. The number of stock watered at the barns is about 40 in winter and 30 in summer.\n\nThere is in addition one six horse power gasoline engine which is at the present used for sawing wood.\n\nThe proposal is to provide an elevated tank of say 25,000 gallons capacity and connect up both wells to this tank in order to provide suitable pressure and storage for fire fighting purposes both at the main building and at the two barns. The school is equipped with hose pipes on each floor but in the event of fire there is only a matter of 700 gallons of water available at the present time.\nWith an elevated tank to provide storage and fire pressure in the building, it is necessary that better pumping equipment be provided so that in the event of the tank being emptied for fire or other purposes it may be filled again within a reasonable period and also may be kept filled in the event of fire. It is therefore suggested that two new pumps be provided as follows:\n\nAt well No. 1 a pump with necessary piping, fittings and valves having a capacity of 1200 to 1500 gallons per hour and operated by a ten horse power gas engine; cost $1265\n\nAt well No. 2, 16-foot wind-mill with 40 feet tower, pump with necessary piping, fittings and valves having a capacity of 650 gallons per hour; cost $895\n\nOne, 25,000 gallon wood storage tank on 60 foot steel tower with equipment for preventing water from freezing; cost $3035\n\nSeven hundred feet of supply and connecting pipe including labor; cost $7180\n\nWith the equipment above suggested the wind-mill would probably keep the building supplied with water at no maintenance cost. The pump at well No. 1 with the ten horse power motor would be required for filling the tank and maintaining the water level in the event of fire and could be regarded as emergency equipment.\n\nThe water in well No. 2 is practically the same quality as in well No. 1 and the use of a wind-mill to operate the pump at this well is considered more economical. This well would also be connected up with the overhead tank, and pipe lines would be taken to the two barns and if necessary the two residences adjoining, which would permit all buildings having the required pressure at all times.\n\nThe wooden storage tank is suggested in preference to a steel tank inasmuch as the former can be obtained for about $2,000 less.\n\nRegarding the additional maintenance cost of operating the new equipment, the consumption of gasoline for the proposed engine at well No. 1 would be about one gallon per horse power per day of 24 hours, so that if the engine were running six hours, two and one-half gallons would be consumed. Normally, however, the wind-mill will keep the elevated tank filled and well No. 1 will not be in use, which will result in a saving of about $12.00 per month instead of an additional maintenance cost.\n\nThe protection against fire at the Indian School at Duck Lake is at the present time nil, and it is more desirable that the lives of the pupils and the property of the Department be protected by some scheme similar to that above proposed.\nRegina, May 31st, 1929.\n\nDear Father Holmes:\n\nI am sorry to have been so long in sending you a report on the proposed changes in the water supply for the Duck Lake Residential School.\n\nI have been in touch with the manufacturers of pumps, wind-mills and water tanks getting quotations from them; furthermore I have been visiting at various points in the Province in connection with other matters.\n\nYour letter of April 24th, giving the results of the test of the wells was duly received and the information was given to the pump manufacturers.\n\nI have now heard from the firms to whom I wrote and have given you my estimates in the accompanying report.\n\nI trust that the information may be of some service to you and if there is anything further which you wish to have explained, please do not hesitate to write me.\n\nI am today returning to you, under separate cover, the blue print which you were good enough to lend to me on the occasion of my inspection.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\nMay 21, 1930.\n\nDear Father Delmas,\n\nWith reference to our conversation when you were in the office recently, regarding the water supply system for your School, I beg to say that the Indian Commissioner of Regina has today been authorized to proceed with this work in accordance with the suggestions contained in the report which you left with me while in Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. Father Delmas,\nPrincipal,\nDuck Lake Indian School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nMay 21, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 17th of June last year, I beg to say that funds are now available for the providing of the elevated tank, pumps, etc., at the Duck Lake School, and you may, therefore, arrange to have this equipment installed as detailed in the report submitted with your letter of the 11th of June last year. It is noted that the total cost will be approximately $7,150. This included the 25000 gal storage tank of wooden construction erected on steel tower.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing, Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\nInspector Hamilton's Report on the Schools in the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the schools of the Duck Lake Agency, inspected while at the Agency between May 6th and May 23rd, 1930.\n\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.)\n\nThe classroom work is carried on in four classrooms, and is arranged as follows:\n\nSenior boys with Mr. J. T. Bizikewick in charge. The grades are:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| III   | 14     |\n| IV    | 8      |\n| V     | 5      |\n| VI    | 2      |\n| VII   | 1      |\n| Total | 30     |\n\nJunior boys with Sister St. Boniface in charge. The grades are:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 22     |\n| II    | 9      |\n| Total | 31     |\n\nSenior girls with Sister St. Melaine in charge, and grades arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| III   | 12     |\n| IV    | 6      |\n| V     | 8      |\n| VI    | 2      |\n| Total | 28     |\n\nThe junior girls are in charge of W.

MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nI found these children all well along in their grades, and they were not timid and backward in answering questions. They were all neatly dressed and were clean in person.\n\nThe classrooms were all clean and properly ventilated. The registers were neatly marked and timetables were made out for each room.\n\nThe teachers appear to be getting good results, and the discipline is excellent.\n\nThe work in the sewing room, laundry, and kitchen was all in progress during my visit, and all departments were under excellent supervision, and splendid work is being done.\n\nThe dormitories were clean. All beds were neatly made, and the rooms were well aired.\n\nThe school is provided with fire extinguishers and the necessary equipment. A water tower was estimated for this year, and, if granted, will provide splendid protection against fire. At present the supply tanks are too small. Fire drill is observed, but on account of the rain and mud, it was not carried out during my inspection.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings I found in good repair.\n\nA large herd of cattle is kept, and sufficient milk is always available for the children.\n\nThe work on the land was well along, and this year the crop will be as follows:\n\n| Crop   | Acres |\n|--------|-------|\n| Wheat  | 150   |\n| Oats   | 100   |\n| Barley | 50    |\n\nThe farm work\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe farm work seen was well done, and I believe the children of this school are receiving splendid care and an excellent training in the various departments.\n\nA root cellar is badly needed as a large quantity of vegetables are grown each year. This, as well as a storehouse, was asked for in the Estimates.\n\nThe Assistant Principal was in charge as the Rev. Father Delmas was away in the East. I was pleased with the discipline and the general management of the school, and I found excellent care being given to all Government property.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection made by Mr. Hamilton of the various schools in the Duck Lake Indian Agency.\n\nSt. Michael's R.C. School.\n\nYou will note there is an enrolment of 135 here, and that the school was found in its usual good shape, the children clean and tidy, and well fed. Reference is made to the fire equipment. I have your authority to go ahead with the erection of a water tower, and we are now getting prices and dealing with the matter.\n\nWith reference to a root cellar for vegetables, this was estimated for but as yet has not been authorized.\n\nJohn Smith's Indian Day School.\n\nThe report on this school is quite satisfactory. The suggestion to convert the present garden into a playground for the children is a good one. An item was placed in the Estimates to provide some playground equipment but as yet I have not received authority to make the purchase.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJames Smith's Day School\n\nThere is a satisfactory enrolment here. The children were clean and everything appears to be in good shape.\n\nMoose Woods Day School\n\nThis school was also in good shape, and the children are making progress. The Inspector draws attention to the fact that the school building needs exterior painting and the teacher's residence is in need of both interior and exterior decoration. Amounts were in the Estimates for this work but the authority has not yet been received.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nOttawa, June 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 305-11 of the 12th instant, enclosing Inspector Hamilton's reports on the schools in the Duck Lake Agency. With reference to the Indian Residential School, I note that the Inspector makes the usual good report. I regret there are no funds for a root cellar this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the matter of a water supply at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to say that after going into the question further I have decided to recommend that the Department abandon the idea of having an elevated tank outside.\n\nI have discussed the matter with several people who depend upon water other than from a city supply and the majority are in favour of the pressure tank system in a country like this where there is so much frost, and the expense of keeping a tank warm is great. The fact that these tanks are being abandoned at certain places should be sufficient reason for the Department not to go on with the installation of one at Duck Lake. I admit that this was at first recommended by me after having had the advice of certain people, but I am satisfied now that it would be a mistake.\n\nI would ask for your authority to put in a pressure tank system, and I might say that I had Mr. Millar of the Fairbanks-Morse Company go up to Duck Lake, and he recommends that a hole be dug in the ground close to the boiler room, covered with concrete, to receive two tanks 45\" in diam. by 24 ft. long, with approximate capacity each of 2260 gals. He also recommends that on Well No. 1 a deep well turbine pump be placed with an approximate capacity of 170 gals. per minute, directly connected to\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nvertical motor and automatically controlled by pressure in tanks, and a 3\" pipe line from same well to main building and connected to tanks. On Well No. 2, a 16 ft. windmill on 50 ft. tower connected to deep well pump, connected to main 3\" line pipe.\n\nThis matter was discussed with Father Delmas, and he is quite satisfied to have this change made, as he claims he knows nothing about the elevated tanks.\n\nThe cost of installing this system will be considerably less than for the system first proposed, and more satisfactory.\n\nAs there is urgency in this matter I should be glad if you would let me know by wire if I may proceed with the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nAugust 2, 1930.\n\nW. M.

As soon as we noticed that we were going to have a great storm, on Saturday night, we stopped the windmill to keep it on the safe way.\n\nUnfortunately we found it yesterday morning so badly broken that it is beyond repairs.\n\nIt worked with very good satisfaction for nearly a month; supplying three quarters of the water required without any cost. We never noticed anything wrong in its structure. But Mr. Miller of the Fairbanks-Morse Co. never inspected it. As the contract is not completed it up to him to supply a new one.\n\nWe might be in a very bad position, regarding our water supply supposing that now the old pump of well No. 1 gives away, before the electric power, provided by the Saskatchewan Power Commission reaches us.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSgd.

This involved the installation of two or three small motors to meet the necessary change to an alternating system, the order for which he placed with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company. He brought with him the account therefor amounting to $149.40. I enclose Regina voucher No. 11 for that amount and beg to recommend payment thereof.\n\nThe plant that was in use there now becomes available for any other like institution and is held at the school at the disposal of the Department. The equipment includes one 15 H.P. engine with battery, a 7\u00bd H.P. and 3 H.P. motor, together with a pump which was being used at the well. The Reverend Father arranged for the change himself, but I think his action was justified as the cost of operation will be less than heretofore.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

This voucher covers the cost of some fittings which were necessary for the Duck Lake School, and the remarks contained in my letter of the 7th instant, with which I forwarded Voucher No. 11, will apply in the present case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, in which he informs me that he has on hand one 15 h.p. engine, 2 motors (direct)-56 batteries, all in good order. Since the school has been connected up with the Saskatchewan Power Commission, these are surplus to the requirements at the school.\n\nI am advised that in order to keep the batteries in good shape they should be charged regularly, and as batteries are required from time to time at various points, I am instructing the Principal to have the 56 batteries sent to Regina, where I shall have them re-charged and stored, and when batteries are required at any point we can supply them from here.\n\nI should like you to bear in mind that we have this engine and motors on hand at Duck Lake. Also the batteries, which as I say will be stored here in Regina. There will be a small charge for having these batteries shipped and re-charged, but this is the only thing to do in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. M.

DELMAS, O.M.I.,\nPRINCIPAL, DUCK LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nDUCK LAKE, SASK., ADDRESSED TO BISHOP J. GUY.\n\n---\n\nPermit me to ask you to render us a service from the Department.\n\nSince the 10th of January, 23 receive light from the Provincial Electric Power, of Saskatoon. Mr. Graham had some motors, required for the alternating current, sent us by the Department.\n\nNow we need about 10 posts more and stronger wire for the motor of the pump and the buildings outside.\n\nCould you possibly insist with Mr. Ferrier so that Mr. Graham could make the necessary arrangements with the Saskatchewan Power Commission to that effect. This work would cost about $600.\n\nIt is ourselves and not the Department who have installed the electric wire of the old building on old red spruce posts to bring the power to the pump and the light to the outside buildings.\n\nWe have, at the disposal of the Department an engine of 15 horse power with dynamo and 54 batteries, all in good order; also 2 direct current motors; one for the pump and the other one for the laundry.\nOttawa, February 19, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 305-11A R.C. of the 14th instant, with reference to electric equipment which is now surplus at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. I note that the batteries have been sent to Regina, for recharging and storing.\n\nA church officer, who visited Ottawa recently, states that he believes some additional improvements are now required at this school. It is claimed that the 10 posts, which take the power from the main building to the pump and to the outbuildings, need replacement and that heavier wiring is required for these outbuilding and pump connections. Will you please make enquiries in this respect and let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nconsideration.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nC.P. Schmidt\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my report respecting the Duck Lake Indian Residential School for the month of January 1931.\n\nWhile visiting through the buildings the Sister in charge of the Laundry Department drew my attention to the fact that they have no means for boiling certain linens which should be boiled or for heating the sad irons, except on the Kitchen Range, and this is not satisfactory as it interferes more or less with the preparing of meals. A small Electric washing machine (family size) should also be provided for special linens or clothes which it does not do to wash in the big washer used for heavy or coarser clothing.\n\nTwo small four wheel trucks should also be provided for moving the wet clothes from the big washer to the wringer (extractor) and from there to the drying lines some of which are in the girls wash room which is quite a distance from the Laundry. Suitable boxes could be made by the school mechanic to be placed on these trucks, this would do away with a good deal of heavy lifting or sliding of tubs on the floors by the older girls who do this work.\n\nThe Laundry is not equipped with a dryer which is much needed as the drying of clothes on lines inside the building in winter is cumbersome, slow and not practical.\n\nNow that the lighting system is connected with the Provincial Power lines, a part of the room formerly used for storage batteries which adjoins the Laundry could be made into a drying room at very little cost. I beg to ask that the Department give these matters their kind and just\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report from Agent Schmidt, of which two copies were sent to this office, with regard to requests made by the Sister in charge of the Laundry Department at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School for certain equipment.\n\nThe matter of the washing machine was mentioned in Inspector Hamilton's report, and I touched upon it in my covering letter. I think a machine of this kind could very well be provided by the school.\n\nWith regard to the four-wheel trucks for moving the wet clothes, I do not think this equipment is necessary. At the Qu'Appelle School where they have twice the number of pupils they have at Duck Lake they do not use trucks, in fact I do not know of any school where they have them.\n\nI suppose when the Department built this school they decided not to install a dryer, and I do not know that they have changed their minds.\n\nI do think they might be supplied with a small stove on which to boil the linens and heat the irons. This seems to be essential.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 305-11A R.O. of the 26th ultimo, with enclosure, concerning the laundry at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. I regret there are no funds for a small electric washing machine, for trucks for moving wet clothes or for a drier. You may arrange, however, to supply a small stove for boiling certain linens and for heating irons. You will please see that there is no unnecessary expense and that the installation does not constitute a fire hazard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\n\nRyrie, Sask., Feb. 23rd, 1931\n\nDUCK LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.)\n\nThe classroom work is arranged as follows.\n\nThe senior girls are in charge of Sister St. Melanie.\n\nThe grades are arranged from 3 to 5 with 35 pupils enrolled.\nDuck Lake R.C. Indian Residential School (Cont'd.)\n\nenrolled. This Sister does excellent work, and the children are well along in their grades. The junior teacher for the girls is Sister St. Ulric. There are 28 children in grade 1, and 11 in grade 2. The children were bright, and I believe are making fair progress. I understand this Sister only took over the work about a year ago, and I have no doubt experience will increase confidence in herself. I understand this Sister does not hold a Saskatchewan certificate, but has a two year Quebec training. The boys' junior teacher is Sister Therese of St. Joseph, and there are 33 pupils on the roll, 24 in Grade 1, and 9 in Grade 2. These children are very alert, and I would judge good progress is made. The senior boys have Mr. Burzie, who, I understand, holds his Second Interim Certificate for Saskatchewan, and is doing excellent work. There are 32 enrolled, and the grades range from 3 to 6. The children were all well dressed, neat in appearance, and clean. The rooms were well aired, and are bright and cheerful. I found the registers neatly kept, and the attendance is excellent.\n\nThe laundry, kitchen, and sewing room are in charge of the Sisters, and excellent work is carried on. There is no confusion in any department, and the work does not appear difficult or hard. The laundry is well equipped, except for a small stove, which is needed in order that the clothes may be boiled. At present the irons are heated on the kitchen range, which is inconvenient, especially when a meal is being prepared. The kitchen is down the main hall from the laundry, and children are often passing back and forth and might easily be burned when carrying the irons, as the hall is not well lighted.\nlighted. A small stove with a flat top, fitted with a copper boiler, could be used for the boiling of the clothes, and also for the heating of irons. At present no clothes are boiled, and it is impossible to keep the white clothes in good condition unless they are. The Sisters made the request for a family size electric washer, which could be used for the staff washing, and would often save, especially in holiday season, the operating of the large power washer, and it would also be a saving on water and soap.\n\nThe girls do all plain sewing, which includes the making of their own dresses, nightgowns, and overalls and shirts for the boys. In addition, they do the mending and darning, all of which is well done, and the training will be of great benefit in later life.\n\nThe dormitories are large, well aired, bright, and spotlessly clean. The beds were neatly made, and the bedding was clean.\n\nThe new pressure tanks are now in use, and good pressure is obtained throughout the building. The new pump apparently is giving good service, and the Rev. Father Delmas assured me he was well satisfied with the system.\n\nThe fire hose are in good repair, and extinguishers are placed in prominent places throughout the building. The Reverend Principal assured me that fire drill is observed regularly, and the children are familiar with what is expected of them.\n\nThe milk cows were in good condition, and are well cared for. The milk cows number about 26 head, and several have\nseveral have already freshened, so that the school is receiving a fair supply of milk. In addition to the milk cows, a herd of about 70 head is fed outside. This herd supplies the beef, and includes many young heifers which later will form part of the milking herd.\n\nA number of brood sows are kept, and I understand that all pork needed for the institution is produced there.\n\nI found the horses in excellent condition, and the stables were clean and in good repair.\n\nThe children were well, except for two or three with bad colds, and these were in bed receiving care and attention from the nursing Sister.\n\nThe meals consist of wheat porridge, milk, bread, grease, and tea for breakfast; for dinner and supper - meat, vegetables, bread, butter or lard, syrup or dried fruit, and tea with sugar is provided. Fish is often substituted for meat. Milk often replaces tea. The children apparently receive plenty, and the food is well prepared and wholesome.\n\nThe school, throughout, is well managed, and the staff members appear capable for the duties assigned to them.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a very satisfactory report on the schools in the Duck Lake Agency, comprising three Day Schools and one Residential School.\n\nYou will note that at the Moose Woods Day School there is an enrolment of 13 pupils, with an average attendance of 12.15, and that the children are neatly dressed and clean in appearance. This speaks very well for the parents on this reserve, who are not under the guidance of a White Instructor, but merely the influence of the teacher, Miss Hare, who is quite capable. The Inspector points out that the school and residence are in good repair, but that both buildings are badly in need of painting, and that a fence is also required. I would point out that $150.00 was placed in the Estimates for painting, and $55.00 for a fence. I should be glad to see these items approved.\n\nAt the John Smith's Day School the work seems to be carried on under a capable teacher. The attendance here is highly satisfactory. It is pleasing to note that here too, where we have no resident Farming Instructor, the children were found to be well clothed and neat in appearance.\n\n-At the-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAt the Fort a la Corne South Day School the teacher is apparently getting splendid results, and the training the children receive will certainly be of great benefit to them in later life. The Inspector points out that there is no well at this school, which is a great handicap. There is an amount of $100.00 in the Estimates for a well, and I hope it has not been struck out.\n\nThe Inspector points out that a new furnace is badly needed at the Fort a la Corne North Day School, as the one now in use is beyond repair. This is a matter that calls for immediate action. I may point out that we asked the Department to place an item of $275.00 in the Supplementary Estimates to provide a furnace, and I should be glad to be advised at as early a date as possible if it is being allowed, as I would like to have the furnace installed as soon as spring comes.\n\nThe report on the Duck Lake Residential School is most satisfactory. I think the children in this school are getting a good training in all branches of the work. There is one matter which I think should be drawn to the attention of the Department, and that is that the Sister in charge of the Junior grades does not hold a Saskatchewan Certificate.\n\nThe children receive a splendid training in all branches of domestic work, but the Inspector does not state whether the girls are being taught to milk cows or not. I am rather inclined to think they are, notwithstanding the fact that there is no mention of it in the report.\n\nYou will note a request is made for a family size electric washer, so that the staff washing can be done separately. I do not know that the Department should be called upon to supply this.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the wholesome meals that the children at this school receive. I know they get all the vegetables that are good for them, as well as a good quantity of fresh milk.\n\nThe report on the whole, as I say, is very satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.H. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nOn the 14th February last I advised you of the dismantling of the engine and motors at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School and that I proposed to have shipped and stored at Regina the batteries in use with the 15 H.P. engine. I wrote the Principal, asking him to have them carefully packed, but received a letter from him which indicates that the proposed method of shipment could not be carried out. I therefore asked the Manager of the Delco-Light-Frigidaire Company here to advise me what would be the best arrangement to adopt in having these batteries taken care of and brought to Regina for storage. His report in reply indicates that great care must be taken and that, unless certain shipping instructions are followed out, the railway company will not accept them for transportation. The expenditure involved, including the time and expense of an expert who will have to proceed to Duck Lake to superintend the packing, will cost $239.60, according to the estimate furnished me by Mr. J. M. Sharpe, the Manager of the Company referred to.\n\nI do not feel justified in incurring this expenditure without submitting the matter for the consideration of the Department. I should like to be advised what action the Department desires to be taken to properly take care of these valuable batteries, which Mr. Sharpe estimates are worth about $1,000.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nApril 7, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD.\n\nAt the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, south of Prince Albert, Sask., electric power is now available, and there is an electric battery surplus to their requirements. Such a battery is now required at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, at Cranbrook, B.C., and I wish to arrange shipment. It will be necessary to have the name of a competent storage battery firm in Prince Albert, to whom the Department can entrust the preparation and packing. This is work that requires an expert. Further, the railway will not accept storage batteries unless they are crated in a certain manner.\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, April 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 305-11A R.C. of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the electric battery at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. A battery of this type is now required at one of our Indian residential schools in British Columbia, and the Department is arranging to have a competent storage battery firm in Prince Albert do the packing and shipping. It should be kept in mind that there is still at this school, surplus to requirements, a 15 horse power engine, a dynamo and two direct current motors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Department No. 109-1-5 of the 19th of February last, I have been ascertaining through the Saskatchewan Power Commission what additional improvements, if any, are required at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School to better the service they are securing from the Commission, and I am advised that no great outlay is needed at the present time. The Commission proposes to install another metering device at the school to record both the lighting and the power load, and I understand that this is all the change necessary at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Sir:\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Guy has referred to the Department a communication which he received from you regarding certain further requirements for the electric light service at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. The Department referred this matter to Mr. Commissioner Graham, informing him of your request that 10 posts, which take the power from the main building to the pump and to the outbuildings, be replaced and that heavier wiring is required for these outbuilding and pump connections. In a recent communication from the Indian Commissioner, he states that he is advised that no great outlay is needed at the present time, and that the Saskatchewan Power Commission proposes to install another metering device at the school to record both the lighting and power load, and that this is all the change necessary at the present time.\n\nI should be pleased to have your further advice in connection with any additional improvements that may be required to the lighting system at the Duck Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Will you please employ Mr. William Urton, of Duck Lake, to assist your engineer and to properly prepare and pack the battery for shipment.

Boarding School, I beg to say that two of the Sisters from this institution came to Regina to see me and they made a very urgent request to be supplied with an electric washing machine to enable them to do the staff washing separately, and after the representations they made to me I am inclined to recommend that if at all possible their request be granted.\n\nI may say that the cost of this machine will not exceed $150.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Geohrane brought over this telegram and Mr. Chene authorized the work - as reply had to be given Friday afternoon.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that I received a long distance call from the Duck Lake Residential School on April 24th informing me that the well from which they obtained their main water supply had failed. I left the same evening for Duck Lake and the following morning investigated the situation.\n\nThe well in question was sunk twenty-three years ago. It is approximately 110 feet in depth, a drilled hole with 8\" iron casing. A concrete building was erected over this well. It is connected with the school by a pipe line 800 feet in length. The well has an iron casing 8\" in diameter with a long Johnston screen at the bottom. During the long period that this well has been in use I am informed that several foreign articles have been dropped down the casing, such as tools, piping etc., inadvertently dropped while workmen were engaged from time to time in making repairs.\n\nOwing to the small size of the hole and its depth, it is impossible to ascertain just what has happened; but I suspect that the screen has become perforated allowing the sand to fill in and shut off the water supply. It may be also that the casing has become eaten into and perforated. I examined several pieces of heavy piping which had been used in the well and found these were perforated in many places. The inference I took from this was that possibly the same action had occurred in connection with the iron casing. In order to repair the well it would be necessary to tear down the concrete building and have a drilling machine remove the foreign matter at the bottom and also to clear out the sand; but, when that had been accomplished, it is doubtful if a satisfactory job of repairing could be made and in any event I believe the operation would cost in the neighborhood of $300.00.\n\nI find upon enquiry that water in the district surrounding the school building can be obtained at from 90 to 115 feet. There appears to be no question but that an ample supply of water can be obtained anywhere in that particular area by drilling to a depth of approximately 100 feet. I am informed on good authority that we can expect the present pipe line to last not longer than three or four years, possibly five. It will then have to be renewed at a cost, including the laying of the pipe line at approximately $1.00 per foot, of $800.00.\n\nIn taking these matters into consideration, I, after consulting with the Principal and the Indian Agent, came to the conclusion that it would be cheaper to sink a new well in close proximity to the school building; in fact immediately adjoining the cellar.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nadjoining the cellar in which the pressure tanks are housed. It is proposed to excavate a chamber which will have concrete walls and roof and which will open into a chamber containing pressure tanks; thus making a frost-proof chamber for the pump which will be easily accessible from the school building and which will do away entirely with the 800 feet of pipe line at present connecting the old well.\n\nIn the meantime they are obtaining a limited supply of water from a well which was sunk by the Provincial Government on the road allowance South of the school, but they are only obtaining barely sufficient for domestic use and not enough for washing purposes and, of course, there would be no surplus on hand in the event of fire. The fire hazard of course at this time of the year is not so great as it would be during the cold weather.\n\nI made enquiry regarding a well driller and find that the only outfit in the district which is large enough to drill an 8\" hole is owned by Mr. R. E. Creelman, of Saskatoon. This man has been working all winter drilling test holes in Seepse on the Saskatchewan River for the Provincial Government. His outfit at present is on the school grounds. Father Holmes, the Principal, asked me to hold it there until a decision was arrived at by our Department. However Mr. Creelman informed me that he had work to do in Saskatoon with the driller but would hold it for a limited time for us.\n\nFollowing are the estimated details of the cost:\n\nDrilling 8\" hole 120 feet at $2.50 $300.00\nRot Iron 8\" casing at $2.50 236.00\n1 only drilling shoe and 1 only drilling head 38.00\n1 only screen 100.00\n1 man hole, chamber for installing pump, pipes etc. to connect with pressure tanks 79.00 $650.00\n\nI trust I have made myself clear in the foregoing report and that my action in sending you such a lengthy newsletter will be considered justified by the circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nRe Duck Lake Indian School\n\nSaskatoon, Sask. May 4/34.\n\n6.10 p.m.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that I interviewed Mr. Creelman this afternoon and found that he can start immediately. This, however, is dependent on casing being on the ground, as he cannot drill more than a few feet without it. Consequently I took the responsibility of ordering 120 feet of 3\" genuine wrought iron casing (similar to that in the old well), drive shoe and driving head from the only available source, viz., Cranes & Limited of Saskatoon. A copy of the order is enclosed. This immediate action was obligatory, as it supplies an opportunity for Mr. Creelman to begin work.\n\nThe next important matter is to provide for the extension to the tank basement. The extension will be 25' long (jutting out from the building) and 6' wide and about 7' deep. It will lie parallel and contiguous to the tank basement, with floor sides and ceiling of re-inforced concrete.\n\nMy first thought was to return to Duck Lake tomorrow morning and procure workmen and building materials and provide definitely for construction of the basement as soon as Creelman has finished the well, i.e., definitely plan for whole work. However, on second thought on reading the telegram \"to initiate work\", I wondered whether this gave me the authority to hire the men and definitely start the work towards completion. Personally, I think it does definitely instruct you (and me) to go ahead.\n\nHowever, a short delay in this part of the work will not hurt matters, especially as Mr. Creelman will be some time drilling the well. Incidentally his charges are $2.50 per foot. The depth will probably be about 120 feet. This is the standard price and was mentioned to Mr. Agent Schmidt at the beginning. It is a reasonable price, especially considering the small depth. He would not definitely set an exact time but it will be at least 10 days.\n\nHowever, I propose to proceed to North Battleford tomorrow morning, thence to Meadow Lake in the afternoon, and do the hydrometric work (5 streams) at the beginning of the week, then proceed again to Battleford to settle the matter of drilling the well at Sandfield School between Nicholson and Rahrick. I was unable to do this during the present week because of the state of the roads. These are now dry and I wish to go to Meadow Lake before rain comes again, today being the first dry one for a week.\n\nI will then be able to provide time for yourself, the Director and the Indian Department to decide whether I am to come again to Saskatoon and Duck Lake to further the work. If I do not receive definite instructions by the time I arrive in North Battleford or Saskatoon after the Meadow Lake visit, I will take it for granted that I shall definitely proceed with the full installation. In any case I interpret the telegram to the effect that all arrangements are to be proceeded with when I return to Duck Lake about May 9 or 10, approximately. I do not expect to pass through Saskatoon when travelling from North Battleford to Duck Lake. The route lies 14 miles...\nnorth.

Indian School\n\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan\n\nby\n\nP.A. Fetterly, B.Sc.,\n\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report\n\nA telegram was received from the Director, dated April 26, 1934, to the effect that the water supply at Duck Lake Indian School had failed and requested that an inspection be made immediately.\n\nThe writer proceeded to carry out these instructions, arriving at Duck Lake on May 2. The preliminary inspection was made in company with Mr. C.P. Schmidt, Indian Agent; Rev. Father Delmas, the Principal; and Mr. Forsythe, the School Engineer.\n\n2. Necessary Water Supply\n\nThe total staff and pupils amount to 180. The stock includes 100 head of cattle together with horses, sheep, pigs, etc., in proportion, necessitating an available supply of 7000 or 8000 gallons per day or more, at certain times such as winter, Washing, etc.\n\n3. Available Supply.\n\n(a) Well No.1 was drilled by the Government of the North West Territories many years ago for the use of\ntravellers. It is situated 6' inside (or outside) the boundaries of the school lands, being about 300 feet southwest of the school building. It is probably about 100 feet deep. It actually may or may not be considered as belonging to the school. An eight-foot windmill mounted on a thirty-foot tower, together with an auxiliary 5 h.p. gasoline engine, supply the motive power. This well is at present producing all of the water used by the school. Consequently, if it should cease production for any reason, e.g., during the winter, the school would be entirely deprived of water.\n\nIncidentally, it will be noted that, up to the present, the Government has been subjected to no expense for wells at this School.\n\n(b) Well No.2 was drilled about 1910 by the Mission Authorities to a depth of 105 feet, near the site of the original school which afterwards burned down. This well is 900 feet west of the present school buildings, and is connected with the tanks at the new school by a 2\" galvanized pipe, buried 9 feet below the surface and 900 feet long.\n\nThis well is situated in a pump house 18' square made of concrete walls 10\" thick and ceiling 5\" thick. In addition, a false sloping roof made of lumber and from 5' to 6' high has been superimposed on the old ceiling which itself is 10 feet high. The concrete portion of the ceiling has two heavy steel railway rails located about 6 feet apart and resting on the walls, for additional support.\nThis well is equipped with 8\" casing, 3\" pipe and a 5 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse motor capable of pumping 1500 gallons per hour. The motor is located in the bottom of a small pit 6' x 3' which has been excavated to a depth of 2' in the bottom of a larger pit 6' square and 12 feet deep. The normal distance from surface of ground to water surface is 28 feet.\n\nThis is the well which has failed to produce water. An examination was made by the writer of its capacity.\n\n**Present Condition of Well No.2.**\n\nThe pump was started and the casing was emptied to the bottom of the 45 feet of 3\" pipe in 2\u00bd minutes. It then \"sucked\". The water resumes its original height (28' below surface of the ground) in about 5 minutes. This means that the water is running into the casing at an impossibly slow rate. This produces a serious situation which cannot remain for long without improvement.\n\nOriginally the water lowered one foot when pumping continuously for 4 hours. At present the pump has been actuated for half a day with only a few gallons resulting.\n\nFather Delmas thinks the casing has \"burst\". Mr. Greelman thinks that the screen was not placed originally below the casing. The proper method is to drive the casing below its permanent position, insert the screen,\nand then pull the casing upwards the length of the screen, leaving the latter at the bottom of the hole. Again, the bottom of the casing may be plugged with sand or foreign matter. At any rate it is known that an old cylinder, a wrench and other foreign materials are now at the bottom of the hole, in the casing.\n\nLabour and Cost of Renovation of Well No.2.\n\nThis method of improving the water supply was fully examined by the writer during his visit.\n\nFirstly, it would be necessary to breach the concrete walls and ceiling, also remove the lumber roof, of the pump-house to a width of at least 8' in order to allow the drilling rig to be placed over the hole which is six feet inside the building. The steel rails which are embedded in the concrete ceiling would have to be cut. Then the driller and helper would \"fish\" with tools for the old cylinder, screen, wrench, etc., at the bottom, perhaps unsuccessfully. The casing may be \"frozen\" and immovable without breaking, as the drilling rigs and 50 ton jacks are unbelievably powerful. The drillers might work 5 or 6 days at $20 per day and then not accomplish anything.\n\nIn addition, the 900 feet of pipe, placed in 1924, will almost surely soon need replacement because of deterioration by the water. This latter point is of great importance and cannot be over-stressed.\nEstimates of Renovation of Well No.2.\n\nDrilling rig 6 days (at least) @ $20 per day 120.00\nBreaching wall & ceiling pumphouse 8' wide 75.00\nRebuilding pumphouse 75.00\nNew Screen 120.00\n\n390.00\n\nAdd 10% contingencies 39.00\n\nTotal estimated direct cost 429.00\n\nRenewal of 900' pipe in the near future at $1.00 per foot for excavation, back-filling and for the new pipe 900.00\n\nTotal prospective cost 1329.00\n\nEven with this expenditure it might be found that the casing or the whole well itself could not be restored because of the uncertainty of the cause of the trouble. The 900' length of supply pipe is also permanently liable to injury and renewal.\n\n4. Recommended Procedure, a New Well No.3.\n\nThe cost of renovation of Well No.2 was then compared with the cost of a new well, together with necessary housing.\n\nThe most convenient and economical site for a new well was found to be near the present tank basement, as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nThis basement is 28 feet long and 14 feet wide jutting out from the boiler room. A small addition\n5' square was also constructed at one side to provide ingress from the boiler room. The basement is 7 feet deep and is constructed with reinforced concrete walls and an earthen floor.\n\nThe proposal is to construct an additional basement 23' long by 6' wide as a side extension. This extension will be constructed of reinforced concrete as to walls, ceiling and floor. As the small entrance from the boiler room is barely 6' high and 4' square, inside measurement, it is proposed to widen the extension to 6' and place a step at the entrance to the extension. As the water will probably be about 28 to 30 feet below the surface of the ground it will probably be necessary to place the motor in an extra pit 6' x 8' at the west end of the extension. Water should not be pumped more than 15 or 16 feet. Consequently the pit will be about 5 or 6 feet below the boiler room flood.\n\nThe present south wall of the tank basement will require to be extended downwards to the depth of the pit.\n\nAn opening 18\" square, covered, will be left in the roof immediately over the well to facilitate future cleaning.\n\nIn addition it may be found necessary to install a water softener. Space will be available to the east of the pump pit.\n\n5. Subsequent Procedure.\n\nIt was recommended that the construction of a\nnew well be proceeded with immediately. Instructions being received by wire, R.E. Creelman of Saskatoon was engaged to drill the well. He stated that he needed 120 feet of 8\" casing, drive shoe, drive head and screen before beginning work. This material was ordered with the exception of the screen which was delayed until the size of sand grains and depth of water-bearing sand stratum was known.\n\nThe well at present writing (May 17) is down to 96 feet, and sufficient water is obtained at this depth.\n\nIt is always impossible to know the depth to which a well should be drilled.\n\n6. Estimated Cost of New Well.\n\nThe estimated cost was based on a 120 feet well and was as follows:\n\nDrilling an 8\" hole 100 ft. @ $2.50 250.00\nCasing 8\", 120 ft. @ $3.15 per foot 378.00\n1 Drive shoe 35.00\n1 Drive head\n1 Sand Screen. 110.00\n\nCost of basement.\n\nExcavation 50 c.yd. @ 75\u00a2 37.50\nConcrete. Roof 23' x 6' x 4\" - 46 6.ft. 46 \"\nFloor 23' x 6' x 4\" - 46 \"\nNorth wall (pit) 8'x5'x10\" - 34 \"\nSouth wall 23'x7'x10\" - 134 \"\nWest end wall - 12' x 5' x 10\" - 50 13 c.y. @ $9.50 123.50\n(17 barrels of cement)\nReinforced Roof 288 feet.\nWalls 240 \"\nFloor 72\n\n600 ft. 1/2\" round iron\n600' x 0.69 lb. - 408 lbs. @ 5\u00a2 20.40\n\nLumber 300 bd.ft. 1\" boards @ $30 24.00\n280 lin.ft.of 2x4. --\n187 bd.ft.@ $30 5.61\n\n29.61 29.61\n\nExtra labour 27.00\n\n$ 973.51\n\nThe old pumping plant from Well No.2 will be used.\n\nIn the original telegraphed tentative estimate it was not known whether a sand screen would be needed. Consequently it was not included.\n\nNearly all of the pipe fittings are available from the old plant. However 160 feet of rubber covered wire, No.10, and 60 feet of 3/4\" pipe for the electric power wires will also be needed.\n\n7. Labour Requirements.\n\nThe number of men required for this work will be as follows:\n\nOne foreman who is also a concrete man or a carpenter or both. (Father Delmas, Principal, has recommended Joe Perret of Duck Lake as fulfilling all of these conditions. He constructed the tank basement).\n\nThree labourers.\n\nOne Steamfitter.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nThe whole intended design, together with\ndetails, was discussed between the School Engineer and Mr. Fetterly, in order that the work might be proceeded with without the necessary presence of the latter at the school during inception of construction. The school engineer, Mr. Forsythe, is a competent man to oversee the work under Father Delmas and Mr. C.P. Schmidt, the Indian Agent.\n\nThe plan has been prepared but lacks one detail, viz: the depth of water surface below surface of ground. The depth of the pit depends on this distance as no attempt should be made to pump water with a shallow well pump more than 15 or 16 feet.\n\nBefore Mr. Fetterly's departure from the school, on May 12, he requested Father Delmas to send information to the Calgary office on four questions:\n\n1. Depth from ground surface to water surface in the well.\n2. Check depth of drilled hole by means of a coil of stove-pipe wire and send this to Calgary for measurement.\n3. Secure a sample of water after the well has been well bailed for possible chemical analysis as all water in this vicinity is said to be rather hard. A water softener may be needed at a later date to prevent possible damage to plumbing.\n\nA copy of a former analysis of water from Well No.1 is enclosed.\n\n4. Ascertain capacity by causing the driller to bail out\nthe well, i.e. the number of gallons per minute for say, one hour. The Driller stated that he could raise a 10 gallon baler three times per minute.\n\nAnswers to these requests are expected at any time as advice has been received from the driller to the effect that water was struck at 96 feet. Meanwhile, this report has been prepared and sent to you for consideration.\n\nIt is hoped that further construction will not be delayed as a well is said to deteriorate if removal of water from it ceases for a time.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\n\nO.H. Hoover\n\nCALGARY, Alberta, May 17, 1934.\nSir,\n\nRe: Duck Lake School\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 26 re the water supply system at Duck Lake Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith a preliminary report on the condition of the existing wells, the action taken in view of the serious water shortage and the additional construction required to complete the new supply with estimates of cost.\n\nThe report states that one well, some distance from the school, is functioning and provides the only present source of supply. The well on which the school was principally dependent failed and has been definitely abandoned. In place of it a new well has been drilled close to the present school and water obtained at a depth of 98 feet.\n\nThe cost of the new well is estimated at $773, and the extension to the existing basement will cost about $200 more. The well is being drilled by R.E. Creelman under authority of your letter of April 26 and the notation on Mr. Hoover's telegram of May 4.\n\nI shall be glad to have your confirmation of what has already been done and instructions to proceed with the rest of the work, including the names of those who are to be employed. It is important that the work be completed as soon as possible, as it is our experience that a drilled well is subject to serious deterioration if it is allowed to stand unused for any length of time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Delmas is sending you a log of well so I will not enclose one. You will note that I have drilled to the depth of one hundred and eighteen feet, twenty-two feet after striking water at 96 feet. I always go through the water bearing strata and then set the screen in the most suitable place. So I have set the screen at 105 to 112 feet level where the coarse sand and gravel is. I bailed the well at the rate of 5 bailers every two minutes each bailer full holding ten gallons, without lowering static head over five feet. We then put the school pump on and pumped for six hours at 7 gallons per minute without lowering static head.\n\nI would recommend this well for seventy-five gallons per minute without doing well any damage. I also would recommend a deep well turbine pump capacity 75 gallons per minute for this well as this well will give a good fire protection at any time.\n\nI will be pleased to give you any further information that you desire.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) H.E. Creelman.\nDuck Lake, Sask. May 23, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to report very good news about our new well. Mr. Greenman left this morning for Saskatoon, his work being done. Here are some details which could interest you. From the surface of the ground to the level of water 29 ft. Depth of drilling is 115 as shown on the logging of the well. A sample of water was sent to you yesterday.\n\nBailing out well it was found out that it gives about 25 gal. per minute. Mr. Greenman claims that the well is good for 75 gal per minute.\n\nNow regarding the underground passage to the well, 6 ft. wide and 7 ft. high are necessary. Around the well we require 6 ft. x 8 ft. = 15 ft. deep. A strong ladder to reach the bottom could be convenient enough for its purpose.\n\nI understood that Mr. Greenman is going to offer you some proposition about that work, of digging and putting some concrete work; I would like to see him having the job. He has a very large family and there is not much work for him during these bad times. He is a good worker and we are used to him now.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Ad) H. Delmas.\n\nPrincipal\nRe Duck Lake Indian School\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 23rd instant regarding the water supply at the above-mentioned school, I am now able to send two Blue Prints of the proposed improved system prepared by P.A. Nutterly of this staff.\n\nFather Delmas has reported that the distance from ground surface to water surface is 29 feet. The bottom of the pump pit will therefore need to be about 15 feet below the surface to allow for a suction of 14 feet. It has been so designed.\n\nAccording to the letters of Father Delmas and Mr. Greelman, two copies of which are enclosed, a plentiful supply of water has been obtained. Mr. Greelman recommends a deep well turbine pump. Mr. Nutterly and I consider that the old shallow well pump should be sufficient. At any rate it should be tried before considering a new deep well pump. We have no doubt of its efficiency.\n\nYou will also note that Father Delmas states that Mr. Greelman is ready to present a proposition for finishing the work. Mr. Greelman has not as yet done so.\n\nA sample of the water has been received and will be preserved for possible chemical analysis.\n\nAccounts have been received from Father Delmas and Mr. Greelman which will be sent to you tomorrow after they have been reviewed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nRe: Duck Lake School.\n\nWith reference to my letter of May 23 regarding the new water supply system at Duck Lake Indian residential school, I enclose herewith copy of a letter from Mr. Hoover dated May 25 with the enclosures mentioned therein.\n\nThe blue print enclosed is the plan referred to at the foot of page 5 of the report which accompanied my letter of May 23.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.T.

Account of Rev. Father Delmas, Principal.\n\nThis consists of express charges on one length of 8\" casing delayed because it was cut into shorter lengths, $2.25; freight charges on the main shipment of 5 lengths of 8\" casing, drive shoe and drive head, $26.40; and Express charges on screen $0.95; a total of $39.60. Prepayment of these express and freight charges were obligatory before removal from C.N.R. Station at Duck Lake, and were advanced by the Principal.\n\nIn addition to these charges, Father Delmas found it necessary to advance $100.00 to Mr. Creelman, as indicated, in order that the work might be begun.\n\nThe receipt, in triplicate, from Mr. Creelman is attached. The total due Father Delmas is, therefore, $129.60. Triplicate copies of the account are enclosed.\n\n2. R.E. Creelman's Account.\n\nThe depth of the well, as certified by Father Delmas in a letter dated May 23, a copy of which was sent to you on May 25, is 118 feet. The agreed price was $2.50 per foot. The drilling thus cost $295.00. From this is to be deducted the advance of $100 made by Father Delmas, leaving a balance due Mr. Creelman of $195.00. Three copies of the notes are enclosed, as are also triplicate copies of the account.\n\n3. A. Mainville's Account.\n\nThis was the last emergency purchase, the other...\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nbeing the casing, drive shoe and drive head.\n\nScreens, being comparatively expensive, are not usually carried in stock outside of Winnipeg and not then in various sizes at that point. Often the order has to be sent direct to Minneapolis. Consequently no time could be lost in insertion of the screen. It was determined to purchase this 7' screen which was suitable in all points, as certified by Mr. Groelman, who is a reputable driller. These screens usually cost about $20.00 per foot. The account is for $110.00. Triplicate copies of the account are enclosed.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that payment be made as follows:\n\nRev. Father H. Delmas, Duck Lake, Sask. $129.60\nR.E.

This was for proper placing of the pipe at the bottom and top. The price of sawing is indicated in the increased price, viz: $73.96 instead of $67.41 for a 20' length. The well being 118 feet deep, all of the casing was used.\n\nNos. 3 and 4, drive shoe, and drive head, are self-explanatory, the price being reasonable.\n\nIt will be noted that 2% discount is allowed for payment before June 20th. The invoice therefore should read $453.74 less $9.07, or $444.67, as indicated in pencil.\n\nIt will also be noted that Government tax is not included as Crane Limited were informed by Mr. Fetterly that this material was to be used on Dominion Government work.\n\nI would recommend that this account be paid before June 20th, to have the discount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Day of Duck Lake may be employed for this work and that he will arrange, on instructions from your engineers, for whatever additional help he requires.\n\nA copy of this letter has been sent to Mr. Hoover so that he may arrange to have the work carried out.

McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nGeneral Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe writer of this letter was in conversation with Rev. Father Delmas of the Indian School at Duck Lake, a few days ago. During our conversation we discussed refrigeration requirements of the Indian School at Duck Lake.\n\nIn company with Rev. Father Delmas we inspected a refrigerator that is in use in the Indian School at Duck Lake.\n\nAfter making a careful investigation of the requirements at this institution, where approximately 500 meals every day are provided, we estimated the cost of supplying this institution with proper Genuine Frigidaire equipment.\n\nThe present method for use, as no doubt you are well aware, is a walk-in refrigerator. It would be our suggestion that this refrigerator be re-insulated with 2\" of corkboard. The door in the present ice bunker would be closed, and the ice bunkers in the present box would all be removed before the insulation was added. The present walk-in door would be re-built and equipped with special refrigerator door hardware with the proper offset equipped with the necessary wire gaskets.\n\nWe would install one only WX1478 Cooling Coil controlled by one only TS Expansion Valve. This would be operated by one only 3D Genuine Frigidaire Air-Flow Com-\n\nEXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS OF REACH, WRIGHT AND DITSON ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT\nAll of the above equipment would be supplied and installed complete for the sum of $682.00. This price includes the necessary electrical work to install this equipment and represents a complete job in every respect.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to repeat the conversation the writer had with you when you were in Onion Lake a few weeks ago, and this equipment in an institution such as the Indian School at Duck Lake, would effect many many savings, and we feel sure that it would be a very wise investment on your part.\n\nIf there is further information we can give you relative to this particular installation, do not hesitate to get in touch with us.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE J. H. ASHDOWN HDWE. CO. Limited,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 4)\nOttawa, September 11, 1934.\n\nAttention - Frigidaire & Electric Dept.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, quoting a price for supplying and installing a refrigerator in the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to supply refrigeration equipment at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nThe J. H. Ashdown Hwse. Co., Ltd.,\nSaskatoon,\nSask.\nFINAL REPORT\n\non\n\nImproved Water Supply\n\nat\n\nDuck Lake Indian School\n\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nby P.A. Fetterly, B.Sc., R.P.E., Assistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\n1. Purpose of Report.\n\nA Preliminary Report on the above named subject was prepared and dated May 17, 1934. The work is now completed and this constitutes the final report pursuant to an inspection made on August 30, 1934, by the writer.\n\n2. Materials.\n\nThe materials were of excellent character. They were supplied promptly when needed.\n\n3. Workmanship.\n\nThe workmanship is of excellent character. The heavy pressure tanks in the adjacent basement were not disturbed to any extent whatever although the pump pit is 8 feet lower than the floor of the latter. The footing is very solid, being on a hard sand; the extra wall under the original tank basement wall is solid. The concrete appears solid, there being no cracks. The connection with the old tank roof is well made, the new reinforcing steel being hooked on the old steel which was uncovered. A slight discoloration a few inches square appeared in the\nwest wall at the junction but this can be eliminated by banking this portion.\n\nThe cutting of the opening from the small entry into the new basement occupied the labour of the four men for six days and cost $48.00. The electrical fixtures were installed by the school engineer at no cost to the Government except for some of the material.\n\nThe pump and motor from the old well was installed in the new one and works efficiently.\n\n4. Water Supply\n\nThe water in the casing stands at 14 feet below the floor of the pit. When pumping is begun the water lowers about a foot in the casing, probably the \"draw-down\" only. Pumping can then be continued for a day or more and the water stops at this level.\n\nThe water is of even better quality than that produced by the old well.\n\nThe windmill over Well No.1 will still be used on windy days.\n\n5. Credentials.\n\nMr. Schmidt, Indian Agent; Father Delmas, the Principal; and the writer, were very pleased with the completed work. Mr. Murison, Inspector of Agencies, together with the Superintendent-General, visited the school immediately after completion and, after examining the installation, expressed themselves favourable after an inspection.\n\n6. Cost.\n\nThe cost of the completed work is as follows:\n| Firm                        | Location       | Goods                          | Amount |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|--------|\n| Monarch Lumber Co.          | Duck Lake, Sask.| Lumber & Cement                | 169.00 |\n| Marshall-Wells Co.          | Saskatoon, \"    | Rein.Iron & Cement             | 31.76  |\n| Crane Ltd.                  | Winnipeg, Man.  | Els Valves, etc.               | 28.16  |\n| Lemery Dennison Electric Co.| Saskatoon, Sask.| Electrical Supplies            | 13.41  |\n| A.C.Day                     | Duck Lake, \"    | Labour(4 men) gravel,nails,    | 245.05 |\n|                             |                 | hinges & hasps.                |        |\n| Crane Limited               | Saskatoon, \"    | Casing                         | 410.74 |\n|                             |                 | (Drive shoe & head             | 43.00  |\n| A.Mainville                 | Saskatoon, \"    | Screen                         | 110.00 |\n| G.Mat.R'lys.                |                 | Freight & Express              | 29.60  |\n|                             |                 | Total                          | 1080.72|\n\nCalgary, Alta.

When the school was built, ten years ago, the Department was not supplying any school with a Genuine Frigidaire. Although the schools built since then have been supplied with such.\n\nI realize that ten years ago it would not have been wise to have one, when our electric power was so limited. Instead of this, a small brick building was put up by the Department in 1926, on the North side of our pantry.\n\nTwice a week, we have to put some ice in it and even with the best care, we lose some meat every season. Moreover, during the hottest days the meat stinks. The melting ice also leaks on the meat, and the concrete floor gets covered with that filthy water.\n\nNow that we have the electric power from Saskatoon, and that the prices of Genuine Frigidaires are cut down, I would like to have that question, brought up to the Department, making them understand the necessity of having a real true refrigerator.\n\nIt is a question of hygiene, cleanliness and economy, first of all. Then regarding the financial question, a Genuine Frigidaire would save lots of good food, the cost of 40 tons of ice, saw dust, packing and hauling ice twice a week, about $225.00 a year. It would be a wise investment.\n\nYou may present to the Department, the suggestions which were offered to me last fall by the J. H. Ashdown Edwe. Co. Limited of Saskatoon.\n\n\"After making a careful investigation of the requirements at this institution, where approximately 500 meals every day are provided, we estimated the cost of supplying this institution with proper Genuine Frigidaire equipment.\n\n........2\nNov. 25th, 1934.\n\nThe present method for use, as no doubt you are well aware, is a walk-in refrigerator. It would be our suggestion that this refrigerator be re-insulated with 2\" of cork-board. The door in the present ice bunker would be closed, and the ice bunkers in the present box would all be removed before the insulation was added. The present walk-in door would be re-built and equipped with special refrigerator door hardware with the proper offset equipped with the necessary wire gaskets.\n\nWe would install one only WXL478 Cooling Coil controlled by one only TS Expansion Valve. This would be operated by one only 3D Genuine Frigidaire Air-Flow Compressor.\n\nAll the above equipment would be supplied and installed complete for the sum of $682.00. This price includes the necessary electrical work to install this equipment and represents a complete job in every respect.\"\n\nI am asking you, Dear Sir, to do your best in recommending to the Department that a Genuine Frigidaire be granted this spring to our school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nC. P. Schmidt Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a communication received from Rev. H. Delmas, Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School which is self explanatory.\n\nI strongly recommend that the request be granted as the small brick building now in use is not a success. One of the reasons I have found, which the Principal does not mention, is that the ice used which is taken from alkaline bottom lakes, smells when melting; the water from this ice is not fit for drinking.\n\nI note the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., a representative has recommended insulating with 2 inch cork board. In my opinion this is not thick enough.\n\nI would ask that the request be given early attention and if granted that the work be done early in the season before the month of May, which some years is a very hot month.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\ns/c\n\nC.P.

In this connection it is noted that the Principal obtained a quotation for the equipment he requires.\n\nThe Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year to cover the cost of supplying a frigidaire. Our Estimates for the next fiscal year are now in course of preparation, and consideration will be given to including an amount for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Inside this fish box, we will install 3/8\" coil on three walls, controlled by expansion valve. This Fish Box installed complete will cost $55.00.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nIn our former quotation we quoted you on equipment and renovation of your present refrigerator. However, after further careful investigation we believe you would be well advised to increase the size of your present refrigerator, and with this additional space you will be able to segregate your milk, butter, etc., from your meats, etc., Milk, when stored in open containers, is very susceptible to other odors or flavors. Further, investigations by our research department have proven that better refrigeration is obtained when two or more separate compartments are used. Particularly does this apply to institutional refrigeration.\n\nIn submitting the above quotation we have included a high grade job in every way. For instance, each coil is equipped with shut off valves. This permits the isolating of any coil or more than one.\n\nThe compressor we have included will have a margin of safety of 40% and will perform the job with a running time of\nless than 8 hours per day in hottest weather and from three to four in ordinary weather, thereby assuring you of economical operation at all times.\n\nOur quotation includes GENUINE FRIGIDAIRE EQUIPMENT.\nKELVINATOR OF CANADA LIMITED\nLONDON, ONTARIO\n\nELECTRIC REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT FOR HOMES,\nSTORES, FACTORIES, OFFICES,\nINSTITUTIONS, CLUBS, HOTELS\nHOSPITALS, CAFES, ETC., ETC.\nMARSHALL-WELLS COMPANY LIMITED\nIMPORTERS\nWHOLESALE HARDWARE\nSASKATOON, SASK.\n\nMarch 14th, 1935.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nAttention - Mr. Schmidt,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to enclose tender for Refrigerator Equipment for\nthe Indian School at Duck Lake. In doing so we are tak-\ning the liberty of making a few suggestions with the\nobject of obtaining the maximum amount of refrigerator\nspace from the building at present used as a refrigera-\ntor, also with as much convenience as possible for the\nkitchen staff.\n\nOn the day the writer examined the present refrigerator,\nwater was standing on the floor of the refrigerator and\nthe kitchen superintendent advised me that this occurred\neach spring. Suggestions are embodied in contract to\ntake care of this.\n\nFurther, the superintendent complained that when the\nbuilding was erected tar paper was used in the construc-\ntion and the smell of this tar paper got into all\nfoods stored in the refrigerator during the summer, when\nthe weather was hot. We suggest that this matter will\nhave to be taken care of when re-building the refrigera-\ntor and we have accordingly included this in our estima-\nte and the contract.\n\nOn examining the building in which the present refrig-\nerator is housed we find that the roof of the building\nwas connected with the main building. The building\nhousing the refrigerator did not connect with the main\nbuilding except at the door of the meat cutting room.\nWe have enclosed a plan of the building as it is at the\npresent time and as we would suggest that it be made, to\nobtain the maximum storage space which is badly needed\nby the school. The proposed change would not involve\nany structural difficulties nor any material cost, as the\nbrick taken from the wall removed could be used again on\nthe new wall and for bricking up the old ice entrance on\nthe outside of the building.\nWe are making one other suggestion and that is, that when the concrete floor of the new refrigerator is put in that a new floor on the same level be installed in the meat cutting room adjoining refrigerator as this floor is in bad condition, and the elimination of the step up to the refrigerator would be of great convenience.\n\nOwing to the fact that our recommendations take on a different form to your letter calling for tenders, we are submitting two tenders marked Plan 1 and Plan 2 and have given full details in each case with the tender.\n\nWe regret that this letter is so lengthy but we believe you will excuse it under the circumstances. We would also like, at this time, to take the opportunity to thank the staff of the school and yourself for the courtesy shown to us during our visits to the school, in connection with this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMARSHALL WELLS COMPANY LIMITED,\n\nRefrigeration Department.\n\nJPC/FLL.\nPLAN #1\n\nGENERAL PLAN\n\nTo extend present refrigerator to main building.

Northern Hardware, Prince Albert, I called on the manager, on May 9th and asked him if he had received my letter of April 24th, asking for a quotation, he said he had and was referring the matter to someone else (Marshall Wells I believe). Grosser & Glass Ltd., Prince Albert, have written me saying they have no facilities at the present time for doing this work.\n\nAfter receiving the Departmental letter mentioned above I visited the school and took the matter up with the Principal who told me that last autumn when he asked the J.N. Ashdown Co. to give him a price all he had in mind was renovating the meat cooling room, which is not satisfactory (see paragraph three and five of his letter of November 20th, 1934) No provision was made for the refrigeration of milk, cream, butter, etc., which are now being kept in a pantry across the corridor from the kitchen. The pantry not being sufficiently cool in summer milk sours in less than 24 hours and there is waste in these kinds of food as well as in the meats. (NOTE:- See Manville Hardware Co., SUMMARY page #7) I therefore worked on a new plan to provide separate compartments for dairy foods and trays for making ice cubes which are indispensable in an institution like ours, more so in case of sickness, also, a fish box, as there are times in summer when fresh fish is procured from the Saskatchewan rivers or from lakes in the district.\n\nUnder the new plan which I will refer to as General Plan, one wall, brick veneer of the present refrigerator building will have to be taken down and this building extended to the main (School) building.\n\nSee Manville Co specifications, Page #1, Changes to be made See Marshall Wells, Ltd., Plan #1 (General Plan) last line, also 2nd sheet of sketch lower part in black ink and paragraph four of letter dated May 14th, 1935.\n\nI note Manville Hardware Co.'s specifications call for 2 inch cork board insulation, while Marshall Wells Co specify 3 inches viz; one 2 inch ply and another 1 inch over same breaking joints. I did not discuss this with the representatives who came to look over the layout as I considered they knew what is required, however when the outside walls of the building are taken into consideration, i.e.; brick veneer, one row only, not a solid brick wall, I am doubtful whether 2 inches of cork board is sufficient.\nIt is obvious that the extra inch of cork board specified by the Marshall Wells Co is a big factor in their quotation being higher than the other.\n\nI strongly recommend that the \"General Plan\" I suggested be accepted and installed for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The meat cooling room is too small to accommodate all foods requiring refrigeration.\n\n(b) It is not practicable to keep in covered containers the large amounts of dairy produce and other perishable foods required for this institution some of which would have to be placed on the floor under the meat racks.\n\n(c) It is absolutely necessary that ice be available in case of emergencies.\n\n(d) The extra cost of installing a complete refrigerator now, would be less than the cost of an addition which I am certain will be demanded in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nC.F. Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\nMay 30, 1955.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 23rd with further reference to the installation of cold storage equipment at the Duck Lake School, as previously advised funds available for this installation are $700.00, and as the prices submitted in your letter of the above mentioned date exceed this amount I would ask you to advise if it would be possible for the school to provide the labour in the construction of the cold storage room, in order to keep the cost to the former estimate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir:\n\nReference your letter of the 14th ultimo re Tender covering the suggested Electric Refrigerator at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, would you kindly revise your quotation making the following changes, namely:\n\nAll brickwork, concrete floors, removal of ice bunkers, removal of board lining in meat room to be done by ourselves, we to supply material.\n\nWe to supply material and labour to put in meat racks and shelves in cooling room.\n\nWe to supply material and labour for Electrical wiring.\n\nWe to supply labourers (local mechanics) to assist your mechanic in charge to put on cork board, interior lining, hanging of refrigerator doors, etc.\n\nWe to supply board and lodging for your mechanic in charge of the work.\n\nInsulation to be 3 inches of cork board, two (2) ply to be used. One ply two inches thick the other one inch thick, all joints to be broken and every sheet submerged in hot hydrolene before placing on walls, after cork board is placed on the walls a liberal coat of hydrolene is to be brushed over the entire surface and finish with wax paper.\n\nState whether the interior lining will be concrete or lumber.\n\nPlease note that a walk-in door 24\" wide is required to enter the milk, butter, etc., cooling room thereby making two walk-in doors, i.e.; one for each room. The window in the present pantry is to be closed.\n\nSigned. C.F. Schmidt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nManville Hardware, Co., Ltd., Prince Albert\nMarshall-Wells, Co.

If this is not granted I will ask the Principal to pay this difference, in addition to supplying part of the material and the labour as specified in my letter mentioned above.\n\nI beg to ask for an early reply also that the specifications, sent in with my previous letter and those enclosed herewith be returned me to be used when the work is being done.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nS/C\n\nC.F.

The Department will provide an additional amount of $280.00 towards payment of the cost of supplying and installing the equipment. The Department will leave the matter in the hands of the Principal and yourself, to decide as to the type of equipment and the firm to install same. It should be distinctly understood that the sum of $980.00 is the full amount this Department can provide and that any costs over and above this amount will have to be paid by the school authorities, from their per capita allowances or other receipts. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed and that a proper guarantee is given by the firm who install the equipment.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should obtain an account, in triplicate, giving full details. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You have received an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure of $700. The balance will be raised by encumbrance here, after the account is received. For your guidance, I am returning the quotations you received.

Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our conversation of yesterday re painting to be done in our school, I beg to say that, as you noticed, we need some painting on metallic ceiling and on stairs as follows:\n\n**Metallic Ceiling**\nPharmacy--250 sq.ft.--some rotten sheets may need to be replaced.\nCorridor (main floor)--860 sq.ft.\nParlor--224 sq.ft.\nKitchen and Scullery--648 sq.ft.\nSky Window--180 sq.ft.\n\nTotal 2282 sq.ft.\n\n**Stairs**\nConcrete has been replaced on steel steps. These were built during the winter months of 1925 and some parts of the concrete work was frozen on both sides (boys' and girls'). Since then, these steps have become worn out and are dangerous. I have made many inquiries how to repair them and it is only lately that I have been assured of entire success by using a kind of putty manufactured by the Tremco Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Canada. As I want this work very well done I will have my mechanic do it. I wish the Department to pay for the material required which has already been ordered and which amounts to about $95.25.\n\nAlso, as both, Indians and children, use these stairs the walls are very dirty and need painting. We have tried water paint without any success. The walls might need scrubbing before oil paint can be applied. The dimensions of these walls including both sides, total 4400 sq.ft., which includes the wall on the south side which goes to the infirmaries. The last mentioned wall has been very dirty since 1925 having been stained before it was dry by smoke escaping from the boilers.\nBesides these, I might state that the floor, walls, and ceiling of the dining room are also in great need of repairs and repainting.\n\nHoping these explanations prove satisfactory, I remain, Dear Sir,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nH. Delmas\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 109-1-5 dated the 7th instant, regarding the expenditure of $400.00 for repairs at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI visited the School yesterday and inspected the interior of the building with the Rev. Father Delmas, the Principal of the School, whom I requested to submit a report on the work he considered necessary.\n\nThe work mentioned in his report is, in my opinion, necessary, and I recommend as follows:\n\nThat an expenditure of approximately $100 be made first for material to repair the steel steps on the stairways. According to the Principal's report enclosed herein it will not be necessary to pay for the labor in this connection. In places the cement filling in the steps is so badly worn that the outside steel flange of the step is now above the cement and accidents are liable to occur to those descending the stairway by getting the toe of their shoe caught in the steel flange and falling down the stairway.\n\nIn regard to the placing of metallic sheets on the ceiling of the Pharmacy room, painting the walls and ceilings where required I would recommend that a competent workman be asked to submit an estimate as to the cost of the material and labor required to do this work. In so doing it is possible that it will be found unnecessary to expend the amount provided.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nSHS/GWN.\nOttawa, August 18, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, your letter of the 13th instant, in which you refer to the amount of $400.00 included in this year's Estimates for repairs at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to proceed with the repairs as outlined in your communication. Please obtain an estimate from a competent workman with respect to the placing of metallic sheets on the ceiling of the Pharmacy Room and the painting of the walls and ceiling of that building. These repairs must be undertaken on the understanding that the total cost will not exceed the above mentioned amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 4)\nDuck Lake, Sask., October 21st, 1938\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI beg to advise that the following repairs are badly needed at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School:\n\nFour classrooms and the Sewing Room in the School require to have the ceilings and walls painted, and the floors varnished.\n\nThe steps leading to the front entrance of the School require replacing as the boards therein are badly worn and rotted.\n\nThe roof of the Community Hall at this School requires re-shingling. As this building is placed between two chimneys sparks often fall on the roof. It therefore should be shingled with a fireproof material.\n\nThe School also requires a shoe sewing machine for repairing the pupils' shoes, as the old machine is now worn out.\n\nI beg to advise that owing to the crop failures during the past four years this School has had very little revenue from their grain crops. They also have had to reduce their herd of cattle. This has resulted in their not producing sufficient funds to keep their buildings in repair.\n\nThe Principal has requested that the foregoing projects receive the consideration of the Department.\n\nI recommend that his request be favorably considered.\n\nForm No. 37, listing the materials required is attached hereto in duplicate.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nS.H.

In this regard I would point out that 2 of these machines have already been supplied to this school (reference your voucher No. 344 dated August 26, 1936).\n\nYou may purchase the following articles locally:\n\n- 3 Pieces 2 x 4 x 14'\n- 56 \" 2 x 4 x 10'\n- 15 \" 1 x 6 x 10'\n- 3 \" 2 x 12 x 14'\n\n12 Lbs. wire nails\n(2 Lbs. 2\u00bd\", 4 lbs. 3\", 6 lbs. 4\")\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the lumber will be $15.35 and the cost of the nails will be 96\u00a2.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure the paint and the material required to repair the roof.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.

They are as follows:\n\nW. P. Bayne E. S. Sanders\nH. E. Ford G. Sims\nW. A. Hamilton A. Taillon\nT. H. Hull R. Thompson\nW. H. Lawson T.S. Wilson\nJ. S. Manson W. F. Wilson\nG. F. Neale W. G. Wright\nR. Paterson John D. Ruttan\n\nOf these I beg to recommend the appointment of Mr. J. D. Ruttan as Travelling Inspector and of Mr. W. G. Wright as Inspector of Construction at the Duck Lake Agency.\n\nI have reviewed the applications very carefully and have arrived at my decision by a process of elimination. The names of W. A. Hamilton, T. H. Hull, J. S. Manson, R. Paterson, E. S. Sanders and A. Taillon were struck off as none of them had been overseas.\n\nMr. H. E. Ford is too young to have gained much experience in building construction, and Mr. W. H. Lawson appears to be rather a cabinet maker than experienced in building.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMessrs. G. F. Neale and G. Sime do not appear to have had any experience in a supervisory capacity.\n\nMr. R. Thompson has occupied the position of Foreman Carpenter, but other than that does not appear to have had any supervisory duties in connection with general building programme. Moreover, although he served in Canada he was not overseas.\n\nOf the remainder who were all overseas, Mr. W. P. Bayne worked for the Alberta Government and is well recommended, but is a resident of Medicine Hat Alberta, and his qualifications are not equal to those of Mr. Ruttan. His residence in Medicine Hat would therefore disqualify him for the position of Inspector in Duck Lake.\n\nNeither Mr. T. S. Wilson nor Mr. W. F. Wilson have the experience or apparent qualifications held by Mr. W. G. Wright and Mr. J. D. Ruttan.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\n\nW. M.

Bayne of 845 - 3rd St., Medicine Hat, Alta., as Inspector of Construction with headquarters at Regina, Sask.\n\nMr. Taillon, who resides within fifteen miles of Duck Lake, is entitled to the preference given under residential requirements.\n\nIt is noted that Commissioner Graham had recommended the appointment of Mr. J. D. Ruttan as Travelling Inspector with headquarters at Regina. It appears from Mr. Ruttan's application that he had already been taken on for work. The advisory Board, on whose recommendation the Commission acted, considered that while Mr. Bayne was not professionally as well qualified as Mr. Ruttan yet his past experience in practical building was probably greater. The Board decided that Mr. Bayne was well qualified to fill the position. Furthermore, under the provisions of the Civil Service Act, Mr. Bayne, who is a pensioner, is entitled to disability preference and thus to appointment before Mr. Ruttan although the latter is a Returned Soldier also.\n\nDuncan C.

(RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-5, part 6)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Form No. 37 requisition for materials to re-roof the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThis building was constructed in 1925 and I understand that the present roof was guaranteed for 10 years. The Principal informs me that a large sum of money has been spent during the past six years in repairing the roof without any permanent success.\n\nOn one of my recent visits to the school the Principal drew my attention to this matter. I found that the roof was leaking badly in the sleeping quarters of the boys and girls. Utenails were spread over the floors to catch the snow water coming through the roof. The walls of the building and some of the main beams encased in metal ceiling roofing are being damaged by the water seeping into them.\n\nThe roof has been examined by an expert from the Tremco Manufacturing Co., who advises that a satisfactory repair job cannot be done as the roof is weathered to the extent that continuous trouble will be experienced from other parts of the roof becoming no longer waterproof.\n\nThe Principal of the school has advised that the school has not sufficient funds to do this work. He requests that the Department assist by supplying the material and the school will provide the labour.\n\nI recommend that his request be granted and if possible the work done before the spring rains.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. H. Simpson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSHS/H.\nENG.\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant regarding the roof of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department was surprised to receive your report regarding the condition of this roof as we do not appear to have any previous communication regarding the matter. No mention was made of repairs to this roof in your estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41. At that time you requested $800.00 for construction of an addition to provide outside wash rooms and toilets. Due to present conditions it is impossible to consider expenditures for which provision has not been made.\n\nWe are hopeful that the $800.00 will be provided in our appropriation for the year 1940-41 but owing to the dissolution of Parliament I am not in a position to state definitely if this amount will be available. However, it should be distinctly understood by the Principal that the Department cannot consider the repairs to the roof and also the erection of the new outside wash rooms and toilets. Which of these do you consider the most important?\n\nIn replying to this letter you should also state if consideration has been given to the use of shingles in replacing the present roof.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. S. H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nMarch 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 109-1-5 dated the 11th instant pertaining to the roof of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School,\n\nThe repairing of the roof is of more importance than the erection of outside wash rooms and toilets. This matter has been discussed with the Principal of the School. He is of the same opinion and understands that if the roof is repaired there will be no funds available in 1940-41 appropriation for the other work mentioned.\n\nShingles cannot be used to replace the present roofing as it is a flat roof.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS. H. Simpson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSUB/H.\nOttawa,\nMarch 27, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant the Purchasing Agent is being requested to order the roofing paper, roof preservative and roof cement required for the repair of the roof at the Duck Lake Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Latour, Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, has requested me to ascertain whether or not any funds have been provided from appropriation in the 1942-1943 estimates on behalf of this school for the purpose of repairs to the interior of the school building.\n\nThe roof of the part of the school building used as the chapel has only one ply of lumber, building paper and shingles and is not closed within. Consequently it is very cold during the winter months and cannot be sufficiently heated. The cost of materials to insulate the roof of the building would be approximately $150.00. If Departmental funds are available to purchase the materials required the school has offered to take care of the cost of labour required to complete this work.\n\nDepartmental advice in this matter would be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

Christianson, Esq., General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nOn September 3rd Mr. Hayes, Provincial Inspector of Steam Boilers made his annual inspection of the two steam boilers at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. He has reported that the tubes in both boilers are badly pitted and that it was absolutely necessary to have them replaced.\n\nOn contacting him by telephone on the night of the 7th he further stated that it would not be safe to use the boilers as the tubes were liable to go at any time and he doubted that they would stand one week's use.\n\nWhile in Prince Albert yesterday I interviewed Mr. J.C. McDonald, Manager of the Prince Albert Foundry Company regarding the cost of new tubes, and installing thereof, also as to whether or not he had sufficient on hand to meet our requirements. He advised that he did not and stated that he would be able to procure them from Winnipeg but that there might be a slight delay due to the present control over materials of this kind.\n\nSkilled labour will be required to remove the old tubes from the boilers and install the new ones. Such labour is not available in Duck Lake. Mr. Hayes, Boiler Inspector, recommended Mr. G. Pritz of Rosthern as being well experienced and capable in this work. I contacted Mr. Pritz by telephone today in order to get an estimate as to the cost of the labour. At present he is overcrowded with work and is unable to examine the work to be done at the school. His charges are one dollar per hour plus the services of a helper and he estimates that the cost of his services alone will be $300.00 which is $100.00 less than the rough estimate given to me by Mr. McDonald of the Prince Albert Foundry. The helper in this work will be provided by the school at no extra cost.\n\nAs the school building cannot be properly heated even in mild weather it would be appreciated if immediate authority could be granted to have the necessary repairs made to the boilers.\n\nForm 37a listing the materials required and the cost of labour is attached hereto.\n\n(Sgd.) S.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am herewith forwarding copy of a letter I received from Mr. Simpson, Indian Agent, Duck Lake Agency, in connection with the flues in the boiler at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is no need for me to go into this matter further as Mr. Simpson has given all of the information, prices, etc. and you will note that this work is going to cost around $1000.00.\n\nI trust the matter will receive your early attention.\n\nRequisition is also herewith attached.\n\nM.

Father G.M. Latour, Principal, Duck Lake Indian Residential School, covering materials required for an extension to main building to provide sanitary wash rooms and toilets for female pupils amounting to the sum of $862.71.\n\nDepartment letter No. 109-1-5, dated August 8, 1944, authorized expenditure of $800.00 only for this purpose. I am submitting the enclosed requisition as received at this office from the Principal which you will note exceeds the authorized expenditure.\n\nI might add that this office has on several occasions during the fall and winter months requested Father Latour to submit a list of materials required; however, due to rush of seasonal school activities and shortage of labour this project has been delayed.\n\nI would recommend that the materials be purchased from 1944-45 estimates and the erection of the addition will be undertaken in the early spring months of this year.\n\nThe prices quoted on the enclosed requisition were obtained from the Reliance Lumber Company in Northern, Sask.\n\nN.J. McLeod,\nAct. Indian Agent.\nOttawa, February 12, 1945.\n\nMr. N. J. McLeod, Indian Agent, Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing requisition for materials required for repairs to the main building of the Duck Lake Residential School, in order to provide sanitary wash-rooms and toilets for female pupils.\n\nYou stated the prices at which the materials could be secured from the Reliance Lumber Company, Roistern, Sask. Please let me know if the total price included sales tax and whether at the price quoted the goods would be delivered, or would we be obliged to pay for their transportation from Roistern to the school?\n\nThe first item on the requisition appears to be incorrect. The unit price is stated to be $1.00 and 1800 of the interlocking tile are requested. It would look from the extension that the price of these is 10\u00a2 each instead of $1.00 each. Please let me know definitely regarding this.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference your letter No. 109-1-5, regarding requisition forwarded by this office for materials required for repairs to the main building of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI have today finally succeeded in securing definite quotations from the Reliance Lumber Co., Rosthern, Sask. and beg to advise as follows:\n\nItem 1. Unit price shown on our requisition for 1200 interlocking tile at $1.00. This should read 1200 interlocking tile at .10\u00a2 each, a total of $120.00.\n\nQuotations include sales tax and are not subject to 10 per cent discount. Quotations are F.O.B. Reliance Lumber Company Warehouse at Rosthern, Sask.\n\nIt is estimated that the amount of $30.00 will be required to cover costs of freighting the materials from Rosthern, Sask. to Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret this error and the inconvenience it has caused your office.\n\nN.J.

In his letter, the Principal admits buying these without any authority but says that he was obliged to act promptly and had no time to consult either the Agent or the Department.\n\nWhilst we all admit that school Principals cannot be left at liberty to buy equipment for their school, even when there are funds standing to their credit in Ottawa, the temptation to do so is very great because in this manner, they receive the articles bought very quickly. The old purchasing system which was in honour in the Department for so many years and which permitted the Educational Branch Officials to purchase up to $500.00, gave greater satisfaction to all concerned and it is to be hoped that it will be reinstated.\n\nIn any case, I am confident that you will be good enough to pay for these two pieces of machinery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nReference is made to your letter dated June 1st, your file No. 910-305-11 A.R.C., addressed to Rev. Father G.M. Latour (copy forwarded to this office) regarding storage water tanks required at St. Michaels Indian Residential School, Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nI regret the delay in this matter, however we have finally secured a definite estimate from M. & K. Plumbing and Heating Company, Prince Albert, Sask., and enclose herewith a copy of their letter dated July 26th, also Form No. 37 outlining the amount required to purchase new tanks and labour in connection with installation.\n\nI recommend that the new tanks be purchased immediately as the old tanks are no longer safe for use under pressure required.\n\nI have carefully checked over the installation of the new tanks with Mr. Masche of M. & K. Plumbing and Heating Co., who accompanied me to St. Michaels Indian Residential School and the following is the proposed method which is submitted for Departmental approval.\n\n1. Leave old tanks in present position, to be used for storage purposes only. In the event of a serious fire outbreak, the additional storage capacity of tanks now in use would be of considerable value.\n\n2. Install new tanks immediately above and (at ground level) over old tank housings.\n\n3. Erect a new additional structure over new tanks. Building to be of brick and tile with tarred roof, 2 walls only required 28' x 11' high and 23' x 11' high.\n\n4. Heating arrangements for preventing freezing in cold weather is available at no extra cost by removing windows between new addition and main boiler room. Estimate of costs of material and labour for addition to house new pressure water tanks will be forwarded immediately available.\n\nMy reasons for recommending the addition to house the new tanks is as follows:\n\nWhen the present water pressure tanks were installed, I find that liberal quantities of cement was used and the tanks installed with very little thought as to replacement in future years. The walls and ceiling are constructed of solid concrete and to now remove the ceiling, replace the present tanks and erect a structure over again will cost considerable, also while the installation is under way, the water supply at the school will be cut off for approximately two to three weeks. This to my mind will cause a serious fire hazard and also inconvenience to the school personnel who are now employed in and around the school premises.\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nJuly 29, 1946.\n\nKindly consider this matter as urgent and I would point out that the new tanks must be installed and ready for use on or before the opening of the fall academic term in September 1946. The addition to house the new tanks must also be constructed previous to October 1st, 1946.\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.J.

I am also attaching a copy of the quotation received from the M. & K. Plumbing and Heating Company. Inspector Ostrander has also written to the Department about this matter. He states that the tanks are needed at the earliest possible date.\n\nI would appreciate it, therefore, if you could arrange to have one of your officers visit this school and advise if the quotation received from M. & K.

Mitchell, Department of Mines & Resources Land Surveyor, I again checked over the matter of replacing the present worn out tanks and the following proposal is recommended by Mr. Mitchell.\n\n1. Excavate a trench at rear of tank storage basement approximately 6' in depth by 6' width and 15' to 20' in length. Cut a hole in concrete basement wall approximately 5' square, remove old tanks through this opening and replace new tanks. Shore up the opening in concrete wall with planking and refill trench with earth removed immediately new tanks have been installed. Estimated cost of removing earth, materials for shoring and refilling not to exceed $100.00.\n\n2. Tanks now in use were purchased from The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company Limited 300-310 Princess Street, Winnipeg, Man. in the year 1929 and exact duplicates should be purchased in order to have tank openings and fittings correspond to the fittings etc. now in use.\n\n3. M & K. Plumbing and Heating Co., Prince Albert should be employed to install new tanks or purchase the new tanks through this firm as outlined on Form 37 dated July 29, 1946, which shows the cost thereof i.e., materials and labour.\n\nLabour costs of replacing these tanks may appear high; however please bear in mind a temporary set up must be arranged in order to assure that the supply of water to the school is not cut off during installation of the new tanks.\n\nBy following the plan outlined herein regarding excavating for removal of the tanks, a considerable saving can be expected and only a small opening made in concrete basement wall.\n\nKindly bear in mind that the tanks must be ordered immediately and installed previous to October 1st, next in order to have this work completed before freezing weather sets in.\n\nN.J. McLeod\nIndian Agent.\n\nEJM/H.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 5th ultimo, File No.1272-305-11 ARG., in connection with the installation of two tanks at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, and with which was enclosed copy of a letter from Indian Agent McLeod together with Requisition Form No. 37, I am now enclosing copy of a letter received from Indian Agent McLeod following the visit to his agency of Mr. J.S. Mitchell, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nMr. McLeod's letter fully explains the circumstances and as the matter is very urgent I would be glad if authority can be given to proceed with the work at the earliest possible date.\n\nJ.F.B.

Mitchell of the Engineering and Construction Service and his report has been carefully reviewed by our Chief Architect. Their recommendations, which are concurred in, are as follows:\n\n1. Excavate a trench at rear of tank storage basement approximately 6'-0\" x 6'-0\" and 15'-0\" to 20'-0\" in length.\n\n2. Cut hole in concrete wall approximately 5'-0\" square.\n\n3.

A delivery date has been promised on this material of from four to six weeks. We would ask, therefore, that a decision be reached so that these tanks may be ordered with the least possible delay, in order that we may be able to install them before the beginning of the new school term.\n\nWe trust this is the information you require, but should any additional information be required, do not hesitate in advising us to that effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM & K PLUMBING & HEATING CO.\n\nPer H.

This purchase of lumber was not authorized by the Department. As this lumber is used for improvements, I take the liberty of asking you to submit this bill to the Department and have the amount refunded to the school.\n\nThanking you for your cooperation,\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. \"G.M.

McLEOD\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, October 29, 1947.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. N.J.

When we receive this we will submit it to the Purchasing Branch but at the present time I am not in a position to guarantee that a purchase order will be issued and if not, payment will be impossible.\n\nThe Principal of the Duck Lake School must be aware of our purchasing regulations which require a requisition to be forwarded to this office before any material or equipment may be provided. It is simply impossible to control our appropriation if principals make purchases without authority and then expect the Department to refund the amount expended.\n\nBernard F.

The school would like to put up a building for the purpose mentioned, size 50' by 30'.\n\nIt is now estimated that the cost of such a building would come to considerable more than $2000.00 with the price of materials and labour having gone up since the time the Estimates were made up in August 1947.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could advise if any provision has been made in the estimates for this building and if so, the amount, so that further particulars could be worked out regarding this building.\n\nN.J.

So out of 18 machines\n8 are in poor condition\n4 are in fair condition\n6 are in very good condition.\n\n2-Laundry Machine:\nThe machine we have at present is too small for the accommodation\nof a school of 200 children.

The Principal is reluctant to put down the 150 yds as it is not possible to put it down in such a way as to make it look like a finished job and it will always look as if the job was only half done.\n\nThe idea of having linoleum in the dining room was not the Principals but was to comply with the wishes of the Supervisor, Group Feeding Section, Nutrition Division, Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nThe Principal would like to know if it is the Department's intention to get another 150 sq. yds next year or whether the 150 sq. yds. now on hand is all the linoleum they are going to get. If they are not to get any more they will have to make the best use possible of the 150 sq. yds. they now have.\n\nN.J. McLEOD\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nNJM/H.\nFebruary 3, 1948.\n\nMr. N.J. McLeod, Indian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, file 98-4 D.L., with reference to the linoleum supplied the Duck Lake Residential School.\n\nIf funds permit we will order the additional 150 sq. yds. before the end of March, otherwise it will be ordered after April 1st.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM\n\n- The Deputy Minister -\n\nI am returning herewith a requisition for six (6) sewing machines requested by the Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School and submitted to the Purchasing Agent by the Superintendent of Training. I am returning also a memorandum dated February 5, 1947, and a statement outlining in detail the policy that might be followed with respect to the purchase of supplies for use at residential schools throughout the Dominion. This is no doubt the information to which you refer in your memorandum. I can attribute our failure to discuss this matter with you or with Mr. Jackson personally to the fact that the time at the disposal of the Superintendent of Training has been decidedly limited. He has been, as you know, giving until now a great deal of attention to the readjustment of Indian day school teachers' salaries and to the preparation of memoranda relating to their eligibility for superannuation allowances.\n\nThe proposal that purchases at residential schools should be measurably uniform is simply one that will not work in practice. My experience has convinced me that each request for supplies must be considered and decided on its merits, always keeping the actual needs of the Indian pupils in mind, particularly their educational needs and their educational advancement.\n\nThere are few requests for sewing machines, for example, from schools operated in cooperation with the Church of England in Canada, for the\n\n.... simple\nsimple reason that the Women's Auxiliary of the Missionary Society of this Church have accepted the responsibility for years of supplying ready-made clothing to Anglican Residential Schools. Until two years ago, this branch paid the freight amounting to approximately $800.00 a year on this clothing. Late in the war period, however, the women responsible for supplying the clothing accepted this charge also. Dr. Alderwood, with whom I discussed this matter six months ago or so, was not at all sure that the policy was a wise one, judged from the standpoint of the pupil. In other words, he felt that it might be more advisable to buy cloth - dress material and cloth for boys' suits - in bulk, and have the pupils, particularly the senior girls, undertake the actual making of the garments and suits. He considered, and I was disposed to agree with him, that it was of the utmost importance that girls should be given a certain amount of this training prior to their return to the reserves.\n\nThere seems to be a feeling that certain School Principals, because of their persistency, request and receive more supplies than those to which they are entitled. This contention, however, is not borne out by the information on file. A number of examples of expenditures the significance of which is apt to be overlooked are made at certain schools annually. The Mohawk School at Brantford, for example, is operated nominally at least under the auspices of the Church of England. There are this year fifty-three pupils, many of them graduates of this school, and others of the Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve, proceeding with high school studies at a cost to this department of $12,000.00. The same policy, but not to the same extent, is followed at the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie, also operated under the auspices of the Church of England, and at the Brandon School operated under the auspices of the United Church. We have not, however, I regret to state at this date an arrangement such as this with any of the schools operated under the auspices of the Catholic Church, for the simple reason that Catholic schools, with rare exceptions, are built on Indian reserves, and we have not found it possible or practical to adopt the Brantford policy at...\nschools in remote and comparatively inaccessible districts.\n\nThe request for six (6) sewing machines at the Duck Lake Residential School represents an attempt on the part of the Principal to remodel discarded military clothing purchased by him from the War Assets Corporation and to make as well dresses and suits for the girls and boys in attendance at the school. The Oblate Order have for a number of years purchased dress material and suiting in bulk at wholesale rates for distribution to their schools. This provides the pupils, particularly the senior girls, with a certain amount of valuable training. There are at this date 202 pupils enrolled at the Duck Lake School, but per capita grants are allowed for only 187. The last audit statement covering the period February, 1945, to March, 1947, indicates that this school was indebted to the Oblate Order to the extent of $10,709.73, but the debt was reduced during the period covered by the audit by the sum of $2,084.82. It is significant to note that no interest has been charged on this loan. The auditor in his report states:\n\n\"While most of the expenditure groups show increases, the percentages of increases are not large, other than in Clothing and Food, namely, 76.8% and 37.17%.\"\n\nIndian Agent McLeod in a letter dated January 24, 1948, directs our attention to a report submitted by Mr. A. M. Warren, District Manager, Singer Sewing Machine Company, Prince Albert, which report shows that of the sewing machines now in use, one (1) is 43 years old, one (1) 39 years old, one (1) 23 years old, one (1) 26 years old, and one the age of which cannot be ascertained, and another 24 years old. Mr. Warren points out that these machines are in poor condition and few will question this opinion, in view of the fact that they have been operated by Indian pupils over a long period of years, and Indian pupils have never been noted for their interest in or care of Government property. If we are going to be at all realistic about these matters, we might as well face the fact that all the churches engaged in the operation of residential schools,\nschools, with perhaps the single exception of the Church of England, have found it impossible during the war period, and even at this date, to secure boys' and girls' clothing to the extent necessary to meet their actual needs. This matter has been brought to my attention almost weekly during the last seven or eight-year period.\n\nI must state that I have been and still am greatly disturbed with the condition of a number of our residential school buildings and lack of equipment at these schools. To enrol Indian pupils at residential schools and to refuse to supply them with the equipment necessary to engage in a worthwhile course of academic and vocational instruction is, in my judgment, a sheer waste of public funds. In this connection, I am sending forward for your information a copy of a letter received by Dr. Moore from Dr. L. B. Pett. I may state that immediately following the receipt of this letter I had a conference with Dr. Moore and Dr. Pett. The discussion at this conference indicated the appalling lack of equipment at the schools visited by the official of the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nIt is our intention, now that the Superintendent of Training is no longer responsible for administration in the Welfare Division, to work out a standard program for Indian residential schools. In this program provision should be made for -\n\n(a) - A worthwhile course in academic and vocational instruction -\n\n(b) - An agreement with the Churches whereby all teachers employed will be fully qualified academically and professionally -\n\n(c) - Schools to be visited and inspected at least twice annually - once by the Public School Inspector as now, and once by a representative of the department, preferably the official now responsible for the promotion and supervision of vocational courses at Indian schools.\n\n.. It is my\nIt is my intention to recommend also that following the sittings of the Special Parliamentary Committee a contract containing these and other proposals be entered into by the department with the Churches now engaged in the operation of residential schools.\n\nDirector.\nDr. P.E. Moore,\nDirector,\nIndian Health Services.\n\nRe: Our food service assistance to residential schools\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nIn 1945 you secured some assistance on menus and diets in certain schools and I offered continuous service when it could be arranged. This was finally arranged with the assignment of one of my nutritionists, full time, beginning in September, 1946. Three steps have been taken:\n\n(1) A poster drawing contest was sponsored, with cash prizes. My Division spent about $4,000.00 on this and was successful in receiving a great deal of information on how Indians think about food, as well as in giving Indian schools the idea that food is important.\n\n(2) A course for cooks and for Indian girls who might be able to serve as assistant cooks was held at Lebret in July, 1947. This course cost this Division about $500.00 and much more to the Branch. As shown in the accompanying Appendix many of those who attended are not now in a position to use the instruction, and only 1 person out of 39 is known to be using it. This unsatisfactory result is due to several factors, including the method of choosing candidates for the course, and the lack of support from principals and other administrators.\n\n(3) Inspections of Indian Residential Schools were begun in order to help cooks to provide more nutritious meals. Detailed reports were made on dietary shortcomings, facilities in the school and other problems. In 13 schools a re-visit has now been made, nearly a year later, and practically no improvement has been found. To date this work has cost us about $5,000.00.\n\nThe following comments may be made from visiting 38 residential schools:\n\n(a) no school was doing a good feeding job;\n\n(b) a lack of mechanical equipment makes necessary the use of much student time on other than instruction;\n\n(c) a lack of coordinated plans for the farm to supply the school meals has caused the purchase of foods which could have been raised; this increases the cost of an adequate diet and makes\nour recommendations result in a demand for money when the need is actually for a policy that combines the farm both with the training and the food supply.\n\n(d) The cook frequently lacks training and is thus not able to take advantage of our assistance; efforts to correct this by a cook's course were not successful (see 2 above);\n\n(e) the methods used in Indian Residential Schools as reflected in their food services do not appear to be fitting Indians for their usual return to the reserve (e.g., ignoring local foods and food habits) nor for proper understanding of white procedures.\n\nConclusions\n\n1. No further visits to Indian Residential Schools appear likely to be useful since there is no value in knowing that another school is below standard nutritionally, and little benefit can be measured from these visits.\n\n2. Emphasis on informing the cooks, rather than the farm managers, Principals, religious administrations, Indian Agents etc., appears to have been a mistake. I suggest that Indian Affairs arrange a conference or series of conferences for these people to discuss food and other problems.\n\n3. Better coordination of farm with food supplies and training is needed for the most economical and practical feeding to be done.\n\n4. Lack of proper equipment is a serious handicap in most places, but since this seems to apply to the whole school it is not just a food matter.\n\nRecommendations\n\nI propose to change our food advice to Indian Residential Schools in the following ways:\n\n1. Continue such contacts as now exist, by correspondence and sending of materials from time to time.\n\n2. Discuss nutrition problems with Principals and others in so far as this is made possible by Conferences called by the proper authorities. One of the purposes of such discussions would be to evolve with their help sets of menus and tests of foods to be provided which could be priced locally and covered by a sufficient money grant in relation to the development of the farm. This need for uniform directions appears to be fundamental to developing good feeding at the schools; it requires planning and coordination at all levels of administration, not the \"hot-potato\" approach now in effect.\n3. Make a demonstration project of at least two schools provided that cooperation of the Indian Affairs Branch and all others concerned can be secured. The schools in mind are the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, and the Edmonton Residential School, for reasons concerned with my own staff and other activities in 1948.\n\nThe project would be a long term matter involving several years. A complete nutrition survey of all children would be carried out. Any essential renovation of the kitchen would have to be carried out, as well as assurance of money for the menus, so as to get first-class feeding. Further clinical and statistical studies would be carried out at 6 month or yearly intervals.\n\nIn one school it would be possible to study the effects of foods containing added vitamins and minerals. My attitude on this topic, which you raised with me recently, is that there is need for small scale study of any results that can be achieved before launching a wide program in the North. It is a remarkable fact that food fortification was launched in the United States and a few other countries without any such study. Even after several years there is no clear evidence. It seems to me important to have a better indication that is now available on how to achieve the results desired.\n\nI hope that you will comment on these ideas when we meet this Wednesday.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) L.B.

A requisition was forwarded to have the fire escapes and fire doors comply with Saskatchewan Provincial Fire regulations. Authority was not given to install the two escapes in accordance with the Provincial Order, as Department letter of September 22nd, 1949, File 109-1-5 (E.I.), stated that funds were not available for the purpose in the current fiscal year. I would recommend that authority be given, as soon as possible, in the beginning of the fiscal year 1949-50. The fire door mentioned in the Fire Inspector's report is on order, and will be installed as soon as received.\"\n31st March, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n23rd instant regarding fire escapes and fire\ndoors which the Provincial Fire Inspector\nrecommended be installed at the Duck Lake School,\nI enclose for your information a copy of a tender\nwhich we received from Mr. McLeod last September.\n\nWe will have the funds in our appropriation\nfor 1949-50 for the installation of these fire\nescapes and fire doors, but it should be understood\nby all parties concerned that the cost of the work\nwill be charged against the funds specified in\nthe appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase\nof new equipment for the Duck Lake School.\n\nIt is becoming extremely difficult to\nobtain the Minister's approval of an expenditure\nas large as the one which is necessary in this\nparticular instance, without having competitive\ntenders. Consequently, we would appreciate it\nif you would obtain additional tenders and submit\nsame for our consideration.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded\nto Mr. McLeod.\n\nBernard F.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor, Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nReference is made to a copy of Department letter dated March 31st, file 652-5 (E.I) regarding fire escapes and fire doors at the Duck Lake, Saskatchewan Indian Residential School.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the tender of the M & K Plumbing and Heating Company of Prince Albert, Sask., be accepted covering the required fire door and fire escapes. We have put this firm to some expense in connection with drafting plans and at the present date they have placed an order for the fire door and are awaiting our authorization to proceed with the making of the required fire escapes. This firm have made several inspection trips to Duck Lake and have the plans and proper equipment to complete the work.\n\nWere we to request additional tenders I fear that the installation of the fire doors and fire escapes would not be completed this year as it is necessary for the firm mentioned to have the fire escapes made up by local machine shops and this would require several months advance notice in order to secure the materials required and then make the fire escapes according to specifications.\n\nN. J. McLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter dated March 31st, File 652-5 (E.1), regarding the fire escapes and fire doors at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Superintendent N.J. McLeod, of the Duck Lake Agency, in which he strongly recommends that the tender of the M & K Plumbing Company, of Prince Albert, be accepted, as it is very difficult to get more than the one tender for the reason given by Mr. McLeod.\n\nThe Duck Lake School is about 45 miles from Prince Albert, and 60 miles from Saskatoon, and there is no firm nearer than Prince Albert or Saskatoon which would be interested in the work. The examination and the measurements are very necessary, following which there has been considerable difficulty in securing the material. It is true that there has been some improvement in the supply of material and labour for such work quite recently, but the situation is still not good, and we will have difficulty in many of our projects if we try to follow a set rule that two or three quotations be submitted on fairly large projects. There is also the difficulty, of course, that some firms submitting their quotations are not particularly anxious to get the work, therefore acceptance of their tender prevents us awarding the contract to some other firm, notwithstanding the fact that the firm which has been awarded the contract, through lack of interest, may keep us waiting for months.\n\nIt is my opinion that any alterations in our school buildings, when demanded by the Provincial Fire Inspector, should be considered urgent, and that there should be as little delay as possible in complying with his demand.\n\nJ.F.B.

Reach-in with Ice-maker combination, coil installed in dining room proper and another 90 cut. ft. Reach-in between the kitchen and dining room. This second Reach-in would be equipped with a blower type chilling unit and two full length doors equipped or reinforced to take milk cans. We would also recommend that we carry all refrigerant line right through to the engine room as we could carry a run of conduit large enough to accommodate both reach-in units and also move your present unit back as per my first letter.\n\nInstallation would possibly be a little more difficult but our machine would be all together and close to our power supply. Also, this room has plenty of windows which could be opened for air supply during hot weather.\n\nIn estimating, the cost will leave the price the same for moving your present compressor at $117.00.\n\n| Description                          | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Reach-in - 90 cut. ft. for Dining Room | 1190.00 |\n| Reach-in - 90 cu. ft. for Kitchen    | 1190.00 |\n| 150' - 5/8 copper $45.00 - 150' 3/8 copper | $22.50 |\n|                                       | 67.50  |\n|                                       | 150.00 |\n|                                       | $2597.50 |\n\n1/2 H.P. heavy duty air cooled compressor for each Reach-in using Freon refrigerant.\n\nI cannot quote you on the power wiring which should not be much as we would be right close to the supply.\n\nFreight runs about $90.00 for both units and is included in the price. Also included is my labour and material in order to give you a complete price less power wiring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nELECTRIC SHOP per \"G.H. Helgason\"\nRefrigeration at Duck Lake Residential School\n\nReferring to the letter from Electric Shop, dated May 7th.\n\nComplete investigation of this proposal is indicated, with the probability that it will prove unwise.\n\n1. Cost: nearly $2750 for 180 cu.ft. That is nearly four times the cost of a cubic foot in a walk-in refrigerator.\n\n2. Position: The dining-room is already none too large to accommodate 210 pupils and the male members of the staff. Moreover, 300 sq.yd. of expensive linoleum has recently been laid.\n\n3. Integration with farm and kitchen might turn out to be inconvenient. This plan suggests that a few people want some form of separate refrigeration. This is certainly an expensive and inconsiderate way to achieve the purpose. It is comparable to the manner in which the Department was led to supply small-scale laundry facilities.\n\nPlease note that there is already a refrigeration unit which will cost $117 to move.\n\nI suggest calling for diagrams and a written appreciation of the needs of the\nschool and the best way to supply them:\n\nE.g.:\n1. What are the dimensions of the existing unit?\n2. What range of temperature does it allow?\n3. What commodities are stored in it?\n4. During the period May 1st - Oct. 1st\n   what is the daily (a) production\n   (b) consumption\n   (c) sale\n\nof (i) Milk\n(ii) Butter\n(iii) Eggs\n(iv) Meat.\n\nC.A.T.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have been requested to provide\na walk-in refrigerator or some similar refrigerating\nequipment that would be suitable for the requirements\nat the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. Enclosed\nfor your information is a quotation which the\nReverend Principal received from the Electric Shop,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe do not favour the proposal submitted\nby this Company for the following reasons:\n\n(1) The cost mentioned in the quotation is approximately\nfour times the cost per cubic foot in a walk-in\nrefrigerator.\n\n(2) We will not consider favourably the suggestion\nmade in the first paragraph of the quotation\nreceived from the Electric Shop. We feel that\nthe dining room at this school is none too large\nto accommodate the pupils and staff. Besides,\nwe have recently laid some 300 square yards of\nexpensive linoleum. In brief, our opinion is\nthat the dining room is not the proper place to\ninstall such a unit, and consideration will have\nto be given to installing it in some other part\nof the school.\n\n(3) We understand that there is already a refrigeration\nunit at this school, and it would costly to move it.\n\n......2\nWe are prepared to give favourable consideration to a suitable refrigeration unit for this school, and would appreciate it if you would give this matter your careful consideration and obtain tenders for the type of unit which you consider should be supplied. We feel the following matters should be kept in mind when considering the type of unit needed:\n\n(a) The dimensions of the existing unit.\n(b) The range of temperature it allows.\n(c) The commodities that are stored in the present unit.\n(d) During the period May 1st to October 1st you should keep in mind the daily production and consumption of milk, butter, eggs and meat.\n\nNo doubt you will confer with the Principal on the matter as soon as your other duties will permit.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor, Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina,\nSask.\n\nRe: Duck Lake Indian Residential School\n\nEnclosed herewith please find form 37 listing thereon cooking and refrigeration equipment required for the above named Indian Residential School.\n\nI. Cooking Kitchen Range.\n\nThe present range now in use is badly burnt out and the entire top has become badly warped with the results that a new stove is required. Cooking range now in use is a two fire box, three oven type, coal burner, No. 203, C. F. Model, \"John Bull\" made by the Gurney Foundry Company, Toronto Ontario.\n\nThe Principal of the Duck Lake School would appreciate our purchasing either an Electric Range of the same capacity or a coal burner with automatic stoker. I have checked over the stove now in use and find that it is beyond repair and requires replacing.\n\nIn view of the model of the range required being a very large type I am unable to submit quotations from local sources and I believe that our Purchasing Agent will be in a position to secure quotations from firms manufacturing cook stoves in the size and capacity required for the Duck Lake School.\n\nAttendance at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School now totals 225 pupils and the staff totals approximately 25 therefore the cooking range required should be of a capacity to prepare meals for the number shown.\n\n2. Refrigeration\n\nThe additional refrigeration equipment is required to provide necessary refrigeration in connection with preservation of perishable food supplies especially milk, butter, eggs and meat. The present refrigerator is really too small and requires freezing temperatures for meats whereas low temperatures is not required for other food supplies such as milk, eggs etc., when I visited the school on May 18th, I found that substantial quantities of perishable food supplies could not be accommodated in the locker and the refrigerator now in use was filled beyond capacity with additional supplies being cooled in rather unsanitary manner due to limited space for this purpose and I believe that the additional refrigeration is badly needed to assist with the proper handling of the necessary supplies that are required.\nIn connection with moving the present motor that operates refrigeration equipment into the Boiler room. This move is necessary as the motor is housed in a small building outside the main building and is subject to extreme cold in the winter months with the result that the motor does not function properly; by moving the motor into the main boiler room this trouble in connection with operation of the motor in cold weather conditions would be eliminated.\n\nAll quotations shown were furnished to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School by the Electric Shop, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It is presumed that this firms quotations would be in line with other firms and in view of local firms being unable to supply or submit quotations the enclosures are submitted for approval.\n\nI recommend that the expenditure be approved providing our Branch Officials can provide the finances to cover the expenditure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. J. McLeod,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nRegina, June 14th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Mr. Phelan\n\nWith reference to the matter of the refrigeration equipment at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, and Army Message dated the 13th instant, I have been withholding a recommendation in this connection because of the fact that I wished to make a visit to the school for further enquiry before forwarding the matter to the Department for consideration. I am enclosing copy of Indian Superintendent McLeod's letter and requisitions for the refrigeration equipment, and a two fire box three oven type cook stove herewith.\n\nThis equipment is apparently needed at the school, and I am therefore forwarding the requisitions herewith, with the recommendation that consideration be given to supplying it. Also enclosed is the quotation of the Electric Shop, Prince Albert, on the refrigerator equipment, totalling $2,597.50.\n\nIf anything further transpires this week as a result of my visit to the Duck Lake School I shall further communicate with the Department in connection with these matters.\n\nJ.P.B.

L. Keenleyside.\n\nIt has come to our attention that your Department is contemplating the erection of a school at Duck Lake in Saskatchewan. We are writing you at this time with the thought that you may be interested in our line of Fiat Shower Cabinets as an accommodation in the wash rooms. For your information, we are enclosing a copy of our descriptive folder and price sheet.\n\nThese low cost shower cabinets require a minimum of floor space for erection and are sold complete with all hardware as outlined in our literature. Fiat products are obtainable through the plumbing trade across Canada.\n\nWe are also enclosing tear sheets on two additional models, the \"COMMODORE\" and \"CADET\" which we will be manufacturing this year and which will have precast terrazzo receptors, as well as tear sheet on the \"MARINER\", a stainless steel unit adaptable for use in institutions etc.\n\nIf there is any further information you would like to have, we would be very pleased to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPORCELAIN AND METAL PRODUCTS LIMITED.\n\nFiat Sales Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 14th of May, 1949, File 652-5 (E.I.), and my letter dated June 14th, 1949, File 1434-6-8-109, in connection with the installation of the refrigeration equipment at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, I visited this school on June 18th, accompanied by Indian Superintendent McLeod and Mr. C.A.F. Clark.\n\nWith regard to (1) in the Department letter referred to, while the cost is somewhat more than a walk-in refrigerator of the same capacity, the Principal wishes to have the refrigerator at one end of the dining-room and the kitchen, and the location of the present refrigerator is very awkwardly situated with respect to the dining room and the kitchen. If in the dining room, the refrigerator becomes a part of the dining room, and therefore should be ornamental as well as practical. It is the intention to use it for milk and butter, mostly, as the other refrigerator is suitable for meat and vegetables, but cannot be used for milk and butter without tainting them.\n\nWith reference to (2), the refrigerator suggested will not reduce the size of the dining room floor space, as it is to be installed under a stairway which has to remain, and will be taking the place of a cupboard now constructed under the stairway, for storage of brooms, etc.\n\nWith regard to (3), the cost of moving the present refrigerator unit to a place convenient to the dining room and kitchen would be nearly as much as the construction of a new one, but I am of the opinion that the old one is quite serviceable where it is, and a new one should be added at the point mentioned at the end of the dining room.\n\nAgain referring to (2)...........\nAgain referring to (2), and that part thereof which refers to 300 yds. of expensive linoleum in the dining room, this linoleum has not been laid, and will not be laid on the dining room floor, which is in the basement of the building, and concrete. It is not needed there, and will be a source of trouble, through moisture, if it is laid on that floor. Father Latour would like permission to use it in other parts of the same building. In my opinion it is not very necessary to lay linoleum on most of the remainder of the building where the floors are of hardwood, and there are other schools where it is needed worse than the Duck Lake School, if it is decided that it should not be laid on the dining room floor at the Duck Lake School.\n\nPlease instruct me further in connection with the linoleum.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nExtract from letter dated June 19th, from C.A.F. Clark. File: 652-1\n\nDuck Lake Residential School\n\nI shared in the discussion about the proposed refrigerator and I offer no objections to the additions requested. The completed installation will, however, set a pattern which we may expect others to wish to imitate.\n\nYou have seen my remarks about the linoleum for the basement floor. This has not been laid, and it is agreed that is neither necessary nor desirable that it be laid on the concrete basement dining-room floor. I heard a suggestion that it be laid on an upper floor, but there the floors are of good hardwood, and I believe that these three hundred yards of linoleum are surplus to the requirements of this school.\n\nThe kitchen stove was examined and found to require additions and expansion.\nJuly 13, 1949.\n\nMR. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Duck Lake Residential School\nYour File No. 1575-6-8-109\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 27th regarding the refrigeration equipment requested by the principal of the above school, the Departmental Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure a Reach-in refrigerator, 90 cubic feet capacity to be placed in the dining room.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter and also in the report received from Mr. Clark, it is considered that the 300 yards of linoleum which was supplied to this school is surplus to requirements. If there is any other residential school in the province of Saskatchewan where the linoleum could be used, authority is granted for transferring the linoleum to that school.

Duck Lake - Delivery not stated.....$1,190.00\n\nIt is noted that Fleming-Pedlar Ltd. have submitted a tender on the required equipment as a result of an invitation to tender having been directed to the Canadian General Electric Co. Ltd., Saskatoon, who referred the request to the above firm as they are distributors in this district for C.G.E. refrigerating equipment.\n\nThe lowest bid received is from Marshall-Wells Co. Ltd. in the amount of $785.00, but as far as can be ascertained from the scanty description supplied it has only shelf storage with a six tray ice making coil specially installed in their standard 90 cubic foot capacity refrigerator.\n\nThe next lowest tender is furnished by Fleming-Pedlar Ltd. in the amount of $1,098.00 for wood exterior finish and $1,240.00 for Dulux finish on steel exterior. This unit is in accordance with specifications which called for a 90 cubic foot reach-in refrigerator with combined cold storage and ice maker. It has provision for handling large cuts of meat or large containers in addition to shelves for smaller items. It has an ice making capacity of twelve trays.\n\nCol. B.F.

The J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co. Ltd. quoted Frigidaire equipment housed in a metal cabinet. Their price in the amount of $1,245.00 is $147.00 higher than Fleming-Pedlar wooden exterior unit and $5.00 higher than their metal exterior unit.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the refrigerating unit offered by Fleming-Pedlar Ltd. at the quoted installed price of $1,098.00 for the wooden exterior finish is the most favourable of the four bids received, and we recommend that the Indian Affairs Branch accept the tender submitted by this firm.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith tenders forwarded with your memorandum.\n\nV.G.

The distance from the station, about one mile is a convenient one.\n\nI have instructed Agent McKenzie to have the N.E. quarter reserved by the Local Agent, pending your decision, and even if you do not purchase the adjoining quarter, it apparently would by itself be just about as good as any other which is available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sd) Hayter Reed.\nCommissioner.\n\nHon.

J. M. Daly,\nDept General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI understand that the\nFrench Catholics are making an\neffort to have the site chosen\nby you near here last summer,\nfor the Indian Industrial\nschool changed to Munsey Lake.\n\nThere are various reasons and\ndisadvantages to be shown why\nthe school should not be\nplaced at Munsey Lake.\n\nMunsey Lake is an out\nof the way place where\nonly ranching is carried on,\nand the site chosen there\nis not fit for agricultural\npurposes. Consequently the\nschool would be in no way\nsuitable for raising fruit\netc., and the Indian children\ncould not have the advantage\nof instruction in farming;\nthey would not see or\nassociate with whites or\nbecome civilized to the\nextent they would be by being\nin a white settlement.\n\nBeing at a great distance\nfor a notice, the trumpet\nis supplied and travelling back and forth,\nand you will be able to see\nthe enemy off across the\nschool. More particularly\nhaving to cross the North\nSaskatchewan which at times\nof the year is impracticable.\nThen an all day of the\nIndians in that vicinity,\nCatholics, the case rapidly\nbeing really Christian and\nunder the control of Protestant\nclergyman, and it would be\nmore desirable that a public\ninstitution of that description\nshould be established in some\nplace where it could be easily\ndesired by those who take\nan interest in the advancement\nof the Indian children and\nnot in a remote place such\nas merely beds where it could\nonly be seen and visited\nthere who had the control\nof it.\n\nOn the other hand there\nare many advantages in having\nthe school located at the site\n\"X\". The site chosen by you\nis 1\u00bd miles from the Big\nStation and town of Edmonton.\nThe land is good agricultural\nland, good water is found\nthere.\nas shown by the well clay under\nyour direction. The children\ncould be the object of\nbetter care in gaining and\nintercourse with whites, more\nless, as they would come\ninto contact with them.\n\nThe school being near the Big\nStation could be carried out at\na much less expense, and the\nbuildings and land \"which would\nreally amount to nothing\" could\nbe disposed of to advantage.\n\nShould the Board see the necessity\nof closing or abandoning the\nschool, whilst at Hunting\nboth, everything would have\nto be sacrificed to them.\n\nI trust that you will think\nthat the advantages shown are\nworthy of your consideration,\nand that you will see your\nway to complete the scheme\nin the S.S. No. 16. 44. 2 M. The\nsite is fairly selected by\nyourself.\n\nNow the best of\n\nFor obedient servant,\n\nHelly & Whitehead\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nReferring to Mr. Hillyard Mitchell's letter of the 26th ultimo herewith, the undersigned would state, for the information of the Superintendent General, that,\n\nOn the 21st December 1891 the Bishop of Saskatchewan made application for an Industrial School in the Saskatchewan District, to be under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, and recommended Duck Lake as the best location for it.\n\nOn the 5th March 1892 His Lordship was informed that the best the Government could do at present was to begin, in a small way, the establishment of a Boarding School at the point recommended by him, viz., Duck Lake, which could, in time, be increased.\n\nOn the 5th of July 1892 the Department of the Interior reserved the N. E. 1/4 of Sec. 16, Tp 44, R 2, West of the 3rd M., for school purposes.\n\nIn the Supplementary Estimates for the current year Parliament voted for the establishment of a Boarding School at Duck Lake the sum of $4000, viz.,\n\nBuildings--------$2,000.00\nFurnishing------1,000.00\nMaintenance-----1,000.00\n\nThe Superintendent General will observe from this\nthis and the correspondence on file herewith that the proposed school is to be a Boarding School, and not an Industrial School, and also that the location decided upon is at Duck Lake, and further, that it was stated in the Supplementary Estimates, when Parliament voted the $4000, that the School was to be a Boarding School, and that it was to be located at Duck Lake.\n\nThe Superintendent General will see from the small sketch on file of the location of the Reserves in the Duck Lake and Carlton Agencies that the great majority of the Indians in the vicinity of Duck Lake are returned as Roman Catholics, while the bulk of the population in the Carlton District, where (viz. Muskeg Lake) Mr. Mitchell says the Roman Catholics are endeavouring to have the proposed school established, are Protestant.\n\nIn deciding upon the location of the School in question, this, of course, was one of the chief reasons for choosing Duck Lake. The fact of its being near to a Railway, thus affording cheap transportation of supplies, &c., was also an important consideration. If the school were located at Muskeg Lake it is apparent that many of the disadvantages mentioned by Mr. Mr. Mitchell would be experienced, without any corresponding benefits.\n\nThe undersigned therefore considers that, in view of all the facts, it would be in the interest of the\nthe school and the Department that the site already chosen, namely, Duck Lake, should be adhered to.\n\nFebruary 1894.\nOttawa, February 20th, 1894.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Daly handed me your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the site of the proposed Boarding School, in order that I might look into the matter and reply to you.\n\nI may say that the force of what you urge in favour of Duck Lake was duly considered when it was determined to put the school in that vicinity, and having for good reason selected a site there, and made our arrangements accordingly, the Minister has not so far seen any sufficient reason advanced to induce a departure from the course determined on.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHillyard Mitchell, Esq., M.L.A.,\nDuck Lake, (Hobart P.O.),\nSaskatchewan.\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\n\nReferring to letter from Bishop Pascal, dated at Aix Province, on 30th October last, in which His Lordship requested that operations relative to the proposed Boarding School in the vicinity of Duck Lake should be deferred until His Lordship should have an opportunity of interviewing the Department regarding the site, the undersigned begs to report that some few days ago His Lordship, accompanied by the Rev. Father LaCombe, called and discussed the matter.\n\nThe undersigned advanced reasons approved by yourself why the site should not be changed to any distance from Duck Lake, and their force was admitted by His Lordship, who agreed that the school should be built near Duck Lake, requesting, however, that it be placed on Roman Catholic Church property there.\n\nThe Church will sell for the purpose from 100 to 160 acres of Mission property, as may be required, and take good lands in payment therefor, valuing its lands at $3.00 per acre, and agreeing to take Government lands in exchange.\n\nSince the reasons which determined the Department to select a site near the village of Duck Lake would have induced it to choose land yet nearer to the village than the 1/4 Section reserved, (N.E. 1/4 Sec.16, Tp\nTp 44, R. 2, W. 3rd I.M.), could a suitable one have been obtained; and moreover, by adoption of the proposed location on the Mission there will be additional advantages in the way of use of Mission buildings, and increased supervision and assistance from the Mission staff.\n\nIt will be observed that we have the 1/4 Section hereinbefore described set apart for the school, and available for purposes of exchange.\n\nIt is recommended, as agreed upon between His Lordship and myself, that Mr. Assistant Indian Commissioner Forget be the arbiter as to value of land to be given in exchange.\n\nMarch 6th, 1894.\nOttawa 13th March 1894\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to past correspondence relative to erection of a boarding school to be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church at Duck Lake, I beg to inform you that His Lordship Bishop Pascal accompanied by the Revd Father Lacombe called here the other day, and it was agreed that the school should be placed on the Roman Catholic Mission property at Duck Lake, the church to give 100 to 160 acres as required, and to receive an equivalent in Government lands calculated upon a valuation of the mission land at $3.00 per acre, and you to be arbiter as to the value of Government Lands.\n\nYour will remember in this connection that we have N.E. 1/4 Section 16 Tp 44 R.2,W.3rd I.M., reserved for a site and consequently available for exchange, and it would be well to endeavour to apply that first on the exchange.\n\nA.R. Forget Esqr.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner\nRegina N.W.T.\nIt will be well for you to communicate with His Lordship and get this essential preliminary arranged as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nD. L. Leith\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nSir,\n\nreferring to your letter of the 13th ultimo\n\nI have the honour to inform you that His Lordship Bishop Pascal has been communicated with in regard to the exchange of lands proposed to be made between the Roman Catholic Mission and the Government.\n\nHis Lordship has been made aware of the desire of the Department to include within such exchange the N.E. & section Tp. 44, R. 2, W 3rd I. M., but refuses to accept it for the reason, amongst others, that the Mission has already enough lands in the vicinity of Duck Lake and prefers making a selection elsewhere.\n\nHis Lordship has indicated the following:\n\nSec. 1/2 N.E. & Tp. 49, R. 3, west 3rd I. M. and S.W. & Tp. 44, R. 13 west 2 I. M. the first not far from Mistowasis reserve in a North east direction at a short distance from Shell River and the other South east of John Smith's reserve on Stoney Creek.\n\nThese sections appear to be available and the value set on them by Mr Louis Schmidt of the Land Office\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOffice at Prince Albert is about $1.00 per acre or $320.0 for the whole as against $300.00, the estimated value of the Mission land given in exchange. In view, however of the object to be attained, I would recommend the exchange as proposed.\n\nIf authorized, His Lordship desires the patents to be issued as soon as possible, the first in the name of \"La Corporation des Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e des Territoires du Nord-Ouest,\" and the second in the name of \"La Corporation Episcopale de Saskatchewan.\"\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Commissioner\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, and in reply to inform you that in so far as locality is concerned there would not appear to be any objection to the proposition made by His Lordship Bishop Pascal relative to taking lands in exchange for those to be surrendered by the Mission at Duck Lake to serve as a site for the proposed boarding school.\n\nIt is not stated what area of land is to be taken for school purposes, but it may probably be assumed in connection with what was written to you that the value of $300 is for 100 acres at $3 per acre.\n\nIf so it would seem that 320 acres is somewhat a large area to give in exchange, or, in other words, that the valuation of Government lands at $1 per acre seems very low. This strikes me all the more forcibly from the fact of being personally assessed for lands in the neighbourhood at a valuation of $3 per acre.\n\nI will be glad to hear from you further on this subject before carrying the matter to the Department of Interior.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. R. Forget, Esq.,\nAsst Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nDeputy of the Sup't General of Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th instant No 86,973 respecting the exchange of lands between the Department and the Roman Catholic Mission at Duck Lake, I beg to state that the area offered in exchange by the mission is 100 acres.\n\nThe valuation of $1.00 per acre on the Government lands which His Lordship Bishop Pascal is willing to accept in exchange, may appear low, but is fully as much as could be obtained for it were it offered for sale. For my part I certainly would prefer paying $320 for the 100 acres of the Mission, owing to its location, than for the two quarter sections referred to.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nAsst Commissioner\n\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, the Minister having decided to take lands for a site for a Boarding School from the Roman Catholic Mission property at Duck Lake, at a value of $3 per acre, to be paid for by the gift of Government lands elsewhere to the same value, and having appointed the Assistant Indian Commissioner to act as valuator of the latter, he reports that in exchange for 100 acres (aggregate value $300) of the Mission property to be taken by the Department the Church desires the N. E. 1/4 of Sec. 17, Tp. 49, R. 3, W 3rd I. M., and S. W. 1/4 Sec. 21, Tp 44, R. 18, W 2 I.M. The value of $1.00 per acre has been set upon these lands by Mr. Louis Schmidt, of the Land Office at Prince Albert, and concurred in by the Assistant Commissioner, who after having it pointed out to him that the value of $1.00 per acre for the Government lands mentioned seems somewhat small as compared with that of $3.00 per acre affixed to Mission lands, still adheres to the relative valuation from a commercial standpoint.\n\nI will be glad, therefore, to be informed whether the land asked for by the church is available, and can be patented to it when the Mission property\n\nThe Deputy of the\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nproperty shall have been formally ceded to the Department for school purposes.\n\nIn this connection I would add that if the lands now asked for are available the N. R. 1/4, Sec. 16, Tp 44, R. 2, W 3rd I. M., which, as shown by your letter of the 30th November last and prior correspondence, has been set apart for the school referred to, will no longer be required by this Department.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy of the Sup't General of Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 8th instant, stating that Bishop Pascal writes urging the commencement of work on the Boarding School at Duck Lake, and to confirm the following message, this day sent to you:\n\n\"If site secured to Department pending arrangement of exchange, may commence work Duck Lake School. All building and furnishing funds lapse expiration current fiscal year.\"\n\nYou have upon file in your office record of what was agreed upon with regard to building, &c., and will kindly govern yourself accordingly.\n\nAs to the lands recommended by you to be given in exchange for the site, application has been made for them to the department of the Interior, and no difficulty is anticipated, but of course it takes a little time. As a matter of business it would not, of course, be prudent to commence building upon a site until secured.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy of the Supt General of Indian Affairs.\n\nA. E. Forget, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter to the Deputy Minister of the Interior, of the 1st instant, file 86,973, enquiring whether the North East \u00bc of Section 17, Township 49, Range 3 West of the 3rd Meridian, and the South West \u00bc of Section 21, Township 44, Range 18 West of the 2nd Meridian, are available for conveyance to the Roman Catholic Mission at Duck Lake in exchange for the Mission lands at that place which it is desired to take as a site for a boarding school, and in reply to inform you that the North East \u00bc of Section 17 is reserved for the Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway Company, and the South West \u00bc of Section 21 has already been allotted to the Manitoba and North Western Railway Company.\n\nAs to the value of these lands I beg to inform you that although Mr. Louis Schmidt, of the Dominion Lands Office at Prince Albert, possesses several excellent qualifications, the Department cannot admit that he is an infallible judge of the value of land, and therefore will not accept his estimate in this instance. The North East \u00bc of 17 has recently been examined by Mr. McLatchie, D.L.S., who reports it to be good land. The South West \u00bc of 21 is rated as first class land, soil loam 12 inches deep.\n\nHayter Reed, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nover sub-soil, and if these lands were still at our disposal we would not sell them at less than the existing regulation price of $3.00 per acre.\n\nIn this connection I have to suggest that in view of the fact that such a large proportion of the odd numbered sections of land in Manitoba and the Territories has been either allotted to, or is reserved for, railway companies, it is advisable that in any future applications for lands your Department should, wherever possible, restrict your selection to even numbered sections.\n\nYour statement that if the lands now asked for are available the North East \u00bc of Section 16, Township 44, Range 2 West of the 3rd Meridian, which has been set apart for a school site, will no longer be required by your Department, is noted, and it is thought that possibly the authorities of the Mission might accept this quarter section if the offer were made to them. It will be reserved in the meantime.\n\nAs soon as we are advised whether the Mission will accept this North East \u00bc of Section 16, or if not what other land they would be willing to accept, we will instruct Mr. Homestead Inspector Cook to make the necessary valuation, but I may say to you at once that in any case $3.00 per acre must be the minimum valuation.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nCERTIFICATE OF OWNERSHIP\n\nEast Saskatchewan Land Registration District.\n\nReference Certificate 1791.\n\nThis is to Certify that the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs of Canada and his successors in office is now the owner of an estate in fee simple of an in the whole of Legal Subdivisions Four and Three and the West half of Legal Subdivision Two of Section Four in Township Forty four in Range Two West of the Third meridian in the District of Saskatchewan in the North West Territories of Canada, containing one hundred acres more or less; subject to the encumbrances, liens and interests notified by memorial underwritten or endorsed hereon, or which may hereafter be recorded in the Register of Title.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto subscribed my name and affixed my seal this Thirty first day of May A.D. 1894.\n\nS.

McLean\nOTTAWA, 14th November, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nIn further reference to the enquiries made by the Deputy Minister respecting the S.E.$\\frac{1}{4}$, Sec.14, Twp.44, Range 20 West of the 2nd Initial Meridian, I beg to say that this Department does not require this lot to be held for the purpose of exchange with the Roman Catholic authorities, as His Lordship, Bishop Pascal asked that the N.W.$\\frac{1}{4}$, Sec.4, Twp.44, Range 25, East of the 2nd Initial Meridian might be substituted for it, and an order in Council was passed on the 22nd February, 1897 approving of such substitution.\n\nMr Rimmer was on leave when I prepared the Memo. of the 10th instant and after consulting with him I find that the Department has no claim to the S.E.$\\frac{1}{4}$, Sec.14, Twp.44, Range 20, West of the 2nd Initial Meridian.\n\nMartin Benson,\nSir;\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th July last (119695-1) and to the copy enclosed therewith of a memorandum of the Law Clerk of your Department in reference to the title to certain lands to be given in exchange for the Duck Lake School site, I have the honour to state that the Orders-in-Council of the 14th January, 1895, and the 22nd February, 1897, appear so far as one can judge from the statement as to their effect contained in the Law Clerk's memorandum, to be sufficient authority for the issue of patents to La Corporation des Oblats de Nord-Ouest and La Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de la District of Saskatchewan, and the title to the school site being now vested in Her Majesty, there seems to be nothing to prevent an immediate issue of the patents. For the purposes of the grants the lands may be treated as Dominion Lands, and the patents may be in the ordinary form in use by the Department of the Interior, which merely recites that the patentees have applied for a grant and upon investigation have been found entitled thereto.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Minister of Justice.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 8th July, 1899.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nExchange of lands for those required for Duck Lake School, North-west Territories.\n\n---------------------\n\nThe question I am asked to advise on is whether a patent should issue to La Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de la Saskatchewan. The facts of the case as shown on file are that:\n\n1st In 1893 it was determined to erect an Industrial School in the District of Saskatchewan; and it was finally decided that it should be erected at Duck Lake upon lands which the Vicar Apostolique administered on behalf of la Corporation des Oblats de Nordouest and la Corporation Apostolique Catholique Romaine de la Saskatchewan.\n\n2nd The Vicar Apostolique was willing to surrender to the Government one hundred acres in exchange for other lands to be allotted to him out of public lands.\n\n3rd Before it was decided what lands should be given in exchange the Bishop transferred and there was forwarded to the Department a certificate of ownership, dated the 31st May, 1894, issued to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and comprising legal sub-division 43 and west half of the legal sub-division 2 of Section 4, in Township 44, in Range 2, west of the 3rd Meridian, containing one hundred acres.\n\n4th By Order in Council, dated 14th January, 1895, on recommendation\nrecommendation of the Minister of the Interior, there was approval given to the transfer to the Department of Indian Affairs of the South-west quarter of Section 4, and the South-west quarter of Section 14, both in Township 44, Range 20, West of the second principal meridian, in the District of Saskatchewan, for the purpose of effecting an exchange of these lands with la Corporation des Oblats du Nord-ouest and la Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de la District of Saskatchewan respectively for lands given by these Corporations for the purpose of an Indian Industrial School at Duck Lake.\n\n5th By Order in Council of 22nd February, 1897, the North-east quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 25, West of the second Meridian, was substituted for the South-east quarter of Section 14, named in the Order in Council of 14th January, 1895.\n\nThere is no doubt that there should be given to the two Corporations named in the Order in Council of 14th January, 1895, the legal title to the lands allotted to them respectively by the intent of that Order in Council and the Order in Council of 22nd February, 1897. La Corporation des Oblats du Nord-ouest should have a legal title to the South-west quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 20, West of the second meridian, Saskatchewan, and la Corporation Episcopale Romaine de Saskatchewan should have a legal title to the North-east quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 25, West of the second Meridian, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe question of what legal steps are to be taken to satisfactorily adjust the titles of the Crown to the lands of the Industrial School and the title of the two Corporations to the lands which it is intended to convey to them is one by no means free from doubt, and as it affects another as well as this Department, it appears one proper to be referred to the Department of Justice.\nAs a matter of conveyancing I think that as the lands to be exchanged with the two Corporations were Dominion lands the lands given in exchange should have been conveyed to the Crown at an express consideration of $320.00 in order that they might be held under the Dominion Lands Act and under Section 31 of that Act His Excellency in Council should have appropriated the desired hundred acres for the purposes of an Indian Boarding School; and that under Section 29 of the Dominion Lands Act there should have been sold to each Corporation respectively for an express consideration of $160.00 the lands intended to be conveyed to them.\n\nIt appears to me that the Order in Council of 14th January, 1895, does not come within Section 31 of the Dominion Lands Act, and does not constitute a reserve for Indians under Section 90 of the Dominion Lands Act, and I am at a loss to ascertain in what way it is possible for this Department to use the machinery provided by the Indian Act to carry out the apparent intention of the Order in Council of 14th January, 1895.\n\nI consider that it will be necessary to adjust titles; and I recommend that the Department of Justice be asked to advise as to the requisite steps.\n\n(Sgd) Reginald Rimmer.\nLaw Clerk.\nOTTAWA, 29th November, 1890\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence had with your Department respecting the proposed exchange of lands with the Corporation des Oblats du Nord-Ouest and La Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de la Saskatchewan, for lands which have been given by these Corporations for the purpose of an Indian Industrial school at Duck Lake, I beg to enclose herewith for the information of the Law Clerk of your Department, who has had this matter before him, a copy of a Memo. from the Law Clerk of this Department, and a copy of the opinion of the Acting Deputy Minister of Justice, and I have to request that patents may issue in accordance with such opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Interior,\nOTTAWA\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\nSecretary\nHon. Sir,\n\nAs the Hon. C. Leighton is absent, I take the liberty of informing you of my surprise at a recent declaration of the Dept. of Lands at Ottawa according to which Section 14 South-east T. 44 R. 20 W. 2 has been vacant and in consequence has been entered as a homestead by Charles Thompson.\n\nThis action, which I cannot explain, is in contradiction of a declaration of the Dept. dated the 14th Jan. 1895, ref. 373192 in file 293111, and kept in the records of the Land Office at Prince Albert. According to these letters two quarters of sections 4 and 14 T. 44 R. 20...\nwere reserved for me in exchange for lands allotted at Duck Lake for St. Michael's school. If the Department thought it well to make this exchange, it ought to have advised us; as nothing was done, I insist upon the first arrangement and protest against the alienation of the land above mentioned.\n\nIf it should be that the Government does not want to keep the first bargain, I am ready to cancel the exchange on condition that I be paid the sum of $700.00 at the rate of $7.00 an acre for the land granted at Duck Lake for the building of the boarding school.\n\nYou will pardon me, Hon' Sir, for my applying to yourself for the settlement of this difficulty, which I look upon as a misunderstanding.\non the part of the officials of the Dept. of the Interior of Indian Affairs. Your kindly consideration so well known prompted me to take this step.\n\nAsking you to accept the expression of my respects,\n\n&c.\n\nAlbert Leduc, O.M.I.\nVia. Agent of Saskatchewan.\nRef.383111:\n\nOttawa, 3rd April, 1900.\n\nMy dear Sir Wilfrid,\n\nReferring to your note of the 26th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Smart, covering a letter from His Lordship Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert, with regard to the issue of patents for certain lands taken in exchange for those required in connection with the Duck Lake School, I beg to state that the facts in this case would appear to be as follows:\n\nIn the month of May, 1894, after it had been decided to erect an Industrial School at Duck Lake, His Lordship, on behalf of La Corporation des Oblats du Nord Ouest and La Corporation Apostolique Catholique Romaine de la Saskatchewan, transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs, as a site for the proposed School, one hundred acres of Section 4, Township 44, Range 2, West of the 3rd Meridian, His Lordship agreeing to take in exchange the South West quarter of Section 4 and the South East quarter of Section 14, Township 44, Range 20, West of the 2nd Meridian. An Order in Council giving effect\n\nThe Right Honourable,\n\nSir Wilfrid Laurier,\n\nPremier and President of the Council.\n\nOttawa.\nto this arrangement was passed on the 14th January, 1895.\n\nOn the 29th September, 1896, Mr. Forget, who was then Indian Commissioner at Regina, addressed a letter to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, in which he stated that His Lordship had written to ask that in the event of the patents for the South West quarter of 4 and the South East quarter of 14, above mentioned, not having been issued, he desired to have substituted for the quarter-section last named the North East quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 25, West of the 2nd Meridian. Mr. Forget, in his letter, strongly recommended His Lordship's request to the favourable consideration of the Department, as the quarter-section asked for was of equal value to the one which His Lordship wished to surrender. The former being available, an Order in Council was passed on the 23rd February, 1897, substituting the same for the South East quarter of Section 14, and the latter has since been acquired as a homestead by one Charles Thompson.\n\nIn the face of these facts, I am inclined to think that His Lordship must be under a misapprehension with regard to the matter, when he states that the Department should have been held to the terms of the Order in Council of the 14th January, 1895, as these terms were subsequently changed at his own\nown request. However, I may add that patents for the South West quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 30, and the North East quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 25, West of the 2nd Meridian, were issued on the 31st ultimo, and His Lordship has been advised accordingly, and as the South East quarter of Section 14 has been disposed of to Mr. Thompson as a homestead, I am afraid that the matter cannot very well be reopened. It is possible also that Bishop Pascal may have overlooked the amendment which was made to the original arrangement by the Order in Council of February, 1897, and that he may now consider the present settlement as satisfactory.\n\nEnclosure: I beg to return His Lordship's letter herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Minister\n\nof the Interior.\n\nae.\nExchange of Lands for Duck Lake School.\n\nI have seen Mr. Rothwell and Mr. Goodeve of the Interior Department today in relation to this matter.\n\nThe Vicar Apostolic is under a wrong impression with regard to the lands to be conveyed to La Corporation Des Oblats Du Nord-Ouest and La Corporation Episcopale Romaine de Saskatchewan. The lands are as described in my Memorandum of 8th July, 1899. As shown by the letter of the Indian Commissioner dated 29th September, 1899, the North-east quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 25 West was substituted at the request of the Vicar Apostolic for the South-east quarter 14-44-20 W.\n\nI understand from Mr. Goodeve that patents are in course of preparation for the lands mentioned in my memorandum and that they will be issued in accordance with the Department of Justice's opinion of 22nd November last and that this Department may be expected to be advised accordingly in a few days.\n\nLaw Clerk.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th November last, No. 119695, I beg to inform you that patents are now in course of preparation for the South West quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 20 West of the 2nd Meridian, in the name of \"Les R\u00e9verends Peres Oblats de Marie Immaculee des Territoires du Nord Ouest;\" and for the North East quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 25 West of the 2nd Meridian, in the name of \"La Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de la Saskatchewan.\"\n\nIn this connection I would ask you to be good enough to let me have a copy of the Certificate of Title which passed to the Department of Indian Affairs title to the land given up by His Lordship Bishop Pascal. This copy is required merely for purposes of record in this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 5th April, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo stating that patents are now in course of preparation for the S.W.\u00bc of Section 4, Twp. 44, Range 20, West of the 2nd Meridian in the name of \"Les Reverends P\u00e8res Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e des Territoires du Nord Ouest\" and for the N.E.\u00bc of Section 4, Twp. 44, Range 25, West of the 2nd Meridian in the name of \"La Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de la Saskatchewan\".\n\nIn compliance with the request contained in the last paragraph of your letter I beg to enclose herewith a copy of the Certificate of Title of the land given up by His Lordship Bishop Pascal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

He also requested me to ask that an exchange of 5 acres of Mission lands be made for 5 acres of Government lands.\n\nWhen the stables and barns were burnt last fall the Principal did not rebuild on the same site as it was too near the main building and on that account had been condemned by the Provincial Health Inspector. Instead of doing so, he built at a considerable distance from the school and on lands belonging to the mission. Five acres of this land upon which the stables are built, he wishes to convey to the Government, and asks that the Mission be given in exchange five acres of vacant land taken from the one hundred acres on which the school buildings are located and which belongs to the Government. The Principal states that the reason for the request is that by the exchange he would escape the taxation of the stables and barns.\n\nAs there can be no reason for urgency in this matter I think it would be as well to have it further reported on by the School Inspector or the Department Surveyor, but as far as I can judge, there would be no material loss or gain to either party except the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthe escape from taxation.

Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 4th inst., No.119695/5A, relative to the application of Principal Charlebois, of the Duck Lake boarding school, for the exchange of 5 acres of Mission land for an equal area of land belonging to the Department, I have the honour to state that there is in my opinion no objection that can be raised to the exchange, but on the contrary some advantage to be gained by it.\n\nThe land asked for is in the north-east corner of the 100 acres belonging to the Department, and is not only unoccupied by buildings but is not even enclosed within the school fence. The school buildings are situated on the Department's land, but none of them are on the five acres in question. On the five acres of Mission land which is offered in exchange the newly erected stables are situated; and as the Department has contributed a large part of the cost of these buildings it seems to me desirable that the Department should own the site.\n\nThere is no appreciable difference in the value of the two pieces of land. The Principal's object in endeavouring to arrange the exchange is, I believe, in order to avoid taxation on the value of the stable buildings and the live stock and farming equipment that may be located in connection with them; and as all these are used in the government service it seems right for this reason also that they should be situated on government land and be exempt from taxation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 3, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to previous correspondence regarding the suggestion made by the Principal of the Duck Lake Boarding School that five acres on the north-west quarter of Section 33, Township 43, Range 2, West of the 3rd Meridian, belonging to the Mission, on which the barns and stables are erected, should be exchanged for five acres on the south-west quarter of Section 4, Township 44, Range 2, West of the 3rd Meridian, the property of the Government, I beg to say that the Department will agree to this exchange and the necessary conveyance may be prepared and submitted for approval and signature. The transfer from the Church to the Crown should be executed before being forwarded and, if found satisfactory, the conveyance from the Government to the Church will also be executed and returned to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Macarthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, February 25, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to matters in connection with the management of the Duck Lake Boarding School I have to ask whether pursuant to the conversations had with you while in Ottawa sometime ago His Lordship Bishop Pascal and yourself have given consideration to the question of the purchase of this property by the Church. I would remind you that the new agreement with boarding schools goes into effect on April 1st, next, and should the Church decide to take over this property and make the necessary repairs and install a water supply and plumbing system the school would be entitled to a per capita grant of $125.00 per pupil.\n\nIn connection with the water supply and drainage system I would inform you that on November 11th, last, the Department wrote to Mr. J. E. Fortin, Regina, Sask., who prepared plans for this system and advised him that they were not sufficiently definite with respect to the septic tank and that a profile drawing showing clearly the size of the tank, the fall of the drain from building to tank and the proposed system of disposal of sludge after its discharge from the tank was required before the Department could determine the feasibility of the system. Mr. Fortin was also asked for short specifications of the fixtures that it was proposed to use and the system of installing the same.\n\nRev. V. Gabillon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nDuck Lake Boarding School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nreply has been received to this letter and I would ask you to communicate at once with Mr. Fortin with a view to having this information supplied.

In answer, I must state that last December in an interview with the Honorable Mr. Oliver, I told him that the Church Bishop Panel of Prince Albert had given me full control of said Indian School and it was agreed that I would inform Mr. Duncan Scott of my intentions in regard to the purchase of the land on which the school was built. This I have done today and as soon as I get a reply we shall close the deal.\n\nIn regard to the improvements to be made to the present buildings, I have written also to Mr. Scott and await his answer.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

These are:- One Arrow's, Beardy's, Muskeg Lake and the other Reserves depending from the Duck Lake and Carlton Agencies. As we have a mission at Meadow Lake we should be given leave to recruit from this Reserve also.\n\nBefore undertaking the improvements on our school at Duck Lake I will wait your answer about these Day Schools, and your promise to give instructions to your Agents that they should warn the Indians that the Boarding School is sufficient for their needs. Otherwise it would be useless to incur such heavy expenses with the perspective that in a few years our school would have to be closed for lack of pupils.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Grondin, O.M.I.\nEdmonton, Alta. March 11th., 1911.\n\nDunca Scott, Esq.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the conversation I had with Mr. F. Oliver just before going to your office, I drew his attention to the fact that the Indians around the Boarding School here made a demand on the Department to establish Day Schools on this Reserve, as well on Batoche's, and other small Reserves. I told the Minister that if these schools were opened it was useless to try to maintain the Boarding School, as the Indians would much better like to send their children to the Day School than to the Boarding School. I expressed also my opinion based on experience at Saddle Lake and other reserves that Day Schools as a rule did not give any good results, and the Honourable gentleman answered me that he no more than myself wanted Day Schools on the above mentioned reserves. Yet last week I heard at Duck Lake that the Indian Agent was keeping the Indians under the impression that they would or could get Day Schools if they wanted them, and as an immediate result of such conduct the Indians refuse to send their children to the Boarding School where we have not just at present the full number of pupils. Will you please give instructions to your Agent at Duck Lake, that we may know before making expensive improvements on the school, that we are sure of getting pupils for the same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Grondin, O.M.I.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nI have to draw your attention to the letters herewith from the Rev. H. Grondin, O.M.I., who has charge of the Indian schools of the Oblate order. These letters refer to the situation of the Duck Lake Boarding School which was under review at the time of the conference between the delegates from the Churches and the Department. As it is desired under the new arrangement that the building should be owned either by the Church or the Government and as there is a certain joint ownership at Duck Lake, the Minister, I understand, was favorable to allowing the Church to acquire this property as it stands for the purchase of the land at $8.00 an acre, with the stipulation that they should bring the buildings up to the standard required by the Department. When Rev. Father Gabillon, the Principal of the School, was here we went very carefully into the changes that would have to be made, and he was furnished with a plan of the changes that should be carried out in the basement. The Department had also obtained a plan for certain drainage improvements to provide a proper sanitary system in the building, but the levels were not furnished by the Civil Engineer who did the work, and we therefore could decide nothing on that point.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI think the Department should still be favorable to handing over this property to the Church, but Father Grondin requires in effect a pledge from the Department that we will not open day schools on any of the reserves from which pupils are drafted to this Boarding School. The Indians of Muskeg Lake and Beardy's Reserve are anxious to have day schools on their reserves; and while I think perhaps they would not at present be very well supported, it is not consistent with Departmental policy to make a bond that no day schools will ever be established on these Reserves.\n\nChief Accountant.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\n\nSend Father Zouin a copy of this report on Duck Lake Res.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As Beardy's Reserve is contiguous to the school property, the Department will not open a day school on that Reserve. The Minister reserved that question so far as One Arrow's Reserve is concerned as for further consideration, and would not bind the Department with reference to day schools on any of the other Reserves contributory to the Duck Lake School.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, April 5th., 1911.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your three letters of March 11th, I have to inform you that it has been decided to dispose of the school property at Duck Lake to the Oblate Order on the payment of $3.00 per acre. By this purchase you will become responsible for the improvements to be carried out at the school. These improvements consist in alterations to the basement, plans of which were handed to you today, and which had been previously given to Father Gabillon, the principal of the school.\n\nAs you are aware, plans for a sanitary system of drainage &c. were prepared for this school but they are not thought to be satisfactory. These plans and copy of the specifications are being sent you under another cover. It is thought advisable that you should endeavor to find a copious supply of water as a first step and then to obtain a competent Sanitary Engineer, who could make specific recommendations with reference to the drainage system &c. &c. These plans must be approved by the Department before the work is undertaken.\n\nI beg to refer you to the papers previously furnished to His Lordship Bishop Pascal and the Rev. Father Gabillon, principal of the school, for the requirements to be met by the school in Class A. The three requirements\n\nRev. H. Grondin, O.M.I.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nwhich it would be necessary specially to provide for in the Duck Lake Boarding School are:\n\n- Pure and plentiful supply of water throughout the building.\n- A proper system of drainage, water closets etc.\n- Hospital accommodation for the isolation of pupils filled with infectious diseases or tuberculosis.\n\nOwing to the prevalence of tuberculosis at this school, it is highly desirable that the pupils so affected should be specially treated as far as dietary and accommodation.\n\nIt is understood that the Department will not open a Day School on Beardy's Reserve. As this Reserve is close to the Boarding School it is thought that the Indians should take advantage of the educational facilities offered by that school, and the Agent will be so informed. A like decision cannot at present be given in the case of One Arrow's Reserve. With reference to the other Reserves, it is not proposed to refuse the establishment of Day Schools, if the Indians should at any time desire them, or if it is thought advisable to grant the request.\n\nWould you kindly state in whom the title is to be vested in order that the necessary action may be taken to transfer the property. A cheque for $300 has been sent by Mr. [signature] for Mr. [signature].\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Department has received from Rev. Father Grondin the sum of $300.00, being the price agreed upon between it and the Oblate Order for the purchase of the land upon which the Duck Lake Boarding School is situated.

In payment therefor the Department of Indian Affairs gave two parcels of Dominion land which were handed over to that Department for the purpose by the Department of the Interior under authority of Orders in Council of 14th January, 1895, and 22nd February, 1897, the two parcels of land referred to being the southwest quarter of section 4, township 44, range 20, west of the 2nd meridian, and the northeast quarter of section 4, township 44, range 26, west of the 2nd meridian.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn the Western Provinces the Indian boarding schools are all conducted under the auspices of the different churches and nearly all are owned by the churches; any not owned by the churches are owned by the Government. A new arrangement has recently been entered into between the Department of Indian Affairs and the church authorities conducting the various boarding schools, under which the schools are to conform to a certain specified standard of excellence as regards buildings, equipment, sanitary arrangements and maintenance. On conforming to this standard the Government-owned schools will receive a per capita grant of $100 per annum, and the church-owned schools will receive a per capita grant of $125 per annum.\n\nThe Dusk Lake school is at present Government-owned, and if brought up to the standard would be entitled to the $100 grant, but if church-owned would be entitled to the $125 grant. Present conditions at that school do not, however, conform to the standard. The water supply, drainage, accommodation for the isolation of pupils afflicted with infectious diseases or tuberculosis, &c., &c., require to be improved, involving an estimated expenditure of $20,000.00.\n\nThe church authorities have agreed to assume the expense of bringing the school up to the standard in consideration of being allowed to acquire possession of the property on payment of $300 for the site, and of the receipt of the per capita grant of $125 per annum allowed to church-owned schools. This arrangement is considered most advantageous to the Department. It may here be stated that, although this school is at present Government-owned, the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church,\nunder whose auspices the school is conducted, have contributed largely towards the construction of the buildings.\n\nThe said sum of three hundred dollars has been deposited to the credit of the Receiver General on account of Casual Revenue for the purpose above referred to, by the church authorities, who request that the deed for the property be made out in favour of Les Rev\u00earends Peres Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e des Territoires du Nord Ouest.\n\nThe undersigned would recommend that authority be now given for the disposal of the said school property to the Roman Catholic Church authorities for the purpose of the said school.\n\nMinister of the Interior and Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nReversion of Duck Lake Indian Boarding School Site to R.C. Church Authorities, together with the buildings thereon.\n\nIn 1893 the Dept. of Indian Affairs decided to establish a boarding school somewhere in the vicinity of Duck Lake under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. To that end, in 1894 the authorities of the church filed with the Dept. a certificate of ownership in favour of the supt. General for legal subdivisions 4 and 5 and the W.\u00bd of legal subdivision 2 of S.4, Tp.44, R.2, W. of 3rd M., in the Dist. of Sask., being 100 acres of the R.C. Mission property at Duck Lake - which 100 acres, the church authorities valued at $300 - it being understood (though no reference was made to it in the certificate) that the land was to be used for the purposes of the school.\n\nOn 14th Jan., 1896, on representations made by the Indian Dept., an O.C. was obtained by the Mintr. of the Interior transferring to the Indian Dept. two parcels of land, namely, the S.W.\u00bc of S.4, and the S.E.\u00bc of S.14, both in Tp.44, R.20, W. and M., to exchange with the church authorities for the 100 acres above referred to. On 22nd Feb., 1897, on representations made by the Indian dept. at the request of the church authorities, an O.C.\nobtained by the Min'r of the In-\nterior substituting the H.F.2 of\nS.4, Tp.44, R.26, W.2nd N. for the\nH.F.2 of S.14 obtained by O.C. of\n14th January.\n\nUnder a new arrangement with\nthe boarding schools in the West,\ntaking effect from 1st Ap., 1911,\nthe Duck Lake Boarding School is\none of the schools which, if main-\ntained at a certain specified\nstandard, would, if church-owned,\ndraw $135 per pupil per annum, or,\nif Government-owned, would draw\n$100 per capita per annum. The\nDuck Lake school has been Gov't-\nowned so far, but the Church has\nalso contributed towards the erec-\ntion of the present buildings. In\norder to bring the buildings and\nequipment up to the specified\nstandard an expenditure of from fif-\nteen to twenty thousand dollars will\nbe necessary. The question of the\ntransfer of the school to the church\nauthorities was one of the subjects\nreferred to at the conference be-\ntween the delegates from the churches\nand the Dept. in Nov'r last. It is -\nconsidered advisable to allow the\nR. C. Church to acquire the prop-\nerty as it stands for the purchase\nof the land at $3 per acre, with the\nstipulation that they shall bring the\nbuildings and equipment up to the\nstandard required by the Dept. and\nthat they will hereafter be re-\nsponsible for all repairs and im-\nprovements, in which case - being\nchurch\nchurch-owned - the school will draw $125 per capita instead of $100.\n\nThe site when obtained by the Dept. from the Church was valued at $500 ($5 per acre) and is being returned at the same figure. The church authorities have deposited to the credit of the Receiver General the required sum of $500 in payment for the site, which includes the buildings above referred to. The church authorities request that the deed for the property be made out in favour of Les Reverends P\u00e8res Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e des Territoires du Nord-Ouest.\n\n100 pupils are allowed for at this school at $100 per capita.\n\nAs the 100 acres now being sold to the church were acquired by the Dept. of Indian Affairs by giving in payment therefor the two parcels of Dominion land obtained from the Dept. of the Interior, it is thought as well for the report to Council seeking authority to sell the said 100 acres to the church, to be signed by Mr. Oliver as Minister of the Interior and as Aupt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs, 26 April, 1911.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\nOTTAWA.\n\nApril 29, 1911.\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nI do not know how far it is necessary to sketch the history of dealings with this land, but what should be brought out prominently in the memo to Council is that the Department in the remodeling of its school policy has endeavoured to introduce a superior class of school buildings, modernly equipped from sanitation, dormitory, living and teaching standpoints, etc., and that it is because the Church is going to take over this present school and buildings and bring them up to the standard of the Department that they are being allowed to purchase the land. This, of course, is mentioned in the present memo., but the Minister thinks it should be emphasized more distinctly.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nThe Committee of the Privy Council, on the recommendation of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and for the reasons stated in his report, dated 26th April 1911, advise that authority be given for the disposal of the site, procured in 1893 for the Indian Boarding School in the vicinity of Duck Lake, in the District of Saskatchewan, N.W.T., valued at $300, consisting of one hundred acres and being composed of legal subdivisions 4 and 3 and the west half of legal subdivision 2 of Section 4 in Township 44, Range 2, West of the 3rd Meridian, in the District of Saskatchewan, to the Roman Catholic Church authorities for the purposes of an Indian Boarding School, for the said sum of $300, and that the deed for the property be made out in favour of Les Reverends Peres Oblats de Marie Immacul\u00e9e des Territoires du Nord Ouest, it being understood that the School will receive the usual per capita grant of $125 per annum allowed to church-owned schools on condition that the school conforms to the specified standard of excellence as regards buildings, equipment, sanitary arrangements and maintenance.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMemo Schools Branch\n\nWith reference to the required conveyance in pursuance of the order in council hereunder dated the 10th day of May 1911, I beg to say that these lands should be conveyed by patent in the usual way.\n\nA.S.

Deputy & Secretary.\n\nHillyard Mitchell, Esq.,\nDuck Lake,\nSask.\nMarch 12, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Rev. Principal of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, I wish to report concerning the history of this institution.\n\nIn 1894 the Department secured from the Oblate Fathers 100 acres (L.S. 3 and 4 and W. \u00bd L.S. 2 of Sec. 4, T. 44, R. 2, W. 3rd) and assisted the Church in the erection of the buildings. The institution, which opened for pupils in 1894, was placed as a government-owned boarding school. The consideration for the site was one half section of land worth roughly $600, which was deeded to the Oblate Fathers under authority of R.C. No. 345, February 22, 1897. In 1896-7 the Church authorities spent about $10,000 on buildings. At this time the Government had made a total capital expenditure of $20,775. In 1911 there was a change in status. The Church, undertaking to make replacements to buildings, received a transfer of the property - the site of 100 acres and a state equity in the buildings for a consideration of $500. The authority for this transfer was R.C. 991 dated May 10, 1911.\n\nFor 13 years the Duck Lake Indian Residential School has been church-owned and has received the per capita grant for that type of institution.\n\nThe Department is preparing to replace the old main building with a modern institution and the Rev. Principal is requesting that we purchase the outbuildings, equipment, stock and the farm of 700 acres. With reference to the outbuildings I consider the only valuable structure is the horse stable erected two years ago. The farm equipment and stock also are of considerable value. 385 acres of the farm are cultivated and are, of course, valuable.\n\nAs the Department is offering to take over capital expense and to erect a modern school, I feel that the Church should give us the outbuildings, equipment and stock. This is in harmony with the practice of Church authorities in the past. It is preferable to a fixed arrangement in the case of the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, as the Department has already borne over $21,000 capital expense. I also consider that the Church authorities should transfer the 700 acre farm at a more or less nominal price, say $10 per acre. The original 100 acre school farm has grown to a 700 acre property; but all through the years the institution was not only assisted by grants for capital expense but received per capita earnings from parliamentary appropriation.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:-\n\nNow that the contract for the Duck Lake Boarding School has been placed, it is very important that the placing of these buildings should be carefully considered. On no account should they be in close proximity to the existing buildings, which are more or less of a fire trap, and should they catch fire there would be great danger of this new and expensive building being destroyed.\n\nIn the second place, if this school is placed in close proximity to the old buildings, it will spoil the whole effect of the appearance of the new building.\n\nThese matters should be considered carefully, in my opinion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

However, as they refer in different places to certain plans which are no doubt filed in the local Registrar's office, I am not in a position to state if these references are correct, but in view of the fact that Mr. Lindsay, in his letter to the Department of Justice, states that he has had the Registrar of the Land Titles Office approve of the descriptions, it is unlikely that any errors are contained therein.\n\nIt would be impossible for the Surveys Branch to define the limits of the parcel transferred in the S.E.\u00bc Sec. 4-44-2-W.3.M., inasmuch as there are nine exceptions in the description of that particular parcel either to a plan or a Certificate of Title which has already been registered.\n\nIn order that the Department might have proper record of the parcel when it is finally conveyed, we should be supplied with copies of all plans referred to in these descriptions (blueprints will be sufficient) and also a copy of the description of that parcel transferred by Certificate of Title No. 2L.G., which is referred to as Exception 6 in the description concerning the S.E.\u00bc Section 4.\n\nChief Surveyor.\nOttawa, 25th August, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nB.5257\nRe: Purchase of land at Duck Lake from the Oblate Order.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with enclosures in the above matter.\n\nWith respect to the question as to whether the descriptions are satisfactory or not, I am enclosing a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Surveyor which speaks for itself. Perhaps your Agent would procure for us, and forward with the conveyances when completed, the blue prints of the plans referred to in the descriptions as suggested by our Chief Surveyor.\n\nWith respect to the portion vested in the National Trust Company, Ltd., I have to say that as The Oblate Fathers are undertaking to convey to us this property it will be necessary for them to take such action as may be necessary to secure the title in themselves to enable them to make the conveyance to us.\n\nIt is noted that there are two proposed conveyances from The Oblate Fathers and it appears that a third will be necessary to convey the portion now held by the National Trust Company.

M. of J.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 9th October 1924\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nWith reference to the letter hereunder from the Agent of the Department of Justice who is dealing with the transfer of certain parcels of land for the Duck Lake school, I have to make the following comment on the description supplied:\n\nIn the exception quoted under \"secondly\" in the description for transfer of the S.E.\u00bc Sec.4, Tp.44, R.2, W.3.M., it appears to me that Exception 5 duplicates a portion of Exception 1 and also duplicates the land covered by Block 1 in Exception 4. The 5th Exception, therefore, would appear to me to be more correct if it were worded \"the northerly five chains of all that part of the said quarter section lying West of the right of way referred to in Exception 1\". It would appear that Parcel F as shown on plan V3751 should also be excepted.\n\nIn Exception 9 a street is called Lewis Street as shown on said plan W; this street is shown on the plan as Louis Street. In the copy of description of certificate of title No.2 L.G., this street is referred to as Louise Street.\n\nWith reference to the area being 717 acres, I may say that in calculating this area, it was apparently overlooked that an area of 6.25 acres requires to be deducted through the N.E.\u00bc Sec.33 on account of the right of way of the railway. The most recent Tp.plans of Tps.43 & 44 show a surveyed trail from Carlton to Gabriel's Crossing, passing through N.\u00bd Sec.4-44-2-W.3.M. and also through N.\u00bd Sec.33-43-2-W.S.M. The exception of this trail is not included in the description nor has any area been deducted on account of it. If this trail has been properly surveyed and established...\nthe title to the land covered by the trail no doubt has been secured by the Province and the plan of the trail filed with the Registrar. It would therefore appear necessary to have the exception mentioned and the area involved deducted.\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nCopies of the plans hereunder might be included when returning the plans submitted by Lindsey as per last from his letter.\nOttawa, 20th October, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nB.5257\nRe: Purchase of land at Duck Lake from the Oblate Order.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in the above matter, with enclosures including a letter from your Agent Mr. James H. Lindsay, K.C., of Prince Albert, dated the 23rd September, all of which have been considered.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose a copy of a memorandum from our Chief Surveyor, Mr. Robertson, with respect to portions of the description which memorandum speaks for itself. I am returning your enclosures herewith and in addition thereto copies of township plans as referred to in the last sentence of Mr. Robertson's memorandum.\n\nThe address of the Oblate Fathers with whom your Agent can communicate in this matter is Rev. A. Massena, Oblate Fathers Provincial House, 10186 107th St., Edmonton, Alta.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nB.5267\n\nRe: Purchase of land at Duck Lake from the Oblate Order\nYour reference No. 109-1-1\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 20th with enclosures therein mentioned, for which I thank you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. D. M. of J.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nLINDSAY & HUTCHISON\n\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nNovember 24th, 1924.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\n\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Purchase of land at Duck Lake from Oblate Fathers B.5287\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo with enclosures.\n\nI have communicated with the Oblate Fathers and have been successful in obtaining a transfer of all the property being purchased by the Government, and have filed in the Land Titles Office here for registration the transfers in the name of the King.\n\nThe land being purchased comprises 717 acres less right of way of the C.N.R. through the N.E.\u00bc 33-43-2-W.3rd containing 6.25 acres. This leaves 710.75 acres to be paid for at the rate of $30.00 per acre. I shall be pleased to receive your cheque for $21,322.50 in favour of \"Les Reverends Peres Oblats de Marie Immacules des Territoires du Nord Ouest.\"\n\nThe tax receipts against the land being purchased shows that the taxes have been paid up to the end of June, 1924. I am informed that the sale of this property was completed on July 2nd, 1924, and I am requesting tax certificates from the respective municipal authorities showing the land clear as at that date. You\nI might confirm the date of the purchase.\n\nI have carefully read over the memorandum of the chief surveyor No. 109-1-1 dated 9th October, 1924, and beg to make the following observations thereon:\n\nThe Chief Surveyor is correct when he states that exception 5 does duplicate a portion of exception 1, with the result that exception 5 in the transfer of that land has been amended to read as follows:- The northerly five chains throughout of the said quarter section, except right of way in exception 1 hereof.\n\nException 5 does also duplicate the lands covered by Block 1 in exception 4, but Block 1 is not part of Plan V3731 and if exception 5 was not made to read as it has been done, then the transfer would require to refer to Plan V1123 in which is Block 1.\n\nYour Surveyor's method of reading the 5th exception would have been correct if the land in Plan V1123 had been described.\n\nParcel F in Plan V3731 is excepted in exception 4. This is a street. So far as the street called Lewis Street is concerned, this street should be called Louis Street, and it can be called by this name in all future references. You will notice that I have deducted the 6.25 acres from the total area referred to by the Chief Surveyor.\n\nThe Township plan referred to by you as the most recent is dated 1913, and a search at the Land Titles Office discloses that the public road referred to in the Chief Surveyor's memorandum was abandoned on May 22nd, 1911 and notice of abandonment was registered on 25th May, 1911 as instrument No. 4789. This trail is not excepted in the\nLand Titles Office so that it is not necessary to mention it.\n\nAs soon as the Certificates of Title issue in the name of the Crown, the same will be forwarded to you together with relative documents, and the cheque to the vendors, will not, of course, be issued by me until the duplicate certificates of Title in favour of the Crown are received.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"JAMES H.

Purchase of land at Duck Lake from Oblate Fathers.\nYour ref. B. 5257.\n\nI have the honour to report that I have now completed the registration of the Titles from the Oblate Fathers in favour of the Crown to the property purchased from them, in accordance with your instructions to me of July 8th, 1924.\n\nI now enclose you the following documents:\n\n1. Duplicate Certificate of Title No. 231 L.T., comprising land in the N.E. of 33 and fractional S.E. and N.E. 32-43-2-W. 3rd.\n\n2. Duplicate Certificate of Title No. 232 L.T., covering land in legal subdivisions 3 and 4, in Sec. 4-44-2-W. 3rd and the S.E. 4-44-2-W. 3rd.\n\n3. Tax Certificate from the Town of Duck Lake, for the land in the Town of Duck Lake, showing the taxes have been paid to date of purchase by the Crown.\nThe taxes on the other land purchased by the Crown are payable to the Rural Municipality of Duck Lake and I have been furnished with a receipt showing that the taxes have been paid for a fraction of the year. I have requested the Oblate Fathers to obtain a rebate for the period from the date the Crown purchased the land, and the Clerk of the Municipality will thereafter furnish me with a tax certificate showing that the land is clear of taxes for the year 1924.\n\nI have, in accordance with your letter of October 24th last, retained all the blue prints in connection with this matter.\n\nThe Chief Surveyor approved of the acreage with the exception of an area of 6.25 which fell to be deducted for a roadway through the N.E.-33-43-2-W.3rd.\n\nOn examining the Titles that have issued I find that from legal subdivisions 3 and 4 of Section 4-44-2-W.3 there is an exception of 2.73 acres, see Title No. 232 L.T. marked 'firstly', taken for a road from the 80 acres therein described, sold to the Government. This 2.73 acres does not appear to have been deducted from the 717 acres nor is this roadway shown on the blue print sent to me, but it may be that the Crown intend to pay for this roadway. This being the case, then there should be deducted from the 717 acres purchased, 6.28 acres, which in the former titles was shown as 6.25 acres, plus 2.73 acres taken\nfor a roadway. If the above acreage of 9.01 acres is deducted from the 717 acres, it leaves 707.99 acres to be paid for at the rate of $30.00 per acre, making the purchase price $21,239.70 instead of $21,322.50, the sum previously requisitioned for.\n\nWould you please send forward this cheque in favour of the vendors as early as possible.\n\nI enclose herewith my account in triplicate for services rendered herein.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHL/MJ\nENCLS.

The property was owned by the Oblate Order and when funds for the building activity were provided in this year's Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education, Vote No. 286, negotiations relative to the acquisition of the farm used for school purposes were commenced.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Form 37 listing thereon new sewing machines required for manual training at St. Michaels Indian Residential School, Duck Lake, Sask.\n\nI have discussed the acquisition of new machines with Rev. Father G.M. Latour, Principal, and enclosed please find a report regarding condition of machines now in use from the District Manager, Singer Sewing Machine Co., which is self explanatory.\n\nI recommend that the expenditure be approved and that all old machines being replaced by a new machine be turned over to this office for distribution amongst Indian homes in Duck Lake Agency or wherever you may decide where the used machines should be allotted.\n\nP.J.

(RG 10, Volume 6306, file 652-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter and requisition received from Indian Agent N.J. McLeod in connection with the need for new sewing machines at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School. Also enclosed is copy of a letter from Mr. A.M. Warren, District Manager of the Singer Sewing Machine Company, to Reverend Father Latour, giving his opinion of the present condition of the sewing machines now in use at the school.\n\nWhile I agree that we have some sewing machines now in use of such an age that they should be replaced, I do not agree that they should all be replaced at once. It will be noted that two of the machines are forty-three years old, and one is thirty-nine years old. Four of them are twenty-three years old, one twenty-four years old, and one twenty-six years old. The age of the remaining four is not known.\n\nIn his enthusiasm to promote sales on behalf of his company Mr. Warren would suggest discarding all of the sewing machines to be replaced by new ones. This does not seem reasonable to me. If two Singer sewing machines have been in operation for forty-three years why should not the four which are twenty-three years old be expected to give some more service?\n\nI would recommend that six new machines be purchased for the Duck Lake School, three of which would replace the three very old machines, and the other three to replace three of those in the poorest condition.\n\nPlease note the remarks in the last paragraph of Indian Agent McLeod's letter that all of the old sewing machines being replaced by new ones be distributed to Indians. While this may seem a wise move they will be old machines difficult to keep in repair, and the Indians may have reason to complain if given a machine which is broken and cannot be repaired. If the Department decides to purchase the six machines which I have recommended, and distribute the old machines to Indians, I shall enquire further into the distribution of old machines on my next visit to the Duck Lake Agency if so instructed.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Esq.,  \nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,  \n304 Post Office Building,  \nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Duck Lake Indian Residential School\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Form #37, listing materials required to erect an addition to the garage and workshop at the rear of the above named school.\n\nThe addition is required to allow sufficient space for mechanical training wherein a farm tractor can be accommodated during the winter months and instruction given to young Indian boys in regards to care, repairing and operation. The addition will also permit space for instruction in carpentry, plumbing and heating, also shoe repairing.\n\nI believe this type of training is necessary, especially in view of the farming Indians now becoming equipped with power farming machines. While the addition is not large it will permit of sufficient space for the purpose required and in this manner will permit instructors to give practical demonstrations in care and operation of farm tractors, trucks and all farming equipment now in use and it is also intended to provide facilities for instruction to adult Indians during the winter months.\n\nThe Principal of the Duck Lake School is prepared to furnish all labour costs in excess of the amount shown, $225.00, this sum is estimated to cover costs of wages for the services of a competent bricklayer only, the remainder of the work can be completed by his employees.\n\nI personally believe this type of training is necessary and will result in our young Indian boys leaving residential school with a working knowledge of care and maintenance of power farming equipment and I recommend that the expenditure be approved.\n\n....../2\nYour letter dated May 2nd, file 1165-109/6-1-652 sets out that the sum of $5800.00 has been approved for expenditure at the Duck Lake School. The expenditures have been discussed with the Principal and approved as follows:\n\nElectric Washer $1235.00\nManual Training building addition $2525.00\nTools, equipment for manual training $2042.00\n\n$5800.00\n\nWhen the addition has been completed a requisition for necessary tools and equipment will be submitted.\n\nN.J. McLeod\nSuperintendent\nDuck Lake Indian Agency\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nPlease refer to my letter of the 9th instant, File\n2142/109/6-1-652, regarding expenditures for the current fiscal\nyear at the Duck Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nEnclosed herewith is copy of a letter from Indian\nSuperintendent N.J. McLeod, of the Duck Lake Agency, and a requisition\nshowing an amount of $2,523.00, being material and labour required\nto construct an addition to the garage and work shop at the rear of\nthe school, the same to be used for mechanical training of the\nIndian boys.\n\nI have discussed the matter of the addition with the\nReverend Principal and Indian Superintendent McLeod, and, certainly\nthe addition is needed. However, in submitting the copy of the\nletter and requisition as received, I am doing so in order that\nthey may be given consideration, and not with any hope that authority\nwill be immediately given to proceed with the expenditure as outlined.\n\nI would recommend that the Departmental Purchasing Agent\nsecure prices for the material, and that the material be purchased\nin that manner.\n\nWith regard to the labour, it will not be necessary to get\nprices on the labour as there is only one bricklayer available in\nthat locality, and he works at union rates. It will be noted that\nmost of the labour will be performed by the school staff.\n\nJ.P.B.

When these are received, we approve an expenditure of $225.00 for employing a bricklayer.\n\nIt is noted that there is only one bricklayer available in the locality of the school.

You should make arrangements with the nearest representative of the Dominion Department of Agriculture to do this work. If you do not know this official, you should communicate with Dr. Thos. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask., and he will, no doubt, assist you in securing the services of the official mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. Delmas, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nCopy of this letter sent to Dr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr R. A. Hoey;\n\nIt is with pleasure that I am forwarding to you a sample of goat-cream butter made here at Duck Lake Indian School.\n\nHowever, I must state that it was not made in a churn. This was tried with the result that after an hour's churning there was no change whatever in the cream. With an egg-beater the butter is made in twenty minutes. So we are inclined to think that the brisk movement is necessary in the making of this butter.\n\nThis week nine gallons of milk were passed through the separator giving us two quarts of cream out of which two pounds, two ounces of butter were obtained.\n\nTrusting that the above information may be of some value to you,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. G.M. Latour O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 29, 1944.\n\nDear Father Latour:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 26, in which you intimate that you have sent forward a sample of goat cream butter.\n\nThis butter, or what was at one time butter, reached this office a day or so ago. You can imagine the condition of the parcel, however, when I tell you that the temperature here was 31 when it arrived. It would appear that the can in which it was packed leaked somewhat, with the result that the post office people or express people were compelled to change the wrappings. However, a certain amount of the liquid did reach me. It was certainly a mistake to send forward a parcel such as this at this particular season of the year.\n\nLet me assure you, however, that your thoughtfulness and courtesy in remembering me in this way is very much appreciated. I was more than delighted to learn that you had a herd of goats at the school. I am looking forward anxiously to Mr. Morris' report, in which he will no doubt deal fully with the success you have had in the management of this particular herd.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend George Latour, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nThe goats at this school are doing very nicely. They are milked regularly and the milk is used in the school. The Sister in charge of the dairy has successfully made butter from the milk and a sample and instructions are being sent to Ottawa for inspection. Father Latour has distributed ten (10) young female goats to Indians on the Beardy's Reserve. He visits this Reserve regularly and will give the goats constant supervision.\n\nNote: Father Latour requested that, if possible, a pure bred Saanen male be sent to him from Spanish. Mr. Roberts - kindly endeavour to obtain one for the Duck Lake School. Note: The understanding with Father Primeau is that all male goats of the Saanen herd at Spanish will be made available for our service at a cost of $20.00 each, crated f.o.b. Spanish. I have already asked that a Saanen male be sent to the Grouard and Blue Quills Schools. When these shipments are being made another one could be included for Duck Lake.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare Division\nOttawa, July 8th, 1944.\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, ALTA.\n\nRequests have recently been received for two Red Male Steer Cows for the Duck Lake and Blue Quills Schools, and I would appreciate hearing from you regarding the possibility of obtaining two suitable animals somewhere in B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Raddy, Esq., Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ontario.\n\nRequests have been received from a few of the Agencies in Saskatchewan and Alberta for Male Simian Goats, and I would appreciate hearing from you as to whether you will have any animals this year which would be suitable for shipment.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Roy,\nDept. Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, July 10, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nThe remarks in your Duck Lake report regarding male goats for the Duck Lake and Blue Quills schools have been noted, but we are advised there are no male goats available at Spanish this year; in fact, it appears the goats there were not bred this year due to Brother Grubb being short of help and unable to devote sufficient time to the goats. However, we have written Mr. Ruddy at Golden Lake, requesting that none of the male goats there be castrated until it is known definitely whether or not some of these may be required for the above schools or any other locations in the West. Would you drop me a line regarding your views as to whether or not the Golden Lake goats would be satisfactory.\n\nI have also written Inspector Schmidt asking him to make enquiries in British Columbia with a view to obtaining pure bred males for Duck Lake and Blue Quills. I might also state that Mr. Schmidt was instructed some time ago to purchase a male Saanen in British Columbia for Grouard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. E. Morris,\nc/o S. H. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBALCARRES,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRegarding the sending of male goats to the Grouard, Blue Quill and Duck Lake schools as recommended in my reports I wish to make it clear that I never intended that young goats be sent. I do feel that good animals six months old could be sent without any difficulty. These three schools are very interested in the raising of goats to be distributed to needy T.B. Indians and we will have to encourage the project by helping to obtain breeding stock.\n\nI investigated the possibility of obtaining Saanen male goats at Edmonton, Calgary and at any other place where I thought goats could be obtained. This question was very thoroughly discussed with Inspector Schmidt and all the agents I have visited to date and in every case they state that there are no good breeding goats to be had. Mr. Schmidt stated regarding the purchase of goats in British Columbia that there are only a limited number available at a very high price and that in his opinion there has been a great deal of inbreeding already. He was of the opinion that if goats are to make a success of in the Agencies in the West good breeding stock will have to come from Ontario.\n\nI would therefore suggest that Father Primeau be asked to hold a number of good male goats until I return to Ottawa. I will provide him with shipping instructions so that the animals can be shipped, stopping over certain points where the Farm Instructors can feed water and exercise them, so that they will reach their destination without hardship.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) J. E. Morris.\nAcknowledging your letter of July 10th, I would recommend that young male goats be retained at Golden Lake for delivery to the above-mentioned schools some time this fall.\n\nIt is regretted that the pure bred herd at Spanish was not bred last year. If Brother Grubb is unable to devote sufficient time to look after this herd of goats it might be well to consider moving them to some other place. I might inform you that many of the Agents are very interested in the securing of goats to supply milk to Indians, and as there are very few pure bred herds in the West it will most likely be necessary to obtain goats in Ontario. It is therefore important that the herd at Spanish be bred this year and goats available for delivery next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.E. Morris.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nREPORT ON DUCK LAKE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nLivestock:\n\nEight head of cattle died during the month and four head of horses. Cause of death of cattle, 1 cow drowned in water hole, 4-2 year old heifers died calving, three died by Blackfly Malady. Two horses died of old age, two mares died at time of foaling. Season calf crop reported as satisfactory increase. Large number of cows being milked and cream shipped to creameries. To-date we have had no report on Tuberculosis test of cattle on Beardy's Reserve conducted by Health of Animals Branch, Department of Agriculture during month of April. Dr. A.B. Gibson, Veterinary, who conducted this test states there were no losses and reasons for delay in submitting his report is due to his time being devoted to a serious malady affecting large herds of cattle in the Prince Albert District during the month caused by infections from Black Flies, approximately 100 head of cattle died in the area surrounding Prince Albert, Sask. during the month from this Malady. Losses on the reserves in this Agency from the same malady totals 3 head only.\n\nOn May 18, 1944 Dr. A.B. Gibson, of the Health of Animals Division, Department of Agriculture, tested the Duck Lake Indian School herd for Bangs Disease, 65 head tested. Eleven proved Positive, twenty-two proved Questionable and the remaining thirty-two were negative. On June 23rd a six weeks retest of all Questionable and Negative animals was due. To-date we have no report on this retest, which was conducted by Dr. Gibson on June 23rd.\n\nN.J. McLeod,\nAct. Indian Agent.\nREPORT ON DUCK LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, 1944.\n\nLivestock:\n\nNo losses of Indian owned cattle reported. Department Ball Knock Hill Grafter #222215, Roan Shorthorn, age 6 years died on John Smith's Reserve. Full report on cause of death will be forwarded under separate cover. Large number of cows are being milked and butter making for home use. Also cream being shipped to Creameries. Serum Test report of blood samples taken from the Duck Lake Indian School herd by Dr. A.B. Gibson, Health of Animals Division, on July 1, 1944 for Bangs Disease. Of the 54 head tested the report showed as follows: 13 animals proved positive, 13 proved questionable and the remaining 28 were negative. A further retest is to be conducted by Dr. Gibson in 30 days. In the meantime positive and questionable animals are kept separate from remainder of herd pending this retest.\n\nN.J. McLeod,\nAct. Indian Agent.\nOttawa, July 10, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nThe remarks in your Duck Lake report regarding male goats for the Duck Lake and Blue Quills schools have been noted, but we are advised there are no male goats available at Spanish this year; in fact, it appears the goats there were not bred this year due to Brother Grubb being short of help and unable to devote sufficient time to the goats.

Would you drop me a line regarding your views as to whether or not the Golden Lake goats would be satisfactory.\n\nI have also written Inspector Schmidt asking him to make enquiries in British Columbia with a view to obtaining pure bred males for Duck Lake and Blue Quills. I might also state that Mr. Schmidt was instructed some time ago to purchase a male Seanan in British Columbia for Grouard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. E. Morris,\nc/o S. H. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBALCARRES,\nSaskatchewan.\nMr. P. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, MANITOBA.\n\nRE: GOATS.\n\nYou are authorized to buy sixteen female goats at fourteen dollars each ($14.00) and six male goats at ten dollars ($10.00) each from the Rev. Mr. Jones; payment to be made out of the Welfare Vote. You are also authorized to purchase two female goats and one male goat from Father Rivard at twenty-five dollars for the three animals.\n\nThis herd is to be established at Norway House; the milk to be used for tubercular patients and the children of families who are unable to provide milk.\n\nThere has been considerable inbreeding in this herd; therefore, you are requested to separate the males at the earliest possible date. Probably you can arrange to pasture them on another island until they are distributed. The male goat purchased from Father Rivard should be used with this herd.\n\nOne male goat has already been sent to Island Lake. The others should be disposed of as follows:\n\nOne to Father Trudeau to establish a herd at Cross Lake.\n\nOne to Indian Agent Lovell at The Pas.\n(Note: It is suggested that this goat be sent there by aeroplane when Dr. Yule next visits Norway House.)\n\nTwo good billies should be selected -\n\nOne to be sent to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Saskatchewan.\nOne to the Blue Quill School in Alberta.\n\nIt is suggested that you write to Father George Letour, Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, and Father L.C. Letour, St. Paul, Alberta, asking them to provide you with the proper shipping instructions.\n\n- Over -\nI understand they will not bring goats out on the \"Kensura\" until after the tourist season is over; therefore these two goats most likely will be shipped the later part of September or the first of October. In my opinion, it might be wise to send these goats via Prince Albert; the one for Duck Lake could be transported from there by truck, the one for the Blue Quill School could be placed off at a station on the main line to Edmonton. If this is done the goats will be delivered in the shortest possible time.\n\n(Sgd) J. E. Morris,\nWelfare and Training Division.\nOttawa, August 25, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nFurther to my letter of July 10th, regarding the shortage of male goats at Spanish, a letter has now been received from Father Prineau in which he states they expect to have more kids than was originally anticipated.\n\nI quote hereunder from Father Prineau's letter:\n\n\"Following up your letter of March 30th (File 84-13) in reply to my letter of the 24th to Mr. Morris, I am pleased to say that we expect to have more kids than we thought there would be at that time. There are already five that have arrived, four billies and one nanny. There will be a good number of others I hope, as more of the nannies were bred than Brother Grubb had thought. I shall let you know later this month as to the number of kids we expect to be able to provide this season.\"\n\nAm passing this information on as it has just occurred to me you may wish to alter the instructions you recently gave to Mr. Lasenby regarding the shipping of billies to Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

No doubt, these goats will be very beneficial to the Indians concerned by providing milk which is necessary for a proper balanced diet.\n\nI wish to inform you that Father Prinsau of the Spanish Indian Residential School has been requested to hold for delivery to you next Spring a Pure Bred Sennan Male. It is thought at that time the animal will be old enough to make the trip to your school without any hardship, and would be available next Fall for breeding purposes.\n\nAgain may I express our appreciation for the interest you are taking in the raising and distribution of goats.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

H. Touchet,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\n\nDear Doctor Touchet:\n\nHenry Peeteetuce, aged 8 years, was reviewed here yesterday. The father gave a rather unusual story. The boy developed severe head ache on June 6th, which lasted three days. This headache was very severe causing the boy to cry. During the same time he vomited immediately after eating. They also noticed at this time that he had convergence of the eyes. The headache has gradually improved and the vomiting has ceased. The eyes are still converged. The boy is very irritable.\n\nPhysical examination and X-ray revealed no change in the chest over that reported to you on May 27th. Examination of the eyes showed the left eye to be converging inwards and had much poorer sight than the right. Examination of the fundi showed the most extensive choked discs we have ever seen. Examination of the other cranial nerves showed no paresis. The knee jerks were absent or very difficult to elicit on both sides. The Babinski test was markedly positive on both sides. Lateral film of the skull showed separation of the frontal suture. Spinal puncture was not done.\n\nIn view of the history, the ocular paresis, the choked discs, the positive Babinski and separation of the frontal suture indicating increased intracranial pressure, we think there is some intracranial involvement. As the boy is tuberculous, this most probably is a tuberculoma. If so, nothing much in the way of treatment can be done. Although, in some centers operative work is attempted but I do not believe with very good results.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned: C.H.

In this he has been unsuccessful, but feels confident that while parents are opposed to sending their children to an Industrial Institution they entertain a better feeling toward the Boarding school, and he alleges among other reasons the following for encouraging that feeling:\n\n1st. That the school is equal, if not superior to any Industrial school for children under 12 years.\n\n2nd. Because the Principal is second to none as an educator of Indian youth.\n\n3rd. Because more attention can be given to the pupils when there are only a few instead of the large\n\nThe Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nlarge number found at an Industrial School.\n\n4th.

I was at File Hills on the 9th and 10th, Jan., and since that date I have made careful enquiries, and I find that the Indians at File Hills are content and I have not heard of any complaints. But I find that Chief Piapot is anxious that his Indians, Muskowpetung and Pasquas Indians should combine together against the Agent, and to have their dances and anything they want. In fact I am informed by a man who has lived amongst these Indians for some years that there is a feeling of great unrest amongst them, and that they have been holding meetings, but what was decided upon I cannot find out. In my opinion a good strong patrol should be sent out from Regina every month, and go through Piapot and Muskowpetung reserves, this can do no harm and might do much good.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n(Sg) J.

I had the matter inquired into at the time, but could not find any foundation for the report. I instructed the Officer Commanding, \"District\" to have S/S Pyffe inquire into the matter, and I beg to forward a copy of his report. Pie-a-pot has just served a term in the goal here, for resisting the Police in the execution of their duty, and I have no doubt he is a mischief maker as he always has been.

The Post Office address is Qui Appell Assa.\n\n**Religion**\nIt is a Presbyterian School conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church authorities, but more especially under the control of the W. F. M. S. of that Church.\n\n**Land**\nThe Land in connection with the school consists of the North half of Sec. 32, Township 22, Range 11, West of the 2nd Meridian, and also all that part of Sec. 33, in the same Township which is outside the boundaries of the Okanese Indian Reserve, the whole comprising about 200 acres of land or less.\n\n**Title to Land**\nOn the 4th August, 1888, the Indian Commis at Regina forwarded to the Dept an application from Mr. R. Newbury, School Teacher on Little Black Bear Reserve, File Hills Agency, asking on account of the Presbyterian Church for a grant of land in connection with a Boarding School which that Church proposed to erect. The portion of land which Mr. Jones requested to be set aside for Boarding School purposes comprised the fractional part of Sec. 33, Township 6.\nTitle to Land (continued)\n\nTownship 22, Range II West of the\n2nd Meridian containing 100 acres.\nAlso the N.E. quarter of Sec 32, Township\n22, Range II W. containing 160 acres.\n\nThe Commrs recommended that the\nabove mentioned land be set aside\nto the Church Authorities providing\nthat a Right of Way between the Agency\nand the Reserve adjacent (viz.: Peabody\nand O'Kane) as well as between the\nAgency and the N.W./4 Sec 32 above\nmentioned be secured to the Dept.\nThis was referred to the Dept. of\nthe Interior for a report as to what\nDepartment's interest in the land in\nquestion and in reply Mr. Douglas\nthe Asst. Secy of the Dept. reported that\nthere was no objection to transferring\nthe N.E./4 of Sec. 32 to the Presbytian\nChurch Authorities as this portion was\nalready reserved for the purposes of the\nIndian Dept. With respect to the\nfractional part of Sec 33 however, Mr.\nDouglas reported that this land was\nincluded in the Land Belt of the\nGreat North West Central Railway Co.\nand formed part of the grant to\nthat Company.\n\nAnd further in regard to this portion\nof Sec 33 the Indian Commrs reported\nthat \"the school house, as well as the\nAgency stables had already been built\non that portion;\" and that a house for\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTitle to Land (continued)\n\nthe destructor was then in the course of construction on the aforesaid portion and also that this portion of land in question was adjacent to the nearest water supply. For these reasons he therefore recommended that this land be at possible transferred to the Indian Department, and that the use thereof portion as may be necessary for Boarding School purposes be gratuitously to the Presbyterian Church authorities so long as they continue to occupy it for school or mission purposes.\n\nThese facts were brought to the notice of the Dept. of Interior and the Assistant Deputy Minister of that Dept. in reply stated that the Minister of Interior had recommended to Council that the North half of Sec. 32, Township 22, Range 11 West of the 2nd Meridian and also that part of Sec. 33 in the same Township which is outside of the boundaries of the Okanese Indian Reserve be vested in the Dept. General of Indian Affairs for purposes connected with the Indians of the said Reserve, including the purpose of the Boarding School, for the benefit of Indian Children.\n\nThis was confirmed by Order in Council Dated March 26th 87.\n\nBuildings\n\nThe buildings in connection with the Boarding School include the following viz.\nBuildings (Continued)\n\nViz., the Home which is built of stone with mansard roof, 30 x 30 ft sq., the walls being 20 ft high & 18 inches thick. It consists of three floors.\n\nThe 1st contains the kitchen, dining room, hall and cellar.\n\nThe 2nd floor contains bedrooms, parlor and school room.\n\nThe 3rd floor contains two dormitories, one for boys and one for girls.\n\nThe School Room situated about 15 yards to the West of the Home is a frame building on a stone foundation, 34 ft long and 16 ft wide with a porch in front which is used as a wash room. There is also a log building used as a play room by the pupils, an ice house, driving house and stables.\n\nAccommodation, Heating\n\nThere is ample accommodation for twenty pupils. The buildings are heated by stoves. There is an abundant supply of water convenient.\n\nCost of Buildings\n\nThe Mission Home building was built in 1888 at a cost of $15,500 of which amount the Department paid the sum of $13,500. The balance of the cost of the buildings was paid by the Presbyterian Church authorities. The total amount contributed & paid by the Dept.\nCost of Buildings (cont.)\n\nTowards the erection of the buildings for Boarding School purposes at the File Hills was $450.00.\n\nThis amount was promised Prof. Start of Winnipeg by the Dept. of Indian Affairs by telegram in August 1888.\n\nBy reference to a memo. of Mr. VanKempen, then Deputy Minister it seems that a grant of only $400.00 was voted in the Supplementary Estimates for 1888-89 but for some reason which does not appear on the file the sum of $450.00 was paid.\n\nA Cheque was issued in favor of Rev. A. Robson representing the Wesley Church authorities for the amount of $450.00.\n\nDuring the year 1897 the Wesley Church authorities asked that the Dept. pay the cost of enlarging and improving the condition of the School Room at the File Hills Boarding School.\n\nThe Indian Act estimated that the cost of such improvements would be $240.00 and submitted plans showing the proposed changes which he required to have made.\n\nThe Dept. authorized the expenditure of the $240.00 for the purpose of making the proposed improvements to the Act.\n\nwas notified to that effect.\nCost of Buildings (cont'd)\n\nThe cost however exceeded the amount promised by the sum of $35.00 which the Dept also paid. This made a total of $75.00 paid by the Dept for the necessary improvements to the Boarding School at Hillville.\n\nHistory of School\n\nThis school was first opened as a Boarding School during the month of March 1889 with the Rev. Alex Campbell as Principal and an enrollment of eight pupils. Previous to that time and since the beginning of the Deer quarry in 1884, it was conducted as a Day School.

A really first class man is what is wanted and good care will have to be taken to see that the right man is obtained. The eehel conditions here are different to other schools, the Principal being a lady, and if farming is to be carried a feature of the training, care must be taken in making the appointment.\n\nA married man is what is wanted, in my opinion, and I think if the Church could select a good Ontario couple it would be wise. It is useless advertising for such help in this country as it is almost impossible to get the right kind.

The Department is of opinion that a married man should be engaged and it might be possible for the Church authorities to obtain the services of an experienced Ontario farmer who would be willing to take up this work. I would ask you to give this matter immediate attention in order that an appointment may be made before the spring farming operations commence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I shall write immediately to Dr. Farquharson advising him of your request which I think is extremely important. That school now ought to be put in all respects in a condition of efficiency corresponding with the splendid building you have given it.

(RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter above quoted and in reply would say that Miss Cunningham did not even apply for leave of absence but simply told me she was going and that she had been told by the Church that she could go. The school was not left in the best of hands, but what could I do when business is done in this way.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspr. of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott;\n\nI think we have discovered a suitable farmer for File Hills. His name is James Montgomery, and he is from Camilla, Ont., in the neighborhood of Orangeville; has a farm of his own; a married man with no children of his own, but an adopted boy who is about eight years of age. His age is 41, and he seems to be a man of good health, and is of medium size. I have made enquiries from those who know him, and all speak of him as a man whose influence in the neighborhood has always been good, and a farmer who has always kept his farm in good condition; buildings and everything being in good repair. I would judge from his appearance and the reports that I have received that he belongs to one of those families we sometimes find in a neighborhood that stand out somewhat from the average, and who are always called upon to do any special work that needs to be done. This man's father was of that type, and he seems to have inherited his father's temperament. He is the Superintendent of the Sunday School, and has been the Secretary and Treasurer of some organization out amongst the farmers. That type of man that we can usually build upon to do his best.\n\nHe came in to see me, and I got one or two others to meet him all of whom were favorably impressed. I was also interested in noticing the carefulness with which he sought to know everything about the situation before deciding. His wife has been a teacher for some years, and should occasion arise perhaps might be of service in filling a vacancy until a successor was secured. He goes West with the hope of making himself of sufficient value to the Government to merit promotion some day. That is a laudable attitude for any man taking up such a situation. He will sell his farm here, and has been perplexed as to whether or not he should take with him his furniture. If sold by auction, it would probably be sacrificed. I have written to Miss Cunningham asking whether or not it would be better in her judgment to take furniture with him and thus to furnish his own house.\n\nI had a letter from Dr. Farquharson of the 9th January, in which is the following sentence from Miss Cunningham;\n\"It seems the Department is resolved to appoint a married man; building a house for him, and give him a salary of $600 per year, to be taken out of the per capita allowance.\" Do we understand that the house is to be taken out of the per capita allowance, as well as the increased salary? One would like to have a definite understanding upon these points.\n\nMy expectation is that Mr. Montgomery will make the farm more than pay its way, assuming that there will be no frosts or hail-storms, against which no man can protect himself. As soon as I hear from you, and if Mr. Scott's appointment is approved, I shall inform him. He would like to begin at once to dispose of his property, in order to get there with the opening of the spring. I feel hopeful that we have found the man that is wanted.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM-ES.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He was here only two weeks before he decided that he would not remain in the position. I am very much disappointed at the decision of Mr. Montgomery but not surprised.\n\nThe Principal is away at present for three weeks holidays. I do not know whether this leave was taken with your authority. I have had no advice on the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that I am informed indirectly that there is to be a change in the Principalship of the File Hills Boarding school in about three months' time and I take this opportunity of advising the Department that unless a thoroughly competent man is appointed to the position, the school, which is capable of accommodating sixty pupils, will never be more than half filled.\n\nAt one time this school was one of the best managed institutions in the country. I speak of the time when it was under the management of Miss Gillespie. The pupils who were turned out had a thorough training in all lines of farm work, and when they returned to the reserves the result of this training was soon evident. At that time conditions under which children were obtained were far more difficult than they are today.\n\nI regret very much that I cannot give you a good report on this school. It has fallen away very much, in fact, it is far from what it should be. For the last two months there has been no Farming Instructor, and the man who was sent up from Toronto was not a success. He had no discipline or authority and besides, was sickly and complained about the hours, although the position is an easy one to fill from a work standpoint.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThere has been practically no recruiting done for the last year, and two years ago the prospects for keeping up a school of this size were excellent.\n\nI might have complained strongly about the conditions here months ago, but did not as I knew there was to be a change of Principals. Then again Miss Cunningham is not strong and I know she has been doing her best, and to write and find fault with her would have done no good.\n\nMy object in writing this letter is to give the Department ample time to locate a thoroughly competent principal for this position, one who is capable of managing the outside work and above all one who will look after the recruiting, as competition is keen and unless this work is well looked after the school will not be a success.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, July 26, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nPresumably a change in the Principalship of the File Hills Boarding School will take place in the near future. As a result of the closing of the Regina Industrial greater accommodation of the most modern type has been provided at the File Hills School and as there is a good farm in connection with it the work of the institution should be productive of the best results, provided a competent staff is engaged.\n\nIt is hoped, therefore, that your Society will be able to nominate for approval a Principal thoroughly competent to supervise the work in all its branches. He should have the support of an efficient staff, particularly in the Matron's and Farming Instructor's departments. The work of the last mentioned official is of prime importance, as it is the desire of the Department to have the boys who attend the school given a thorough course in practical farming.\n\nIt is the earnest desire of the Department to see this school rank among the best of its kind in the West and with the appointment of an energetic and efficient staff there is no reason why this wish should not be realized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Cunningham, the Principal of the same\nschool, has notified me that she will surrender her office\nand enter her connection with the school Oct. 4th next.\nWe have been in correspondence with the Rev. Mr. Eadie of\nOttawa to see if he would become Principal. So far he\nhas given no definite answer. He was recommended\nvery highly for Regina Industrial School.\n\nMiss Cunningham desires to have her work all\naudited on her leaving and has asked me to perform\nthis duty. Both I understand from what I have heard\nannually in various schools that this work falls to the\nlot of the Inspector of Agencies and Schools. In that\nevent Miss Cunningham's books should be audited by\nRev. W. Graham Inspector for Smith Lake Settlement\nand if this arrangement is correct I think it only just to Miss\nCunningham that her request be complied with. I have\nreceived no instructions as Superintendent to examine the books\nfrom four schools and moreover I do not wish in any way\nto conflict with the work many officials of the Department.\nUnless I receive notification to the contrary I shall assume\nthat Rev.

I think Mr. McLaren is labouring under an entirely wrong impression as your telegram to me puts the matter in an entirely different light.\n\nWhen the matter of auditing these books was first spoken of the Principal told me that she had been informed by Mr. McLaren that he did not think it was his duty to audit them, as his books had always been audited by a Government Inspector. I then told her that I would make an audit of the books before she left. On Friday last when I was over at the school the Principal told me that she had received a letter from Mr. McLaren, from which the following is an extract, \"I got word from Ottawa that they expect me to make an audit of the books.\" This of course was a surprise to me and I wired you for instructions, and I take from your telegram that there has been no change in the Department's policy with regard to my duties in this matter, but I do think, as I said before.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nthat Mr. McLaren is labouring under a wrong impression in respect to his duties as far as the Government is concerned.\n\nNow that the Church have appointed a school Superintendent I think it would save a great deal of trouble in the future if my duties with regard to Boarding schools, and particularly in the case of the File Hills school, were clearly defined, for as you know, there are matters coming up constantly between the Indians and the school, which require immediate action, and I am called upon to give advice. If this is interfered with by Church officials, who have nothing to do with the Indians on reserves, you will readily see where serious complications might arise. I should not like to be placed in the position of giving instructions and having them interfered with by such officers.\n\nI may say further that I was informed yesterday by the Principal that Mr. McLaren is expected here on Saturday to make an audit he claims he has been instructed to make, and in view of this I think it will be better for me to defer my inspection, as I have no desire to clash with Mr. McLaren.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 3, 1911.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in further reference to the audit of the books of the Pine Hills Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that when the Department wrote Mr. McLaren on the 16th ultimo it had in view a special audit which appeared to be necessary from the standpoint of the Church before a new Principal was installed. As the Inspector within whose jurisdiction this school is situated it is your duty when making your official inspections to make an audit of the books and report upon the finances.\n\nThe appointment of Rev. Mr. McLaren as Superintendent of Presbyterian Indian Schools in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta does not in any way affect your status as the official inspector of the Department. Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, has held a like position respecting Methodist schools for a number of years and in no case has there been any confliction of duties. Mr. McLaren can hardly think that his appointment will in any way affect the relation of our inspector to the schools, but if that fact at any time becomes plain his impression can be corrected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq., Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the resignation of Miss Cunningham, Principal of the File Hills Boarding School, took effect on the 1st October. She left the institution on the 4th inst. At that time no successor had arrived and I had heard nothing of a new appointment.

First, Miss Cunningham has resigned the principalship of the Pine Hills School, and Rev. H. G. Sweet, has been appointed as her successor in the principalship. Mr. Sweet is a minister of our own Church. He is a graduate in Arts of Manitoba University, and I believe has taught himself. His wife holds a first-class certificate as teacher from the Province of Manitoba, and has a reputation of being a splendid teacher. I am not certain yet whether she will be engaged in such services as to receive payment from our Committee or not, but in any case she will be there and will take an interest in the whole work of the school-room, as well as of the Boarding-Department of the School.\n\nSecond, Miss Armstrong has resigned her position as teacher of the Moose Mountain Indian School, the one known as White Bear, by your Department. I am sorry that we have not as yet got a permanent teacher for the school; but Miss Cory, the daughter of your agent for these reserves, has kindly undertaken to conduct the school until a permanent teacher is appointed. Miss Cory substituted for Miss Armstrong during her furlough last summer and did I believe, excellent work. I trust that I will be able to report to you the appointment of a permanent teacher for this school before long.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lately the Department has had communications bearing on kindred subjects from Rev. Mr. McLaren. It is unsatisfactory to have to deal with more than one body in matters of this kind and I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether it is your wish that correspondence on these subjects shall be conducted as in the past through your office.

Sir,\n\nA complaint has been made to the Department with regard to the working of the sewerage system in connection with the File Hills Boarding School and from a report received it would appear that the trouble is that the staff is not sufficient to properly look after the work.\n\nIt is understood that the new Principal, Rev. Mr. Sweet, has asked the Church authorities to provide him with the services of an extra man who would look after the plumbing and heating and work of that kind which cannot be attended to by either the Principal or the Farming Instructor whose time now is fully occupied. In a school of this kind it is necessary that there should be a competent man to look after work of the kind above referred to and I would ask that you take the necessary steps to make the provision asked for by the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. F. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that there has been no Farming Instructor at the File Hills Boarding school for the last two months and from what I can gather from Mr. Sweet, the Principal, there is no telling when one is likely to be appointed. I understand the Church authorities expect Mr. Sweet to pay the salary out of proceeds of products sold from farm. It is utterly absurd to expect this as the farm at the school is a very small one, some forty acres, and this is run down. The school can consume everything that is produced on it. All this has been pointed out to the Church authorities by Mr. Sweet, I understand, but so far nothing has been done.\n\nThe Department will remember my bringing up the question of appointing a third man for this school and the promise from the Church authorities that something would be done in this matter. I would point out that nothing has been done as yet. The Principal is alone at this large school and something should be done at once, as the Church is not keeping their part of the Contract.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nSir,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Your obedient servant,\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of February 20th last, in reference to the appointment to the staff of the Pine Hills Boarding School of a man who would look after the plumbing and heating and work of that kind.\n\nThe Department is now informed that there has been no farming instructor at this school for the last two months. Mr. Graham, Inspector of Indian Agencies, states that he understands that the Church authorities expect Mr. Sweet to pay the salary of a farming instructor from the proceeds of the products raised upon the farm. To do this is impossible as there are at present only some forty acres cultivated and even this land is said to be run down.\n\nAt the present time the Principal is alone at this large school and it is not possible for him to properly look after the interests of the institution. Steps should be taken immediately to appoint a farming instructor and also the other help above referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. F.

The services of a farmer are also urgently needed, if the school is to attain the success expected of it. Mr Sweet is now the only man about the place. As he is neither a farmer nor a mechanic, he cannot be expected to perform the duties pertaining to these positions.\n\nIn conclusion I beg to refer you to the terms of the contract for the maintenance and management of this school. Section 9 calls for, among other things, the instruction of the male pupils in gardening, farming and the care of stock, or such other industries as are suitable to their local requirements; and Section 12, provides that the Management shall keep and maintain the school buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRev.

I have seen Dr. Farquharson this morning and he tells me that he thinks there is at present a satisfactory farmer connected with the school. At any rate that is but one of the things that need to be done.\n\nThe Western Committee is sending a deputation to investigate the whole situation, which has not been satisfactory of late. Mr. MacLaren's marriage to one of the Indian pupils has embarrassed very much the problem and radical changes are necessary to save the situation. We have been in correspondence about it and Dr. Baird and some other member of the Committee are to visit it this week with a view to some radical action. We are greatly disappointed because we regarded Mr. MacLaren as our most competent man. He has unquestionable ability and is interested in the Indian work. My fear is that it will be necessary to dispense with his services entirely.\nMr. Pedley-2-\n\nSept. 19, 1912.\n\nI might add that by action of the Assembly, the Indian work is now placed in the care of the Home Mission Committee, of which Dr. A.

I presume I shall be for a little while during the transition period in touch with it until they get acquainted with the situation.

MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nI regret to report a sad drowning accident which occurred at the Pine Hills Boarding School on Friday, Nov. 1st. About five o'clock in the afternoon three little boys, from 7 to 10 years of age, were playing on the bank of the lake close to the building. One of them, Archie Feather, 7 years old, had a hand sleigh and was running on the thin ice quite close to the shore, and from what I can gather he was pushed out on the ice by the other boys. The ice being quite thin, in fact too thin to be safe at any point, the sleigh and lad went through. The alarm was at once given and it was only from six to ten minutes before the lad was taken out of the water and every effort made to revive life, but without effect. I at once reported the matter to the Coroner who decided it was not necessary to hold an inquest.\n\nThe parents of the child feel very keenly about the matter and think there was gross carelessness on the part of those in charge of the school in allowing children of this age entrusted to their care to play near a lake, especially when the ice is just forming. The Principal tells me he warned the children in the morning and again at noon not to go on the ice.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI would point out that warning children of this age is of very little avail unless there is someone having direct supervision over them, our of doors as well as when they are indoors.\n\nI wish once more to bring to the Department's notice the fact that there is no Instructor or outside men at this Institution and that the children are not getting the supervision or training they should get. This is the third time I have brought this matter to your notice and I trust the Church can be induced to attend to it at once. It seems to me too bad that after such a large outlay of money as was spent on this building that the Department does not insist on its being properly managed.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Agencies.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, November 11th, 1913.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General -\n\nI bring to your attention Mr. Inspector Graham's letter of the 4th instant.\n\nTo my mind this is a case in which it is pretty clear that negligence has resulted in loss of life.\n\nWe have drawn the attention of the Presbyterian Authorities to the insufficient staff of the File Hills Boarding School but evidently without result. I think we should let them see that the Department is determined to have the management comply with the terms of the contract, and I would, therefore, advise that the Presbyterian Authorities be told that we cannot continue to pay the grant for the File Hills Boarding School unless there is a proper staff and necessary supervision.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA.

Sir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention the substance of a recent communication received from Mr. W. M. Graham, Inspector of the South Saskatchewan Inspectorate, in which he reports to this Department the sad death by drowning on Nov. 1st of Archie Feather, seven years of age, a pupil of the File Hills Boarding School. In company with two other pupils, 7 to 10 years of age, this boy was playing on the thin ice of the lake near the shore and close to the school building. He was on a hand signal and it seems he was pushed out from the shore by another boy on to very thin ice and went through. The alarm was at once given and although it was only six to ten minutes before the lad was taken out of the water, and efforts made to revive life, he succumbed.\n\nThe parents of the boy feel very keenly about the matter and think there was gross carelessness on the part of those in charge of the school in allowing children of that age, entrusted to their care, to play in so dangerous a place.\n\nThe Department is of the opinion that this is a case in which it is clear that negligence has resulted in loss of life. It would appear that the trouble at the school is that the present staff is not sufficient to look after the work and exercise proper care over the pupils. The attention of the Presbyterian Church Authorities has repeatedly been called to the need of a larger staff at this school.

For this the school is not responsible. Our representative there, Mr. Sweet, sent us a bill of $155 for a nurse whom it was necessary for them to engage to assist the staff during the epidemic. I know that, in the Indian Department, provision is made for medicine and medical attendance and nursing, and my judgment is that the Government ought to become responsible for this item of expense.

I saw him first on Oct. 28th suffering with measles and during his illness he developed tuberculosis and has had several hemorrhages from the lungs and is in a very weak condition; he has also a chillula in arms and mastoiditis, which all require good nursing. This boy's parents want to take him home where he will not have a nurse to look after him; in other words to die from want of care and the proper diet. It is only a matter of time until he will die; the boy would have to be carried out on a stretcher. I would like to know the government or the department wishes in such cases. It looks to me cruel to let the parents take the boy away. On the other hand children are sent away from the schools if they have incurable disease, but in a case like the above it would look inhuman even the parents.\nparents want him.\n\nThe principal has been worrying me over the phone to know if I will let him go; they do not feel that they are able to stand expenses of a nurse so long.\n\nPlease write me soon what actions I am to take in this case and also what I am to do in future with such cases.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nW.Hall M.M.\nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.,\n20th December, 1912.\n\nGlen Campbell, Esq.,\nChief Inspector Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFollowing my letter of a few days ago re. Douglas Bear in the File Hills School, Mr. Graham called me up over the phone and said that the father and mother of the boy was bothering him every day about taking the child home, and that he wished that I would give my consent to allow him to go. I told him that I thought it was a piece of barbarism to allow the boy to go, but that he could do as he liked, so the boy was removed.\n\nPlease give me instructions how I am to act in future cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Hall M.D.\nSir,\n\nPlease find herewith enclose two letters from Dr. Hall of Fort Qu'Appelle referring to the case of a sick boy who has been under his charge medically.

The doctor's correspondence would tend to show that this boy should not have been discharged from the school unless proper provision was made for his care in his home and the Department would like to have a report from you in the matter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn some time your honorable Government at Ottawa has taken exception to the management of persons on the staff of the File Hills School and to the consequent condition of discipline in the school. Let me now state that the buildings have been put in the best possible condition and the grounds are made clean and neat. The children are well fed, clothed, housed and cared for; illness and proper food teaching in things intellectual, moral and religious. We can promise also that as many farm animals of all kinds as can be kept will be cared for at the school and with the opening spring the best known teacher will give his assistance to carry on a more progressive scheme of education than in the past.\n\nWe have now a capable and full staff:\n\n1.

[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a communication I received from Rev. H. C. Sweet, Principal of the Fife Hills school.\n\nI think the Department should increase the number of pupils allowed for this school. The building has a capacity for 60 or 65 pupils and instead of putting a restriction on the number to be admitted every encouragement should be given to the Principal to increase the number. This would be in accordance with your last circular on the subject of getting children for the school.\n\nUp to now nothing much has been done in the way of farming at this school, but now that the staff is complete and we have the promise that good work will be done on the farm next year I think it would not be right to restrict the recruiting; besides it would not be fair to the Presbyterians to allow children of school age to stay out of school when there is accommodation waiting for them.\n\nThe Estimates of last year provided for 40, an increase of five over the previous year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will be good enough to advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the above date and number stating that you had received through Chief Inspector Campbell two communications from Dr. Hall, in which he states that Douglas Bear was granted his discharge from the school by me notwithstanding that he was in such a state of health that he required careful nursing. Your letter states further that the Doctor's correspondence tends to show that this boy should not have been discharged from school unless proper provision was made for him in his home, and that the Department would like a report from me on the matter as soon as possible.\n\nI am sorry you have not favored me with copies of the Doctor's letters so that I would be in a better position to reply to any statements that he has made regarding this particular case.\n\nIf Dr. Hall has led you to believe that this pupil was discharged from the school without his full consent all I can say is that he is telling you a deliberate untruth.\n\nThe circumstances of the case are as follows:\n\nDouglas Bear was ill, more or less, since early Spring. On Oct. 3rd last Dr. Hart of Indian Head was at the Agency looking after a private patient and I had him go up to the school to examine the boy (at that time Dr. Hall had not been attending the school). Dr. Hart stated it was a case of Tuberculosis.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTuberculosis When the boy got worse Dr. Hall was called in and made four trips to the school between Oct. 12th and Nov. 19th, during which time and in fact up to Dec. 11th, there was a trained nurse in charge who reported the case to the Doctor every day or so over the phone.\n\nI may say that from the beginning, but more particularly from the time Dr. Hall took charge of the case the parents who are fairly intelligent, especially the father, insisted on having the boy at home and the Doctor was informed of this. They claimed from the beginning that nothing could be done for the boy, and as time went on they would come to my office and make demands for the boy to be released from the school claiming that instead of helping him the Doctor was doing him harm. I did everything in my power to reason with the parents, telling them that White men understood the disease and that everything possible was being done for the boy. This had absolutely no effect and they would leave my office weeping; it was quite pathetic. As the case developed the parents became all the more persistent to have the boy home. Four or five times a week they would come to my back door to see me an hour or so before I was up and I was forced to explain the same thing over and over again. Finally matters got so bad that the parents threatened to go and take the boy out of school whether I wanted it or not. I may say that at intervals all through this difficulty I would call up the Doctor and explain what was going on. I ventured to suggest that as there was no hope for the boy, would it not be as well to let the poor people have him at home.\nThe Doctor would invariably answer me by saying that he would leave the matter to me. Of course I could not accept the responsibility and told him he was the Doctor and it rested entirely with him. He would follow this up by saying that if the boy was discharged by me he would back up the action, which of course I would not do, and so the matter went on. Later the school people took up the matter with the Doctor and he would tell them to see me. I would talk to the Doctor with the same result; he was willing to discharge the boy but wanted me to take the responsibility.\n\nAbout a week or ten days before the boy was finally discharged the Nurse came over to my office to say that she had just had a conversation with Dr. Hall on the subject of sending the boy home, and he advised her to come to see me and that he would be agreeable to anything the Principal and myself decided to do. I told the Nurse I would not consent to the boy going out without the Doctor's authority. She could not understand this and finally wound up by saying\u2014asking who would find fault if I did not. The next thing I heard was that the Doctor informed the nurse that he had referred the matter to Ottawa. Why this was done I am unable to understand. All the time this wrangling was going on the unfortunate parents were around imploring to have their boy home and the boy himself expressed a dying wish that he be allowed to go to his parents and die at home. Three days before he died phoned to the Doctor again and said I thought the boy should be allowed to go home as he had not long to live. To my surprise he consented and the boy was taken home and died. I never want to go through another experience of this kind. I think the Doctor showed\nshowed a lack of good judgment in keeping the boy in spite of the strong opposition of the parents. I think too that he should have known long before he did that it was a hopeless case and that he was injuring the cause of the school by insisting on holding the boy. I am positive there is no law that would uphold such a high-handed action. Every year dozens of such cases arise in the Indians schools and the medical officers allow the children to return home; some recover for the time being, and others succumb.\n\nThe position I occupied through the whole affair was most undesirable. I could not and would not take the responsibility of discharging the boy in the face of the doctor's indefinite answers, and yet I felt he was exceeding his authority in holding the boy so he did. I never heard of a doctor, in my experience with Indians, acting as he has done in this case. The parents of the boy complained bitterly to me about his manner and threats he made to them when speaking to him about their boy.\n\nMy reason for being so particular about having the doctor's orders and making him take the responsibility was that I knew Dr. Hall well and expected he would act as he has done. If half the reports I hear are true he does a great deal of talking about what he is going to do and I come in for a good share of his abuse. Knowing this I tried to take every precaution so as not to leave myself open, but apparently I have failed, and I think it would be in the interests of the Department, if they have the slightest doubt as to the veracity of my statements, to have this case further enquired into. I am not satisfied and do not wish the matter to rest here as I consider Dr. Hall a dangerous man, which is proven by the fact of his sending just the sort of report I was so particularly to guard against.\nI would ask what my powers are with regard to retaining Indian children in schools when they are afflicted affected like this. Even if there were a law to hold them in school, how many parents would stand treatment of this kind?\n\nThe medical work here is highly unsatisfactory and I trust the matter will soon be adjusted. I have dealt with this in another letter.\n\nI may say that Dr. Hall is away at present on leave, or I should have called him up and demanded an explanation from him.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of January 15th dealing with the boy, Douglas Bear, who was discharged from the File Hills Boarding School; if any case similar to this arises in the future you may immediately advise the Department by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nMar. 8th, 1913.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of December the 26th, re the bill of $155 for salary of nurse who was employed by your representative when the epidemic of measles was on at the File Hills School, I beg leave to state again that I consider that this is a liability of the Department, although you quote section 2, part II, in which you say that you are only responsible for medicines. How does it come that you are paying the full salary constantly of a nurse at the Brandon School in the Methodist Church? Now, I consider that this is an obligation of the Government, and that this bill ought to be paid. I have ordered it to be paid in the meantime, as the nurse has been out of her salary, but I am going to insist that it is a legitimate charge, inasmuch as your Agent ordered the nurse, and I consider you are responsible for the payment of the same. Hoping that you will give this matter your prompt attention, and expecting to receive a cheque for the amount,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nGen. Supt. of Pres. Home Missions.\nOttawa, March 12, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in further reference to the account for the salary of a nurse engaged at the File Hills Boarding School during the epidemic of measles last fall.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that further inquiries are being made in regard to this matter and you will be again communicated with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Andrew S. Grant,\nGen. Supt. of Presbyterian Home Missions,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, March 12, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn December last, Rev. A. S. Grant, General Superintendent of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, wrote to the Department in connection with the payment of a bill of $155.00 for the nurse whom it was necessary to engage to assist the staff during the epidemic of measles.\n\nOrdinarily under the contract the church authorities would be responsible for the expenditure incurred, but the Rev. Mr. Grant in a letter just received states that as the Agent ordered the nurse he considers the Department responsible for the payment of the sum. If such instructions were given the Department is prepared to consider the payment of the account, as the circumstances were exceptional. Therefore, if there is any obligation on the part of the Department you may submit certified voucher in favour of the Presbyterian Church. If the payment is made the Department would like to have it done out of the current years appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H.

McKay, who was employed there last fall proved to be unfitted for the position. Previous to his engagement he is reported to have forged several documents. He was arrested and brought to trial and is now serving a term in penitentiary. The Church authorities should lose no time in replacing this man; in fact, he should have been replaced long ago.

I have let two boys go there but in stead they let those boys herd sheep or cattle every day without giving them...\na chance to go to school. It appears they only go to school once or twice a day, but more or less they are absent from the school.\n\nClark, therefore, I am asking you right along to have a school in my reserve. I have been working for lost three years to try to get a boarding school in our reserve, but I am trying to without success. We are reserve and try our best all the time to try having school.\nBut some way or other we cannot get no satisfaction answer from him. We understand by sending those children to school it only to go to school not to have those boys herding sheep or cattle.\n\nIf you think that your Indians would learn school I may say you better hope God kind school on our reserve at present time the those children are treated in\nIn those schools there is no way to thing that those children will learn a lot to make them know. With it I always insist started there is always school every week and they should go to school every day not only 2 or 3 days.\n\nThat's all for this time.

The School have repeatedly made this claim, and have given me as one of the reasons for their large arrears in maintenance the fact that the Government owed them this money. I am going to make them, in the light of your statement, produce the facts.\n\nAm sorry to give you this trouble, but it is very necessary that this matter should be cleared up, as the Board here are feeling very much displeased, and must not remain in this unsettled state.\n\nI will communicate with you again when I receive a reply from File Hills.\n\nI expect to be in St. Andrew's, Ottawa, for December\n7th, and I will call and see you, if convenient, in regard to the situation at Kamsack and Round Lake.

Grant,\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nAvonhurst, Sask., 13th Nov., 1913.\n\nRev. Dr. Grant,\n\nToronto.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,-\n\nMay I call the attention of yourself and Committee to the needs of these Indian reserves- (Pasqua Muscowpetung and Piapot). At present there is no school on or near these reserves and no Protestant Church building. The Presbyterian Church has had an interest here since about 1886- or 7-. When a boarding school was opened and a Mission established also a church building erected. Under Rev. W. S. Moore, an Indian congregation was organized- the membership reached something over forty,- over one hundred Indians were baptized, quite a number of these adults. When the Regina industrial school opened in 1891- forty pupils were drafted from the school here (known as the Lakesend school), Mr. Moore left soon after to take up work elsewhere. Whether it was thought that the Regina school would be sufficient to serve the needs of the reserves or not I cannot say, but for some reason the Lakesend school was closed. After Mr. Moore left there were long intervals - often of several years- when there was no Protestant missionary and no Protestant service of any kind. One or two men gave service for brief periods. When the writer took charge\nthere had been no service for about 3 years, that is no regular missionary. We found the church building had been destroyed by a prairie fire. Services are conducted now in houses and tepees.\n\nThe Indians are asking for a school to be centrally located to serve these three reserves. They have been insisting on this for several years. At one time it was thought that the File Hills boarding school would serve these reserves, i.e., the Protestant Indians, but the parents protest that it is too far away and in the past two years we have only been able to get 3 children from these reserves to File Hills school. There are now about 30 children of school age. The Indians are holding these in hope of a school, which they claim has lately been promised them by Govt. officials. Now it seems that if we are to make any permanent stand here we must have control of the children. Pagans, R. Catholic as well as the Protestant Indians are most friendly and would send their children to their home school. If we do not get these 30 children (and there are many more will be of school age in a short time), most of them will be drafted into the nearest school\u2014the R.C. school at Lebret.\n\nNo doubt if a school is voted\u2014and the Indians state that it has been promised them\u2014the Dom. Govt. will erect and equip the building, but likely some\nChurch will have control. It is evident that if the controlling Church is not ours we might as well abandon these reserves.\n\nA school might be opened this winter say after New Years by making use of the old agency buildings on the Muscowpetung reserve\u2014some repairs would be necessary\u2014but a small outlay, say, $500.00, would make the buildings serviceable for the winter\u2014in this way we could hold these children until a permanent building be erected.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. B. Heron.\nDec., 15, 1913.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nDr. Grant called on me the other day and left with me a letter from Mr. H.B. Heron, a copy of which is enclosed herewith. Will you kindly read it and favour me with your opinion on the question of establishing a day school for the Indians in question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th inst., enclosing a copy of one received by Dr. Grant from Mr. R. B. Heron, the Presbyterian Missionary who lives near Pasqua Reserve.\n\nI am of the opinion that it would be a decided mistake for the Government or the Presbyterian Church to start a Day school for Piapot, Muscowpetung and Pasqua reserves. The Department have made ample provision for all the children on the Qu'Appelle Agency (both Catholics and Protestants) in the two Government schools at Qu'Appelle and File Hills. The latter was recently built with the idea of taking care of the children of the File Hills and Qu'Appelle Agencies. At the present time there are twelve children from the Qu'Appelle Agency attending this school, five of whom have been admitted since Regina school was closed, and there is room for thirty more pupils in the building. One reason why the children from Qu'Appelle Agency are not attending school\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nin\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nin greater numbers is that they claim Mr. Campbell told them they would get a Day school and as a result of this alleged promise they have been holding back their children from both File Hills and Qu'Appelle schools, and I have had complaints about this from the Principals of both of these institutions. Another reason, so far as the File Hills School is concerned, is that recruiting has been very indifferently carried on. Mr. Heron was appointed Missionary on the West Reserves and I understand one of his duties was to assist in recruiting for the File Hills School. He has done practically nothing in this regard. His sympathies are, and always have been for a school on the West reserves and he has been talking to the Indians on these lines ever since he went there, and they use this as an argument for not sending their children here.\n\nMr. Heron's suggestions are impractically. It would be impossible to have a Day school that would serve more than one reserve, although, from his letter, you would think it quite feasible. He says a school might be temporarily started in the old Agency buildings. These are situated ten miles from the Indians on Piapot reserve, seven or eight miles from the settlement on Pasqua's and four miles from the settlement.\nsettlement on Muscowpetung reserve.\n\nAs I said before there is ample provision for all the children and I would suggest that if the Department does not intend to start a Day school at Qu'Appelle Agency, that Mr. Heron be so informed through Dr. Grant, and also that he be advised not to keep agitating for a school that is not at all necessary, as such a course tends to work against the recruiting of the two schools now in existence.\n\nI may add that the Grand Trunk Pacific railway, which now passes along the South Boundary of the reserves of the Qu'Appelle Agency makes it quite convenient for the Indians to bring their children to File Hills as it is only about one and a half hours' run to Balcarres. I think some means should be taken to force the parents, who are holding back their children, to send them to school. There would be no evil consequences if the act were put into force. There is ample room in both schools for all.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspr. of Indian Agencies.\nJanuary 15, 1914.\n\nDear Dr. Grant -\n\nReferring to my conversation when last in Ottawa and the communication addressed to you by Mr. Herron which you left with me, I have looked carefully into this matter and it appears that at some time an official of the Department stated to these Indians that a day school should be established but it is utterly impracticable to have a day school that would serve the three reserves. There is ample room in the Pile Hills Boarding School and the Qu'Appelle Industrial School for the Protestant and Catholic children of school age and as both these schools are readily accessible the Department cannot consider the erection of a residential school. So far as the Presbyterians on these reserves are concerned I would point out that Balcarres is only one and a half hours run from the Qu'Appelle Agency by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway which now passes along the south boundary of the Reserve.\n\nI should esteem it a favour if you could advise\n\nDr. A.

We are not anxious any more than the Government to multiply these centres, and are perfectly satisfied with your decision. I will notify Mr. Herron, and also Principal Sweet, and tell them to look into this matter further.\n\nThanking you for your decision,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nJanuary 16th, 1914.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nIt has been represented to the Department that the Indians of Piapot, Masopotamia and Pasqua's Reserves are not sending their children to the residential schools at Qu'Appelle or File Hills, as they are anticipating that the Department will erect a school for themselves. I wish to correct this impression as it is considered that the schools above mentioned afford ample accommodation for all the children of school age and are both readily accessible.\n\nYou will be good enough to take the first opportunity of conferring with these Indians with a view to obtaining recruits and report results to the Department. Presumably they will be disposed to send their children to these schools when the attitude of the Department regarding the establishment of a boarding school is explained. If necessary the regulations will be enforced but the Department does not desire to take this line of action until other methods fail. When reporting be good enough to state the number of children of school age on the Reserves at present, and whether they are Protestants or Pagans.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. Michel, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdgeley, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI referred this whole correspondence about the Qu'Appelle Reserve, and your decision not to build the school there, to the Principal at File Hills, and he assures me that he will do all in his power in recruiting to secure children from these Reserves for the School. He thinks that, if the final statement went out from you that no school would be built, that would help the situation very much. The Indians on these reserves evidently have made up their minds, and repeatedly say that they have been promised a school. A letter from you would decide that matter. It seems to me that, when the Government goes to the expense of building Boarding Schools and maintaining them, some pressure should be brought to bear upon Indian parents to insist on their giving a liberal education to their children, as it is by this means that we are to solve the problem of the Indian on the Plain relating to our civilization.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAndrew S.

The nurse should look after the sanitation of the school, the health of the children, the dietary and the manner in which food is prepared. She should instruct the children in matters affecting personal health and the older girls and boys in first aid in cases of emergency. There would be a very wide field for her usefulness if she takes matters up in the right way. When she has had a term of service at File Hills she may move on to one of the other schools.

At the same time I think it would be a very good move to send some of the children that have not yet reached the day school limit as to age to the File Hills Boarding School as it would have a good effect on the others. The principal writes me that he can take 6 or 8 new pupils into the school.\n\nSgd. Thos. Cory,\nIndian Agent,\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing you in regard to a matter that has come up in my work here, as Class-\nroom teacher in the Tile Mills Indian Boarding\nSchool, and I trust that you will kindly\nhonor my request and reply to my letter\nat an early date possible.\n\nA new Agent has been appointed on these\nReserves and as he has two children of school\nage, he wishes to send them into my Class-\nroom along with the Indian children - so there\nis no Public school close to the Agency and\nthe Boarding School is quite near. He also\nwishes me to take the children for the whole day,\none child is in the 4th Grade. The other is a toddler.\n\nAs you are possibly aware, the Indian\nchildren are in the Classroom only the half\nday, and I have them divided up as follows:\nIn the morning I have the Primer class -\nas many as eleven children - also classes\nin Grades I., II., III. and IV.\n\nIn the afternoon I have classes in\nGrade I., II., III. and IV.\n\nIn the morning I have an attendance of\n37, 39 or 40 children.\nThere are 63 children on the roll and I have 40 desks in the room.\n\nThe size of class-room is 31\u00bd ft. x 24\u00bd ft. x 12\u00bd ft.\n\nWhat I wish to know is this \u2014 In an Indian School such as this is \u2014 am I supposed to admit and teach white children? and would I be compelled to give them the whole day system as in a public school?\n\nIf I did admit them it would necessarily mean a change of my whole working system with the Indian children \u2014 extra work for the teacher and while I desire above all other things to be fair and do my duty well toward everyone concerned, I am wondering if it would be a fair deal to the Indian children for whom the class-room is built or for the white children who would have to be confined in the same room with the Indian children during class hours.\n\nThen on the other hand I am hired and paid not by the Government \u2014 but by the Woman's Auxiliary Society of the Presbyterian Church and the Agent is a Government Official \u2014 I should think his children would be under the Public School system.\n\nThe clerk at the Agency has also a family with one or two of school age and if I admit the one family the others will expect to attend also. We are supposed to have new Indian children coming in all the time and this may mean a constant change of the system of work in the class-room \u2014 not only for myself \u2014 but for the children.\nOther teachers who shall follow me in this work, I would be grateful if you would advise me as to what the Government wish a teacher to do in regard to this matter.\n\nI try to do my duty toward every child, white or brown, as faithfully as possible.\n\nI trust you will judge the matter fairly and let me know what you advise.\n\nAm writing to the women's missionary society regarding their wishes in the matter too.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRose C. MacKenzie,\nTeacher Class-room\nLittle Hills Indian Bldg. School\nBelcarra, B.C.\nMay 26, 1920.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in reference to the attendance of children of the employees of the Department in the class room of the File Hills Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I would state that while the Department would be pleased if these children could be accommodated without disadvantage to the Indian children in attendance at the school, there is no obligation on the part of the school authorities to admit them. In any event I would not ask you to make any change in the regulations governing your management of the class-room work, which, I have no doubt, now is planned to the best advantage possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Rose C. Mackenzie,\nTeacher,\nFile Hills Boarding School,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI thought you might be interested to see how well the pupils of the File Hills School are progressing. The following is a copy of a letter I receive yesterday from Mr. Gibson, the Principal,-\n\n\"At the Balcarres School Fair held October 1st, our children carried off 33 First and 17 Second prizes a total of 50 prizes.\n\nAgain at the Central Fair, competing with all Public schools in the Balcarres Inspectorate, we secured 22 First and 8 Second prizes, a total of 30 prizes.\n\nI hope to have a list of the names of the children who won prizes ready to send you in a few days.\"\n\nI was pleased to hear this.

I had a conversation with Commissioner Graham a few weeks ago, and he suggested at that time that it might be necessary to secure a new principal in the near future. He intimated that he might be in a position to suggest a suitable man. I am writing him today.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/LM.\nExtract from \"THE PRESBYTERIAN WITNESS\" September 8, 1921.\n\nFILE HILLS BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nA correspondent sends an interesting item with reference to work being done at the File Hills Indian Mission. Children from the Boarding School won fifty prizes at the Balcarres local school fair in competition with the Public School; also thirty prizes at the central school fair, competing with all the schools in the Balcarres Inspectorate. The School also won a shield to be held for a year\u2014given to the school winning the largest number of prizes. This is surely a splendid record.\nOttawa. September 27, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI beg to draw your attention to your letter of May 18th, last, regarding the suggestion of Mr. Commissioner Graham that it might be necessary to secure the services of a new principal for the Pine Hills Boarding School and that you were writing him in the matter.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that a communication has been received which, as far as we are able to decipher, is signed P. Rhodes as principal. If a new principal has been secured to replace Mr. W. W.

I note that there is plenty of accommodation for more pupils at the school, and I have to inform you that the pupilage will be increased from 80 to 90 as from the last instant.

Please inform the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF. L. Deacon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\"Adjacent to the agency, but just outside the reserve, the Presbyterian Mission Board, with a grant from the Department, have, at a cost of $1,550, built a stone boarding school, thirty feet square and three stories high, capable, in addition to being a residence for the Principal and his family, of accommodating about twenty-five pupils. This school was opened in March, and has at the present time an enrolment of eight pupils; and although the Indians have not shown that desire for educating their children which it was confidently hoped they would evince, there is reason to believe, under the able management of the present Principal, the Rev. Alex. Campbell, whose kind and courteous manner and earnest missionary zeal are gradually overcoming their prejudices, the attendance will, in the near future, show a considerable increase. Besides the comfortable home and wholesome food thus provided for the children attending school, Mr. Campbell is enabled to supply very large quantities of clothing kindly sent him by the Ladies Foreign Mission Society.\"\n\n- Indian Agent Reynolds - 1889.\n\n\"The new boarding school has been completed, and is a very good looking structure. The Rev. Mr. Campbell was in charge, and expected to have a full complement of pupils as winter approaches. Everything was in the best order about the premises; and the rooms, beds and bedding were clean and neatly arranged.\"\n\n- Inspector McGibbon - 1889.\n\n\"I regret to report that the Indians have not shown a more willing disposition to avail themselves of the excellent opportunities afforded them for sending their children to school. The average daily attendance for the year has been five. It is very gratifying, however, to know that the few pupils who are attending the boarding school are making most satisfactory progress, under the care of the principal, Mr. Alex. Skene, who is possessed of more than ordinary teaching ability, and is a thorough disciplinarian.\"\n\n- Indian Agent Reynolds - 1890.\n\n\"A marked improvement has taken place with respect to the boarding school at File Hills. The Indians at that agency have, as a rule, evinced a strong dislike to having their children educated, but in so far as securing pupils for the boarding schools is concerned, this has been overcome, and the means available could now be more than utilized.\"\n\n- Indian Commissioner Reed - 1891.\nRE: FILE HILLS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\n\"Mr. Skeene still continues his boarding school for the Indians. He has twelve pupils. He speaks encouragingly of his success, and is most sanguine for the future of his school. He is a teacher of long experience, and has an Ontario record as a most successful one. He has no day pupils. Chief Star Blanket still obstinately refuses to allow any children of his band to attend any school.\"\n\n- Inspector Wadsworth - 1892.\n\n\"The industries taught are practical: basket-making, straw plaiting, knitting, sewing, housework, gardening, milking and care of live stock.\n\nSamples of their work in basket-making and straw-plaiting were shown to me; as yet they have not yet made much progress in learning these arts.\n\nThe large vegetable garden is a credit to the school.\n\nThe principal informs me that he seldom hears the children using any other language than English, even when at play, and that one little fellow has forgotten almost entirely his native dialect. They seldom, if ever, go home, their parents or guardians having given them up entirely to him, and that not one of them wished to or attended the sun dance held on the reserve near the school quite recently.\n\nI examined the routine of work, schedule of the school and the time table of the school-room, they are all satisfactory.\n\nWhile the children receive a sufficiency of meat, milk and fresh vegetables enter largely into the dietary of the school at this season of the year.\n\nMr. Skeene gave me the impression that he is a superior teacher of Indian children.\"\n\n- Inspector Wadsworth - 1893.\n| Year | Average Attendance | P.

Our first record is of a day school on the Little Black Bear's Reserve, opened in October, 1884, with Mr. J. C. Richardson as teacher. This activity failed because of lack of interest and because of the unsettled conditions brought about by the Riel Rebellion. In September, 1886, Mr. R. Toms re-opened the school and it was continued with some success until September 30, 1889. It was closed at this time, as the pupils were recruited for the boarding school which had opened in March of that year.\n\nDuring our conversation, you mentioned Mr. Donald H. Melvor, an Indian graduate in Theology from Manitoba College. I can find no record of any activity in his case at File Hills. He was teacher of what was known as the Okanase or Riding Mountain Indian Day School, in the Birtle agency, for a few years commencing 1883. He transferred for a time to the Cote School and then back again to Riding Mountain.\n\nThere is attached a tabular statement, showing the average attendance, per capita grant allowed and the principals at the File Hills Indian Residential School from 1889 to the present time. I regret that I have no record of the number of half-breeds that were maintained and educated by the school at File Hills during its earlier years. I am attaching also extracts from the official reports of the Department. The year mentioned in each case is the year of the report. I trust these statements will prove useful.\n\nAs you requested, I am forwarding a copy of this communication and enclosure direct to Mr. Rhodes, the present principal at the File Hills School.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMrs. W. R.

As most of the graduates of your school will return to reserves that are largely farming communities, it is very important that the girls be fully competent in this particular.

The first page displays a very good photograph of His Majesty King George V. The next page has a photograph of File Hills Residential School and of a group of the girls dressed in smart school uniform.\n\nThe following introductory letter gives a good idea of school life at File Hills:\n\n\"Dear Junior Red Cross Friends:\n\"On behalf of the pupils of File Hills School, I wish to thank you very much for the interesting and instructive portfolio you sent us.\n\"We take a special interest in our neighbours to the south of us and we hope the portfolio which we are sending you will be interesting to you.\n\"Our school was built in 1911. It is twelve miles from the nearest town, Balcarres, and it is about sixty miles from Regina, which is the capital of Saskatchewan.\n\n\"There are about ninety children in this school. We come to school when we are five or six years old, and graduate at eighteen.\n\n\"The Senior pupils attend school only half a day. Grade VII and VI go in the morning and Grades II and I in the afternoon. The other half day consists of cooking, washing, sewing and mending. The primary classes, from one to four, go both morning and afternoon.\n\n\"There are quite a number of buildings around the school. The Principal's house is a little to the east of it. The main building consists of the dining-rooms, play-rooms, dormitories, staff offices, sewing room, kitchen, dairy and store rooms.\n\n\"There are nine members on the staff, namely\u2014the Principal, Matron, Domestic Science teacher, Laundry Supervisor, Cook, Engineer, Farm Instructor and a Teacher.\n\n\"We have six weeks' vacation in summer. We all go to our homes for our holidays, most of them being quite a distance from here. We also have two weeks' holiday at Christmas.\n\n\"In the winter, we usually have picture shows, which are held once a week. Other nights we spend our time by doing what we like.\n\n\"Trusting that from the foregoing you will have a little idea of what our school is like.\n\nYour sincere friend,\n(Signed) Myrtle Bean,\nGrade VIII.\"\n\nThe rest of the portfolio deals with articles about Saskatchewan, samples of school work and well selected illustrations.\nFile Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nBalcarres, Sask.,\nJune 4th, 1930.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will take up with the Department at Ottawa the matter of increased pupilage for this school.\n\nAt the present time our Pupilage is 90 and for the past 6 months we have had between 95 and 100 pupils enrolled, this has resulted in increased expenditure to the extent of about $100.00 per pupil, which includes new outfits for all new pupils and additional expenses for food etc.\n\nI have found this increased expenditure somewhat burdensome owing to the fact that the past year was practically a total failure in this district as far as crops and garden truck were concerned, the expenditure for feed and seed of all kinds being very heavy (about $1200.00 was spent on these items alone) this is in addition to the increased expenditure for food and clothing for the extra pupils.\n\nI did not want to turn these pupils away, especially after the parents had applied for admission unsolicited. I considered that a refusal to admit them at this time might have an effect on the recruiting in future.\n\nI shall be very glad if you will kindly take this matter up with the Department with a view to having this increase granted as from April 1st.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. F. Rhodes.\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Mr. F. Rhodes, Principal of the File Hills Residential School, asking the Department to increase the authorized pupilage at that institution. Mr. Rhodes pertinently sets out reasons for making this application and I thoroughly endorse them. He has done excellent work at this school, which is one of the most satisfactorily conducted institutions that we have in the West. The whole conduct of the school is excellent and the premises and all Departmental property are well taken care of. His management is good. He very rarely asks for Departmental assistance. I would, therefore, recommend his application for increased pupilage be granted to take effect from the 1st of April last. Please advise me if this is done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

The Qu'Appelle School is much better situated than the File Hills School, as the former is just on the edge of the village and quite close to railway facilities, having therefore much less expense than the File Hills School in the matter of freight, truck transport, &c. I was under the impression that when these schools were \"zoned\" a few years ago, all inequalities were ironed out, but this is one which seems to have been overlooked, unless there is some explanation of which I am not aware.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this enquiry,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Grant at the above rate will be paid for an average of 100 pupils.\n\nI may add that the per capita allowance for the Round Lake Indian Residential School will be at the same rate as stated above, for a pupilage of 75, as from April first, 1935.\n\nThe per capita rate at these schools is the same as is provided for a number of residential schools of similar type in Saskatchewan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Robertson,\nInspector Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter 306-11B of the 28th October, regarding attempted suicide of Kenneth Stonechild, pupil of the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nI attach herewith statement from Mr. Rhodes, Principal of the School also statement from Mr. Ganner, Boys Supervisor.\n\nAt about 9 A.M. Sunday Octr. 22nd, Mr. Rhodes came to my home and informed me that a boy Kenneth Stonechild truanted from the School at about 5.30 P.M. last time, Saturday Octr. 21st. He also informed me that the Father of the boy and the boy arrived at the School at 8.15 Sunday morning. The father stated that he had found his son Kenneth hanging by the neck from a cross beam in his stable at approximately ten minutes to seven.\n\nMr. Rhodes and I went to the home and stable of Harry Stonechild, father of the boy, and we inspected the rope in the stable, and found that it had been cut. We also found that the knot of the rope was still quite loose. While we were in the stable Harry Stonechild came over from the house and explained to us just how he had found Kenneth hanging. He also explained that he had cut the rope and assisted Kenneth over to the house. We then proceeded to the house and I questioned Kenneth and examined him for marks in the vicinity of the neck. I found a very slight abrasion running along the point of the jawbone. Kenneth informed me that he had run away from the school because he had been sent back on the playground by one of the members of Staff, also that he \"thought\" the member had said he would attend to him later. He also informed me that he had obtained the rope used, from the barn room in the barn. I then returned to the Agency and immediately called Dr. Sims the Medical officer and the R.C.M.P. at Balcarres requesting them to come out and make an examination and investigation. I presume reports in full have been submitted to you from the Doctor and Police.\n\nI would like to point out however the fact that the rope knot was quite loose indicating that no great strain had been placed upon it, further the beam from which the rope was suspended was quite low and that in my opinion it was impossible for a person of this boy's height to hang suspended from this rope. Another fact which would require some explaining is that while this boy was cut down at 6.30 A.M. yet he and his father returned to the school at 8.15 A.M. and the place where the deed was done is some 20 to 25 minutes walk from the school, which would indicate the boy had not suffered much physical strain.\n\nWhile Mr. Rhodes opinion is that this boy was trying to bring discredit to the school, my opinion is that the boy wanted away from the school for good, also Mr. Rhodes informed me afterwards that the parents of this boy had made a verbal request last spring for the discharge of Kenneth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThomas Robertson, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nG.

Dodds Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFile Hills Agency.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: No. 179 Kenneth Stonechild.\n\nIn accordance with Dr Robertson's request in his letter dated October 28th relative to the attempted suicide of the above mentioned Pupil of this School, herewith please find statement from myself and one from Mr Genner, Boys Supervisor, attached.\n\nIt was reported to me at about 6-25 PM on Saturday October 21st that the above mentioned Pupil was absent from the Supper Table, I instructed the Farm Instructor and the Boys Supervisor to search the grounds and Buildings for him, this was done but they were unsuccessful in finding the boy, I then proceeded to the home of the Boys Parents, Mr Harry Stonechild, and informed them that the Boy had left the School without permission, Mr Stonechild immediately commenced a search for his Son and on my way back to the School I kept a sharp watch for any trace of the Boy.\n\nOn my return to the School I made enquiries of the male members of Staff to ascertain if there was any real cause for the boy running away, Mr Genner gave the information as set out in his statement, this information was corroborated on questioning the Boy the following day and it would appear that his truancy and subsequent act were based on the flimsiest of causes, this Boy had not been punished and as far as I am aware there had not been any threatened punishment by any of the members of Staff.\n\nThis Boy is at times very vacant and while I have never noticed any suicidal tendencies there appears to be rather a low mentality, I believe however that there was not any premeditated intention of committing suicide but rather a desire to cause trouble or bring discredit on the School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nFrom: A.P. Gauvin (Boys Supervisor)\n\nRe: Kenneth Stonechild.\n\nWith reference to the above Indian Pupil at this School, and the complaint regarding myself which he has brought to your notice:\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 21st at 4 P.M., in my capacity as Boys Supervisor I was in the yard when I saw Kenneth Stonechild climbing through the playground fence and proceed towards the Horse Barn.\n\nAccording to the Rules of the School as laid down by the Principal the above pupil was wrong in:\n\n1. Going over or through the playground fence to get to the Barn-yard.\n2. Going to the Horse Barn 45 minutes before the proper time for evening chores without authority of the farm instructor.\n\nI accordingly called to this Boy from the yard.\nand asked him where he was going.\n\nHe informed me he was going to the Horse Barn to feed-up.\n\nI asked him if the farm instructor had told him to do so, and he said, No.\n\nI then told him to get back into the playground (by the proper way) and stay there until the farm instructor called him for chores.\n\nI was at least 25 yards from this pupil during the conversation.\n\nI subsequently heard that Kenneth Stonechild went to chores at the proper time, but at assembly for supper at 5:30 P.M. he was missing. When the opportunity occurred I informed the Principal of his absence.\n\nI also wish to state emphatically that I did not punish this pupil in any way whatsoever\u2014nor did I threaten to do so.\n\nA.R.

In order to be certain he was normal it will be necessary to take him in for examination and report by Dr. Rothwell. I am hoping that it will not be necessary for him to remain in Hospital, but expect to take him to the Doctor's office. Once this report is received a report will be forwarded to you.\n\nAt present I am of the opinion that the action he took was not that he wished to take his own life, but rather that he wished to stir up dissatisfaction against the school and staff, with the hope that he would be discharged. Unless Dr. Rothwell recommends that he be committed to a mental institution, I would recommend that arrangements be made for him to be transferred to another Residential School. I do not feel that it would be in the best interests of the other pupils to have him back at File Hills School and there would be a certain amount of punishment, that he is going to be away from his parents and not be able to see them as frequently as in the past. To me there is no reason why he should not continue to attend school. I will admit that no matter how long he may go he never will win a Governor General's medal, but that is no excuse to allow him to return to the Reserve to bum around and do nothing. If he is wanting to start that before he is 15 years of age, what will be be like when he reaches the age of 25 years.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nM.D.\nMedical Superintendent,\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nDr. Thos.

Harry Stonechild.\n\n5. The Wilmer referred to in Kenneth's statement is a relative of Stonechilds, he is crippled and a mute, this lad Kenneth was taken to the barn and described how he was hanging, he had the rope around his neck three times, the feet were spread on the floor, and he was lying back in the rope, pressure on the back of his neck, he would have starved to death before he would have died from hanging.\n\n6. Dr Symes examined this youth, he found some slight abrasions on the neck and cheeks, The Doctor stated he would take this lad to The Hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle, Sask., and keep him under observation considering he was phthisic, and in view of this lad's age etc., and the fact that he was an Indian, and juvenile, this appeared to be correct procedure, as this lad does not appear responsible for his actions.\n\n7.

Would you kindly note from the report the boy Kenneth STONECHILD has stated he attempted suicide because he did not like the way the school staff acted. Possibly he is suffering mentally and if this is so what he has said may have no foundation. On the other hand it is felt some further investigation should be made into the cause for his act for the sake of all concerned.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you let me have your comments and whether or not any further enquiry will be undertaken through your Department.\n\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nA/Supt.\n(M.H. Nicholson)\nin Charge C.I.B.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., November 17, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach Police Report and correspondence re Kenneth Stonechild, attempted suicide, File Hills Residential School.\n\nIt will be noted the Police suggest that some further investigation should be made into the cause for his act. I have taken the matter up with Mr. Doids, the Agent; Mr. Rhodes, the Principal of the School; and Dr. Simes, our Medical Superintendent. I can find no evidence that this boy has received any punishment in the past, had anything to fear at that time, or any valid reason why he should have made this attempt.\n\nThe boy has been, since that date, in the Qu'Appelle Indian Hospital, under the supervision of Dr. Simes, and the Doctor reports that he can find no evidence of any mental derangement. He is, however, going to bring him in to Dr. Rothwell for further examination. It is also Dr. Simes' opinion that the boy was not troubled with the intention of taking his life, but rather to stir up trouble in the school in the hope of securing his discharge. Dr. Simes recommends that if the boy is found to be normal he be returned to another school, as he considers the boy would have a bad influence, if he were returned there, on the rest of the pupils. Dr. Simes is apparently also of the opinion that he is not very bright and the schooling will not be of much benefit to him, but considers that he would be better there than running around the reserve.\n\nWe have in our schools both boys and girls around 15 years of age upon whom, in my opinion, we are simply squandering money in continuing them there with the hope of advancing them further in education. This boy is apparently one of that class. Under ordinary conditions I would recommend his discharge, but owing to the fact that it is believed he took this action for the purpose of obtaining his discharge, were it now given, it would have a tendency to encourage other pupils to take some action such as this to obtain theirs. I would therefore recommend that if this boy be found normal, authority be given to transfer him to another school. May I have your instructions please.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nP.S.--Since writing the above, I am in receipt of another letter from Dr. Simes in which he states that Dr. Rothwell can find no evidence of mental derangement but recommends the boy be transferred to another school rather than sent back to File Hills. I might also state that I have advised the Police I can find no reason for this boy's action except a desire to obtain his discharge from the school.\nOttawa, November 24, 1939.\n\nRe: Kenneth Stonechild\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 17 and also a police report relating to the above noted student, attached thereto.\n\nI note that in the last paragraph of your letter you state: \"We have in our schools both boys and girls around 15 years of age upon whom in my opinion we are simply squandering money in continuing them there with the hope of advancing them further in education.\"\n\nI am inclined to agree with you that a great deal of time is wasted in all educational institutions in seeking to educate boys and girls with a low I.Q. On the other hand, we have learned from experience that it is an exceedingly dangerous thing to turn boys and girls of this age with a low I.Q. rating loose on the reserves. You should feel perfectly free to point out to the principals of residential schools that these boys and girls should be engaged in vocational work\u2014sewing, knitting, mat making, basketry, elementary agriculture, dish washing, etc. I learned from experience in the operation of the subnormal institution at Portage that it is astonishing what these boys and girls can undertake and accomplish if given the right direction.\n\nIn the case of Kenneth Stonechild, I can see no\u2014\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nsee no serious objection to his transfer to another school, provided you can make the necessary arrangements. If, on the other hand, home conditions are reasonably satisfactory, he might be allowed to return home. The history of the attempted suicide is likely to reach the school ahead of him and make it somewhat embarrassing for him to feel at home in any school to which he might be sent. Any arrangements you can see fit to make will be acceptable to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDr. A. B. Simes:\nFort Qu'Appelle, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Simes:\n\nYour patient, Stonechild, was in my office on November 14th. After going into this case, and with the information you had given me, I feel that it is just a problem of behaviour in this boy. It might seem a little unusual that he would go to the lengths of trying to take his life, but I feel, as you seem to, that he did not intend to do anything more than create sympathy for himself. He is undoubtedly deaf and has considerable difficulty in the school classroom, and as a result of this he claims that the teacher would get out of patience with him at times and \"boxed his ears\", I believe he said. He is quite emotional and cried when telling about it. I suppose that it was not as bad as that, but rather he himself was not anxious to remain in school. No doubt these children of the wild are even more inclined to want to be out of School in the wide open spaces than a white child, so it would not be very unusual if he did feel that way about school.\n\nWhen he left the school and went home he was still in fear of his father punishing him and taking him back to the school, and that no doubt would explain his remaining outside and then arranging things so that it would appear when they turned up in the morning that he had tried to take his own life. He is only fifteen years of age and rather young to think of something as serious as that, and I do not feel that he was intending to take his own life\u2014in fact he volunteers the statement now that he did not, but thought it would be a good way to have himself excused from running away from school.\n\nI am inclined to be sympathetic towards this youngster because there were many things about the school that he did not like besides the teacher. He tells me that the boys of his age teased him a great deal and would tell him he was both dumb and deaf and, from his own statements, they did impose upon him. To protect himself from that he chose to play with children much younger, which no doubt created the impression among the teachers that he was of their mental age.\n\nYou suggest getting some new school environment and I think that would be advisable and it might help to solve the problem. I do not feel that this boy is as yet either a defective or a case of mental trouble.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nO.E. Rothwell, M.D.\nDirector,\nPsychopathic Department.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my #306-11B of November 17th, re attempted suicide, Kenneth Stonechild, File Hills Residential School, I now beg to attach Dr. Rothwell's report, which I think confirms Dr. Simes' idea that it was not actually a case of attempted suicide.\n\nYou will note Dr. Rothwell also considers this boy should be transferred to another school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. Robertson\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nTR/FMc\n\n(Letter dictated by Dr. Robertson)\nBalcarres,\n\nNovember 27th 1939.\n\nDr Thos Robertson,\nInspector for Saskatchewan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Doctor Robertson;\n\nRe: No.167. Reginald Keewatin.\n\nI have to report that the above mentioned Pupil of this School truanted on Friday evening, November 17th between 5-30 and 6-00 PM, he proceeded to his home the same evening, I went to the home of his Parents the following morning and they informed me that the boy was out helping his brothers to cut wood, when the Father and myself went to the bluff the boy could not be found, I decided to leave the boy with his Parents and advised them to bring him back to the School when he had settled down somewhat, they returned him to the School on Tuesday afternoon and at 5-30 the same evening he was again missing he was returned to the School again on Thursday and was put to bed and his clothing taken away from him.\n\nOn Friday morning Mr Ganner, the Boys Supervisor sent one of the Boys to the Dormitory for this boys dishes, the boy returned immediately and reported that Reggie was trying to hang himself in the Bathroom in the Dormitory, Mr Ganner immediately went to the Dormitory and found this Boy suspended from a vent pipe in the Bathroom by a belt under his chin and attached to a Bed sheet thrown over the pipe, Mr Ganner released the boy and sent him back to his bed,(the boy was able to walk to his bed without any difficulty) and placed a guard over him, this guard has been maintained since.\n\nOn Saturday on my return I notified the Mounted Police at Balcarres of this incident and he made a trip to the School for the purpose of questioning this Boy, we were not able to glean any information as to why he had done this other than that the Staff are always mean to him and are always picking on him, this has been the excuse given in other cases.\nthe reason for running away, I would say that this boy like Kenneth Stonechild has not been disciplined or punished, and they therefore cannot give this as a cause for their truancy, they resent being spoken to and corrected by the members of Staff, that is the only reason we can find for their actions.\n\nIt would appear upon questioning that this Boy did not actually intend to do away with himself, it is significant that he waited until he heard someone coming to the Dormitory and then made the attempt knowing that they would immediately look for him when they found that he was not in his bed, he has admitted to me since that it was not his intention to go the limit, that he wanted to cause trouble by this action, I believe there is a concerted effort afoot to cause trouble and bring discredit upon the School and the Staff, particularly Mr Ganner, it has always been my experience that one member of Staff is particularly disliked by the Indians and they will go to any length to cause trouble for him in the hope that he will be discharged, when they succeed in their efforts they direct their attentions to another member of Staff, in past years this attitude has been ignored by myself and I have told the Indians that I will take the responsibility for my Staff, and that I would not tolerate any interference on their part, I still believe that these boys have been put up to this by some-one outside, but neither the Mounted Police Corporal or myself have been successful in finding out who it is.\n\nIn this connection I have been thinking that it might be as well if we were to ask the Mounted Police to co-operate and send a special investigator to the School, I would be willing to give Mr Ganner extended leave of absence, and the investigator could take Mr. Ganner's position at the School, we could leave the impression that Mr Ganner had resigned and left, this arrangement would have to be entirely secret of course, I wonder if you could see the Mounted Police authorities and discuss this with them (if you consider such action would help to clear up this matter) I am firmly convinced that this is the only way we can get to the bottom of the affair.\n\nIn connection with the Kenneth Stonechild case; I am quoting a few extracts from a short letter I received from Mr Frayling of the Gordon's School on Saturday, his letter is dated the 23rd.\n\n\"Dear Mr Rhodes,\n\nI was sorry to hear of the sad ending of one of your boy pupils, *** You have my sympathy knowing the many untrue reports that can circulate at such times.\"\n\nIt would appear from the above that reports have been circulated among the Indians of the Touchwood Agency that Stonechild actually took his life, I have not heard where Mr Frayling got his information, but there is no doubt that what he has heard is quite\naccepted as true on that Agency, I do not know just how general the circulation of this report has been, but there is no doubt that the whole Province, (at least the Indians of the Province) are aware of the attempt made by Stonechild, I would therefore like you to co-operate with me and forward a letter to the Indian Agent at the Touchwood Agency stating that the reports circulated throughout that Agency are entirely untrue and requesting the Agent to correct this impression in his contacts with the Indians, it might be that we shall hear of similar reports from other Agencies and it might then be necessary to circulate all Agencies that these reports are absolutely untrue.\n\nIf you feel that this could be better discussed verbally in your Office I would be willing to come in and do so, at the present time I feel that one can hardly leave the place in case something else crops up that will have more disastrous effects.\n\nI trust you will be able to give this matter your early attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nI am attaching a letter received from Mr. Rhodes, Principal of the above school. You will note from this that there has been another case of so-called attempted suicide at this school; that it is Mr. Rhodes' opinion that there is some outside influence trying to stir up trouble; that he suggests getting the Mounted Police to send in a special investigator.\n\nI have discussed the matter thoroughly with Mr. Rhodes. He is firmly convinced that in neither case did the boys actually intend to commit suicide\u2014in fact both of them have admitted that they did not. In the last case the strap was under the boy's chin, not around his throat.\n\nMr. Rhodes is of the opinion that while the Boys' Supervisor, Mr. Ganner, has done nothing in the way of punishment to antagonize the boys, some of them have taken a dislike to him and are adopting this method of stirring up trouble, with the hope of having him removed. While Mr. Rhodes suspects some outside influence is at work, he has no evidence at all to support the idea.\n\nHe suggested that the Police send in an investigator, and while, in my opinion, to do so would be of no value, as I do not believe the Indians would give any information to any white man so sent in, even if outside influence is being used, I took the matter up with the Mounted Police and they advise that while they are at all times\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nready to.....\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nready to assist, they do not consider that the R.C.M.P. should become involved in such an investigation, as it rather revolves around the administration of the school. I have informed Mr. Rhodes of this and expressed the opinion that if any white man could secure such information, it would be Mr. Holloway, our Farming Instructor on the Peepeekisis Reserve, as he is well liked by the Indians, and I have suggested that Mr. Rhodes consult him. I have also suggested that he discuss the matter with George Deiter, one of the best farmers on the Reserve, and probably more in touch with what is actually going on than any other Indian there. Deiter has previously been very antagonistic to the Department, but has recently swung around and is now working with us.\n\nThe boy who gave the first trouble is now back at the school. He has assured Mr. Rhodes that he will give no further trouble. The last offender is also at the school and has given the same assurance. No punishment was inflicted on the first offender, but the last one was well spanked in the presence of an R.C.M.P. official, who was called in by Mr. Rhodes at the time of the offence.\n\nIt is my opinion that this will end this trouble at the school, as both the Indians and the children see that they have gained nothing by what they have done and will, I believe, abandon that method. Mr. Rhodes, however, has considered the matter, and while he feels, as I do, that the trouble may be over, he feels at the same time that he is sitting on a volcano, as it were.\n\nI would appreciate your advise as to what further action should be taken in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

I patrolled at 6.30 p.m., by pte auto to the said school for the purpose of making investigation, Mr Rhodes produced this lad who had been under guard since the attempt, I questioned this lad as to why he had attempted to take his life, he stated that he did it because he wanted to leave school and that he was mistreated, he later denied this and stated he did it because he wanted to cause trouble and that he had not been mistreated.\n\n2. Information obtained at the school was to the effect that Keeswatin ran away from the school on Nov. 17th and was returned to the school by his parents on Nov. 21st, he ran away again at 5.30 p.m., that night and his parents reported him at home on the 23rd inst., he was then brought back to school by the staff and kept in his room, on Friday morning one of the staff sent a boy to Keeswatin's room to get the dishes he had used when eating, the boy found Keeswatin in the bathroom trying to hang himself, he was taken down by Mr. Ganner and has since been kept under guard.\n\n3. Undoubtedly there is a movement on foot through the students at this school to cause trouble, the seat of the trouble is unknown, it does not appear that this lad intended to take his life, he states himself he did it to cause trouble.\n\n4. Mr Rhodes is going to have Dr. Simes make an examination of this lad and no doubt he will be removed to the hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle, due to his age it appears that such is the only action to be taken, however it is suggested that these boys should not be returned to this school, they should if possible be sent elsewhere.\n\n5.

I was very favourably impressed with the cleanliness of the different departments and the general efficiency of the staff, which would reflect capable supervision on the part of the Principal. At the present time difficulty is being experienced with the water supply at this school. The main source of supply having been cut off. The well in question is a drilled well some three hundred feet in depth. The pump connection broke and to date it has been impossible to retrieve the disconnected portion from the bottom of the casing. Several experienced men have been engaged and work is still being carried on.\n\nE.S. Jones,\nActing Indian Agent.\nRegina, Saskatchewan,\nOctober 28th, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from the Mounted Police on Wilfred Deiter, an Indian boy from the File Hills Colony who ran away from the school for the second time. Evidently the Police were called in and the boy in question was found with his father near their home on the Reserve. Constable Mears states in his report as follows:\n\n\"In conversation with this boy and also his father, it was learned that his reason for running away from the school, is due to the fact that he gets no class work, he is doing outside work, such as hauling hay, cutting wood, and general labouring; the father states, that in view of the fact that his boy is receiving no better education at the school than he would receive at home, and further that the other boys have enlisted and he can use this boy's help, he does not encourage him to stay at school.\n\nWith full knowledge of the fact, that Indians are fond of making complaints of frivolous nature, there would appear to be some ground for this matter and in view of the fact that hunting these children takes up considerable time, at a time when other more important matters have to be neglected, it is considered that some action should be taken to have conditions rectified, in order that there will be no recurrence.\"\n\nSuperintendent Nicholson of the Police makes the following remark:\n\n\"It would be appreciated if the matter of this boy's escapades could be brought to the attention of the officials concerned in order that appropriate control may be exercised over his future actions.\"\n\nI, of course, have not heard your part of the story but from the foregoing if he were my boy and not receiving any education at the school I certainly would not leave him there.\n\nI am aware that . . . .\nI am aware that Indian boys only attend the classroom half days and work half days alternately, but in the case of this boy he seems to be working all of the time.\n\nWill you please be good enough to furnish me with a full explanation in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

While there I inspected the school buildings, also the out-buildings, and everything in general connected with the school, and have come to the conclusion that this institution is well managed in every way.\n\nFile Hills School is a very good building and the only repair work that is required is some decorating in the kitchen, and the Principal, I believe, has already arranged for this. Mr. Rhodes remarked to me that unless some unforeseen calamity happened he would need but very little in the next 3 years. Here is a man who realizes that there is a war on and does not intend to ask for anything unless it is absolutely required. The out-buildings are small and scattered all over the yard. They are all of cheap construction but have been painted recently and are in good state of repair. This also applies to the barn. The two classrooms are in a separate building and this is also in good state of repair.\n\nThe school maintains about 35 head of cattle, mostly all cows, and 22 were milking at the time of my inspection. They keep chickens but no hogs. They also farm 35 acres of land which yielded a fair crop last year. They have all of the potatoes and vegetables that they require, in fact the Principal told me that he had potatoes to sell.\n\nThe children receive milk three times a day and as I was there at noon I checked over the bill of fare and was in the dining room while the children were eating. From the appearance of the children and from the food that was being served to them, I think they are well cared for and they seemed to be happy and full of life. However, the same thing applies here as at the other schools, that is, the boys are not getting very much manual training, but Mr. Rhodes informed me that he had hired a man to come to the school that very day to teach this subject. The girls are getting the usual training given in every...\nGiven in every boarding school. The children are well clad and well cared for.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

The girls are getting the usual training given in every...\ngiven in every boarding school. The children are well clad and well cared for.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Agencies.\nReport on the File Hills Indian Residential School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to inform you that I visited the File Hills Indian Residential School on the 5th instant.\n\nI reported on this School on November 28th, 1940, and everything is practically the same as it was at that time.\n\nThe buildings are in about the same state of repair as they were last year.\n\nThe crop, however, was very poor this year on account of drought, and they only threshed 900 bus. of Oats from 63 acres, and 570 bus. of Wheat from 40 acres. The Principal also informed me that they only harvested 300 bus. of Potatoes and it will be necessary for him to purchase additional potatoes during the Winter. This is no fault of the School, simply a case of lack of moisture.\n\nThey have the same amount of cattle at the School as they had last year and at the time of my visit they were milking 12 cows.\n\nThe well at the School with which they had so much trouble last year, is functioning satisfactorily at the present time and they have an abundance of water.\n\nI was in the classrooms talking to the children and they all looked exceptionally well. Therefore they are evidently well cared for and there was no sickness of any kind in the School. There were 90 children in residence and two still to come, at the time of my inspection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, he now informs me that a few days after some of the children started to discuss the fire at different times and there were a lot of rumours floating around. Therefore Mr. Jones got in touch with Cpl. McCarro, of the R.C.M.Police, Balcarres, who carried out an investigation at the school, during which three boys admitted setting fire to the school.\n\nThe boy who actually lit the match and started the fire is only 12 years old and is from the Carlton Agency, Mistawasis Reserve. Benny Pasqua and Jimmy Keepiness, aged 15, of the Qu'Appelle Agency, helped the little fellow and more or less forced him to start the fire.\n\nAgent Jones was in the office today and we went to see Superintendent Darling, of the R.C.M.Police here in the city. While we were there he got in touch with Commissioner Ring, of the Bureau of Child Protection and it was decided to take the three boys into custody. Mr. Jones is to lay the charges tonight when he returns to Balcarres. These boys will be brought in to Regina very likely to-morrow and placed in the Industrial School here until such time as their case comes up.\n\nHave you any instructions to give in the matter? You will receive this letter on Monday morning, as I am sending it by Air Mail, and if you write back immediately I should receive your reply on Tuesday. The Police Report will not be forwarded by Cpl. McCarro until about Monday.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) M.

Today I am in receipt of another letter, copy of which I enclose.\n\nInstructions are being issued granting the discharge from the school of the three boys mentioned in Mr. Christianson's letter.\n\nApparently they desire to keep the fireman for the month of May in order to have another man at the school.

On receipt of your previous letter, I asked Mrs. Loveys to send you the information about the School which you requested, as this is an institution under the care of The Woman's Missionary Society.

To date three boys, Sampson Pechawis age 12 years of the Mistawasis Reserve, Carlton Agency; Benny Pasqua age 15 years, of the Pasqua Reserve, Qu'Appelle Agency; and Jimmie Keepness, age 15 years, of Moscowpetung Reserve, also of the Qu'Appelle Agency; have each admitted his guilt and the part each played in this affair.\n\nThe investigation was carried out on April 15th and 16th. I laid an Information and Complaint on Friday, April 17th and the boys were removed to the Regina Industrial School on Saturday, April 18th. They will remain there pending further instruction from the Department. It is understood Mr. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies has contacted the Department requesting the Department's wishes and instructions.\n\nAs stated above, to date three boys have admitted their guilt, but there is no doubt in my mind that all of the senior boys in the School were aware of what was going to take place and had a hand in the careful and deliberate plans that were laid. It is my intention to have the investigation continued.\n\nI understand the police are submitting a detailed report to the Department. Therefore I did not see the necessity of my doing so and have confined my report to the findings to date and the action taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. G.

File Hills Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan. (BALGARRES DET.CASE)\n\n9-4-42\n\n1. With reference to the above. This early A.M. phone call was received from R.S. Jones, Indian Agent of the File Hills Agency, reporting that during the evening previous April 7th, the school house at the File Hills Indian Residential School had burned to the ground with the total loss of the school equipment contained therein. This building was 100' X 26', one storey with full sized basement, and contained two class rooms known as the senior and junior. The building was heated by a pipeless furnace located in the basement. The fire was first noticed at approx. 7:30 p.m. and as enquiries from the staff revealed no fire to have been put in the furnace since 5:30 p.m. and very little at this time, all the circumstances indicated the fire to have been set and for this reason Mr. Jones requested a police investigation.\n\n2. In company with Capt. Zimmerman and Caldwell, patrol was immediately made to the File Hills Agency, but other than being fairly well convinced that the fire had been set by some of the children, no definite information to that effect could be obtained this date and on Mr. Jones suggestion it was deemed advisable to let the matter rest for a few days during which time with the aid of the staff every effort would be made to obtain some lead which would assist the investigation.\n\n15-4-42\n\n3. This date Mr. Jones stated that he had information which he considered would be worthy of checking, with the following results.\n\nSTATEMENT OF MRS. AGNES ALEXANDER, Kitchen Supervisor.\n\nBEGINS: \"Yesterday morning April 14th, I was talking to Edith RIDER, age 14 yrs., and in conversation she said that Samson PECHAWIS told Elsie Anderson on Wednesday morning April 8th that the boys were going to burn the class room that night.

From the contents of the foregoing statements it was evident that Samson Pechawis and Jimmy Keepness were fragrantly implicated in the burning of the school and after considerable questioning and cross examination they furnished the following statements:\n\nStatement of Samson Pechawis - Age 12 yrs.\n\nBEGINS: On Sunday evening April 5th, 1942, I was at the senior play ground. Benny Pasqua, Andrew Rider, Jimmy Keepness and Willie Hilkit were there. We were all lying on the grass. These boys told me to burn down the class room, I said no. They said why don't you do it there is too much trouble. I told them I did not know how to burn down the class room. They said there is lots of paper in the waste paper basket in the basement and I was to take this paper and put it in the corner near the chimney and set fire to it. I said no I would not do it. No time was mentioned when the fire was to be set. On Tuesday morning April 7th, I told Elsie Anderson at the dairy that we were going to set the school on fire. She said do it right away, that would be nice. After supper that day Benny Pasqua, Andrew Rider, Jimmy Keepness and Willie Hilkit and I went behind the class room. The boys asked Andrew Rider to go in the north east class room window, he said no I am too big it would not fit me. They then said to me you are the smallest and told me to go in this class room window and go down and open the coal chute door in the basement. I said no you always make me do everything. They said go and do it if you don't the big boys will hang you. I had trouble before with Andrew Rider and Terrence Bear over some money I lost and they gave me a licking. I am afraid of the big boys. I crawled up the north east class room window the storm window had a slide in it and I went into the junior room through this slide. I went to the basement and opened the coal chute door. This door was fastened with a bolt about a foot long with a stick on the end about two feet long which was turned between two uprights. I unturned this stick so as the door could be opened from the outside. I was going to set the fire at this time but the bell rang and I came out the basement through the coal chute. It was the 7:30 p.m. bell that rang. After lining up in the main building all the senior boys went out to the play ground to play football. Soon after Mr. Andres and Mr. Huston came with the truck and Stanley Pasqua and my brother Arnold who had run away a few days previous. We all then came into the play gymnasium room and soon after Jimmy Keepness said to me, let's go and do it again, meaning start the fire. I said no they might think we are running away.\n\nCONT'D ON PAGE -4-\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arnold, Stanley, Willie, Jimmy and Wilfred and I went to the north side of the school. Jimmy Keepness and I went into the basement through the coal chute. Jimmy started gathering paper and he asked me for a match. I gave him a match, he said no you start it and I will put on the paper. There was a narrow place beside the chimney and Jimmy put a lot of paper at this place to the ceiling. I lit the match to it, the fire flamed right up to the ceiling. We got out the coal chute right away. Only Willie Hilkit was spying around the corner when Jimmy and I came out the basement. We then went to the senior playground. After that there were some little boys passing near the school house and Willie Hilkit went and told them to get away from there. Jimmy and I went back and went into the basement and we seen the fire had started to burn the ceiling and then we came out again. We went back to the playground.

Benny went away and the next time I seen Samson he came out the coal chute. Samson called me and asked me to come down with him, I said no. Then Wilfred and Arnold came and Arnold told me to go down. I went down into the basement with Samson and I gathered paper and he put it close by the chimney and then he set fire to it. As soon as I seen the flames going up I got through the coal chute and Samson came soon after. Wilfred and Arnold were outside when I came out, I went to Arnold and Wilfred and we went around to the front steps and Samson came and found us there.

We went over to where they were and asked them what they were doing. They said they had set a fire in the class room. We all went and looked in one of the basement windows, we seen the smoke, after this Jimmy and Samson went into the basement through the wood chute and when they came out they said the fire was going good. We all then went to the Senior play ground and played football. After that I seen the smoke coming out the class room roof and then the alarm was given.

File Hills' Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan. (BALGARRES DET. CASE)\n\n7. It will be noted that the contents of the foregoing statements are somewhat at variance with regard to persons present, etc., but that Jimmy Keppness, Benny Pasqua and the above named admit their active participation in the setting of the fire, while the others, particularly Arnold Pechawis, Alfred Hatawai and Lloyd Stonechild, who are considered the chief counsellors of the offence have no admission in implicating Pasqua, Keppness and Samson Pechawis, but they are cleverly endeavouring to keep themselves from being involved. It is also fairly well established that the anticipated burning of the school was common knowledge particularly among the senior boys of which there are some 16, and while several others are mentioned in the statements as being present, investigation has so far failed to confirm same and the parties giving the statements on being further questioned state they may have been mistaken in the identity of certain ones, however, as already stated there would appear considerable to hand implicating Arnold Pechawis, Alfred Hatawai and Lloyd Stonechild, and this is further borne out by the contents of the following note which was handed to me by Mr. Jones on the morning of the 18th when I went for the above named and his companions to take them to Regina, and at which time I was given to understand the note had been found and turned over to Mr. Jones. Contents of the note follow and there is very little doubt but that it was written by Arnold Pechawis.\n\nBEGIN: \"To Samson: Hello there, well here goes an answer which I got this afternoon. Well Sammy its longest you don't blame me and W.H. for that gas we got, don't say anything about that please, tell him you them Mr.G.M.P. Lloyd told you to set it the time I and S.F. ran away so you get the idea from him. That's what we going to say too they just want to find out you got that idea first so just tell them he say that the time you got stripping after you run away, if they know Lloyd really got that idea first so they'll let us go. Jimmy said he going to tell them that to, tell them mounties my brother Arnold got after me after we did that he sure gave me hell for doing that but he didn't want to tell anybody first, say that to them, so I won't be in trouble and tell them I wasn't home that time he tell you and Jimmy I set the fire in the school, tell them that's time I was away I and S.F., tell them that so long from your brother A.F. If you answer give it to me.\"\n\nSamson Pechawis on being questioned about the above letter furnished the following information in the form of a statement.\n\nBEGIN: \"During the afternoon of April 17th., I wrote a note to my brother Arnold Pechawis told him to tell the truth about the big boys and the fire and maybe they would let us off. I gave this note to Terrance Bear to give to Arnold. Later Terrance gave me the note that Cpl. Macara has shown me and said that Arnold sent it. I read it about half then put it in my side pants pocket. I lost this note and Jimmy Keppness has told me that George Stonechild seen the note sticking out of my pocket while I was eating and he took it out of my pocket and gave it to Lloyd Stonechild. Lloyd Stonechild told me that the best way to set the fire was with gas. He told me to ask Walter Stonechild for some gas. I didn't ask Walter. Walter helps Mr. Lame in the engine room.\" END. Sgd.

Before I helped to burn the school I was going to try and get some gas but I did not get any. I know there was a small can of gas kept in one of the toilets, I put this gas there after I got it from Walter Stonechild. I was going to use this gas to light the fire but it got spilled by some of the kids. Walter knew when he gave me the gas what I was going to use it for, I asked Walter to get it for me.\"\n\n(Sg\u0101) Jimmy Keepness.\n\n10.

After supper time on Wednesday, April 8th, 1942, I went to the toilet with Arnold PECHAWIS.

Arnold and I went over to where these boys were at the Classroom and learned from them that they had set the Classroom on fire. Arnold and I looked through the basement window and seen the fire. It was close by the furnace. Jimmy then said about getting some gasoline. I did not want to do it but Arnold, Jimmy, Samson and myself went to the Sawing Outfit. Jimmy got a Jam Can and we got the Jam Can half full of gasoline from the sawing engine and we all returned to the Classroom. Jimmy and Samson went down the basement and threw the gas on the ceiling. Jimmy and Samson came out of the cellar and Jimmy said the fire is going good.\n\nJimmy KEPPESS told me that Lloyd STONECHILD was the first to get the idea of burning the Classroom, he said to Jimmy you boys don't like the school burn it down.\n\nWITNESS\n\nCorporal R.

The letter in question is again being embodied in this report -\n\n\"Hello there, well here goes an answer which I got this afternoon. Well Sammy let's hope you don't blame me, M.M. for that gas we got, don't say anything about that please, tell him you think R.G.M.R. Lloyd told you to get at the time I and S.P. ran away so you get the idea from him. That's what we going to say too they just want to find out you got that idea first so just tell them he say that the time you got strapping after you run away, if they know Lloyd really got that idea first so they'll let us go. Jimmy said he's going to tell them that to, tell them mountain my brother Arnold got after me after we did that he sure gave me hell for doing that but he didn't want to tell anybody first, say that to them, so I want be in trouble and tell them I wasn't hear that time he tell you and Jimmy to set the fire in the school, tell them that time I was away I and S.P. tell them that so long from your brother A.F.\n\nIf you answer give it to me.\"\n\nThe above named on being interviewed and confronted with the foregoing letter admitted being the author of same and after considerable questioning an explanation of the contents he submitted the following statement -\n\nSTATEMENT OF ARNOLD PECHANIS, age 16 yrs., 7 months.\n\nHaving been warned by Cpl. Macara, I need not say anything, I have nothing to hope from any promise or favour and nothing to fear from any threat whether or not I say anything. Any thing I do say may be used in evidence at my trial. Understanding the above, I make the following statement voluntarily.\n\nOn Monday, March 30th., 1942, I in company with Stanley Pechanis run away from the File Hills Indian Residential School. We were brought back to the school on Tuesday evening, April 7th., and receiving a talking and strapping from Mr. Huston, Principal. After receiving the strapping I went upstairs and Jimmy Krehmee who had also run away before I did said, \"I was trying to burn the school while you were gone\" and that he still intended to do it. On Wednesday evening, April 8th., just after supper, Wilfred Baynham and I went to the toilet. At this time I seen Benny Pechanis and Willie Hilbert standing by the school and I also seen Jimmy Krehmee and Samson Pechanis go down the coal chute into the basement. We knew these boys were setting fire to the school and Wilfred and I went over. Benny went away with Hilbert and Jimmy and Samson came out the basement. There wasn't only Wilfred, Jimmy, Samson and I left. We looked in the basement windows and seen the fire had kind of died down. Jimmy had a jam can and said lets go and get some gasoline from the sewing outfit. All four of us went to the sewing outfit, Jimmy loosened the gas pipe and we all took turns sucking gas out and spitting it into the can. Jimmy then took the pipe right off and was able to fill the can with gas. We then took the gasoline back to the class room.\nSTATEMENT OF ARNOLD PECHAWIS, age 16 yrs., 7 mos., Cont'd.\n\nTO THE CLASS ROOM. Jimmy and Semon went into the basement through the basement window and we seen them throw the gasoline over the basement ceiling and then light it. The flames went right up and Jimmy and Semon came out the basement and walked out to the playground. It was not long afterwards when the class room was noticed on fire. All the senior and intermediate boys knew that we intended to burn the class room. Jimmy KENNEDY told me that it was Lloyd STORCHILL that first said to him that he should burn down the class room. It was Lloyd that caused me to run away and gave me .10\u00a2 and he gave Stanley .10\u00a2 also.\"\n\nENDS.\n\nWitnesses:\n\nArnold Pechawis.\n\n4. In view of the contents of the foregoing statement and the admitted action of the accused which definitely involves him in the commission of this offense, charge was laid as outlined herein and the accused remanded without plea to await definite date and place of trial and further report will be submitted as soon as same has been arranged. It is anticipated that a further remand will will be necessary and the matter of same will be taken up with the R.C.M.P., I/C., Regina Town Station. Information and Complaint is held by J.C.

With reference to the above, this file is interlocked with Balcarres file No. Semon KEEPNESS - Arson Gil O.C.C., and it is requested that the latter file be referred to wherein it will be noted that the above named is alleged to have been the first to suggest the burning of the classroom to Jimmy KEEPNESS.\n\n24-4-48\n\n2. This date in company with Cpl. Macara a patrol was made via Ford Code 6220 to the File Hills agency, and STONECHILD on being confronted with certain incidents in which he is alleged to have been involved and other information to hand, submitted the following statement:\n\nBEGINS: The night that Jimmy KEEPNESS was brought back from running away I was talking to Jimmy upstairs. He was feeling blue and I told him about the school burning down at Lebret about 3 years ago and I said to him you better burn the school down here, this same night I told him that he better not do that for he would make trouble. Two or three days after, all the boys were talking about burning the school and I told them all not to do it. The first time anything had been said about burning the school down was after I had told Jimmy when we were upstairs. END ---- Witnessed: Cpl. Macara.\n\nSIGNED Lloyd STONECHILD.\n\n3. It will be noted that STONECHILD makes a clear admission of having suggested to KEEPNESS that he burn down the classroom, but this is as far as he would involve himself. He emphatically denies having had anything to do with obtaining gasoline or making any other preparations for the fire, and although this is doubted there is very little information to prove otherwise as he undoubtedly endeavoured to keep himself from being definitely participating in the actual setting of the fire or being in the close proximity at the time it was being carried out by the others. It is mentioned that it was apparently first intended to fire the Main Residential Building, but no information could be obtained indicating that any such attempt had been definitely made. STONECHILD, during interrogation admitted that two days prior to the fire he had taken some dry kindling to the basement of the classroom without anyone authorising him to do so, and that he had not performed such a chore for at least two years previous. He however, denied that the action was for any purpose other than to supply kindling for the furnace, and there has been nothing obtained to refute his assertion, but his unauthorized actions in this respect appear very suspicious.\n\n4. The writer is of the opinion that STONECHILD in admitting having counselled KEEPNESS to fire the classroom...\nNo: Lloyd STONECHILD - (Juvenile) Treaty Indian,\nArson 811 C.C.C., File Hills Indian Residential\nSchool, Saskatchewan.\n(BALCARRIES DETACHMENT CASE)\n\nPARA. 2.

I am at present engaged in the task of preparing a full and complete report on conditions at the school for the information of the Minister.

Dobbin as Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School. At the present time Mr. Dobbin is in charge of the Indian Mission at the Cote Reserve.\n\nThe Department has approved the temporary appointment of Mr. Dobbin as Principal, but we have advised the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada that we consider conditions at the school should be carefully reviewed after he has been in charge for six months or so. Due to the destruction of the classroom building at the File Hills School by fire and the apparent lack of discipline mentioned in several letters received from you, it is our feeling that it would have been preferable to have a clergyman appointed Principal. It is for this reason that we have only approved of Mr. Dobbin temporarily. As you can realize, the United Church at the present time is experiencing considerable difficulty in obtaining qualified men for Principals of residential schools, as there has been a heavy demand for many of their best men to enter the Chaplain Services with some branch of the Active Army.\n\nI feel certain that both the Indian Agent and yourself will do everything possible to assist Mr. Dobbin and we will be glad to hear from you from time to time regarding his administration of the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. M.

This date, via Greyhound bus, the writer patrolled to Melville for the purpose of going into these cases with Mr. L.T. McKIM, Agent for the Att. Gen., whose services have been retained to conduct the prosecution. Mr. McKIM requested that if possible further evidence be obtained as to any conversation which may have been overheard by any of the accused regarding their intention of committing this offense, just in case any of them should decide to plead not guilty. He further desired, if possible to obtain proof of their ages, particularly, that of Arnold PECHAWIS and Wilfred HAYNAIL.\n\n3. Date of trial has been arranged with Mr. McKIM and Magistrate Fraser and set for Saturday, May 16th, 1942, at 2:00 P.M. at Balgares, Sask.

He will then be discharged on probation and has to report every two weeks to his Agent.\n\nJim Keepness, aged 15, and Benny Pasqua, aged 15, both from the Qu'Appelle Agency, were sentenced to remain at the Industrial School until September 1st, at which time they will be transferred to the Brandon Residential School until June 30th, 1943.\n\nArnold Pechawis, aged 16, Mistawasis Reserve (brother of Samson Pechawis), and Wilfred Haywhi, aged 16, from the Assiniboina Reserve, Qu'Appelle Agency - one year in the Moosomin Jail.\n\nJim Keepness and Benny Pasqua had counsel and were defended by Mr. Robinson, a lawyer here in Regina. This was arranged for by the parents of the two boys. The other three had no counsel.\n\nAt the trial and investigation it was revealed that the five boys sentenced are not any worse than the other boys at the School because everybody knew the night before that the fire was going to take place, apparently, with the exception of the Staff. I must say that the boys who were reprimanded seemed to be very nice and this was borne out by the Principal of the\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndustrial School..................\nIndustrial School here in Regina.

I say that our Department does not intend to appear on this case, therefore we have more or less left the matter to Mr. Christianson of the Indian Department. I note you have notified him of the date. We are telling him what we consider might be done with these boys from the observations made by the Superintendent of the School. He says that the two younger boys, he thinks, could be put on probation, and maybe the older boy as well. We would suggest, therefore, that the recommendation be that the boys all be put on probation to the Indian Agent or to somebody well known in the district, and if the Judge did not think this was sufficient that the older boy be sent to the Industrial School, and the younger ones be put on probation.\n\nThe boys have been very well behaved while in detention, and have shown a willingness to do everything they have been told, and even this small amount of punishment may be of some benefit to them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nL.B.

The situation there is rather bad, as the accommodation which is used for school-room is not only inadequate, but is such that the children suffer from having to spend much time there.\n\nI gathered from the conversation I had with you that there was a possibility of getting an amount put in the estimates to rebuild this school-room. I shall be glad to know whether it has been found possible to have this item included. The Women's Missionary Society, under whom this school is conducted, are inclined to make life a little less than pleasant for me. I wonder whether I can get some assurance from you that it is likely that something will be done in connection with this school this year.\n\nWe appreciate the extra grant that came from the Department the other day to assist in carrying on the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.)

There has been, and still is, however, a feeling that an attempt should be made to carry on with the buildings now available, in the hope that huge supplies of lumber and other building equipment will be available for a worthwhile building program immediately following the close of the war. In addition to the acute shortage of certain building materials, there is, as you know, an acute shortage of skilled labour in the Dominion. These have been the main considerations that have resulted in our present policy. However, if the war continues, it is just possible that this policy may have to be modified to meet conditions such as the conditions now existing at File Hills.

I agree that an attempt should be made to carry on with the buildings available at the present time, so far as this is possible; but the situation at File Hills is such that it is imposing a very great hardship both on the Church's missionary effort and on the Indians themselves to try to carry on.\n\nMay I ask if the Department would consider paying for the moving of a building, if such could be found not too far away. I have an idea that in that district there might be some building or buildings which could be drawn in and used as a school, temporarily, if we knew that the Department would pay the cost of such an undertaking. I have not yet written to representatives of the Church in that area, asking them to make enquiries along this line, as I did not know what your attitude would be. I should be glad to know what you think of this.\n\nI have written to the Department about certain other matters and am waiting to get word from someone in the Department as to the date on which Mr. Crerar is likely to be back in Ottawa, so that I may make an appointment to see him. I could take this matter up at the same time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-1, part 2)\nOttawa, May 5, 1943.\n\nRe: File Hills Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nYour letter of April 30, addressed to Dr. Camsell, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply. Dr. Camsell is absent from his office and is not likely to return for several weeks.\n\nI feel confident that the amount necessary to move and repair a temporary building could be secured from this year's appropriations. It would be appreciated if you secured from the Principal information with respect to the buildings that might be available for the purpose we have in mind.\n\nI have this morning been in touch with Mr. Jackson. He informs me that the Minister is now back and would be glad to see you, should you decide to visit Ottawa next week. The Minister attends a meeting of the War Cabinet on Wednesday and a meeting of Treasury Board on Thursday of each week.

I was in the new classrooms talking to the man in charge, Mr. Dick Hasty, whom I have known for the past thirty years. He is getting up in years but he is a first class carpenter and we can depend on anything Mr. Hasty does therefore I know he will make a good job of rebuilding these classrooms. Mr. Hasty told me that they probably would be finished at the end of this month but on account of the shortage of labour he thought it might take him a couple of weeks longer so in all probability it will be on in November some time before the building is completed. However, it is closed in and there should be no trouble in finishing even if the weather does get cold.\n\nThe Principal again brought to my attention the boiler at the school. When Mr. Mayhew, Provincial Boiler Inspector, was down there last he reported to me when the new boiler was being installed that we should make arrangements to purchase another new boiler to replace the other one, and I brought this to the attention of our Branch. I again brought this to the attention of our Branch on July 17th last since no action had been taken stating that the boiler was not satisfactory but again no attention was paid to this by our Branch. To quote Mr. Dobbin's remarks it does not matter how much you fire this boiler it is so badly caked that very little results are obtained from the fuel burned in this heating plant therefore they are depending mostly on the boiler that was installed a year ago last Fall at the school and in real cold weather this is not sufficient. The matter of having a new boiler installed should be given consideration.\n\nThe staff at the school, of course, is new as several of the ladies there are beginning their first year but there were one or two ladies who were there before I certainly was not sorry to see leave this institution. Mr. Dobbin, the Principal, seems to be carrying on very satisfactorily.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING DECEMBER 31st, 1945, ON FILE HILLS AGENCY\n\nEducation\n\nThere are no day schools in this Agency as the children attend the Qu'Appelle Residential school at Mebret and the File Hills Residential School near Agency Headquarters. Both these schools are filled to capacity. All children coming of age this year were admitted into either of these schools. Two ex-pupils of the File Hills School are attending Brandon Residential School for advanced education.\n\nThe construction of a dug out has been completed at the File Hills School to supplement the inadequate water supply there.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nFile Hills,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nMar. 5, 1946.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nAttached hereto is a copy of a letter dated March 2nd from Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School, pertaining to the misconduct of a number of senior boy and girl pupils.\n\nI visited this school yesterday, and found that five of the senior girls and six of the senior boys were implicated in this matter, and that the entrance through the wall separating the girls balcony from the store room had been effected on Jan. 30th last and was not discovered until 2:30 A.M. Feb. 24th. The entrance was cleverly hidden as described in the Principal's report. It was also found that at the times the girls were visiting the boys dormitory, one or more of them were acting as sentinels at a window from which they could observe anyone approaching the boys dormitory. There was no evidence to indicate that any of the members of the school staff had been negligent in the supervision of the pupils. I also found that the Principal of the school had had the partition repaired, a new yale lock placed on the store room door, and had arranged the store room so that there is now a clear view of the walls separating the two dormitories on the balcony.\n\nI have arranged to have the R.C.M. Police at Balcarres visit the school this Thursday and go over the evidence procured against ex-pupil George Stonechild, 16 years old, discharged Feb. 3rd, 1946, in connection with effecting entrance into the store room by means of a key he had made to open the lock on the door leading therein.\n\nTo date none of the parents of the pupils indicated in this matter have approached me regarding it and as this is the first case of this kind I have had to deal with I deemed it advisable to report it to you.\n\nSgd. S.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nBalcarres, Sask.\nMarch 2nd, 1946.\n\nS.H. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFile Hills Agency.\n\nI wish to submit the following report concerning recent occurrences at File Hills School: On Sunday morning, February 24th, about 2:30 noises were heard in the senior boy's balcony and upon investigation by the Boys Supervisor five Senior girls were discovered there.\n\nAn immediate investigation by Principal and Staff revealed the following facts. One of the Senior boys had opened the lock on the balcony store room door by means of a key which he had fashioned from another key with the aid of a small file. Having thus gained access to this store-room which is separated from the girls balcony by a thin partition of \u00bd in. V-joint, the boys managed to get possession of a brace and bit with which they bored holes in the wall and removed several short boards from the bottom panel of the partition. The opening thus formed was in a corner near the floor and behind a cupboard which was put back in its usual position afterwards. On the girl's side of the partition a large packing box covered the opening. About 2 A.M. one of the senior boys unlocked the storeroom door and sent a smaller boy through the opening into the girls dormitory to waken a number of the girls who followed him back to the senior boys dormitory, after which they spent some time in bed with the boys. In two cases attempted sexual intercourse was admitted. At first the visits were made with utmost stealth but later the girls became careless and the noise attracted the attention of the night watchman and boys Supervisor who made the discovery, actually catching five girls in the boys balcony. The visits were planned to take place shortly after the night watchman had made his hourly inspection of the dormitory. The offenders have been summarily dealt with and punishment administered fitting the seriousness of the offenses. Parents of pupils implicated were informed at once and allowed to visit the balconies.\n\nI would appreciate very much if you would give this matter your immediate attention, conducting a further investigation to ascertain whether or not legal action may be taken against the boy who made the key and opened the storeroom.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd. Leonard L. Dobbin.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of letters of Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the File Hills School, and Mr. S.H. Simpson, Indian Agent, File Hills Agency, in connection with the misconduct of some of the pupils.\n\nI have since discussed this quite thoroughly with Mr. Dobbin and I am satisfied that he has the matter well in hand and it is not likely there will be a recurrence.\n\nThe R.C.M. Police have investigated and Mr. Dobbin informs me that there has not been sufficient evidence brought to light to warrant charges being laid against anyone. I shall have the Police Report shortly and if anything interesting results therefrom I shall take appropriate action.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 19, 1946.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing correspondence with reference to the action of certain pupils at the File Hills Residential School. I trust that the action taken by the Principal and staff will avoid a recurrence of this conduct in the future.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSir:\n\nAllow me to bring to your notice a situation which we feel is worthy of consideration.\n\nI am the engineer of File Hills Residential Indian Institute. We were engaged and moved here from Winnipeg July 145. Had our furniture and piano shipped and tracked.\n\nWe live in a separate cottage provided by the school for the engineer. As far as I know I have been satisfactory and we have tried to cooperate with the needs and interests of the school, beginning the day at 6 a.m., and quite often working till 10 p.m. at the school. I sleep and eat at the cottage. We were paid for $75 per month with maintenance, but we buy considerable food, garden seeds, and hoe the garden. We made improvements at the cottage including building and installing attachments to a western yard work, built a good garage. Mrs. Tooch, my wife voluntarily without remuneration takes timely interest in Indians\u2014teaching stamp and music twice a week and likes to help in any special events. It is good for her as she is fond of Indian children. We rejected a more remunerative employment for this job to find a mingling with children (our home was deprived and benefit of our stay).\n\nNow we are told through our Principal, Mr. Hobbs, word has come from you that we must be discharged because the engineer must live on the residence. This seems very unfair towards us and\nand (by the way) a young single man such as you seek, who can do the job I do here, is not going to \"stay put\" inside four high walls 12 miles from the nearest P.O. and work in grease and mud.\n\nNo doubt fire hazard is your reason. There are two men besides the night-watchman in the residence. A phone can be installed for a comparatively small sum.\n\nBesides the maintenance of engines and sickly tractor, I've been steadily employed in repair work, and some paper-vising\u2014putting in long days. We feel this discharge is very unfair, and though it may be of little \"bread and butter\" to us we should appreciate a few words from you. It takes work and some money to move and damages goods.\n\nI am\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nE. Rock,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nJuly 3, 1946.\n\nMr. S. H. Simpson, Indian Agent,\nBalcarres, Saskatchewan.\n\nLetter from E. Pocock,\nFile Hills Residential School\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter received from Mr. E. Pocock, Engineer at the above school.\n\nI have carefully checked the file and am not able to find any reference to the necessity for the engineer living in the school building.\n\nCould you please check into the facts as reported in this attached letter.\n\n[Signature]\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Department letter #111-1-1, Jul.3/46.\nE. Pocock; File Hills Residential School.\n\nI have interviewed Mr. L.L. Dobbin, Principal of the School pertaining to dispensing with Mr. Pocock's services as Engineer at this school. He advises that as Mr. Pocock was unable to successfully perform the duties required of him as Engineer, chiefly due to his old age, he terminated his contract to keep him in the employment of the school by giving him the required one months notice. He also advises that he did not inform Mr. Pocock that he had received word from the Department to the effect that the Engineer was required to live in the residence.\n\nMr. Dobbin informed me that he has had considerable difficulty in procuring the type of employees required in this work during the war and has had to do the best with what he could get. This condition is now changing and he is endeavouring to build up an efficient staff on a permanent basis.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Agent.\nBalcarres, Sask., 8/7/46.\n\nTo: Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nRe: We are at a loss to know whether you received a communication from us some weeks ago about June 19. The mail was taken by another party. We wish to know if our letter reached you.\n\nThere have been serious developments arising from the unmerited dismissal of a war veteran who was under contract to continue as Farm Instructor at File Hills for 1946-47. Also the unprecedented discharge of six of the staff\u2014to employ the choice of the United Church of Canada, and to give the staff\u2014Easterners. These of course being termed unmitigated nonsense, and Hitleric, preposterous lack of economical action.\n\nJacta est alea. But the smooth functioning of File Hills School is finis. For no other reason (as we are told) our verbal contract for 1946-47 is broken because we are a married couple, over 50, and we live in a cottage near the residence. Our work was satisfactory and we have been among the other targets of this firing squad working overtime nearly everyday. Is there no protection for File Hills staff? No Board to be responsible? No proper methods to engage and dismiss workers?\n\nIndian Affairs.

This date patrol was made via Code #3564 to the File Hills Indian Reserve investigating complaint received from the above named relative to a ladies purse and contents which had been stolen from her room in the above referred to school, she being an employee therein. She informed that her room is directly connected with the children's dormitory and that for this reason she usually kept same locked. During the afternoon in question June 27th, she omitted to lock her room and that it was during this particular afternoon or early evening that she is certain the purse was taken, although she did not discover the loss of same until the following afternoon at which time she was making preparation to depart for Regina and had occasion to seek her purse. She was unable to furnish any definite information as to who may have taken the purse, but stated that there was considerable unusual activity around the school with the children and their respective parents as it was the end of the school term and the children were departing to their homes for the holidays. Two girls namely, Caroline Sanderson and Marion Keewatin, age 15 & 17 yrs, had during the afternoon arrived from Brandon and were met by their parents at the school. These girls were former students at the File Hills Indian School and were well known to Mrs. Graham. In conversation with the girls she remarked to them that a certain cat had kittens and that they were upstairs in the dormitory with the result that the girls went up to see them and for this reason Mrs. Graham is suspicious of these girls being implicated in the disappearance of her purse. The girls are known to have been upstairs but not for any extended period and they have never been seen with the purse or any of the contents. Likewise they both deny any knowledge of the affair. Mr. McLean, Principal of the school was interviewed and he is very reluctant to believe that these girls had anything to do with the purse and that it occurred to him that it was only on account of them going up to see the kittens that they came under suspicion and the numerous other children around made it very difficult to place suspicion on any particular individual.\n\nThe following is a description of the stolen purse:\n\n(a) Ladies dark brown calfskin purse containing:\n   - 1 $5.00 bill,\n   - 2 $1.00 bills and some silver,\n   - Bank pass books,\n   - Income tax receipts and door keys.\n   - Small black compact with gilt sailboat on top.\n   Total value Approx. $25.00.\n\nCONT ON PAGE-2-\n2. From result of enquiries nothing of a definite nature was uncovered which would involve the two girls suspected by the complainant and in the absence of same their denials of implication can only be excepted until other tangible information comes to hand. It is again mentioned that there were numerous other children together with their respective parents around the school during the afternoon and early evening and that owing to the end of the term and preparation of the students on return to their homes, the customary supervision was somewhat relaxed which afforded more opportunity for anyone prone to take advantage of such circumstances. Mrs. Graham advised that to the best of her recollection her purse was on a chair or the dresser in her room and that the removal of same would entail only the matter of seconds. She is not concerned about the cash lost but would like very much to retrieve the purse and other contents.\n\n3. Enquiries are being continued and further report on results will be submitted to meet diary date. No request is being made to have the purse and contents circularized as all the circumstances would appear confined to the File Hills Indian Reserve and any information coming to hand will be reported to this office.\n\nS.

We have noted that there is considerable doubt in your mind as to the necessity of a residential school at File Hills. We have discovered in the past that the prime consideration in the provision of bus facilities is the condition of the roads along which such buses would have to travel. These buses can operate up to distances of 12 miles from the school and if the roads are good, still deliver the children to the school before 9 A.M. Therefore, it would be appreciated if we could have your views as to the possibility of providing transportation on the roads in the immediate vicinity of the school on a 10 month basis (exclusive of summer holidays).\n\nYour letter will be discussed with Major Clark as soon as he returns to Ottawa and we will write you further when we have heard concerning road conditions.\n\nBernard F.

Bryant, Indian Agent Pelly Agency, called this office and advised that the captioned along with another Indian girl named Rosie CADOTTE had run away from the Indian Residential School at the File Hills Reservation. Mr. Bryant stated that both these girls were fourteen years of age and that they were both from the Cote Reserve, Pelly Agency, and that he had taken both girls to the school in question. Mr. Bryant advised that both girls had returned to their homes on the Cote Reserve and he requested that these girls be picked up by members of this detachment and escorted to Yorkton to be turned over to the principal of the File Hills school who would meet the patrol at that point as per arrangement. Mr. Bryant stated that he was requesting this procedure to impress upon the girls that they had done wrong in running away.\n\n14-10-47\n\nA.M. of this date a patrol was made to the Cote I.R., per P.O. Code 8565 by Corpl. Doyle and the writer for the purpose of locating these girls. The CADOTTE girl could not be found at her home and it would appear that she had run off into the bush on the approach of the police transport. A search of the bush was made but without result.\n\nThe WHITESHANK girl was found at home. She was subsequently conveyed to Yorkton being accompanied by her mother. At Yorkton she was turned over to the principal of the school, Mr. Nelson.\n\nAfter completing other police duties, patrol returned to Kasask, arriving at 6.30 p.m.\n\nAt the first opportunity the CADOTTE girl will be picked up and conveyed to Yorkton as per arrangements with Mr. Nelson; report will be submitted in this regard under appropriate caption.\n\nThis file is being considered closed at this detachment.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The pupils have come back to the classroom after supper to try a test in Division and a test in spelling.\n\nThe classroom won't hold all the pupils assigned to this teacher, and so the \"half-day system\" is unescapable.\n\nThe children are clean and happy. They had no chance of a warning to \"spruce up\" for this visit.\nThings are a bit crowded in the boys' dormitory. As usual in many schools (even where hooks are possible) the boys \"hang\" their day clothing on the beds. Here the bed- and night-clothes are clean and adequate.\n\nThe little fellow is ailing but there is no other place to put him.\n\nThis is pretty ancient plumbing and a prime example of what should NOT be held up to impressionable children as the product of a superior civilization. Observe that in some wash-basins a portable hand-basin has been placed to avoid the use of the drain.\n\nA girls' bathroom. The lack of partitions makes supervision so much easier although there are those who might carp at the indelicacy that such a setup must encourage. On the centre seat I have placed an orange wrapper which was the only tissue I could find. But on each of the teacher's desks there was a roll of tissue for use in the classroom. I spoke of this to the Principal, and later I mailed each teacher a package of Kleenex without comment.\n\nIt is surprising how many of our schools fail in this training. Also it is gratifying to find a few schools where this matter is splendidly handled.\nThe main building and the schoolhouse (blank wall). Additional classroom space could be added here.\n\nThe electric plant is not very effective. The 32-volt system should be replaced by something in the 110-115 volt class in order to ensure ample voltage at the extremes.\n\nThe junior classroom has a full quota of pupils. Here Mr. McLean is seen talking to Mr. Scovil of the Regina office who very kindly drove the car by which I was able to get to the school. The \"road\" through the reserve needs more than a little attention.\n\nTop of a fire-escape pole which leads down from a dormitory to the verandah.

Principal Mclean is a pretty good planner.\nThe Principal has done a good job of cleaning and beautifying the grounds. Thrift and foresight characterize his activities. This little hot-house will give him all the tomato, etc. plants which he can use in his outside garden for school purposes.\n\nAs elsewhere in Saskatchewan water is a problem. This dug-out cannot be used for school water. Seepage from the barn drains down to it; moreover it is placed in a pasture where the animals drink from it. Another dug-out and well should be arranged nearer to the school (off the picture to the right).\n\nThis is the first school where I have found that the chapel has to be used as a dining hall for the pupils and the \"chancel\" (beyond the curtain) as the staff dining-room. Most of our schools insist on a one-purpose chapel.\n\nSupper was served too soon after my arrival to allow for any stage-setting. The children had meat, vegetables, bread and butter, milk to drink, and a dessert of jello with a generous helping of whipped cream. The children recognized the vanilla flavouring. They were obviously used to good meals.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 19, 1948.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nFile Hills Residential School\n\n(1) REPAIRS:\n\nBy now you will have received an Army Signal concerning the boiler repairs and the purchase of the lighting plant required at the above residential school.\n\nThe Minister has approved the acceptance of the tender of Greenfield Motors Limited, to the amount of $797.60 to carry out the repairs as listed in their tender of June 4th, 1948.\n\nYesterday we mailed a copy of purchase order 33063 covering the purchase of a lighting plant and a set of batteries from Greenfield Motors Limited.\n\n(2) FUTURE POLICY WITH REGARD TO THE OPERATION OF THIS SCHOOL:\n\nTwo days ago, Dr. Dorey of the United Church of Canada visited this office. The contents of your letter of June 15th was discussed with him at some length and while not committing himself fully, it seems fairly evident that he is in agreement with the replacement of this residential school by day schools.\n\nMajor Clark was also present at the discussion and he too is in agreement with your recommendation. It\nis understood that the two class room school block now on the site of the residential school could be used as a day school, providing transportation for the children could be arranged. It was, therefore, agreed that Major Clark would visit the school this fall and go over the roads thoroughly and decide whether bus transportation is feasible. It would be appreciated if efforts could be made to improve the roads selected to the extent required for them to be used by a heavy school bus. Our experiences with such transportation in Ontario have convinced us that good roads are essential for the provision of adequate school bus transportation.\n\nI also understand that another day school would be required on this reserve near the File Hills colony. Would it be possible to have arrangements made for the school children at the File Hills colony to be admitted to the provincial school at Lorette?\n\nTo summarize, therefore -\n\n(1) File Hills Residential School will be operated as a residential school during the 1948-49 academic year.\n\n(2) A thorough survey will be completed to decide what day school facilities can be provided to replace this residential school during the 1949-50 academic year.\n\n(3) Before the closing of this residential school is authorized, adequate educational facilities must be ready to provide for the continuance of the education of these children. In other words, we cannot close the residential school until the day schools required are complete and bus transportation is provided.\n\nBernard P.

Certainly much is needed if the school is to continue in operation, but I hesitate to recommend spending any further money on it, excepting for urgent temporary repairs, in view of the doubtful future of the school. In discussing this with Mr. Booth he asked me whether he should frankly tell Mr. McLean that the school will probably cease to operate after the 1948-49 term. Mr. Booth, of course, is aware of the attitude if the Department towards the school and its continuance, but apparently Mr. McLean is not. I would suggest that Mr. McLean be frankly informed of the situation and the reason for withholding the expensive improvements. However, I have advised Mr. Booth against giving this information to Mr. McLean unless instructed so to do by the Department.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nFile Hills Residential School.\n\nYou will recall our recent conversation with regard to the future operation of this institution as a residential school.

She is, indeed, greatly disturbed over its contents, and I would ask that you be good enough to take no further action regarding this matter until Dr. Dorey's return to the office, when he can take it up with you and with Mrs. Loveys. We expect Dr. Dorey will return to the city about the middle of October, when I shall see that your letter is brought to his immediate attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nFile Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nWith further reference to our letter of August 19, regarding the school situation at File Hills, Mr. C.A.F. Clark, Educational Survey Officer, will arrive at Regina on Friday evening October 15, via C. P. R.\n\nIt would assist him greatly if you could supply him with an up-to-date large scale map of the reserve to which he could add additional information. Considerable travel by car may also be expected.\n\nIf it is not possible for Mr. Clark to be accommodated at the File Hills School beginning Monday October 18, he would appreciate your arranging other accommodation for him in the immediate neighbourhood of the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nFile Hills School Situation:\n\nThe photos show buildings associated with church work in the File Hills \"colony.\" \n\n1. The United Church Mission house, occupied by a woman worker. It could provide room for a teacher.\n\n2. The adjacent United Church. It is not readily adaptable for classroom purpose.\n\n3. Shows the phone line extending to the sub-agency buildings, about 1000 yd. distant. Land for a school site could be found here, to the left of the church in photo #2.\n\nPhoto #4 shows the Roman Catholic Church and Hall. This two-story building could become a teachers' residence and classroom if the Indians of that faith press their demand for a day school also.\n\nIt is, however, a matter of opinion and if one's concept of living standards whether the File Hill Indians are ready for an abrupt transition to day schools. My own opinion is that the majority of homes need to be increased in size and improved in quality. If not, the general cultural level which...\nhas been achieved \u2014 and perhaps artificially maintained \u2014 by the influence of residential schools may suffer a considerable recession.\n\nMr. Ostrander has a large-scale map of the reserve on which the agency staff has entered the size and religious affiliation of families, existing and proposed roads, and the agricultural possibilities.\n\nIt would be possible to fill a one-room school, perhaps even a two-room school, with Protestant children at the colony, and at the same time conduct a full-time day school in the two-room school block at the U.C. residential school. This school is presently congested, and gives only part-time classwork in some grades.\n\nThe road-building programme, however, required to ensure bus service for a colony school would be quite extensive and would, perhaps, be better spread over two or three years.\n\nA beginning of day-school instruction might be made by an adjustment in the residential pupilage to permit pupils who are conveniently and suitably housed to attend on a day-pupil schedule. To this end the basement of the existing school block could be adjusted to afford a third classroom and an activity room; or, if dormitories for either sex are reduced or abandoned, the main building could afford extra classroom accommodation.\n\nChildren could make their way on foot or in vehicles supplied by parents. Or a beginning could be made in bus service.\n\nThe advantages of centralized teaching could thus be preserved for pupils and for staff, and the necessary residential facilities retained. In view of the situation at Round Lake it would appear necessary to retain some U.C. place of refuge in the province.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\nMr. Ostrander\n\nFile Hills Schools:\n\nIn regard to our discussion today it will be helpful if you will forward to this office the annotated diagram of the File Hills Reserve which was made at the Agency office. Photostatic copies of it will be made here for distribution to all concerned.\n\nAt the same time please include a copy of the table of statistics relating to surviving children born in the years 1933 to 1948 both inclusive.\n\nI would remind you that you agreed to make inquiries about the probable availability of bus service, preferably on the basis of payment by the vehicle-mile.\n\nYour recommendation concerning the pupilage to be allowed at File Hills Residential School is also desired, the presumption being that a two-room school is provided in the \"Clay\" area and that some pupils who must be kept in residential schools can be accommodated at Brandon or Cottage La Prairie.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina,\nSask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nI am submitting a report on William Creeley.\n\nSunday evening, February 13th., after being home for half an hour I went back to the school building about 5.30 P.M. When I went in some boys told me William Creeley had gone up to their dormitory. I was surprised as visiting is over at 4.30 and no visitor is allowed upstairs unless they have special permission.\n\nI immediately went up and found him in the room of the Boys' Supervisor\u2014Mr. Panchuck. I asked him what he was doing there and what he wanted. He replied that he wanted the Boys' Supervisor to give his children (a boy of 9 and a boy of 7) special attention and favors, and that when he came in the younger boy was crying. I told him all children here are treated alike and that none received special favors and then I asked him to leave.\n\nI walked ahead of him to the stairs but let him go down first. When we reached the playroom he said \"come on outside\" I went with him to the boys' door and opened it for him. During this time I had said nothing. As he went down he suddenly rushed back and caught me by the legs and as I was totally unprepared for such a move he succeeded in pulling me down the steps. He said he wanted to fight and he called to two friends who were waiting to come and help him.\n\nMr. Panchuck, who had followed me, and I both tried to reason with him but he took off his coat and pulled out a knife and started swinging it around. I called to the boys who had gathered to get Mr. Reeves, the Engineer, and he came and tried to talk to him. Then I turned to go into the school and he made a race at me and as his arm went round my neck I put up my hand to save my face. The knife cut the sweater I was wearing and made a cut in the fleshy part of my right thumb. When he made the race at me Mr. Panchuck tried to come to my assistance but George Kewatin, one of the Creeleys' friends, grabbed him by the hands and held him long enough to give Creeley his chance. Creeley kept repeating that he would kill me yet and that he would come back till he did.\n\nAs I had been told by several .........................\nAs I had been told by several that Bill Creeley was a very dangerous man I have always treated him very carefully in an effort to avoid friction. Last September he caused considerable unpleasantness here when he threatened me because visiting hours were on Saturday from 2 to 4:30 P.M. He wanted to come on Sunday and any time he pleased. Following a talk with Mr. Booth on the matter I have allowed visiting both Saturday and Sunday afternoons from 2 to 4:30 since last October.\n\nI phoned the police in Balcarres and they came out Sunday night. They arrested him on Tuesday and I understand the charge is common assault. He is out on bail and the case come up February 24th.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Lachlan McLean.\nMarch 1, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\n\nThe letter hereunder is self-explanatory.\n\nMr. McLean is the Principal of the File Hills Residential School and has always been satisfactory in the performance of his duties.

Police Report, File 49R 629-2-92, in connection with the assault of William Creeley, Treaty Indian, Okanese Reserve, upon Mr. Lachlan McLean, Principal of the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. McLean telephoned to me late in the evening of February 13th, 1949, informing me of the assault. The reason he telephoned to me was that Mr. Booth, Indian Superintendent, File Hills-Qu'Appelle Agency, was away at Ottawa at the time. I instructed Mr. McLean to call the N.C.O. of the Balcarres Detachment, R.C.M. Police, to deal with the case.\n\nWhen Mr. McLean telephoned to me he appeared quite excited but did not seem inclined to lay a charge. However, on my advice, he has done so, with the result that the accused has been sentenced to 2 months in Regina Gaol.\n\nWith regard to matters generally, at the school, discipline has been fairly good under Mr. McLean, and this incident was very unexpected. I do not think it advisable to take any further action other than that I am asking Indian Superintendent Frank Booth, on his next visit to the school and the reserve, to point out to the Indians that the school is entirely under Mr. McLean's charge, and that no Indian has a right to enter the school without Mr. McLean's permission.\n\nWilliam Creeley is an erratic type of Indian, and probably had been drinking some intoxicant before visiting the school, otherwise I do not think he would have acted in the manner indicated by the Police Report.\n\nJ.P.B.

The writer returned to Det. 12:00 M.H.\n\n6. The following is a copy of the statement obtained from Mr. McLean, principal of File Hills Indian Residential School, Sask., regarding this matter.\n\nSunday Feb. 13, 1949\n\n\"I Lachlan McLean, state that I am principal of File Hills Indian Residential School. At 5:30 P.M. on Sunday February 13, 1949 I came from my residence to the School. Some of the children told me Mr. Creeley was up in the boys dormitory. I went up to see what the trouble was as he had no business being up there.\n\nI asked him what he wanted here. I couldn't make head or tail of what he was saying. I told him he better get out of here altogether, he had no business up here.\n\nWhen he got to the bottom of the stairs he said will you come outside. I opened the door so he could go out and he grabbed me by the leg and pulled me downstairs to the bottom outside. I think Mr. Panchook, boys supervisor was with me. He wanted to fight. I think Mr. Panchook told him to stop. Creeley had tried to hit me but Panchook stood between me and him. Then Creeley called in two other Indians who were with him and he pulled off his coat and hat and threw it down on the ground. I told the school children to go and get Mr. Reeves the Engineer. Mr Reeves tried to reason with him. Then he took out a knife and held the knife in his hand, it was a jack knife and opened. He said I'll kill you. He made a strike at me with his right hand with the knife and it came around my neck, I put up my right hand and got a cut just behind the last knuckle of the right thumb. Mr Reeves told me I better go in. I went in. I wouldn't say he was drunk, he struck me as being partly insane.\n\n(Sgd) Lachlan McLean\n\nA slight cut was noted on the back of Mr. McLean's right hand, the skin was broken as a drop of blood had seeped through.\n\n6. The following is a copy of the statement obtained from Peter Panchook, boys supervisor File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nSunday Feb. 13, 1949\n\n\"I Peter Panchook state that I am boys supervisor at File Hills Indian School. About 5:45 P.M. today Feb. 13, 1949 I was up in my room. I was sitting there, there was a knock on the door, I opened it and Bill Creeley came in. I asked him what he wanted, he said one of his kids was crying downstairs. I said I couldn't help it. I told him he wasn't supposed to be up here. Then he told me he had seen Mr. McLean about it and he wouldn't pay any attention so he was going to see me.\n\nJust about then Mr. McLean walked in. He put his hand on Creeley's shoulder and told him he had no business...\"\n6. (continued) had no business up there. Just then Mr. McLean put him ahead of him. Creeley said something about getting outside. I didn't exactly hear what it was. I thought there might be trouble so I went along with them. When we got to the boys outside door, Mr. McLean opened the door and told him to get out. As soon as Mr. McLean opened the door he grabbed ahead of him by the collar; as soon as he grabbed Mr. McLean, I got Mr. McLean by the shoulders and tried to hold him and Mr. Creeley grabbed Mr. McLean by the leg and he pulled Mr. McLean outside and I went with him.\n\nWhile he was holding him by the leg I got him away. Creeley asked two Indians who were outside to take their coats off and help him. They came over but did not take their coats off. When I was trying to hold Creeley off one of the Indians who had a parka on caught ahead of my hand from behind and held it.\n\nThen Creeley got Mr. McLean's leg again. Mr. Reeves came then. Then we got Creeley away from Mr. McLean.\n\nCreeley got up on the steps, Mr. McLean was below with Mr. Reeves and myself. Creeley pulled a jack knife out of his pocket and opened it. He said any of you that makes a move is going to get it. Mr. Reeves told Mr. McLean to go in and Creeley made a dive for Mr. McLean, he took a swing at Mr. McLean with the knife and then it was rough and tumble. When Creeley dived this Indian had me by the hand again. Creeley had said to Mr. McLean I'll get you sooner or later and I'll kill you.\n\n(Sgd) Peter Panchook.\n\n7. The following is a copy of the statement obtained from William J. Reeves, Engineer at File Hills Indian Residential School, Sask., Sunday Feb. 13, 1949.\n\n\"I William J. Reeves, state that I am an engineer at File Hills Indian Residential School. About 5:45 P.M. on Sunday Feb. 13, 1949 one of the boys called me. I was in the staff sitting room, he told me Will Creeley was fighting Mr. McLean. I went to the boys doorway and outside. Mr. Creeley had Mr. McLean by the leg. I helped pull him off. As we parted them Creeley stood on the steps and Mr. McLean below. Myself Mr. Panchook and an Indian were between them. Creeley was using abusive language towards Mr. McLean. I didn't know what he meant. He got his pocket knife out, opened it. He was threatening Mr. McLean. He put it down for a little while. I warned him it was a serious offence to threaten anybody with a pocket knife. He brought the knife up again and he tried to jump past us. He got Mr. McLean who was leaving to go around to the front door. There was a rough and tumble and I did not see what took place. Mr. McLean went into the school I went inside myself then. After I warned him about using the knife he said he had lots of money to pay and lots of friends to help him pay. When I first got down there I asked him what the trouble was and he said Mr. McLean had put him out of the dormitory, and I told him it was Mr. McLean's duty. I remember him saying he would get Mr. McLean sooner or later.\"\n\n(Sgd) W.J. Reeves.\n\nContinued page -4-\nMr. McLean stated that he wished to take some action against Creeley but was undecided at this time as to what charge to lay and would call at Det. in connection with same following A.M. Mr. McLean and staff stated that they did not intend taking any action against either of the other Indians as they had attempted to restrain Creeley. As far as could be learned Creeley had left with the other Indians for the reserve. Mr. McLean stated that the routine of the school was badly upset as a result of the incident and at his request Sgt. Irvine remained at the school overnight returning to Det. following A.M.\n\n14-2-49\n\nThis A.M., Mr. McLean called at Det. and after discussing the matter advised that he intended to lay a charge of Common Assault under Sec. 291 of the Criminal Code against Creeley. Same date Mr. McLean appeared before Mr. Arthur E. GRAHAM, J.S.C. of Fort Qu'Appelle and laid a charge under Sec. 291 of the code and warrant to apprehend was issued for Creeley.\n\n15-2-49\n\nAt 9:00 A.M. this date the writer accompanied by Sgt.

Our records here indicate that the building was erected by the Department in 1910, after tenders had been called. You will recall that on April 9, 1942, a fire completely destroyed the classroom and contents in a separate building from the main quarters. We have also found a letter from the Reverend Dr. J.H. \u00c9douard, dated March 7, 1927, indicating that the four Residential Schools at Portage la Prairie, File Hills, Round Lake and Alberni were considered the property of the Department. To conclude, therefore, the Department built this school and the cost of its erection was paid from the Education Vote.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..................................................School for the Quarter ended ...........................................193......\n\nPrincipal ...........................................................................................................\n\nDated ...........................................193......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ........................................................................................................\n\nDated at ...........................................this ...........................................193......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReps.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended 19.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 2nd 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended June 30th.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 7th, 19[Year]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place Name], Sask.\n\nthis 3rd July, 19[Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated July 7, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated July 1, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this day, 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReps.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lake Wabamun Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Leonard L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the WILK HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 1st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILLS HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1945\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...File Hills Residential School for the Quarter ended...Sept 30...1943.\n\nPrincipal...L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Pine Hills Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal: L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fire Hills Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal: L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...FILE-NILLS RESIDENTIAL........School for the Quarter ended...MARCH-31st..................1944.\n\nPrincipal...........................................\n\nDated...APRIL 1st..............................1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent.......................................\n\nDated at...Calgary, Alta.........................this...5th day of April..................1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APRIL 1st 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 6th day of April 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...FILS HILLS RESIDENTIAL...School for the Quarter ended...MARCH 31st...194...\n\nPrincipal...L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 3rd, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepaid and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly-per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the File Hills Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal L. L. Dobbin\n\nDated Oct. 3, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL...School for the Quarter ended...MAR. 31...1945.\n\nPrincipal...L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILLS HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the Quarter ended MAR. 31, 1915.\n\nPrincipal: L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE MILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30 1945\n\nPrincipal L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended December 31 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 2nd 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FLE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. End 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JAN. 10, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILTHILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended September 30th 19\u2014\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 6th 19\u2014\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\u2014\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended...June 30 1946\n\nPrincipal: LeLe Dobbin\n\nDated July 2 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

(RG 10, Volume 6307, file 653-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended Mar 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended Mar. 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 1st 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the File Hills Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReeq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will a demand be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the File Hills Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 8 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: File Hills\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the FILE HILLS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: L. W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ____________________________ School for the Quarter ended ____________________________ 19____.\n\nPrincipal ____________________________\n\nDated ____________________________ 19____\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ____________________________\n\nDated at ____________________________ this ____________________________ 19____.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nQU'APPELLE AGENCY\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Date]\n\nMUSCOW, SASK.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.
