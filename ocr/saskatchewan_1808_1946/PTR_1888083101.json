D. MAVEETY\nPRINCE ALBERT N.W.T.\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 31, 1886.\n\nNORTHEAST ORDINANCES\nHis Lordship Judge Richardson and Mr. A. E. Foster are now busy engaged in consolidating the Ordinances passed by the Northwest Council, with a view to having them revised and re-enacted by the Legislative Assembly. A number of the Ordinances is very much needed, and we are glad that it is being done. There are several of the Ordinances, too, which require amendments, and we take occasion now to point out one or two of these in which some of them stand in need of amendment. And first to the Municipal Ordinance, 1885. Section two provides for the erection of rural municipalities containing an area of not less than two square miles, but there is no provision made for the election of town municipalities, unless they be incorporated by an act of the Legislature. That we claim is an unnecessary proceeding; the same provisions should apply to the incorporation of towns as to rural municipalities. Section twenty should be amended so as to give municipal councils power to prescribe the form of oath to be taken by electors. Section 127, subsection (c), which should be changed. Under this sub-section as it now stands any collegiate institute, incorporated seminary, etc., may hold any quantity of land and such land be exempt from taxation. We can see no good reason why any institution should be allowed to hold more land than it actually uses, except from taxation. Where land is held, even by a public educational institution, and not used, it should be taxed. As the law stands at present, all any ratepayer has to do in order to avoid taxation is to execute a bogus transfer of his property to some collegiate institute. Another unnecessary provision in the existing Ordinance is that which requires lands to be sold for arrears of taxes to be advertised in a weekly newspaper published in Regina (see 259) or in the North-West Gazette. What sense, or result, is there in advertising Prince Albert lands in Regina? If there were no paper published here the case might be different. It is not likely that people would come up here from the capital of the Territorial government to tax sale, and we do not suppose that half a dozen citizens of this place would see the advertisement if inserted in the official gazette or a Regina weekly for two months. It simply means that a great deal of our money must go out of the place for nothing. If we have to sell land for taxes, let it be advertised where the land is to be sold and the probable purchaser resides. The time allowed for the redemption of land is too long. Section 257 allows two years. The time should be limited to one year from date of sale; there is no great inducement to purchase when the ratepayer has to wait two years for his deed, and although he is allowed twenty per cent. interest on his money if the land is redeemed, Speculators do not purchase at tax sales for the sake of the interest; their object is to secure the land and when they see a good chance of the title being completed they will not care about investing. There are several other points in which this Ordinance might be improved upon, and to which we hope to refer in a future issue, as well as to some of the other Ordinances.\n\nHORSE SHOE STORE\nJust arrived\u2014A Large Consignment of Choice Groceries, Canned Goods, Pickles, Sauces, etc.\nFifty Chests Choice Congo Tea\nWhich we will sell until further notice at $2 per lb.\nFresh importations in Fancy Dry Goods, Millinery, Ribbons, Hosiery, etc., etc.\nFull Lines of Windowcurtains\nIn Lace, Tapestry and Japanese, Fancy Blinds and Shade Rollers.\nJust arrived\u2014Large Stock of PATENT MEDICINES, STATIONERY, ETC.

The proceedings were conducted in every respect. Owing to a number of circumstances it was found impossible to get the full range of the district in which the association had its head quarters, the fact of their being no means of crossing the river would have prevented.\n\nThere were large numbers present at the meetings and the results of the three days shooting show a marked improvement over other years. The weather was very fine except for the very bad wind and the wind was very often uncomfortable, but notwithstanding all these difficulties the shooters did very well.\n\nMONTANA MATCH.\n\nThe first event of the meeting was the Montana Match, in which there were forty-nine entries. There were twenty-five prizes in kind donated by our local merchants and others. Firing commenced at nine o'clock and under the conditions of this match were ranges 200, 400 and 600 yards. Sabre rifle, service rifle and shotgun ranges.\n\nThe following are the prize winners together with their scores\u2014\n\n1. Kerr, Const., lang., presented by Coon, M. J., St. Albert.\n2. Baker, F.

T. E. Baker and Const. Leslie, each with 128 points tied for first place off the fire line, but each at 300 yards, Baker winning with a score of forty to his competitor's fourteen and thus securing the medal.\n\n**THE MACDONALD MATCH**\n\nThere were over forty entries in this match. The prizes were a challenge cup, presented by Mr. H. Macdonald, M.P., and \u00a35 added by the Association. The ranges were 600 and 400 yards, and the first prize was won by James McKay\u2014D. Williams, second, shooting the same score but falling off the firing range. The following are the scores\u2014\n\n| No. | Name          | Score |\n|-----|---------------|-------|\n| 1   | Baker, T.E.   | 128   |\n| 2   | Leslie, Const. | 128   |\n| 3   | McKay, James  | 128   |\n| 4   | Williams, D.   | 128   |\n| 5   | Bailey, Sergt. | 127   |\n| 6   | Montgomery     | 127   |\n| 7   | Turner, Sergt. | 127   |\n| 8   | Park, Sergt.   | 127   |\n| 9   | Horne, Sergt.  | 127   |\n| 10  | Clarke, Sergt. | 127   |\n| 11  | Rogers, Sergt. | 127   |\n| 12  | Bailey, Sergt. | 127   |\n| 13  | Bailey, Sergt. | 127   |\n| 14  | Bailey, Sergt. | 127   |\n| 15  | Bailey, Sergt. | 127   |\n\n**LAURIE'S MATCH**\n\nThe most interesting event of the meeting came off on Friday afternoon. This was the Laurie Match; shot at 400 yards with the rifle, seven rounds. The first prize was awarded to Sergt. J. S. second, a beautiful gold hanger; third, a bronze sauce; fourth, silver spoon holder. The prizes were presented by the ladies of Prince Albert, each lady subscriber selecting a member of the association to represent her. Each subscriber winning a prize to hang it over the body whom he represented or to some one of the family. A large number of ladies attended the fair and were present on the grounds during the progress of the match and assisted in the refreshments after the shooting as the gentlemen. The ladies very kindly provided refreshments on the grounds for the members of the association and did things for them which they could possibly do. No doubt their presence contributed in no small degree to the success of the affair. We were glad in this match, and we trust that on future occasions they will pay a visit to our local Winstons. The shooting was good throughout, in fact could not be better. D. Williams and Sergt. F. Talbot, both of Prince Albert, scored 25, and it was not expected that their scores would be beaten, until Const. Bailey by his own account, shot a perfect bull's-eye, making the possible thirty-five. Excitement ran high when Sergt. Facker had scored an 11, and Bailey and it looked as though if Const. Bailey could not be alone with his gun, the aggregate last that night would be 50. Const. Bailey then became the winner of the most coveted cup, and was warmly congratulated by all who knew him. The excitement when the firing ceased was carried up to the ladies' refreshment tent by his lordship, Lord Lauries, who presented the cup to Mr. Spark, the only whose colour he wore. The following are some of the best scores\u2014\n\n| No. | Name          | Score |\n|-----|---------------|-------|\n| 1   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 2   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 3   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 4   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 5   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 6   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 7   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 8   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 9   | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n| 10  | Bailey, Sergt. | 35    |\n\n**ALL COMERS' MATCH**\n\nThere was not such a large attendance of members as usual Saturday as on the two preceding days. The first event this morning was the All-Comers' Match. Ten rounds of twenty-eight shots short. The prizes being a medal presented by Sergt. A. Bailey, \u00a35 and \u00a330 added by the association. The match was won by T. E. Baker. During the shooting in this match Capt. Thos. McKay donated a valuable silver cup, which was won by Const. Leslie who almost made the possible.
