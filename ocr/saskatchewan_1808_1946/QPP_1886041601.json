Commis- sioner Crozier; Superintendents Wm. Hemmings, Lottin, McMillan, Gage, Neale, Newell, Macdonald and Jarvis; Commissions for thirty-one inspectors.\n\nThe Minister of the Interior in- structed the Dominion Land Surveyors Act, making funds for the act are nearly complete, and others are already in practical operation. An affidavit before the senior clerk in the absence of a local agent, groups of interested parties may obtain titles to land which they may not otherwise obtain.\n\nThe minister has also ordered the compilation of maps which will be continued after the 1st of January, 1890, application for patents must be made within three months from the date of issue.\n\nJAMES COWAN,\nQu\u2019Appelle, March 26, 1886.\n\nFORT QU\u2019APPELLE.\n\nWe took a trip to Fort Qu\u2019Appelle on Saturday last, and as might be expected when the farmers are seeding, business was quiet. When we descended into the valley and saw the town repose peacefully under the shade of the pine, on either side of the valley, we were forcibly struck with the beauty of the scene. The hills on the south side of the valley are dotted with trees, but the town is built on a level piece of land. The town is built on a piece of land lying between two fine lakes in the valley. Taken altogether the situation is one of beautiful repose, and would be a paradise for any city. We had heard that there was a possibility of sewer drainage, which we understand is not sufficient for the needs of the town, but as it is not sufficiently raised above the level of the lakes, the idea is not, unless the town grows so fast that it will not become a place of any importance. The municipal council we called at the Village Office and found the Postmaster. He was very obliging.\n\nWe also met Mr. T. W. Jackson on the street and he invited us up to his house for tea. He is very kind. He informed us that he had just received a letter from Ottawa, saying that the government was going to send a surveyor to examine the land. This will become a very important line and one that should be looked after by the Dominion Government.\n\nThe municipal council was in session when we arrived at the office. Mr. M. A. J. Macdonald, all. The council had resolved itself into an audit committee, and were engaged in the books of the municipality. We took a look at the style in which the books were kept, and were very much surprised at their neatness. They are much more elaborate and costly than those kept in any other town in a new country, and if the Council is as extravagant in other matters as they are in the matter of books, we do not wonder that the taxes are high.\n\n\u2014 Potatoes wanted at The Pro- vost\u2019s office for subscriptions.\nTHE COMING STRUGGLE.\n\nBritish statesmen have commenced the great struggle which will mark the closing years of the present century. This struggle, as appearing in the annals of British history\u2014While writing the Premier Nicholson, who has been advanced in his political career by the election of Lord Liverpool as Premier, the Duke of Wellington, and Lord Lynedoch, have been called together by the Prime Minister, Mr. Gladstone, to consider the financial position of the country. They have discussed the question of the Irish question, and have come to the conclusion that Ireland should be given a greater degree of self-government.\n\nMR. BLAKE'S SPEECH.\n\nFrom the House of Commons: When Mr. Blake declared, in his speech at Liverpool, that the ballot should be extended to all classes of the community, he said that the ballot was essential, because the majority of voters did not have enough confidence in their representatives. He further stated that the ballot would ensure a fairer division of votes among the candidates. The right hon. member for Liverpool then moved an amendment of his own, which was supported by the hon. members for Manchester and Leeds.\n\nHOME RULE.\n\nMr. Gladstone has addressed himself to the task of providing Home Rule for Ireland. His proposition is being discussed in both Houses of Parliament. The members of the Irish delegation have visited Westminster to examine the proposals. They have also met with Mr. Gladstone, who has assured them of his support.\n\nA FAMILY MEMORY.\n\nJabez Weidman, a former colonel of the Maine Volunteers, died at his home in Bangor, Maine, on January 15, 1892. He had been a prominent figure in the Civil War era and had served as a brigadier general during the war. Jabez was born in Maine in 1823 and was educated at Princeton University. He was a member of the New England Bar Association and served as a justice of the peace.\n\nWIT AND HUMOR.\n\nA man was asked why he believed in the doctrine of evolution. He replied, \"Because I know God created the earth in six days.\"\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of ONE DOLLAR, with the object of endeavoring to make payment.

He had been shot by a trumpeter and was taken to Tyler, Texas, in a dying condition.\n\n\"Help me fight back this cruel death,\" he said to the doctor here,\" said the dying man, cheerily. The doctors had already told him that there was no hope.\n\nWith a calm dignity, he bade the weevil, and called all of his wonder-full force to aid in the struggle to live.\n\n\"I tell me exciting stories,\" he said to the boys around his bed, \"for I must die, and you will be left here.\"\n\nAnd the boys did laugh, and tell big stories, poor fellows, when the story-teller could not keep up the ra-gits. The hears sped rapidly by; the nervous young man, the conductor grown weak and failing, but his courage never faltered.\n\nA telegram from his wife, in answer to his request, came just before he was brought into the room and raised. She was coming on a special train, the conductor asked for her passage, and with lighting speed her train was annihilating distance. She came in, a young woman in the full flush of health, a new life uplifted against death, the kind of terror. The news moved Fraser in a moment of his life.\n\nKeep up your courage,\" he said.\n\n\"Wait here,\" whispered a broken man, she will be here in an hour.\"\n\n\"Turn me over, boys,\" he whispered.\n\nIt was done. He whispered to an attendant\u2014\"Charley, I cannot run on this schedule\u2014good-bye.\"\n\nHe was dead.\n\nELEGANT HANDS.\n\nA proper hand can be more un-fashionable than any other face. But just now, we are told, it is particularly \"the fashion\" to display a proper hand.\n\nThat elaborate box of nonsense, the nail-case, made of plush or satin, and lined with attractive little blue silk, may be used in more than usual request.\n\nGirls spend an hour at a time polishing their nails, pink powder a bit of chocolate or, with an instrument made for the purpose, carefully rubbing away the thin film of skin that obscures the white creases at the base of the nail. A fresh coat of varnish is then put on them with dismay, and causes an instant demand for lemon juice.\n\nA hard hand is better suited to searching domestic recipes for the proper composition of almond-paste. A tender hand is less liable to wrist or knuckle plagues the victim in despair.\n\nThere is good in all this, but the thing may be carried too far. A young lady's hands should be well cared for, but polished to a high degree, but there are some blunders possible upon its beauty which no one can excuse.\n\nSuch is the pictured appearance of the hand of a young lady who has received a wound, the pale, stained fingers of the preserver-keeper, and who would not regard the wound as a mark of a royal pain that has not diminished the dignity of the situation as honorable ones, no more than the disfigurement than the woundcut on the forehead of a soldier.\n\nThe tenderer your hands the better they hang below, until they become too heavy to be useful. The plump, round, white hands with a pink palm, tan in a sunburning, the keen, hard hand that is redder and rougher, and does good work, has the first claim upon our admiration.\n\nSan Jones, the evangelist, has given the girls a special ser-mon. Among other things he said: \"Girls, watch your appearance. Angel Gabriel himself could not keep some company that girls do in Chicago and not be cor-rupted. We must be careful about this on earth for beauty and glory. Boys go in bad company, but the girls must be pure. Mr. Jones urged in a long description and denunciation of the present young women, and described the cause of their downfall as the dud-der-legged dude. Some mothers, he said, fixed their daughters to be little party girls for their children. A little party is a big party in short order. There was a loud party and then the hugging German. I want to have the grass growing on my grave. I want to be among attending Germans. After the Ger-mans, then what? I will not go there. Take care of yourself. If a man found priest who says that at his confessional nineteen out of every twenty young women who has stayed single has their full self-pity and virtue to the influence of the balloon.\"\n\nFor Boots & Shoes\n\nGO TO\n\nS.
