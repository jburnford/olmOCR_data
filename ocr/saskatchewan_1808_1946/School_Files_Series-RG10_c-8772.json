Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Canada,\nKamloops, B.C.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of your favour of August 7th in regard to the vertical boiler and regret the trouble you are having in connection with same.\n\nWe may say that before making shipment of the boiler it was put under test by our own mechanics and also was examined under test by the Boiler Inspection Department and everything was in first class condition, with no signs of weakness apparent.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the condition which you now find is simply due to ordinary contraction and expansion conditions and doubtless if the boiler was in operation for an extended time these leaks, which you mention, would take up.\n\nIn view of the test to which the boiler was submitted before shipment, we regret that we cannot see our way clear to agreeing to your request that this boiler be caulked at our expense. We would, however, be prepared to send a boiler maker to Kamloops to do this work without profit, or in other words, at our net cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVANCOUVER ENGINEERING WORKS, LTD.,\n\n(Signed) E. Redpath,\nGeneral Manager.\n\nAC/AMF.\n\nCOPY FOR INFORMATION OF:\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nK-S-2.\n\nDear Sir-\n\nIn connection with the Vertical Boiler in the Laundry at Kamloops Indian Residential School, Mr. T.J. Arnall, engineer of the Dominion Public Works, in his inspection report recommends as follows:\n\n\"Most of the tubes were leaking on top tube sheet; Seam in firebox leaking; Longitudinal Seam below butt strap leaking. These should be repaired by the Manufacturer without expense to the Department as this is a new boiler and has had every care. Safety valve set to correspond with steam requirements of laundry machinery.\"\n\nIn regard to this I wrote the Vancouver Engineering Works, Vancouver on the 7th instant, asking them to make the necessary repairs at their expense. A copy of this letter was forwarded to you. Since then I have had a reply from them, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.\n\nI am of the opinion that the responsibility for the condition of this boiler rests with the Manufacturers. Please advise me as to just what action I should take in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, September 1, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication you received from the Vancouver Engineering Works, Limited, regarding the condition of the vertical boiler in the laundry at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. It is noted that the Engineer of the Dominion Public Works Department, following his inspection, recommended considerable repairs to this boiler, as enumerated in your letter.\n\nThis boiler has been in use only about a year, and the Department fails to understand why it should be in its present condition. It is noted the Vancouver Engineering Works are of opinion that the present condition of the boiler is due to ordinary contraction and expansion and that this firm will be unable to carry out the necessary repairs at their own expense.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the Vancouver Engineering Works send a boiler maker to the school and carry out the repairs required to place the boiler in a satisfactory condition. All expenses for the purpose should be kept to the lowest possible point, and, when the work has been completed to the satisfaction of the Principal and yourself, you should obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, stating in detail the work carried out, the number of days or hours employed and the rate charged. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. I would request that you have the repairs made to this boiler at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.

They asked that the tank be sold to this firm. As it is contrary to government practice to sell property or articles of this nature, the tank was turned over to the Dominion Salvage Officer for disposal.\n\nIn August of last year a Minute was received from the Dominion Salvage Officer advising that the tank had been sold to F. W. Gale, Box 425 Kamloops for the sum of $15.00, the purchaser to pay all expenses in connection with the removal.\n\nA letter has been received in the Department dated October 6, from Mr. Gale, advising that the pneumatic tank has not yet been turned over to him. As this tank is his property having been sold to him by the Government Salvage Officer I would ask you to kindly communicate with Mr. Gale and arrange with the School to allow him to take possession and remove the tank.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Durante and Carr & Son respectively, for work in connection with repairs to Kamloops Indian residential School.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Carr's account, you will please note that it is $30.00 less than his tender of $210.00. The reason for this was that other urgent work showed up, and I decided that repairs to the Monel Metal sink in the Dairy ($30.00) should wait over for another year, and in place of this, I had the shingles on roof of gables on the girls' wing repaired by V. Durante ($30.00).\n\nIn regard to this extra shingling work I beg to say that when Mr. Blackbourn commenced the painting of the roof, it was found that the shingles on these roofs of the gables had become badly weathered and lifted some so bad that they had to be replaced and all the others renailed. Rather than delay the painting of this part of the building with everything all set, along with excellent weather, I had the work done and trust that you will approve of my action. When considering the first shingle repair job the gables were overlooked as the roofs of the gables were not visible from the ground.\n\nIn regard to the other item on Voucher 258-36, for cement piers, etc., ($25.00), these piers had to be installed to hold the wall radiators. Previous to the repairs the radiators had been fastened to the baseboard which was imbedded in the old plaster for support. When this plaster and baseboard was replaced with cement there was nothing left but tile and cement to which to fasten them. These new piers have a centre bolt with the head fastened into the cement of the floor.\n\nThis makes a total expenditure to date of $1696.00.\n\nR.C.

Durante proceed with the work.\n\nAnother job at the school which should be done this fall, if funds are available, is the painting of the cow barn. The outside walls are badly weathered and the siding is showing up through the paint. The same applies to the roof except it is in a worse condition than the walls.

Ferguson)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nKamloops, B.C.,\nAugust 29th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regards to Tender No. G.S. 1877, covering the disposal of one (1) Pneumatic Storage Tank at the Kamloops Residential School through the Government Contract Supervision Committee, beg to advise that Mr. Gale of this city has advised me that he was the successful bidder and now wishes to obtain possession of the property. I would therefore be obliged if the Department would instruct myself or the principal at the school to turn over this property to him.\n\nAlso in connection with this tank, there is a quantity of piping valves, etc., and an old dynamo, which were not included in the tender which called for just the tank. If it is the Department's intention that these articles should be included in the sale, please advise me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nWJF/BC\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCOPY.\nIn regard to your letter of the 13th instant, dealing with the sale of a Pneumatic Tank at Kamloops Indian Residential School to Mr. Gale, I beg to advise that on August 23rd, 1935, I wrote the Department in regard to this matter. A copy of my letter is enclosed herewith, to which I have not had a reply.\n\nMr. Gale claims that all the equipment, dynamo, piping, valves and other fittings should be turned over to him with the tank. In this I do not agree, as the tender definitely states \"one old pneumatic tank\". However, I will await the Department's instructions on this point.\n\nFrom the start there appears to have been a mix-up in this matter. Apparently the Water Power Branch recommended the sale of this tank without referring it to this office or the school, as the first I knew about it was when I received the tenders from the salvage office, and until today I had never been authorized to turn this tank over to Mr. Gale. Some time ago the building over the tank was locked up by the Water Power Branch, but I can get the key from them here when I have a reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(W. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOctober 31, 1956.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th with further reference to the sale of the pneumatic tank at the Kamloops School, I would advise Mr. Gale that the tank only was sold to him and the same should therefore be turned over to him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Principal to salvage any lumber from the building which can be used at the school. The walls have rotted, but the lumber in the roof is in fairly good shape.\n\nI trust that the Department will approve of my action in regards to the salvage of this material.\n\nI was out to the school today with Mr. Gale, the party who purchased the tank from Government Contract Supervision Committee some time ago, arranging for delivery of tank to him. Before the tank can be removed intact, it is necessary that the roof of the building must also be removed, and Mr. Gale has agreed to wait a week or so for his tank, to give the Reverend Principal time to salvage the lumber as referred to above.\n\nSince receipt of your letter of the 31st October, in connection with this tank, there has been some delay in taking action. This was due to the fact that the Dominion Water Power Bureau had locked the building and had the key in their possession.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.

Gale was accepted.\n\nIt is stated that Mr. Gale wished to take everything in the building, including a pump and dynamo, but it apparently was decided that he should take only the tank. The point at issue is not the pump and dynamo but Mr. Gale thinks the valves and fittings attached to the tank should go with it.\"\n\nWill you kindly furnish a report herein.\n\nW.J.F.

Gale, I would say that in May, 1935, the department was advised by the Dominion Water Power Branch that a pneumatic tank at the Kamloops Indian Residential School was of no further use and that an offer for same had been received from Fernie Bros. They asked that the tank be sold to this firm. As it is contrary to government practice to sell property or articles of this nature, the tank was turned over to the Dominion Salvage Officer for disposal.\n\nIn August of said year a Minute was received from the Dominion Salvage Officer advising that the tank had been sold to Mr. Gale, Box 482, Kamloops, for the sum of $15.00, the purchaser to pay all expenses in connection with the removal.\n\nA letter was received here dated October 6th, 1936, from Mr. Gale advising that the pneumatic tank had not been turned over to him. The Indian Agent was instructed on October 13th to communicate with Mr. Gale and arrange with the school authorities to allow him to take possession and remove the tank. On October 17th the Indian Agent wrote to the department stating that Mr. Gale claimed that all the equipment, including dynamo, piping and other fittings should be turned over to him with the tank. The Agent did not agree with this as the tender definitely stated the old pneumatic tank. The Indian Agent was advised on October 31st that the tank only was sold to Mr. Gale.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nJanuary 28, 1937.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nI have to refer to my memorandum of January 6 regarding tank sold by the Dominion Salvage Officer to Mr. F. A. Gale of Kamloops, B.C., and telephone conversation with Mr. Pratt in regard thereto of this date.\n\nThe matter has been discussed with Colonel Beer, who states that in his opinion there would be no objection to the equipment being turned over to Mr. Gale without further charge, as he considers that it is a natural assumption that this might have been included with the tank in the first place, although it was not mentioned specifically. If you so desire I shall instruct the Indian Agent accordingly.\n\nI may point out, however, that the amount paid by Mr. Gale represents a very small percentage of the value of the tank itself, without taking into account that of the equipment.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your instructions.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nJanuary 28, 1937\n\nMemoandum.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nI have to refer to my memorandum of January 6 regarding tank sold by the Dominion Salvage Officer to Mr. F.

Tennant, Medical Officer, Kamloops, B.C., dated March 31st, 1937.\n\nOriginal on File 300 C-3.\n\nThe school is still troubled with offensive sewage odors. I trust it will be possible to have repairs done this year. In case you have forgotten our troubles in this connection, I will give you a few details.\n\nThe tank is too small for the amount of sewage handled. Consequently, it passes through partly digested and clogs the beds. The disposal bed is placed in very fine silt which readily filters into the pipes helping to block them. The drains are also laid with too much fall. I suggest an extra tank be placed between the building and the automatic flush tank. Also that drains be lifted and placed in fresh soil with some fine gravel around the pipes to prevent silt getting in them.\nApril 15th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Dudley,\n\nIn our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38, the following items were included for the Kamloops Indian Residential School:\n\nInstallation septic tank - $2,000.\nMiscellaneous repairs - 200.\n\nYou will note, on this file, a copy of a recent letter from Dr. P. S. Tennant, Medical Officer, Kamloops, B. C.\n\nThe reports received from the Indian Agent and the Medical Officer during the past two or three years indicate that the present sewage disposal system at the Kamloops Residential School is not sufficiently large to do the work required.\n\nI feel that it is most important that something should be done to improve the sewage disposal system at this school and I recommend that the necessary action be taken in this regard at the earliest possible date.\n\nIn addition to the current file, I am sending you the previous file with a letter turned out showing that the sewage disposal system has been unsatisfactory for some time.\n\nChief, Training Division.\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building, 165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nAs the National Health Branch of this Department is interested in matters of water supply and sewage disposal we would deem it a favour if you would let us have a copy of any information and blueprints that may be available respecting methods used for the disposal of sewage at the Indian Industrial School at Kamloops, British Columbia. In connection with certain matters that are under the supervision of the National Health Branch it has been stated to this office that the sewer outfall at the Indian Industrial School at Kamloops is situated about one mile and a quarter upstream from the water supply intake of the Canadian National Railways for the Kamloops Junction coachyard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ASS'T.\nMay 8, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRegarding your inquiry of May 5th the sewage disposal system at the Indian Industrial School at Kamloops, B.C. is comprised briefly as follows:\n\nThe system is what is known as Septic Tank Sub-surface Irrigation System, and consists of a reinforced concrete septic tank connected with two disposal beds composed of 4 inch open jointed land tile laid 3'6\" below the surface of the ground.\n\nThe sewage is carried from the school by means of 4 inch sewer pipes to a main inspection chamber from whence it is transferred by means of an 8 inch sewer pipe to the septic tank.\n\nThe septic tank is divided into two compartments:\n\n1. Settling chamber or septic tank which is 15' x 7' x 9'6\" deep and is connected by a 5 foot overflow weir with the siphon chamber.\n\n2. The siphon chamber which is 15' x 7' x 6'6\" deep and is equipped with automatic siphon discharging four times a day under normal loads.\n\nThe discharge pipe from the septic tank to the disposal bed is a 6\" sewer pipe 210' in length.\n\nThe disposal beds are two in number consisting of 4\" land tile laid to conform with the contours of the ground on a grade of .005. The east bed consists of 2000 linear feet of land tile, and the west bed comprises 1500 linear feet. This gives a total disposal bed of 3500 linear feet.\n\nThe construction of this plant was carried out by contract under the supervision of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, Vancouver, in 1924. Detailed specifications and plans for this system are not available at hand, but if you...\nrequire them they will be procured and forwarded at your request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nC.

Brown of this Department, has been passed to this office for the attention of this Branch.\n\nFrom its description in your letter, the design of the septic tank sub-surface irrigation system at the Indian Industrial School at Kamloops, British Columbia, has some features that are not frequently used. In the event that such action meets with your approval, may our District Sanitary Engineer pay a visit to this sewage disposal works on the occasion of his next visit to Kamloops some time during the present year?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nCHIEF, PUBLIC HEALTH ENGINEERING DIVISION.\n\nGHF/EW.\nMay 14, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the sewage disposal system at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I would say that this branch would have no objection to your District Sanitary Engineer paying a visit to the Kamloops Indian Residential School to look at this system when he is in the vicinity of Kamloops.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFor Director of Indian Affairs.\n\nG.

The school building is situated at the southern extremity of a low ridge projecting from the hills to the north, and is at an elevation of about 25 feet above the bank of the South Thompson river. To the south and west are extensive river flats, most of which are covered with water at flood stage of the Thompson river.\n\nOccupying a considerable area of the School property on the river flats is a small lake used for bathing purposes by the school children. The lake surface varies in elevation four or five feet at medium and high stages of the river, when river and lake are directly connected by a small channel. At such times the lake area increases more than 50%.\n\nPRESENT SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM\n\nSewage disposal facilities consist of a septic tank of about 4,000 gallons capacity or about 13 gallons per head for the school population of approximately 325. The flow to the septic tank is approximately 12,000 gallons per day.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water and Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nEffluent from the septic tank is discharged at about 200 feet from the tank and finds its way by an open ditch to a small pond at the foot of the garden.\n\nWhen the sewage disposal system was first installed in 1924, it included a sub-irrigation system of about 0.35 acres to which was discharged the tank effluent. In 1930, however, the distribution pipes of the sub-irrigation system clogged up, were subsequently re-conditioned and operated successfully for two years when they again clogged and have not since functioned. The last time was due apparently to the fact that solids were passing from the settling chamber to the syphon chamber, as was evidenced by the condition of the pipes recently dug up.\n\nThe septic tank is in my opinion too small to accommodate the amount of debris which accumulates in a few months after being cleaned. The reduced capacity as a result of this accumulation causes an increased rate of flow through the tank resulting in decreased septization and the conveyance of solids to the syphon chamber. The function of the settling chamber appears to be nullified by the grade of the inlet pipe which allows a high velocity inflow and keeps the tank contents in an agitated state.\n\nIt would appear desirable to have an enlarged settling chamber capacity at least twice the existing capacity, or sufficient to accommodate from 16 to 24 hours sewage.\n\nThe major problem, however, appears to be a satisfactory disposal of septic tank effluent and sludge.\nThe present method of disposal of septic tank effluent, to the pond at the feet of the garden, is very unsanitary as at times a considerable amount of the effluent accumulates and the area becomes a breeding ground for flies. The stench from the area has become very much of a nuisance.\n\nMETHODS OF SEWAGE DISPOSAL\n\nIn addition to the inspection of the existing plant, I investigated the possibility of alternative methods of disposal of sewage both in a raw condition and after treatment.\n\nSewage in a raw state, from Kamloops School, may not be disposed of other than by emptying into the North Thompson river. To do this would require the construction of a pipeline about two and one-half miles in length. The pipeline grade, however, would be below the minimum for satisfactory conveyance.\n\nOn the attached plan are shown two projected sewer lines from the school to the Thompson river.\n\nLine \"A\" as above mentioned would be unsatisfactory due to insufficient grade. Line \"B\" would not be possible for raw sewage, due to location of C.H.R. pumphouse supplying Kamloops Junction, within a short distance of the projected sewer outfall.\n\nFor the discharge of treated or processed sewage to the South Thompson river, it would be desirable to have an outfall closer to the school and farther from the pump intakes, as dissemination in the river water would be more complete and the cost would be less.\n\nThe disposal of raw sewage by broad irrigation is not a practical possibility due to necessity of pumping to suitable ground and of using other methods.\nof disposal in winter.\n\nIt is probable that septic tank treatment of sewage at Kamloops School is preferable to any other process as it is as a rule the least expensive to operate, and provides an effluent easily disposed of and susceptible to subsequent treatment if found necessary. The sludge and detritus is reduced to a minimum and both are in a state readily and cheaply handled.\n\n**DISPOSAL OF SEPTIC TANK EFFLUENT**\n\nEffluent from septic tanks is not considered by most authorities to be free from disease producing bacteria, and for that reason subsequent treatment or disposal should be considered necessary at the Kamloops Industrial School, so as to preclude the possibility of endangering the health of the neighborhood.\n\nThe most readily available place of disposal would be the South Thompson river, where the low water flow would be sufficient to provide a dilution of about 1 in 62,000 \u2014 authorities consider that 1 in 50 to 100 is ample safeguard. However, it would probably be unwise to empty the septic tank effluent directly into the river even if subsequently chlorinated or filtered owing to the proximity of the City of Kamloops and other users, at least until other reasonable expedients have been exhausted.\n\nThe system of disposal by sub-irrigation is the method most suitable for adoption at the school. It is likely to prove the cheapest to install and operate, and least likely to create a nuisance. The area suitable for the purpose is limited to about one to one and one-half acres close to the septic tank.\nbut at a desirable distance from the river.\n\n**SUGGESTED SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM**\n\nI would suggest that the existing sewage disposal system be re-constructed with minor alterations to function as was originally intended. The septic tank capacity should be increased to take care of present requirements, sub-irrigation beds provided for disposal of the effluent and facilities for removing accumulation of sludge and detritus installed. Such a reconstructed system with the improvements and facilities mentioned, is estimated to cost complete $6015.00 and is as shown on attached plan Appendix \"B\".\n\n**SUB-IRRIGATION DISPOSAL BEDS**\n\nBeds suitable for disposal of septic tank effluent by sub-irrigation may be constructed at an estimated cost of $3745.00. Such an installation should consist of two units aggregating about one acre in area and so connected with the septic tank as to permit of alternate applications of the effluent to the beds at intervals of about six hours.\n\nTile in the existing disposal beds is laid at a depth of 4\u00bd feet. It is proposed that the new tile be laid at a depth of about 3 feet, which is expected will be sufficient depth for frost protection. It will be less expensive to install new tile than to dig up the old tile, clean it, and refill the trench, as a shift from the ground used for the former beds is required.\n\n**SEPTIC TANK ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS**\n\nProposals for the enlargement of the septic tank capacity, alterations to present tank, provision for sludge removal, alternating syphons, etc., are estimated to cost $2270.00.\nEnlargement of capacity would be obtained by providing an additional settling chamber of approximately the same content as the present one, with connection to the syphon chamber and provision for proportionate distribution of sewage to the two settling chambers. The present syphon chamber would be re-equipped with alternating syphons discharging to sub-irrigation beds.\n\nProvision for removal of sludge would consist of installation of hopper bottoms in settling tanks with 8-inch outlets and discharge pipes. The pipe outlet to be so located as to provide for discharge of sludge into a confined area in the garden to permit drying and subsequent removal.\n\nThe carrying out of the above alterations and enlargements should be undertaken during mid-summer school holidays, July or August, as the cost of the work would be at a minimum at that time and any interruption to the operation of the sewage disposal plant would not affect the school.\n\nRegarding the employment of funds, presently available, these could best be used in increasing the septic tank capacity and alterations to existing tank, estimated to cost $2270., to be followed by the installation, at a later date, of the disposal beds.\n\nMAINTENANCE OF SYSTEM\n\nMuch of the difficulty in connection with the satisfactory operation of the sewage disposal system has probably been due to lack of familiarity of the school staff with the operation of such systems. It would be desirable that written instructions regard-\ning the functioning of the equipment and its maintenance be accessible to the school authorities and that the school staff charged with such duties be informed of what is required to maintain the system in good order and at a minimum of expense.\n\nThe system should function from 2 to 3 years without the necessity of cleaning the settling tank, and it should not be necessary to clean the disposal beds oftener than once in ten years. While it should be possible to clean the beds at a very reasonable cost, probably not exceeding $150.00, sometimes it is necessary to have the tile completely dug up, if the septic tank effluent carries much sludge, as the soil becomes clogged. Under such conditions the cost of cleaning is very much higher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.G. Warren\nAsst.

Various reports on the unsuccessful operation of this installation were evidently received by the Indian Affairs Branch during 1935 and 1936 and it is understood that the appropriation of the Indian Affairs Branch of 1937-38 includes under Kamloops Indian Residential School the following:\n\nInstallation septic tanks ...... $2,000.00\nMiscellaneous repairs .......... 200.00\n\nOn reference of this question to one of our engineers Mr. Webb was written on the 21st of May last and in order to have up-to-date information, he was requested to have one of his engineers make an inspection of this sewage system and furnish a full report covering the work necessary to put the system in proper condition.\n\nI am now in receipt, from Mr. Webb, of a report prepared by Mr. Warren a copy of which accompanies this memorandum.\n\nIt appears that the situation in respect to sewage disposal from this institution is somewhat complicated, due to the Kamloops Residential School being situated on the north side of the South Thompson River, a mile or so above the city of Kamloops whose water supply is taken from the South Thompson River a short distance down stream.\n\nThe possibility of discharging the effluent, after treatment in septic tanks, directly into the South Thompson River was given consideration by Mr. Webb and in view of the volume of flow in this river it would seem that such would be a safe method of disposal. However, as the city of Kamloops takes their water supply from a point about half a mile down\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector, Surveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nstream from where the effluent from the school would have to be discharged, it was finally decided that it would be unwise to take any chances, however remote, of contaminating the city water supply. It will further be noted that the accompanying report of Mr. Warren recommends the enlargement of the present septic tank and the passing of the effluent into sub-irrigation beds. I concur in this recommendation and suggest it be submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch for their approval.\n\nIt would seem from information available that the existing system was designed for a much smaller population than now occupies the Indian School. For this reason, irrespective of the present condition of the system, it requires to be enlarged. This factor accounts for the comparatively large amount of money estimated as required. The approximate $6000 being therefore not merely for repairs to present system but also for its enlargement.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Warren recommends that the majority of the work should be carried out during the summer holiday season when the Indian children are away from the school. It is however Mr. Webb's opinion that the $2000.00 available this season might be used to increase the septic tank capacity which it will be noted Mr. Warren estimates would cost approximately $2270.00.\n\nI would be glad to be advised if this suggestion meets with your approval and if so the necessary actions will be taken for proceeding with this work this season.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(sgd.) T. S. Mills.\nJ.N.S.\nSeptember 4, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe - Kamloops Indian Residential School Sewage Disposal System\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer and a report from Mr. Webb prepared by Mr. Warren on the above sewage disposal system. You will note that the only alternative to providing for sub-irrigation beds after the enlargement of the present septic tank, is the discharging of the effluent directly into the South Thompson River and that as this involves a possible, though remote, contamination of the river water from which the City of Kamloops obtains its water supply, this is not advisable.\n\nMr. Warren's recommendation is, therefore, that the present septic tank be enlarged and the effluent be passed into sub-irrigation beds. The cost of this work is estimated at approximately $6,000. Mr. Warren further recommends that the majority of this work should be carried out as far as possible during the holiday season and that for this year the $2,200 provided in the Estimates be used for increasing the capacity of the septic tank.\n\nIf you approve, action will be taken to proceed with the work at once.\n\nDirector.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, September 9, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nThe Sewage Disposal System at the Kamloops Indian Residential School (electoral district of Kamloops) has not been working satisfactorily for some time and provision was made in the current year's appropriation for Indian education for improving it. The Surveys and Engineering Branch were requested to have one of their engineers make an inspection of this system and advise what is required to make the Sewage Disposal System operate satisfactorily.\n\nMr. C.H.

MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM ON THE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM OF THE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL AT KAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nExamined - Oct. 26th, 1937.\n\nPrincipal of School, - Father Kennedy.\n\nThe Indian Residential School is situated about three miles from the city of Kamloops on the north bank of the South Thompson River and was visited on the above date in order to determine what influence the school's sewage disposal system might possibly have in polluting the South Thompson River which is used as a source of water supply by Kamloops and the Canadian National Railways at Kamloops Junction, the intakes being located on opposite sides of the river two miles below the school. The water from each supply is delivered for consumption in the raw state.\n\nFrom the months of September to June inclusive the resident population at the school is 314 while during the summer months it drops to 15. The method of disposing of the domestic sewage from this source may be described as follows. A gravity source of water supply of ample quantity permits the use of numerous flush type toilets in the school which all drain through 4-inch sewer pipes to a main inspection chamber from whence the sewage is conveyed through an 8-inch pipe to a covered reinforced concrete septic tank of two chambers with given dimensions of 15 ft. by 7 ft. by 9\u00bd ft. deep for the settling chamber and 15 ft. by 7 ft. by 6\u00bd ft. deep for the dosing or siphon chamber. The liquid effluent from the tank discharges through a 6-inch pipe to a disposal field, 210 feet distant, consisting of 3,500 linear feet of open jointed 4-inch field tile laid at a depth of 3ft.-6in. in gravelly soil. The ends of the branches are provided with vents.\n\nAn examination of the system disclosed that the sub-\nsurface irrigation part was not functioning at all, having been clogged up for some time. The effluent from the tank had a very strong odor from the putrescible organic matter in it and was being discharged into an open ditch, finally collecting in a shallow hollow about 1,000 feet from the bank of the river and at an elevation of about 20 feet above it. The soil at this point appears to be heavy clay so that the liquid does not run away freely. (see Photo No. 3.)\n\nThe contour of the ground is such that a rim exists between this hollow and the bank of the river preventing any of the sewage from flowing directly into the river. However, the presence of a small slough to the west of the school, (Photo No. 2), which is known to rise and fall with the level of the Thompson River suggests that there may be a possible connection with the river providing an indirect means for this sewage to reach and pollute it, endangering the quality of the water at the municipal intake.\n\nFrom a calculation of the capacity of the present system it is apparent that the tank and the disposal field are inadequate for the amount of sewage to be handled with the consequent results from overloading. From 40 to 60 gallons of sewage per capita per day are usually allowed for in designing a tank. Assuming a flow of 40 gallons per capita and an average detention period of 24 hours the settling tank should hold 14,420 gallons which includes a 15% allowance for sludge. This requirement is in contrast to the maximum capacity of the present tank of 6,250 gallons. For a subsurface irrigation system, from 20 to 60 linear feet of field tile per capita is required, the length depending upon the character of the soil. Using the minimum figure of 20 feet per capita at least 6,000 feet of disposal trench would be needed in contrast to the present 3,500 feet. Difficulties are\nIndian School, Kamloops, B.C.\n\npresent in laying out a disposal field as the soil appears to consist of separate layers of gravel and impervious clay so that the porosity varies considerably. The present disposal field has been laid out in a gravelly area south of the playground.\n\nIn conclusion the inadequate capacity of the present sewage disposal system gives rise to local nuisance conditions and there is a possibility that the pollution from this source may contaminate the South Thompson River through seepage or being washed in during heavy rains and thus affecting the quality of the Kamloops water supply.\n\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\n\nNo. 1.

At the same time, Mr. Webb, our District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, does not consider it advisable to attempt work on the septic tank at Kamloops during the cold winter months and suggests that the start of the work be deferred until early in February. It would of course be borne in mind that it should be completed before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nWould you kindly advise me if this arrangement would be satisfactory to you.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM: Mr. Wardle.\n\nI have your memorandum of November 20th with reference to the sewage disposal system at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI note that your Chief Engineer states that it is inadvisable to commence the work at the present time.\n\nI hope, however, that you will give definite instructions to have the work started about February 1st, in order that it may be completed before March 31st. Funds for the purpose are available in this year's appropriation, but no provision for increasing the size of the sewage disposal system at this school has been made in our estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39.\n\nAs I presume you are aware, we have already transferred to your branch the amount of $2,200.\n\nDirector.\nKAMLOOPS AGENCY\n\nKamloops, B.C., November 25th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 6th inst., in which I requisitioned a French Range for Kamloops Indian Residential School, at a cost of $850.00 installed, I beg to advise that the Rev.

However, before receiving your letter of November 6th, the Department received a communication from Commissioner MacKay, in which he pointed out the necessity for repairing the boilers at the Kamloops School at a cost of $760. This latter expenditure was authorized and, as a result, the amount provided in the current year's appropriation has already been exceeded.\n\nAfter giving the matter very careful consideration, I find that we can allow an amount of $350. for a new range at this school. Purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list. I have reviewed our list and do not find the name of Enamel Heating Products Company, Limited, mentioned in your letter of November 6th. If you cannot secure a suitable range from someone on the approved list in Kamloops, it would be advisable to consult Indian Commissioner MacKay before making a purchase.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Tennant, Medical Superintendent,\nKamloops, British Columbia, with reference\nto Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on file 154-0-13.\n\n\"Father Kennedy has several difficulties at the present time, and has complained about them to me. He has abortion among his herd of cows, and this is threatening the milk supply at the school as most of the calves die, due to the fact that the school has only one barn, which makes it impossible to segregate infected animals from healthy ones, and it also makes it impossible to build up a healthy herd again. Apart from the question of disease, more barn room is needed, and the Principal is quite ready and willing to provide more cows for a larger supply of milk. In this we should encourage him. The milk house is an unsanitary old shack which should be condemned.\n\nSince I have been in Kamloops, the Principals of the School have been requesting recreation rooms for the children. Basements with cement floors are not ideal for gymnastics and are not suitable for indoor sports, the ceilings being low. As a result of the children playing on cement floors I have had three fractured elbows during the last month.\n\nI presume that shortage of finance would not make the building of a recreation hall a possibility in the immediate future, but I do think that the cow barn situation is a matter of urgency, and if you can afford any assistance in procuring the barn for the school, I hope you will do so.\"\nH.

Normally the stable accommodation at the school is too small to provide a milk supply for a school population of 300. At the present time the school is experiencing great difficulty due to the present of infectious abortion in the herd of cows.

Tennant.\nMedical Superintendent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 26, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated November 30 last Doctor Tennant stated that there was contagious abortion among the herd of cows at the Kamloops School and that this threatened the milk supply. He recommended the erection of an additional barn. No immediate action was taken on this letter owing to the fact that the Department had no funds for the purpose.\n\nI am now in receipt of another letter from Doctor Tennant dated the 17th instant which reads as follows:\n\n\"I would like to know how my recommendation for another barn at Kamloops Residential School was received by the School Branch.

The new 2 oven range purchased last month was also installed and is giving perfect satisfaction to the cooking staff at the school. Previous to this installation, considerable discomfort was experienced by the staff when the fires were lit in both ranges in the morning from smoke backing up and clouding the kitchen from poor draught. This has been overcome by finding that the chimney carries two flues instead of one as believed before. The new range has been connected with the second flue and the Sisters in charge of the kitchen are now all smiles, and the agent can now go into the kitchen without having to make excuses for the supposed faulty chimney construction.\n\nW.

Ferguson,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson:\n\nOn the occasion of the visit to the School of Major McKay, Indian Commissioner, we brought up the question of the need of an auditorium in connection with the School. At that time both you and Major Mackay asked me to send you a detailed report of the whole question and you both promised your whole-hearted cooperation. Owing to circumstances over which I had no control I have been unable to take up this matter till the present time. I am sure you will understand that my delay in writing to you regarding the question of an auditorium is not due to any lack of interest concerning this need at the School.\n\nAmong the many reasons which might be given to prove the necessity of an auditorium at this School I shall refer to only one. I feel that one of the reasons why the Indians do not make greater progress in spite of all the sacrifices that are made for their welfare and in spite of all that the Department is doing for them is the fact that they have little ambition and that notwithstanding their racial pride they have little or no confidence in themselves. In the things that really count from the point of view of the Department and the Church, they are struggling against an inferiority complex. This is my personal opinion. Whether right or wrong, I have acted according to this opinion which for me is a certainty and I think I can say that I have obtained results. I have told the children that they can succeed as well as any other children if they only make up their minds to do so and in the few times they appeared in public they fully well proved my contention. On one occasion Mr. T.O. Hill was as well pleased with the performance of the children that he publicly promised, when in Ottawa, to speak of it to the Hon. Mr. Crearar, Minister of Mines & Resources in charge of Indian Affairs. Although the children have done well on every occasion when they appeared before the public they have not really been given a chance to do their best as we have no facilities to train them. Did we have a hall here which the children could use for recreation and in which they could be trained for public performances, to which the public could be invited and in which the children would feel at home, I am sure that we could prove to the public of, at least, this part of the country that the sacrifices that are being made and that the money that is being spent by the Department is not being wasted.\n\nIn one of the circulars sent out by Mr. R.A. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, he asked for suggestions regarding the manner in which the methods employed could be improved. (of Ottawa: 503-658, May 15, 1937). At that time I made no suggestions as I did not know what the Department would be willing to do. Now, I would like to make this suggestion:\nKindly ask the Department to allow me to put up an Auditorium. I shall be glad if it is put up without extra cost to the Department. I would like you, Mr. Ferguson, to cooperate with me in this matter as you have cooperated with me in the past. I would ask you to supervise this whole undertaking, to see that no money be spent that would endanger the good financial standing which this school has and which is granted to this school by all business men who have dealings with us. I would ask that you see that the building is put up according to the requirements of the Department. As I have been successful in financing the School in the past I am sure that I can accept this extra financial burden without in any way imposing on the children that is by taking from them what is their due in regard to food or clothing. Could the Department see their way to give a more generous grant to the technical school in the way of material and also could they give a contribution towards putting in a new technical class room in a semi-basement under the auditorium? I would be very grateful.\n\nHowever, I would like you to obtain permission from the Department according to the following specifications. (More or less.)\n\nA frame building 62 by 104 feet at the rear of the school placed close to the boiler with an entrance convenient for both boys and girls.\n\nThe height from floor to ceiling 26 ft.\nBasket court 46 by 76 ft.\nStage and Dressing Rooms 62 by 14 ft.\nCloak Rooms and Main Entrance 62 by 14 ft.\n\nThere would be a Projection Room above the Cloak Rooms for the Moving Picture Machine. There could be a gallery above the Cloak Rooms for seats as well as a seating space of eight feet on each side of the hall. Were the building put up close to the school it could be heated at very little extra cost by having the heating system connected up with the heating instalment of the school.\n\nI have given this matter very careful thought during the past two years and I consulted men of experience who are interested, and I was assured that the cost would not be over $4,000 for the building I had in mind. Were I not sure that I could complete the building I would be willing to be careful and wait till finances would permit to complete the work.\n\nEventually the building could be brick veneered to correspond with the general outlines of the school building or if the Department agreed it could be finished in stucco.\n\nWere it possible to get this permission very soon, I would be very thankful as I could start the work at once.\n\nThanking you for whatever you may be able to do to help me out in this matter and for all past favours, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nThomas M. Kennedy, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nKamloops, B.C., February 26th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from the Rev. Father Kennedy, C.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Residential School, in which, among other matters, he requests that he be granted permission to erect a suitable auditorium in connection with the school, the cost of construction to be paid for from school funds.\n\nIn the past few years the Rev. Principal has certainly brought the children of the school before the public eye in the way of physical training, band playing and drill work, and there is certainly much credit coming to him. The present quarters for this class of training at the school is limited, and he is unable to do justice in his efforts in this aspect. If the Department fails to take cognizance of training, which I think we should do after seeing the splendid progress in this connection at the school, the Rev. Father should certainly have adequate quarters, and in consideration of the proposal that the auditorium will be built without direct cost to the Department, I favour the ideal, and the proposition should be encouraged as much as possible.\n\nOne point that enters into the construction of this building as planned is that it is of wooden structure. The proposal is to build it at the rear of the boiler room. This will bring it in between the boys' wing and the Chapel. The question is, how much of a fire hazard this wooden structure would be to the rest of the building. The present wings on both sides, and the boiler house, the nearest parts of the house to the proposed structure are of brick construction, and possibly with the fire protective equipment we have at the school they might withstand serious damage should the proposed building burn up. This is a point that can be decided on by the Department engineers and architects.\n\nThe Rev. Father mentions in his letter the possibility of a contribution from the Department towards putting in a technical classroom in the semi-basement under the proposed building. I agree with this as a very good suggestion if the building is gone ahead with. The present\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 8, VANCOUVER, B.C.\nquarters of the technical class are inadequate. It is an old, stove-heated, frame building set away some considerable distance from the main buildings. It is too small for the number of pupils who should be in the class at the same time. A new class-room of sufficient size, properly equipped would be of much benefit to the pupil in the teaching of this class of work, which is of so much importance to the progress of the young men after leaving the school, and I would state that this point is worthy of much consideration by the Department.\n\nIn regard to the heating of this proposed building, the present boilers at the school are about double the capacity requirement for the heating of the school, and sufficient to heat the new building, and would therefore not tax the present equipment to any extent.\n\nMy suggestion in the matter is that if the fire hazard angle does not enter into the proposition to any great degree, we have the Rev. Father prepare a plan of the building proposed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a communication received from the Rev. T.M. Kennedy, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, addressed to Mr. Indian Agent W.J. Ferguson, Kamloops, B.C., and a copy of Mr. Ferguson's covering letter. In connection with the proposal of the Principal to erect\u2014mainly out of school funds\u2014an auditorium building, I may say that this matter has been discussed at some length with our Inspector of Schools. Inspector Barry is strongly in favor of the proposal, firstly, because of the present lack of accommodation for band and drill work and the physical training of the boys, and secondly, to allow for proper accommodation for Manual Training in the basement of the proposed building.\n\nIn this connection Inspector Barry recommends that a small extra grant be made to the school for the fitting up of the proposed new Manual Training shop. In other respects the Inspector supports the views advanced by Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Kamloops Indian Residential School is the largest Indian School in the Province and at present without any auditorium, I would recommend the proposal of the Rev. T.M. Kennedy to the favorable consideration of the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl\nWEC/AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 10, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing letters received from Mr. Ferguson and the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School in connection with the erection of an auditorium.\n\nIt is noted from the Principal's letter that he is prepared to erect this building from school funds. You may advise him that the Department approves his action in this regard. It is expected, of course, that every precaution will be taken to keep fire risk at a minimum.\n\nThe proposal to have a technical classroom in the basement of this new building is a good one. However, from the information contained in the Principal's letter it is not possible to decide the amount of assistance which we can give.\n\nPlease let me have full particulars regarding the material which the Principal requests that we supply. At the same time you should give an estimate of its cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

It is expected, of course, that every precaution will be taken to keep fire risk at a minimum.\n\nPart of your letter reads as follows:\n\n\"Could the Department see their way to give a more generous grant to the technical school in the way of material and also could they give a contribution toward putting in a new technical classroom in a semi-basement under the auditorium?\"\n\nI would appreciate your forwarding me more specific information regarding what you wish us to do.

The kitchen was flooded and Mr. Carr was called in to make the necessary repairs.\n\nWhen I applied for funds to carry out the other roof repairs, I had this item in mind, and included it in the sum asked for, which was allowed under authority of Departmental Letter No. 154-0-5, October 29, 1937.\n\nNew Voucher No. 647-37, covering this account is enclosed herewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J. Ferguson\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to thank you most sincerely for your kind letter of the 12th (File 154-0-5.)\n\nI would have written sooner to thank you for the information you gave me that the Department has no objection to my erecting a new auditorium the cost of which will be met from school funds but I waited to be able to send you details regarding the building I wish to put up. I have been unable to get all the details yet. I do not, however, wish to delay any longer in expressing my gratitude to you for this special favour on behalf of the children. They are most enthusiastic.\n\nAs soon as I received your letter, I called up a man who was recommended to me as being one of the best contractors in Kamloops. He is now working on the third plan. His first plans were far too elaborate. I find that the cost of a semi-basement would be approximately $2000.00. This extra cost cannot be met out of school funds and I would not feel justified in even suggesting that the Department contribute this amount especially as there is so much other important work to be done such as a new barn, the replacement of the cold storage system and general repair work around the school for the upkeep of the buildings.\n\nI am certain that we can put up a very creditable building with the funds we have. We might save money by hiring a few men and having our boys help but I am afraid that there might be an accident and some of the boys might be hurt and then what we save might might be only at the expense of the solidity of the building. I prefer to give the contract to a reliable man who will assume full responsibility and take every precaution.\n\nWhen I receive the plans and have had time to study them I shall write again and give you estimates on cost of material which the Department might see fit to contribute for completing the building which work will be done by the boys of the technical school. At the same time I shall have an estimate of cost of paint for the outbuildings and varnish for some of the floors especially for the girls recreation floor. I do not think the cost would be very great and it is very important that the work be done as soon as possible. All this work could be done by the boys and would be a good training for them instead of making little boxes for exhibitions. I am very grateful to you for having suggested in your letter that I do this.\nI had not intended writing at such a great length at least this time but I feel I should not close without saying a few words about the school. I am sure you will feel pleased to know that I am confident that this is the best year we have had in the school since my coming here. There is a wonderful spirit among the children. We have had no trouble with them. Their health has been good. Of course with the number of children we have there are bound to be exceptions to all this but they have been few and far between.\n\nThanking you once more for your kindness, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Kamloops School Sewage Disposal\n\nDuring the construction of the addition and improvements to the septic tank for Kamloops School, I found that at a depth of about 7 feet the soil was much more suitable for the absorption of septic tank effluent than at a depth of 3\u00bd to 4 feet.\n\nThe original underground disposal bed was at the shallower depth and it had been planned to enlarge and renew the underground disposal system at about the same average depth. I would suggest that when and if the underground disposal system for septic tank effluent is adopted that the beds be constructed at about 7 feet in depth. I made several tests and found good clean gravel to a depth of 14 feet. As to what greater depth the gravel reached I could not readily determine.\n\nThis gravel stratum outcrops on the bank of the South Thompson river but with the disposal beds at a minimum distance of 150 yards or more from the river filtering should be complete. By increasing the trench width and the use of several rows of large tile in one trench, the capacity of the disposal bed area may be kept at the necessary capacity and the cost of installation considerably reduced, probably as much as 25% or 30% from the estimate given in my report of July, 1937, approximately $3750.\n\nBefore undertaking the construction of underground disposal beds it would be desirable to observe the results from the present method of effluent disposal, that is surface irrigation of the garden area. The system has only been in operation for about two months and in approximately one month the school population will be considerably reduced until about September 1st. An inspection will be made about the end of September or early in October to see what the results have been both in the operation of the septic tank system and in the disposal of the tank effluent.\n\n(SGD) W.G. Warren.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJune 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Kamloops School Sewage Disposal System.\n\nCertain improvements were made to the sewage disposal plant at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in the past fiscal year and consisted in an addition to the septic tank settling chamber cage as shown in plan accompanying Mr. Warren's report of August 20, 1937, the construction of a sludge pipeline to the site of a proposed garden drying pond, a change in the location of the effluent pipeline and its extension to the garden. This latter is additional to the plan of disposal contained in Mr. Warren's report above referred to and may be considered a temporary measure in substitution of the underground effluent disposal recommended.\n\nThe usefulness of this effluent extension to the garden will almost entirely depend on how effectively the garden irrigator will distribute the effluent over the area of the garden below the ditch. It may be that this temporary measure will prove to be satisfactory and no further underground disposal beds required.\n\nThe cost of the work done as above referred to, was $2153.70. The sludge drying basin remains to be completed at an estimated cost of $130. I would recommend that provision be made for the construction of this basin within the next year.\n\nWe propose to make an inspection of the plant sometime during the present summer to see that it is operating satisfactorily, following which full instructions on the care and operation of the plant concerned will be prepared for the guidance of the school officials.\n\nIn connection with this matter I am enclosing, for your reference, a memorandum by Mr. Whitehouse dated June 1st, wherein reference is made to the soil conditions at the school and the possibility that some change may be made in the original proposals re underground beds should this be found necessary.\n\nThere is attached hereto a plan of the sewage disposal system for Kamloops Indian Residential School dated May 18, 1938, showing the details of the existing plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E.

I think this may be laid against the original contractor who evidently used poor material in the construction of these roofs.\n\nHowever that cannot be helped now, and to avoid damage to the interior of the building by heavy rain this fall, it will be necessary to have this roof repaired.\n\nH.J. Giddens & Son who are on the approved list examined the roof and I consider the price of $25.00 tendered by them as being fair for the work, and I would recommend that the work be done and the tender accepted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

Ferguson,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson:\n\nWhen Mr. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training was here at the School, I spoke to him about getting help from the Department regarding the completing of our new auditorium. He asked me to send in my requisition by writing.\n\nMr. H.J. Davies, the contractor who put up the main construction gave me a price of $1235.00 to complete the exterior of the building. The Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Co. contracted to put in a satisfactory heating system for $1400. The cost of lumber for completing the interior is $1000.00. This work could be done by the boys in the technical school, and thus save the cost of labour.\n\nIn order to complete the building before the cold weather sets in I would ask if it would not be possible for the Department to make a grant of $1000.00. The cost so far has been $3300.00. Did I receive this grant, it would then be more easy for me to get permission from the Church Authorities to spend the balance from school funds in completing the building.\n\nWhether or not it is possible to obtain this grant I would ask for the following consideration from the Department:\n\nDuring the quarter ending Dec. 1937, we had 4-16 children over the quota. In March quarter 11-66 and during the June quarter 9-64. These children were accepted owing to home conditions being poor and on request of the agents. These children over the quota at $25.00 per quarter per child would mean $1015.00. Could the Department not see their way to granting us this amount or part thereof which could be spent on the Auditorium.\n\nI am sending in a requisition for building material for the Auditorium. This could be given as a grant as material for the technical School, and would all be used up during the year by the pupils and thus enable us to keep this large class busy without the necessity of the school paying out of its grant what had to be paid in the past to keep the technical school open during the year.\n\nMr. H.J. Davies, gave me a tender of $2200.00 to build a new technical school in connection with the auditorium, of 30 by 50 feet at the same time making provision for four garages. Were this built by the boys of the school, I feel that there would be quite a saving. Were the Department able to give me a grant towards this, with permission to use this grant at the present time on the auditorium, the boys of the technical school could then gradually build the technical school out of school funds and the yearly grant for technical work granted by the Department.\nI would also like to get a grant to buy paint for the painting of the outbuildings. This would protect the buildings and would give a very attractive appearance to the layout we now have here. We would need:\n\nTo stain the roofs of 13,600 sq.ft. 90 gals.\nTo paint silo 1,700 \" \" 8 gals\nTo paint walls 17,500 \" \" 45 gals\nFor trimmings 9 gals.\n\nI am most anxious, as you know, to have the auditorium completed as soon as possible.

Baxter, O.M.I.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith two letters from the Reverend Principal of Kamloops Residential School, concerning assistance from the Department in connection with the new auditorium, and other matters at the school.\n\nThe school request is quite large and I am not prepared to make a recommendation until I have the views of the Department in the matter.\n\nBesides the improvement requested in the enclosed letters there is the question of more stable accommodation for the dairy cattle at the school, and also the erection of a new 16'x24' dairy.\n\nIn regard to this new barn, the proposition now is to remodel the floor plan of 38 feet of the north end of the present barn. This would call for the tearing out of the calf and bull pens and the horse stalls, which would be replaced with cow stalls to the number of 20, ten on each side, and with the present 22 stalls, this would give them accommodation for 42 cows, and they would all be in the one building.\n\nTo take care of the horses, calves, bulls and sick stock, it is proposed to build a new barn with room for two bull pens, 2 calf pens, 1 maternity pen and 1 pen for miscellaneous stock, and an isolation room 15'x17' for sick stock. This room would be partitioned off from the rest of the barn with a solid wall, with an entrance from outside. The length over all of this barn would be 60', with a width of 24'. The equipment from the old barn, bull pens, calf pen, stalls, etc., could be installed in the new barn, but for the 20 new stalls in the old barn equipment would have to be purchased for these.\n\nI am giving you this rough outline so that you may know what is required at the school when considering the enclosed requests of the Rev. Principal.\n\nIn regard to this stable accommodation, I would recommend that this proposal be given consideration, and as much of the work carried out this year as there are funds available for this purpose.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nIf you will advise me as to the amount of funds available for this year, I will have a detailed plan prepared, along with more complete information, and will also submit an estimate of the cost of the proposals.\n\nIn regard to the paint referred to in the Rev. Principal's letter, part of this, enough for the old barn, was requisitioned for by me on June 29th last, but authority for the purchase has not as yet reached me. When it does, and has been applied to the barn by the staff at the school, a further supply will be requisitioned for the rest of the outbuildings.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 29, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant you may incur an expenditure of $25.00 in repairing the roof at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.

No doubt he discussed with the Principal the matters mentioned in your letter. Unfortunately, owing to illness, Mr. Hoey has not yet returned to duty but I expect he will be in the office within the next week or so and at that time I will direct his attention to your recent communication. I might add that as you were informed in my letter of the 6th instant the paint requested in your letter of June 29 is being ordered by the Purchasing Agent and should reach the school in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW.

The firm of Kennedy & Woodward is non-existent. The Pondosa Pine Lumber Co. have mill at Westwold, but have no local office and also refused to tender on previous orders.\n\nYou will note that all the new written tenders are much lower than Mr. H. J. Davies' verbal tender. After Mr. Davies on the 26th ultimo gave me his prices, I called all the other firms by telephone who have tendered as per this letter and they were all higher in price than he was. Now they have somewhat reduced their prices.\n\nAt the present time and during the past week Mr. Davies has been out of town and I have not been able to get a new tender from him. However, he is expected back next week and as soon as he is, I will get a new tender from him if he cares to. I will telegraph the amount to the Department and hence avoid delay.\n\nWith these new purchasing regulations, there is some confusion. One time I will send in wholesale prices. This will be referred back for local tenders. These are sent in and in the end the purchase is made in Vancouver or somewhere else.\n\nGordon Grant, a railroad employee, has given an order -\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nan order for lumber.

BAILEY\n\nRe: Building material for Kamloops Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of the 22nd instant I am sending forward, herewith, copy of a telegram received today from W. J. Ferguson, Indian Agent, Kamloops, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. R.A.Hoey,\n\nWith reference to your requisition of August 31st, for lumber, etc., required for the Kamloops Indian Residential School, if you will refer to this you will note that the Indian Agent recommended the purchase of materials from H. J. Davies, Contractor, whose prices amounted to $961.70. The Agent further stated that he had made enquiries from other dealers and contractors and that the prices quoted by Davies were as low as could be obtained in Kamloops. We requested you to forward the names of other parties asked to quote and to let us have the original tenders. From the Agent's letter dated the 17th instant it now appears that he had not secured tenders until requested to do so at the later date.\n\nThe procedure has been quite irregular. As you will note, the first quotation secured from Mr. Davies was $961.70. The tender reported in the Agent's letter of the 17th instant, from the same man, amounts to $968.35. Again, in the Agent's wire of the 23rd instant, this tender is reported as $910.85. In view of these irregularities it has been decided to call for new tenders from Head Office.\n\nThe Indian Agent, W.J.Ferguson, complains that the new regulations have caused him some confusion. It does not appear to me that the Purchasing Regulations should be difficult to understand if trouble were taken to read them carefully.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson.\n\nOn the 31st August there was submitted to your office by the Indian Affairs a requisition for lumber required for repairs to the Kamloops Indian Residential School (copy enclosed). On this requisition appears the following note:\n\n\"The Indian Agent secured the above prices from H.J. Davies, Contractor, Kamloops, B.C. He further states that he made enquiries from other dealers and contractors and that the prices quoted above are as low as can be obtained in Kamloops. The Indian Agent states that the material is needed immediately.\"\n\nThe principle of the purchase was approved by you and passed on to me on September 2nd. Upon receipt of this I enquired of the Indian Affairs what other firms and contractors in Kamloops had been asked to quote and what prices had been submitted. This information was not available in the Indian Affairs Branch and evidently they wired to Mr. Ferguson, Indian Agent, on the 10th, to which he replied by letter on September 17th (copy enclosed). With this letter there were also quotations as follows:\n\nKamloops Lumber Co., Ltd., $920.85\nInland Building Supplies, Ltd., 898.70\nF.D. Woodward, 928.35\n\nOn September 23rd I received a copy of a wire from Mr. Ferguson, stating:\n\n\"Re building material for school, reference my letter 17th, Davies' tender $910.85.\"\nYou will note that the requisition of August 31st gave the quotation of H.J.Davies as $961.70, while the Indian Agent's letter of September 17th gave Mr. Davies' tender price as $968.35. Three different quotations have been offered by Mr.Davies and as yet we have not received any tender from him. Of course, this information may be on record in the Agent's office.\n\nIn view of the irregularity in dealing with this tender it was decided that we would call for new tenders. These were invited on the 27th ultimo and are due on October 10th.\n\nFrom the evidence on file it would appear that tenders had not been invited until after Mr.Ferguson was in receipt of the department's wire of the 10th ultimo; also, that quotations were invited by Mr.Ferguson from two firms not on the preferred list, viz:-\n\nInland Building Supplies,Ltd.;\nKamloops Lumber Co., Ltd.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nOttawa, October 5th, 1938.\n\nDr. H.W.

I also noted that there were only eight different items on this requisition. If this requisition had been sent in the proper manner by you in the first place, there would not have been any further correspondence in this connection\u2014it would have saved several letters and two or three telegrams.\n\nYou have had previous instructions to obtain tenders from those on the approved list, and I might call your attention to the fact that getting prices over the telephone is not a tender. If you had taken the trouble to go to those on the approved list in Kamloops and asked them for a tender in writing and signed by them, and then submitted them with your requisition, the matter would have been dealt with immediately. Instead of that, you go to Mr. H. J. Davis and get a verbal tender from him which was not acceptable by the Purchasing Agent. I note that by taking the steps Mr. Bailey did, the price quoted by Mr. Davis has been reduced from $968.35 to $910.85. Apparently Mr. Davies made still another quotation as in one instance I note he has quoted $961.70.\n\nIn view of all these irregularities, it has been decided.....\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\ndecided to call for a new tender from Head Office.\n\nThe last three paragraphs of your letter, above referred to, are uncalled for. You will readily understand that the Government of Canada reserves the right to place their business where they may see fit no matter what the opinion of an Indian Agent might be. You have received definite instructions regarding purchases and I fail to see why further instructions should be necessary or would facilitate matters in any way. Personally, I think that the whole matter can be traced back to your office\u2014in your unwillingness to cooperate with the new purchasing regulations.\n\nIn due course, I shall expect to receive a reply to this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Superintendent\nof Agencies.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** R.C.

The present fire fighting equipment at the school is in poor shape and this purchase referred to should be made as soon as funds are available. Work on the laying of the new floor in the girls' recreation room was commenced at the last of the month.\n\nW. J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent.\nKAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nDuring the month the old French range was overhauled, new plates on the top were installed, and the fire side of the oven covered with asbestos. A porch entrance where the roof was leaking was repaired at a cost of twenty-five dollars.\n\nW. J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent.\nOctober 28, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. R.A.Hoey.\n\nWith reference to your requisition of August 31st, for a quantity of lumber required for the Kamloops Indian Residential School (copy of requisition enclosed), you will note that this requisition stated:\n\n\"The Indian Agent secured the above prices from Mr. H.J.Davies, Contractor, Kamloops, B.C. He further states that he made enquiries from other dealers and contractors, and that the prices noted above are as low as can be obtained in Kamloops. The Indian Agent states that the material is needed immediately.\"\n\nUpon receipt of this requisition I wrote you on September 9th as follows:\n\n\"Confirming telephone request of even date to Mr.Phelan, with reference to building material requisitioned for repairs to Kamloops Indian Residential School, your file 154-0-5, will you please arrange to advise me as to what firms and contractors in Kamloops, B.C., were asked to quote by the Indian Agent, and what were the prices they quoted.\n\n\"Upon receipt of this information I will arrange to secure delivery at earliest possible date.\n\n\"We should have originals of tenders.\"\n\nEvidently, in turn, you wrote to Mr.Ferguson, Indian Agent at Kamloops, who then secured new tenders (copies enclosed), forwarding the same under cover of his memorandum of September 17th. You will note that of these tenders forwarded by Mr.Ferguson on September 17th two of the firms,\nviz: Inland Building Supplies, Ltd., and Kamloops Lumber Company, Ltd., are not on the preferred list. Why did Mr. Ferguson invite these firms to tender? Further, from Mr. Ferguson's memorandum I infer that formal tenders had not been secured by him prior to submitting his requisition of August 31st.\n\nI therefore reported the circumstances to Mr. Jackson and received verbal instructions that, because of irregularities in calling for tenders, it would be necessary to issue a new call. Accordingly, this call was issued on September 27th to the following firms:\n\nR. Carswell & Co., Kamloops, B.C.\nPondosa Pine Lumber Co., \"\nF. D. Woodward, \"\nH. J. Davies, \"\n\nThe tenders were due on October 10th, but only one was received, viz: that of F.D.Woodward (copy enclosed), $943.80, while his earlier tender was $920.80, an increase of $23.00. It is difficult to understand why this tender should have been increased, or to understand the various prices of Mr. H. J. Davies, as reported by Mr. Ferguson.\n\nThe above circumstances were reported to Mr. Jackson in detail on October 4th. (Copy of memorandum enclosed.)\n\nThe whole transaction has been very unsatisfactory, and I would be very much pleased if you would forward a copy of this correspondence to Major MacKay, at Vancouver, as, possibly, he will be able to secure some satisfactory explanation of the various tenders. If he considers it necessary to call for new tenders we would be obliged if he would do so, and make his submission to Ottawa, together with his recommendation.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUEST FOR QUOTATION\n\nR.Carswell & Co., Kamloops, B.C.\nPondosa Pine Lbr.Co.,\nF.D.Woodward,\nH.J.Davies,\n\nOttawa, September 27, 1938.\n\nTenders are hereby invited for the supply of the goods specified below; prices to include Dominion Sales Tax and be f.o.b.\n\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nGoods required are for Government use and are not for resale.

Jackson,\n\nOn the 31st August there was submitted to your office by the Indian Affairs a requisition for lumber required for repairs to the Kamloops Indian Residential School (copy enclosed). On this requisition appears the following note:-\n\n\"The Indian Agent secured the above prices from H.J. Davies, Contractor, Kamloops, B.C. He further states that he made enquiries from other dealers and contractors and that the prices quoted above are as low as can be obtained in Kamloops. The Indian Agent states that the material is needed immediately.\"\n\nThe principle of the purchase was approved by you and passed on to me on September 2nd. Upon receipt of this I enquired of the Indian Affairs what other firms and contractors in Kamloops had been asked to quote and what prices had been submitted. This information was not available in the Indian Affairs Branch and evidently they wired to Mr. Ferguson, Indian Agent, on the 10th, to which he replied by letter on September 17th (copy enclosed). With this letter there were also quotations as follows:-\n\nKamloops Lumber Co., Ltd., $920.85\nInland Building Supplies, Ltd., $928.70\nF.D. Woodward, $928.35\n\nOn September 23rd I received a copy of a wire from Mr. Ferguson, stating:-\n\n\"Re building material for school reference my letter 17th, Davies' tender $910.85.\"\nYou will note that the requisition of August 31st gave the quotation of H.J.Davies as $961.70, while the Indian Agent's letter of September 17th gave Mr. Davies' tender price as $968.35. Three different quotations have been offered by Mr. Davies and as yet we have not received any tender from him. Of course, this information may be on record in the Agent's office.\n\nIn view of the irregularity in dealing with this tender it was decided that we would call for new tenders. These were invited on the 27th ultimo and are due on October 10th.\n\nFrom the evidence on file it would appear that tenders had not been invited until after Mr. Ferguson was in receipt of the department's wire of the 10th ultimo; also, that quotations were invited by Mr. Ferguson from two firms not on the preferred list, viz:-\n\nInland Building Supplies, Ltd.;\nKamloops Lumber Co., Ltd.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nTelegram\n\nKamloops BC 23 1938 Sept. 23 PM\n\nSECY Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe building material for school reference my letter seventeenth Davies' tender nine hundred ten dollars eighty-five cents.\n\nW. J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nIndian Affairs Branch\nKamloops Agency.\n\nKamloops, B.C., Sept. 17, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n(Attention Mr. H.A. Hoey)\n\nWith reference to your telegram of the 10th instant, regarding the purchase of material for the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I am enclosing herewith the following tenders:\n\nInland Building Supplies, Ltd. Not on preferred list. Carry a large stock of lumber and building supplies. Amount of tender......................... $898.70\n\nKamloops Lumber Co., Ltd. Not on preferred list. Have a sawmill and carry a large stock of lumber and building material. Amount of tender............. 920.80\n\nF.D. Woodward, Contractor. On preferred list. Does not stock lumber or building material. Amount of tender............................... 928.35\n\nH.J. Davies, Contractor. On preferred list. No lumber yard. Verbal tender of August 26th........... 968.35\n\nCarswell Lumber Co. On preferred list. Refused to tender on account of financial difficulties.\n\nThe other names on preferred list are Gordon Grant, who has no lumber yard and is working full time as trainman for railway. The firm of Kennedy & Woodward is non-existent. The Fondosa Pine Lumber Company have mill at Westwold, but have no local office, and also refused to tender on previous orders.\n\nYou will note that all the new written tenders are much lower than Mr. H.J. Davies' verbal tender. After Mr. Davies on the 26th ultimo gave me his prices, I called all the other firms by telephone, who have tendered as per this letter and they were all higher in price than he was. Now they have somewhat reduced their prices.\n\nAt the present time and during the past week Mr. Davies has been out of town and I have not been able to get a new tender from him. However, he is expected back next week and as soon as he is I will get a new tender from him if he cares to. I will telegraph the amount to the department and hence avoid some delay.\n\nWith these new purchasing regulations, there is some confusion. One time I will send in wholesale prices. This will be referred back for local tenders. These are sent in and in the end the purchase is made in Vancouver or somewhere else.\n\nGordon Grant, a railroad employee, has been given an order for lumber. Kennedy & Woodward, a firm out of business for several years, has also been given an order for lumber.\n\nIt would indeed be a relief if agents could be supplied with printed tender forms along with definite instructions regarding matters dealing with purchases.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) W.J.

Dalgleish & Sons for $7.29 covering tar paper used in connection with the laying of the floor in the girls' recreation room. My explanation for this extra expenditure is that after the old floor was torn up it was found that the old paper could not be used again. The school was about to open after the summer holidays and with the laundry situated directly beneath this floor, rather than let the floor be laid without some damp-proof insulation, I ordered the extra tar paper for the floor. The floor was laid and completed with oil and varnish for the use of the children by September 15th.\n\nIn regard to this floor I should mention that in Purchasing Order No. 6834 no provision was made for nails or paper. In Mr. Davies' original price of $365.00 for the completed floor these extra were covered. However, the final cost of the floor, as shown below, was much below Mr. Davies' price.\n\n| Flooring | $171.00 |\n|----------|---------|\n| Labour and nails | 143.00 |\n| Tar paper | 7.29 |\n| **Total** | **$321.29** |\n\nI am also attaching herewith Voucher No. 292-38 in favour of Mr. F.D. Woodward for $171.00 covering the purchase of flooring for the above-mentioned girls' recreation room. In this regard I would refer you to your letter of Sept. 17th last in which I was instructed where to purchase the flooring under Purchase Order No. 6834, in favour of Kennedy & Woodward which had been returned by the postal authorities unclaimed. In regard to the purchase of this flooring I beg to offer the following explanation:\n\nUpon return of the tenders from the contractors which was awarded to Mr. F.D. Woodward, the lowest bid (the original tenders are enclosed herewith) and knowing that Mr. Woodward through his son was at one time interested in the firm of Kennedy & Woodward, which has been out of business for some time, I asked him if he would undertake to supply the flooring at the same price in accordance with the copy of Order No. 6834 which I had on file in the office at the time. He agreed to do this and submitted a written tender to this effect. As the school was about to open at the time and being anxious to have the job completed as soon as possible so as not to inconvenience the school a great deal, I placed the order with him.\n\nAll expenditures have now been completed in connection with the school except the purchase of the material for the auditorium.\n\nI trust that my actions in the purchase of this flooring will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nTENDER FOR THE REMOVAL OF OLD FLOOR AND LAYING OF NEW FLOOR IN THE GIRLS' RECREATION ROOM AT KAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, KAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nI, Denis Salvas, the undersigned hereby agree to remove the old floor and to lay and sand ready for oil and varnish 3000 feet B.M. of No. 1 edge grain flooring in the girls' recreation room at the Kamloops residential school, Kamloops.

Welfare & Training:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 18th, file 154-0-5, in connection with a voucher for $95.90, covering paid for Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn regard to the purchase of more expensive paint, I explained this in my covering letter of November 4th which went forward with the voucher at the time. Apparently this letter did not reach your office, so I am enclosing a copy herewith along with the voucher.\n\nI was possibly to blame for ordering red paint in the first place, but thought it a suitable colour for the purpose of painting a barn, but as already mentioned the Rev. Principal took strenuous objections to the colour, and I allowed him to have it changed.\n\nMy suggestion of returning the paint to the equivalent of $9.90 to Dalgleish & Sons can still be carried out as the school has not yet made use of the paint.\n\nI might add that on account of the colouring matter used, grey paint is more expensive than red paint.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

In a previous report, I discussed in detail the prevalence of Bang's disease in the herd of cattle supplying milk for the members of the staff and student body of the School.\n\nEnclosed, herewith, you will find a letter from the Departmental Medical Officer at Kamloops, in connection with both subjects.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that a milk pasteurizing plant should be installed at this School, and also that a new and more modern milk-house should be erected at the earliest possible moment. The shack at present used for the purpose of handling and cooling the milk is most unsuitable and unsanitary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.L.

However, the end of this fiscal year is approaching and it is possible that there may be some funds left over which may be made available for this purpose. If not, the purchase should be made as soon as funds can be obtained in the new fiscal year, as it is most necessary for the protection of this school in case of a fire that this equipment be supplied.\n\nIn regard to the purchase of this equipment, I would refer you to Gerald H. Barry's Inspection of Schools Report of February 6th and 7th, of this Agency.\n\nThe prices contained in this requisition were supplied by LaFrance Fire Engine and Foamite Ltd., 3846 3rd Ave., West, Vancouver, B.C. Their representative, Mr. V.H.Brown, at my request, along with Mr. Anthony Leah, engineer at the School, made the survey of the equipment required. After I received Mr. Brown's report, I checked over the requirements with Mr. Leah and reduced the quantities of a few of the items and prepared my requisition accordingly.\n\nFrom my personal knowledge of the conditions and quantity of equipment at the school, and also considering the check up with Mr. Leah, I would recommend that this equipment be supplied as requisitioned.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J. Ferguson\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\nP.O.Box 444,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFebruary 20, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have read with care a letter from Indian Agent Ferguson, G-E-2-11 dated February 16th, and considered the requisition for fire fighting equipment which he forwarded.\n\nThe general necessity for a renewal of equipment at the Kamloops Indian Residential School was mentioned in my last report on the school forwarded to you on the 8th instant.\n\nIn supporting the Indian Agent's application there are two matters which in my opinion should receive consideration.\n\n(a) There is an urgent need for a proper apparatus for the Pasteurization of milk for the children of this school and if funds are strictly limited this apparatus should be provided even if the provision of extra fire equipment had to be deferred.\n\n(b) Almost 50% of the Indian Agent's total requisition is made up by the cost of lined and unlined fire hose.\n\nShould only a very limited amount be now available at the end of the Fiscal Year, I consider that the extinguishers asked for, including the items to repair old Guardene 2\u00bd gallon type apparatus, might well supplied, and the provision of the necessary outside and inside hose left till the next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith requisition for fire fighting equipment for the Kamloops Indian Residential School received from Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson.\n\nThe question of the necessity for the renewal of the equipment was fully discussed with Capt. Barry, who inspected the school on the 6th and 7th of this month. Of the equipment asked for, the fire extinguishers are the most important at the moment and should be provided. The supply of the outside and inside hose could be left over until early in the coming fiscal year, unless funds are available at the present time to meet the expenditure involved.\n\nA copy of a letter from Capt. Barry regarding the equipment requisitioned for, is forwarded herewith.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 11, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing requisition for fire fighting equipment for the Kamloops Indian residential school. At the present time our funds are totally assigned and it is impossible to consider immediate purchase of these articles.\n\nI, therefore, return this to you in order that you may further consider this requisition. It would appear that it should not be necessary to supply as much equipment as mentioned by the Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nThe enclosed is a simple drawing of the barn floor plan. I hope you will be able to understand it. The dimensions are just the same as the plans the late Mr Orr drew, which plans they have in the engineering dept. I had to change the lay-out somewhat on account of our ground conditions here.\n\nMr Phelan was in the barn when he was here this week, and I rather think he was pleased with it. I am sorry we have not been able to put the stock in yet, but an unlocked for difficulty presented itself. Our root cellar, with our full supply of potatoes is part of the old barn, and we rely on the heat from the stock to take care of them during the cold months, and so that we should not lose our potatoes, we decided to let the stock remain.\n\nAt present we are painting the inside of the barn, and this may surprise you when I say the inside, ceilings and walls will be aluminum paint trimmed with black. How does that appeal to you. I think it will be rather grand, and fit for the Hon. Minister or the Governor General to inspect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nIf you consider a building of this kind suitable for Kamloops and the school management approves the method of erection that is suggested in the preceding part of this letter please let me know and a plan of the building can be forwarded to you.\n\nThe barn at Sault Ste. Marie was erected by day labour in charge of a competent foreman. If possible you might let me know the name and address of a competent foreman for our consideration.\n\nIn view of the fact that there is only a temporary Principal at the Kamloops school at the present time I realize that it will not be possible to handle this matter until a permanent appointment is made. However, I thought I would bring it to your attention in order that you may give it consideration and possibly, if you happen to visit Kamloops within the next month or so, you can discuss erection of the barn with the school management and others interested.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would return the enclosed picture when it has served your purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are aware several requests have been received within the last few months for the erection of a new barn at the Kamloops Indian residential school.\n\nIn preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 it was found possible to include an amount of $2,500.00 only for this purpose. However, I am doubtful if this amount would provide a barn that would meet the requirements of the school.\n\nWould you favour the erection of a barn, preferably under the direction of the school management, on the understanding that $2,500.00 would be provided during the current fiscal year and $2,500.00 in the appropriation for the year 1940-41. This would provide a barn costing $5,000.00.\n\nFor your information I enclose a photograph of a barn erected at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., for the amount of money mentioned above. The dimensions of this building are as follows:\n\nLength - 82'6\"\nWidth - 36'\nFloor to ridge - 32'\nClearance in barn - 8'6\"\n\nOn the ground floor there is space for 18 cow stalls, 1 bull pen, 1 cow pen, 1 calf pen, 5 horse stalls and 1 feed room. The upper floor is loft.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

All the poles of the line have rotted below the ground line and a couple of poles have already fallen to the ground. The old poles are short in length and will not stand resetting, nor are the poles strong enough to stand stubbing, so that the only alternative is to replace the old with new poles and new cross-arms and make a good substantial job of it. The old line at best was only a makeshift.\n\nThe school will require the use of this pump for irrigation purposes by May 1st next, so there should be no delay in having this expenditure authorized.\n\nThe prices in my estimate were supplied by the B.C. Electric Railway Co., and it is possible that if I have the work done by one of the local firms or individual on the approved list, I may be able to get the work done for less than my requisition.

Barry  \nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 9)\nDear Sir:-\n\nYour File 154-0-5\n\nI have to refer to your letter of March 11th, regarding the provision of certain fire protection equipment at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to forward herewith a revised requisition received from Mr. Ferguson, together with his covering letter.\n\nThe matter was further discussed with Capt. Barry who has suggested that one fire extinguisher will do in the laundry, thus reducing the total sum actually required to furnish urgent and necessary equipment to $430.09, which comes within the amount provided in the 1939-40 Estimates.\n\nThe application is recommended for favourable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nP.O.Box 444  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMarch 28, 1939.\n\nMajor D. W. MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nP.O.Box 70,  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have read Departmental letter 154-0-5 from Mr R.A.Hoey, dealing with the proposed new barn at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nWith regard to the second paragraph of the above letter, I may say that a sum of $2,500.00 would be, as suggested by Mr Hoey, entirely inadequate to cover the erection of a suitable barn and pay for the material.\n\nI may say that I should be in favour of the erection of a suitable barn by the school authorities on the understanding that its cost not to exceed $5,000.00 be reimbursed by the Department as suggested by Mr. Hoey during the current 1939-40 and 1940-41 fiscal years.\n\nThe work would be too heavy for the Annual Training Class at the school, and should in my opinion be carried out by a contractor, approved by the Department, and not by day labour under a foreman.\n\nIt is my opinion that a shake roof would be far better than a metal one. I doubt that the accommodation provided in the barn constructed at Sault Ste. Marie, is just what would be required at Kamloops, and I should favour a general design and plan more in keeping with B.C. practice. I doubt that horse stalls would be necessary, but believe that increased space would be needed for calves.\n\nPossibly with the high winds occurring from time to time a lower type of barn would be more suitable and somewhat less expensive. The plans might I believe be drawn by the contractor wishing to erect the building and be subject, together with specifications, to the approval of the Department.\n\nA new Principal will, I understand, be nominated to take charge of the Kamloops Indian Residential School in the very near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe File 154-0-5.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 23 in the matter of the erection of the new barn at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nWith regard to the third paragraph of the above letter I would approve of the proposal made to finance the construction. This proposal was discussed with Reverend Father Scannell, Provincial of the Oblate Order, during his recent visit to this city and Rev. Father O'Grady, when they called at this office. Father Scannell agreed with the suggested arrangements and did not anticipate there would be any difficulty in having the school provide the additional $2500, which amount would be repaid to the school from the funds provided in the 1940-41 estimates.\n\nThe subject has been reviewed at length with Inspector Barry, a copy of whose letter following his consideration of the proposal is attached for your information. I am inclined to agree with the Inspector that it would be best to have the barn built by the school authorities on the understanding that the total cost would not exceed $5000 and that construction be carried out by contract approved by the Department.\n\nI should say that a lower type of barn, with shingle or shake roof, would be best in the Kamloops area because of the high winds which frequently occur there. Nevertheless, it would be as well to send the plan of the Sault Ste. Marie barn along for guidance in drawing up plans for a building that would meet requirements at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Now that Rev. Father O'Grady has been appointed to the Principalship of the Kamloops School and is to some extent already familiar with the proposal, arrangements could be made by him to have plans of a suitable barn prepared and submit same for examination and consideration of the Department. I should appreciate further instructions in this matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 13th ultimo with reference to the erection of a new barn at the Kamloops Indian residential school.\n\nIt is noted that Rev. Father Scannell, Provincial of the Oblate Order, has agreed to our proposal that an amount of $5000.00 be expended in the erection of this building on the understanding that $2500.00 will be paid by the Department during the current fiscal year and the balance during the fiscal year 1939-40. It is also understood that in the meantime the school management will be responsible for payment of $2500.00 which the Department will refund to them during the next fiscal year.\n\nFrom past experience I feel that if this building is erected by contract it will either cost more than the amount suggested above or the building will be much smaller than the barn at Shingwauk Home.\n\nI am still of the opinion that the best value would be secured by engaging a competent foreman who would be nominated by the Department and by erecting the building by day labour with the Principal of the Kamloops school acting as supervisor in order to make certain that the building is erected as quickly as possible.\n\nI should appreciate your again consulting the Principal of the Kamloops school with a view to ascertaining if he concurs in this procedure. If so, it would be further understood that the approval of the Honourable the Minister would be secured for your purchasing all materials required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMay 2, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Kamloops Indian Reserve Sewage Disposal System\n\nFurther to our memorandum of the 4th ultimo with reference to the above, we are now advised by Mr. Webb that instructions covering the operation of cleaning of the septic tanks at this School have been completed and copies sent to the Indian Agent at Kamloops, who is being requested to see that the instructions are in the possession of the school authorities and that the instructions are followed with regard to the maintenance of the sewage system.\n\nIn a letter now received from Mr. Webb with regard to the Kamloops Indian Residential School sewage disposal system, he points out that funds have not yet been provided for the construction of the sludge drying basin referred to in Mr. Warren's report of August 20th, 1937. The cost of this work is now estimated by Mr. Webb at $100.00, and he states that it would be desirable that the work be completed before it becomes necessary to clean the settling chamber probably within the next twelve or fifteen months.\n\nYou will recall that a copy of Mr. Warren's report referred to above accompanied our memorandum of September 3, 1937, and that $2200.00 was provided for work along the lines of this report. Apparently this was not sufficient to undertake the construction of the sludge drying basin now referred to by Mr. Webb. It is, therefore, recommended that if funds can be provided to the extent of $100.00, that such work might be undertaken this season.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

This matter was covered in Mr. Warren's report of August 20th, 1937.

I understand the total cost would be $5000 and the Department was willing to give $2500 this year if the Church Authorities would provide the balance as a loan and be re-imbursed next year. I have been promised the loan in question by our Church Authorities and am, therefore, ready to proceed with the construction of the barn but as yet have not received final word from the Department. I should like to begin work on the building as soon as possible in order to have it completed before the School year re-opens in September.\n\nI should be very grateful for any information you may have with regard to the Department's final decision and for any assistance you may be able to give to expedite the matter, for I feel, since I have come to this School that the construction of a new barn is an urgent necessity.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"F.

To replace these buildings the cost will be all of $1000.00. This might have been prevented had the department supplied the fire fighting equipment for this building as per my requisition of February 16th last.\n\nW. J. Ferguson.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour report for the month of May has recently been brought to my attention and it is noted that you refer to the destruction by fire of the hog houses and pens at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI have reviewed our files but I cannot find any report that was submitted by you regarding this fire. I feel it is unnecessary for me to state that in the event of fire or any serious happening at any residential school the Indian agent is expected to report fully to the Department immediately following such occurrence. It would therefore be appreciated if you would report fully regarding this fire, stating its cause and any other information that you may have concerning it.\n\nAs you have been previously informed, the only amount available in the current year's estimates is $2,500 for the erection of a new barn. Arrangements have already been completed for the construction of a barn costing $5,000. Of this amount, $2,500 will be paid by the Department this year and $2,500 will be provided in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Ferguson,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson:\n\nOn May 21, 1939 the Pig Pen on the school property was completely destroyed by fire. It is a building 60'x14' of one storey frame construction. It is situated 850' from the Main Bldg., 75' from the Barn, 60' from the Chicken House.\n\nIn the extreme East end of the Pig Pen a Brick and cement Fire box was lighted daily to cook pig feed. It was from this part of the building that the fire was first sighted.\n\nOn the morning of May 21st, the fire was lighted at 6 A.M. as usual and since it was Sunday when Mass is held at 7 A.M. the Farm Manager looked in at the fire just before coming over to the Chapel, which was about 6:55 A.M. All was well then. When the sister in charge of the kitchen went down to prepare breakfast at 7:30 A.M. she saw smoke and reported immediately. The Engineer and Farm Manager both rushed to investigate. Fire was coming through the roof just over the fire box in the pig pen.\n\nA length of hose was run from the fire hydrant in front of the barn but since the point of contact was 300' from this hydrant, it was necessary to carry all the hose from the four hydrants around the Main Bldg. and join them all together. This required at least ten minutes and by this time the Pig Pen was completely destroyed. Further it is known that the pressure obtainable from this hydrant at the barn is but 60 lbs. since it is cut in between the Main Reservoir and the Main Pump.\n\nHowever there was sufficient water to check any further conflagration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.O'Grady O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 3rd ultimo, I beg to submit herewith a report received from Rev.

In this connection I would refer you to my letter of March 11 and your reply of April 14. At that time the Department considered that the request for fire equipment was excessive. We are still of this opinion, especially in view of the fact that the Kamloops school can be considered as a semi-fireproof building and due to present conditions instructions have been received to keep expenditure as low as possible.\n\nLast spring 8 additional fire extinguishers were supplied for this school. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of May 8 last.\n\nAs Indian Agent Ferguson is again insisting on purchasing a very large amount of fire equipment I thought it advisable to re-submit the matter to you for your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 15th authorizing the purchase of materials required for the new barn being constructed at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I have to advise that accounts for materials totalling $3487.37 have now been received and I should appreciate your instructions regarding the submission of these.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Department provided $2500 of the total of $5000, which the barn is to cost, from this year's funds and the school, although meeting the balance of $2500, will be reimbursed this amount from funds to be made available in the 1940-41 estimates.\n\nDoes the Department intend sending the amount available to Rev. F. O'Grady and have him pay all the accounts, including labour in connection with the construction, or do you wish accounts up to $2500 sent to the Department for payment and the rest of the accounts handed over to the school for attention. I should appreciate an early reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 24, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the new barn at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease submit accounts to an amount of $2,500.00. Cheques in payment will then be issued by the Department.\n\nThe rest of the account should be handed over to the school for their attention. Reimbursement for the balance over and above the $2,500 being paid this year will be made from our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41. As both the Principal and yourself understand, the funds from that appropriation will not be available until after April 1, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.

It is over a year since they were attended to, and I understand refills should be installed without delay.\n\nI have also put a note on the estimate regarding some re-arrangement whereby the present water system would afford water for fire protection for the new barn. In this connection, I would suggest that the Water Power Branch have Mr. W.C. Warren, while attending to irrigation work in this Agency for the next two weeks, prepare a report and estimate on the material and work required to remedy this situation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

Giddens & Sons. This work was recommended by Mr. T. J. Arnall, S.P.P. Engineer of the Dominion Department of Public Works in his report of August 6th, 1939. This report, along with other reports on boilers at certain Indian Residential Schools, was sent to the Department under cover of my letter of 26th October last.\n\nI would recommend approval of the above application and that the work be carried out by the firm making the lowest tender.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Arnall's report on the condition of the boilers at the Kamloops Residential School, I have passed on the remarks in the reports to the Principal of the School for his attention.\n\nRegarding boiler No. 44501, Mr. Arnall reports that the tubes of this boiler must be re-rolled and beaded at top. This will require the services of a boiler maker, and as the Department has previously on two occasions paid for having this work done, I have taken it for granted that the Department will again pay for these repairs.\n\nYou will therefore find enclosed herewith tenders covering this work as follows:\n\n| Company          | Tender Amount |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| Carr & Son       | $28.00        |\n| Giddens & Sons   | $48.00        |\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDecember 5, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal System, Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will recall that your memorandum of the 11th of May last advised that the Indian Affairs Branch had $100 available for the construction of a sludge drying basin for the above sewage disposal system.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a report from Mr. Webb to the effect that this work has been completed, but as this drying basin was to facilitate the clearing of the settling chambers, it has not been put in operation as the necessity of cleaning the chambers has not as yet been evident.\n\nThe drying basin consists of a shallow pit 35' by 60' and approximately 3' deep with a roadway approach. This is connected to the settling chamber by an 8\" pipeline. To facilitate the distribution of the sludge in the drying basin, a wooden flume attached to the end of the pipeline with suitable apertures was provided the full length of the basin (60'). The basin was enclosed by barbed wire fencing to prevent encroachment of animals.\n\nMr. Webb reports that on Mr. Warren's last visit to this school late in October, he saw nothing to indicate that the septic tanks were not functioning satisfactorily. The effluent was satisfactory and no solids were passing out of the tanks.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 9)\n11th December, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal System,\nKamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information I am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer from which it is noted that the work connected with the construction of the sludge drying basin has been completed but there is no necessity for putting it in operation up to the present time. A description of the basin is included and also a statement by Mr. Warren that the septic tanks are functioning satisfactorily.\n\nWe are asking our Engineers for a statement of the costs of this work for which $100 was made available.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sewage disposal system,\nKamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information and with further reference to my memorandum of the 11th ultimo, I would advise that the cost of the sludge drying basin for the above sewage disposal system is $99.10 made up of -\n\nMaterial .......... $19.10\nLabour .......... 80.00\n\nDirector.\nKAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nAn excavation for receiving and evaporating the liquid overflow from the sewage system at the school was completed and fences cost $80.00. Work was supervised by the Water Power Branch. Estimates were prepared and tenders received for repairs to the laundry boiler. Estimates are also being prepared in connection with new lights inside and out for the landings of the fire escape.\n\nThe school has made application to lease some 104 acres of Indian owned land adjoining the school property for agricultural purposes. A report has been forwarded to the Commissioner.\n\nAn estimate is also being prepared for the rearrangement of fire hydrants so as to give the new barn fire protection. The new barn has been completed and painted.\n\nW. J.

There is one point, though, that I would like to mention in my estimate I listed.\n\nFor outside hose houses 100 ft. 2\u00bd inch best grade cotton\nRubber-lined fire hose in 50 ft. length........................$90.00\n\nYou will note on Charles Niedner's Sons voucher that 100 ft. of Rendeis Under Linen hose was supplied. This is an unlined hose and in my opinion will not stand outside services. However, the cost was only $28.00 and, as the School can make some use of it, I have left it with them rather than return it away back to Quebec; but it should be kept in mind that the cotton rubber-lined hose should be supplied as soon as funds are available from next year's appropriation.\n\nIn regard to fire protection for the new cow barn, by re-arrangement of pipe line and hydrant when Mr. Warren of the\nThe Secretary.\n\nWater Power Bureau was here in December we looked over the proposition, and I think that at this time if requested to do so, he would prepare an estimate to cover the cost of the material and labour. In my opinion, the School should supply the labour, that is, the digging of the trench for the pipe.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. J.

The materials used were all carefully examined by the foreman to ensure that both the quality and quantity ordered were supplied. The plan adopted is particularly suitable for the requirements of the School and the design found to be the best in a wind-swept area such as Kamloops. The ground floor division has been painted with white enamel, which is now used almost entirely in large up-to-date dairy barns, permitting of regular washing, and doing away with the necessity of the constant use of lime solution for walls and ceiling. Two prints of the barn are forwarded, which give some indication of the size and design of the building.\n\nThe Department agreed to spend $5,000.00 for a new barn - 50% of which was to be paid from the 1939-40 funds, and the School to undertake the payment of the balance, which would be refunded from the 1940-41 appropriation. Vouchers totalling $2,305.07 have already gone forward to the Department and they, in all probability, have been paid, leaving an amount of $2,694.93 due to the School.\n\nIt will be observed that the total of the Vouchers enclosed is $2,990.05 but, of this amount the Department will be required to refund, according to arrangements, $2,694.93; the difference of $295.12 representing the amount in excess of the $5,000, which the Department undertook to pay, could very well be met by the School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Ferguson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON KAMLOOPS AGENCY FOR MARCH 1940.\n\nKamloops Residential School\n\nPrincipal complains that the main double cooking range has burnt out and a replacement will be required. Local tinsmith who examined the range claims that it would cost over $200.00 to repair and reline, and then the repairs might not prove satisfactory, so it will be necessary to purchase a new range for the school at a cost of about $400.00.\n\nW. J. Ferguson.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has just been brought to the attention of this Branch that in your report for the month of March you referred to the cooking range at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. For your future guidance I would point out that it is undesirable to include such items in your monthly report. They should be the subject of a special letter.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of a new range at $400.00. Please let me have detailed information regarding the type of range required and, if possible, the catalogue number. At the same time you should state if you consider any allowance could be obtained for the old range.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood, however, by the Principal that in the event of the Department purchasing the range there will be no further funds available for repairs and improvements at the Kamloops School during the current fiscal year. Our appropriation for the current fiscal year has been drastically reduced and as a consequence when we pay the balance owing in connection with the construction of the barn there will be only sufficient left to purchase the new range.\n\nConsequently when replying to this letter you should state definitely if the Principal understands the situation as outlined above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. W.

O'Grady, Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, in which he stated that he understood definitely that the total amount the Department would allow for a new barn was $5000.00 of which amount $2500.00 would be paid in the fiscal year 1939-40 and the balance provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nIn connection with the barn vouchers to a total amount of $3133.74 were submitted and paid during the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nI am now in receipt of your voucher No. 4A dated April 20, 1940, requesting a payment of $2990.05. This amount, added to what has already been paid, makes the total cost of this barn approximately $6100.00 which is considerably more than the amount authorized. Before deciding what balance can be allowed I felt it was advisable to ascertain from you why the cost of this barn has so far exceeded the amount originally agreed upon.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

Kamloops, for Kamloops Indian Residential School. Tenders from McLean, McFeely, Prior, Ltd., and Gordon & Belyea, both of Vancouver, B.C., are also enclosed, along with an illustration of the required range, but showing only two ovens.\n\nThis will replace the burnt out Malahat Range at the school, which has had continuous use since 1926, which gives fourteen years service, which is fair, considering the heavy strain of use required from this equipment at the school. The old range has given good service and I would favour replacement being made with the same make of range.\n\nI had Giddens & Son here, local tinsmiths, examine the old range for repairs and they reported that the cost would be excessive, and after being repaired it would still be an old stove.\n\nI might mention that Commissioner Major D.M. MacKay, this Spring, had a second hand three oven range shipped to the School, but the Reverend Principal claims it is too narrow, and the ovens are small. I examined this range today. It is 28 inches wide across the top. The length is alright and the condition is fair, but the Reverend Principal is right in his claim that it is too narrow. The School uses most of the cooking in 10 or 12 gallon aluminum pots and they cannot be passed by one another when on top of the range. They were cooking lunch at the School when I was over and the top was too crowded for satisfactory cooking. Most of the pots and pans were overhanging the top. The ovens were also overcrowded.\n\nThe Malahat Range has a width of 36 inches, and an extra width of 8 inches over the three oven range at present in use, and this extra width makes it more convenient for the cooking and handling of utensils in use.\n\nWith the range shipped the School by the Commissioner, and if a new one is supplied in accordance with the enclosed requisition, this will make three old ranges at the School for disposal\u2014a two-oven Steamboat range, the old Malahat 3 oven range and the one from the Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nThe old 3-oven Malahat Range is badly burned out in the firebox and around the oven, and is of no further use to the School as a range, but possibly some of the top plates and other parts could be used at some future time in repairs to the new range if the same type, a Malahat is supplied. These parts could be stored by the School, and the rest of the body of the stove dumped, or if a buyer can be found, disposed of as junk.\n\nThe Steamboat Range, 2-oven range could be repaired so as to be of use in some camp, logging, etc., and I have advised local stove dealers that it will likely be for sale through the Salvage Branch.\n\nThe Commissioner's three oven stove is in fair shape and could also be disposed of to some camp outfit when a new range is supplied.\n\nIn the purchase of this new range from a wholesale house, or the manufacturer, I do not think that they would consider any allowance on any of these old ranges, and before a local retail dealer would touch any of these old ranges he would have to have a sale already arranged.\n\nOn the requisition you will note that I have included a brass hotwater coil for the range at a cost of $27.15. I understand that ranges are supplied without coils, so that in making the purchase a coil, either brass or iron should be included. The cost of the iron one is $11.90. The School has requested a brass coil, but I will leave this for the Department to decide.\n\nAs advised, I have pointed out to the Reverend Principal that in the event of the Department purchasing this range, there will be no further funds available for repairs and improvements at the School during the current fiscal year. He distinctly understands the situation in making his request for the new range.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Commissioner, Major D.M. MacKay.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

Dalgleish & Sons on a #30 McClary Chef Junior Range, weight 2400 lbs. price $430.00, water jacket $14.50 extra.\n\nFrom the description of this range, it is stated that the firebox and flue system are lined throughout with best quality firebrick. This feature of a fire brick lining in the firebox and flues, in my opinion, is worth considering when making purchase of a new range.\n\nThe Malahat Range on which I reported is supplied with a cast iron firebox.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the stove manufacturer could have it lined with firebrick the same as the McClary range.\n\nN.S.

BAILEY\n\nI desire to refer to purchase order dated June 7 for a Malahat heavy duty steel range for the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I attach a further quotation received from N. S. Dalgleish & Sons, Kamloops, B.C. The Agent states that the reason this price is higher than the one obtained from McLennan, McFeely & Prior Ltd. is due to the fact that the oven on which Dalgleish & Sons quote has the firebox and flue system lined throughout with best quality fire brick. Possibly you are aware that an oven equipped in this manner is worth the difference in price.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nKamloops Indian Residential School\nFOUNDED IN 1889\nIN CHARGE OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nKamloops, B.C., June 7th, 1940.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI should like to acknowledge, with sincere thanks, your air mail letter of May 20th, which I received the day before our Golden Jubilee celebration. I appreciated it more than words can tell. Your unfailing interest in our work of the Residential Schools has always been a source of great encouragement to us. I was very glad to thank the Department publicly on the occasion of the Jubilee for the great work it has done in forwarding the cause of Indian education at this Institution.\n\nThe Jubilee celebration was all that we could have wished for. We had a large gathering of Indian and white people and the former were very orderly indeed. The weather was exceptionally fine for the outdoor ceremonies. All were amazed at the ability of the children during the concert and the Indian parents were very proud of them. Under separate cover I am sending you copies of the \"Kamloops Sentinel\" the editor of which attended the concert and made his own report.\n\nThere are several matters of business that come to mind especially at this time of the year when the estimates are going through Parliament and I hope you will not mind my mentioning them in this letter. I understand the difficult position in which the Department finds itself this year because of the war and the stringent measures it must take to reduce expenses. I have already received the circular of Mr. McGill announcing a reduction in the per capita grant to $2.24, which means that this School will receive $3759.72 less each year. The transportation allowance has been cut in half and Mr. Hoey stated in a letter to Mr. Ferguson that after paying the balance due on the barn and purchasing a new kitchen range the Department would probably not be able to do any more for this School this year.\n\nNotwithstanding the necessary reductions to be made I feel that the School should not remain at a standstill; there are some things needed very urgently. During the past year I\nhave gone to considerable pains and expense to keep the buildings in a state of good repair. I have painted the boys' recreation, shoe and wash rooms, sanded the floors and painted the offices in the administration section, extended and purchased paint for the new piggery, installed a new fruit cooker to handle half of a ton of fruit in 30 minutes, put out a new orchard and insulated and lined the auditorium with hemlock flooring. These are some of the main improvements which have been done out of the School grant. But there are others which are very necessary and which I feel I cannot finance. We should have fire protection for the new barn and piggery to the amount of $582.66 and a new frigidaire costing $750.00.\n\nThere is another improvement needed very badly at this School and which has been requested for several years but which the Department has not been able to grant and it is a new technical shop and dairy. The present technical shop is altogether too small and unsuitable, has no equipment in the way of power tools and machinery, and soon will need a new floor. The dairy is only a small outbuilding and very unsanitary.\n\nAlthough the Department has been very good to us in the past I would not presume on its generosity to grant us the two buildings in question this year. But I have a proposition to offer. I am prepared to construct a new technical shop and dairy this year and equip both, provided the Department would re-imburse us next year in the same manner as it is doing this year for the new barn. The total cost would not exceed $2500.00. I discussed the matter with Very Rev. Father Scannell on his visit here and he sanctioned it. I should like to be free in the purchase of materials as I know where I can purchase lumber at a greatly reduced price, which will be necessary in order to construct the buildings at the above cost, labor included. I will be responsible for good workmanship and can assure the Department that the buildings will be well in keeping with the other fine buildings at this Institution.\n\nI would appreciate an early decision of the Department in this matter as I would like to prepare the materials for the Manual Training class when School re-opens. The boys did splendid work on the new piggery and I feel they will do even better work on their new technical shop.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your letter of June 5, in which it is stated that the cost of the new barn for Kamloops Indian Residential School reached an amount of $6100.00,\n\nI do not know how this total was arrived at, as I understood all accounts were to pass through this office and the total of these is as stated in my letter of April 22nd, 1940, $5295.12.

If you so desire you might bring this matter to our attention again in September at which time we will probably be preparing the estimates for the fiscal year 1941-42 and the matter will then receive further consideration but, as intimated above, I am unable at the present time to make any definite promise that the amount will be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJune 21, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the barn at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that in writing to you on June 5 we mentioned that the cost of the barn would be approximately $6100.00.

The reason is that she was admitted in 1936 and, therefore, has had only four years in School. She is very anxious to return for one more year to learn all she can. She profits very well by her time in School and I would recommend her being allowed to return for another year.\n\nWith reference to the estimates for 1941-1942 I should like to remark that the items listed are absolutely necessary. I discussed each one in detail with Commissioner Major Mackay and Indian Agent Ferguson and both agreed all were essential. Many other repairs, which are urgent but not so important, were eliminated from the list as it was thought the Department would be short of funds this year. I am, however, under separate cover, enclosing a proposed layout of the School grounds, which need levelling very badly. It is a work which is as important as the erection of a building. As you know the grounds immediately surrounding the School are very uneven, very dusty and unsuitable for a play field. Because of the intense heat and lack of moisture in this area nothing will grow without irrigation. But it is impossible to irrigate the grounds properly as they are not level. I had a survey taken to find out how much earth had to be moved to bring the grounds to a proper level. There are 18815 cu. yds. to be moved a distance of approximately 450 ft. The estimated cost, because of the distance, is 20\u00a2 per cu. yd., which would make a total amount of $3763.00. I should be very glad if the Department could help us as the need for a proper playground has always been felt at this School. After the grounds have been levelled an irrigation line and sprinkling system should be installed to the amount of $700.00. And there is the interior redecorating of the main building estimated at $1437.25 which has been eliminated from the estimates this year.\n\nIn the estimates submitted through the Indian Office last month we are asking the Department to consider favorably the erection of a technical building to cost $2000.00 and a dairy costing $500.00. As a special request I should like to obtain authority for these two items this month, if possible. We need the buildings very urgently and this is the best time of the year for their construction. Work could begin immediately.\nand the two buildings would be completed before winter. The present dairy in particular is very unsanitary and is a danger to the spread of germs especially throughout the winter months when it is more difficult to keep it clean. And the technical building is in a poor state of repair, is much too small as it also includes a shoe repairing shop, and is very cold in winter.\n\nI feel at times that the Department might consider the above requests exorbitant coming at a time when funds are so badly needed for other purposes but I do hope it will accede to the most important ones. I am keenly interested in the progress of this the Department's largest Residential School, which has been so well built up and taken care of in the past and I will be very grateful for any favors that might be forthcoming.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 7, 1940.\n\nDear Father O'Grady:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to repairs and improvements at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I note that the items mentioned in your letter will be included in the estimates forwarded through the Indian Agent's office. Your requests will receive very careful consideration but I know you realize that owing to present conditions it is impossible for me, at the present time, to even guess what amount of money will be allowed for repairs and improvements at Indian residential schools during the fiscal year 1941-42.\n\nIn the present year's appropriation I was able to obtain an amount of $4000.00 for completing the payments on the barn at Kamloops and for repairs and improvements. Of this amount we have already expended $3392.20 leaving a balance on hand of $607.80. I note from your letter that a new dairy could be erected for $400.00 or $500.00. Consequently it would be possible to handle this at the present time.\n\nDetailed information regarding material required should be forwarded to this office through the office of the local Indian Agent in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the 1941-42 Estimates for the Kamloops Agency, there was an item included of $350.00 for boiler tubes for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI have now been informed by the Boiler Inspector that the replacing of these tubes will cost in the neighbourhood of $700.00, and I would, therefore, request that my estimate be altered to this new amount, as the Inspector has stated that it will be necessary to replace these tubes after the present firing season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

The grounds immediately surrounding the School are very dusty and uneven and altogether unsuitable for the recreation needs of the children. They should be properly levelled and irrigated and some kind of grass sown to keep down the dust. According to a survey there are 18815 cu. yds. of clay to be moved approximately 450 ft. The cost, because of the distance, is estimated at 20\u00a2 per cu. yd., making a total of $3765.00. After the grounds have been levelled 900 ft. of flume should be installed for irrigation. The cost is 50\u00a2 per ft. making a total of $450.00. And a sprinkling system, estimated at $250.00, is needed in front of the School.\n\nFor several years estimates for the interior re-decorating of the main School building have been submitted to the amount of $1437.25 but so far none of this has been granted. Some parts of the building are very badly in need of repair and I would ask that this amount be allotted for that purpose this year.\n\nI would kindly ask you to forward these requests to the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Principal, Rev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I., attached hereto.\n\nKamloops Indian Agency,\nOctober 5th, 1940.\n\nIndian Agent\nRepairs to Building: For the past two or three years, the amount of $1437.00 has been included in the Estimates to cover the redecoration of the interior of the main building. This year, to reduce the estimates, this was left out. Also you will recall, on our visit to the School that we considered the condition of the interior as being fair. From time to time, the school has redecorated some of the rooms and halls themselves. This has kept up the fair appearance, and I feel that they would carry on further with the maintenance of the interior if they were supplied with the material required, and in this respect I would suggest that $500.00 be included in the estimates for material such as paint, kalsomine, etc.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed herewith a supplementary estimate for the year 1941-42, in connection with the Kamloops Indian Residential School, in the amount of $5500.00. I am also enclosing a letter from the Rev. Principal, Father O'Grady, C.M.I., in which the request in this regard is made.\n\nYou will recall that during your visit here in August last, we discussed the estimates for the next fiscal year with the Rev. Principal, and arrived at the decision that certain items only should be included, and in order of importance. It was on the basis of this discussion that I prepared the 1941-42 estimates for the School last August, feeling at the time that the School was sufficiently provided for. In this regard, also, at the time no mention was made by the Rev. Principal of the Department's being expected to pay anything towards the costs of the levelling of the recreation grounds. As you are aware, the School has already gone ahead with this work on their own. While this work was discussed by the Principal and myself at different times, the work was in no way authorized by this office.\n\nRecreation Grounds: As already mentioned, the School has gone ahead with this work and up to date have moved some 2000 cubic yards of dirt and gravel. In connection with this levelling programme, under a survey of the work carried out by the Provincial Public Works for the School, the amount of gravel and dirt to be moved amounts to a total of 16,815 cubic yards. As 2000 cubic yards have been moved by the School it leaves as per this estimate, 16,815 cubic yards.\n\nWhile this work when completed will greatly improve the grounds at the school in every way, I am of the opinion that the programme is too extensive at this time when funds should be conserved. It is possible, though that the work could be modified and nearly equal results obtained, and before the Department makes any expenditure in this connection I would suggest that the Water Bureau engineers be requested to make a survey and a report. In the meantime, if at all possible at this late date, provision could be made in the estimates for an expenditure of $1500.00 to cover the moving of the gravel and dirt and the required irrigation works.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith supplementary estimates received from Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson covering improvements to the recreation grounds and repairs to buildings of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, together with a covering letter from Rev. Father O'Grady.\n\nWith reference to the former item, extensive changes to the grounds surrounding the school were commenced this year by the Rev. Principal. During a short visit to the school in August, the proposed scheme was explained to me and I looked over the work done up to that time. I advised Father O'Grady that in my opinion it was work on which engineering advice and supervision were required and that in any case it was extremely doubtful if the Department could assist in any such scheme under the conditions facing the country.\n\nThe project involves the removal of considerable quantities of earth and gravel, road work, extensive levelling operations, flume construction and the installation of a sprinkling system. My own opinion is that changes of an important character should not be undertaken at any of our schools without Departmental authority, and I should like to suggest that instructions be issued accordingly. In this particular case, the whole scheme should have been investigated and reported on by engineers of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau before any work was undertaken.\n\nRegarding item 2, an amount of $1437 was included in the 1940-41 estimates to cover the redecoration of the interior of the building, and if nothing can be done this fiscal year in this connection, provision should be made, if possible, to take care of some of the work in 1941-42.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 22, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant enclosing supplementary estimates received from Indian Agent Ferguson regarding improvements and repairs requested by the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom the estimates previously received it was considered that retubing the boilers, providing a refrigeration plant and other expenditures were extremely necessary and I am hopeful that funds can be secured for these purposes, although no definite decision has yet been made in this regard.\n\nIt will simply be impossible to consider the expenditures suggested in Mr. Ferguson's letter of October 9 and you may so inform the Principal of the Kamloops School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nOctober 22, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant there are sufficient funds in the amount allotted to the Kamloops Residential School for the current fiscal year to provide for the erection of the dairy.

The purpose of the motors is to operate the water circulating pump for both boilers. The one in use burnt out three weeks ago. Since then they have been using an old motor which has been kept at the school for just such an emergency as this. This old motor is functioning satisfactorily, but there is also the possibility that something might also happen to it and put it out of working order. If this should happen it would leave the school without heat until this equipment is replaced, or shift made with some temporary local equipment in the meantime.\n\nI am enclosing quotations as follows:\n\nFernie Bros., Kamloops, B.C.

Quotations from C.L. Wain and Son and Fernie Bros., of Kamloops, are also enclosed. Information received here from inquiries made indicates that the price of this equipment together with transportation charges to Kamloops would be very little less than the quotation of C.L.

I should, therefore, like to obtain permission from the Department to install mechanical stokers in the heating and laundry boilers, kitchen range and domestic hot water heater.\n\nThese stokers would installed at no cost to the Department; payment for them would be made mostly out of the savings of fuel. Apart from lower fuel costs a uniform temperature could be maintained throughout the School building, especially in the class rooms, which would be a great benefit to the children in the winter months.\n\nI should appreciate an early reply from the Department as the price of stokers may be advancing very soon.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAlong with the enclosed official letter asking the permission of the Department to install stokers I am writing these few lines to explain the situation more fully. The cost of lump coal is $11.06 F.O.B. Kamloops in car load lots and we burn nearly a ton a day by hand firing. Stoker coal is about $3.00 a ton cheaper and we would burn less of it. Our fuel costs would be reduced about 30%. I gave the matter very careful consideration and figured over a period of about two years and a half we could pay for the stokers mostly out of the savings in fuel. The stokers could, therefore, be installed without any cost to the Department. With this plan in mind I placed the order for the stokers but after doing so it occurred to me that I should formally ask permission from the Department to install them even at our own expense. I was told that Father Kennedy had obtained the permission several years ago and I thought it would be on file but I cannot find it. The stokers are not installed as yet but delivery will be made in a few days. If I could, therefore, obtain the permission from the Department next week I would be very grateful.\n\nI had been thinking about writing you for some time about the estimates for next year but I knew you would do all you could to obtain for us what we need most. I am very thankful for what you obtained for us this year and for having the dairy authorized out of the current year's appropriation; we are proceeding with it now as the frost is pretty well out of the ground. For this coming year I am hoping you will be able to have the new technical building authorized. I understand funds may be very limited but we really need a new building to give the boys proper manual training. Anything that you can do to obtain the building for us this year will be very greatly appreciated. --- As soon as the estimates have been passed I would be glad to know what amount has been allotted to us this year---.\n\nIf you should happen to be coming West this summer be sure to come this way and spend a few days with us. If you enjoy fishing there are great opportunities here to have a pleasant holiday; yourself and Mrs. Phelan could have a fine time.\n\nWith kindest regards and best wishes,\n\nSincerely,\n\nF.

I cannot see any objection to your action in this regard as I presume that you have ascertained that the type of stoker you are securing will give proper service and that there will be no damage caused to any of the heating and laundry boilers, kitchen range or domestic hot water heater.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The matter was brought to the attention of Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson, who obtained quotations on similar pipe from firms in Vancouver. The amount required is 512 ft. and the price per foot is $1.10 making a total of $563.20. Major McKay, the Indian Commissioner for B.C., on a recent visit, took note of the matter. I understand he will bring it to the attention of the Department in Ottawa within a few days. Should the Department find it impossible to meet this expenditure at this late date in the fiscal year I will be forced to make payment from the School funds as the pipe is absolutely necessary for irrigation, which will commence within a month. In that case I trust the Department will be able to re-imburse the School from the appropriation of the coming fiscal year.\n\nWith reference to the construction of a proposed technical School, for which estimates have already been submitted, should the Department, because of other needed repairs at this Institution, be able to appropriate only half of the amount required i.e. $1000 I would be willing to supply materials and labor to the amount of $1000, thus completing the structure, provided the Department could re-imburse us from the appropriation of the fiscal year 1942-1943.\n\nI should like to be informed, at your very earliest convenience, what amount in the estimates we have been allowed for the fiscal year beginning April 1st. next. I can secure labor in April but beyond that time it may be scarce and materials are steadily rising in price.\n\nThanking you for your assistance in the past I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 20, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Father O'Grady:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant Indian Commissioner MacKay's office is being authorized to purchase the irrigation pipe required at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. It is noted that the total cost of this pipe will be $343.20.\n\nWith reference to your previous request for construction of a new technical school I regret that in view of present conditions it was not found possible to include this item in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year. $125.00 for painting, $700.00 for retubing boilers and $750.00 for a refrigerator plant is the total amount that will be available for repairs and improvements and new equipment at the Kamloops Residential School during the fiscal year 1941-42. This amount may seem small but you can realize the very great difficulties under which we are working at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 20, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Kamloops Residential School in which he states that he requires 318 ft. of pipe for the irrigation line. He further states that the total cost of this pipe will be $343.20. You may arrange for its immediate purchase and you should attach to the voucher your purchase order. An encumbrance will be secured when the account reaches Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nKamloops Indian Residential School\n\nFOUNDED IN 1889\nIN CHARGE OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nKamloops, B.C., March 22nd, 1941.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have today received your letter of the 20th instant and wish to thank you sincerely for the appropriation to the amount of $345.20 allowed by the Department for the purchase of the irrigation pipe and also for the grants of $125.00 for painting, $700.00 for retubing boilers and $750.00 for a refrigerator plant. I can assure you these grants are very much appreciated.\n\nWhilst I was disappointed that the Department was forced to omit the construction of a new technical school from the list of items in the appropriation for the coming fiscal year I can quite readily understand the omission due to present war conditions. However I am hoping that we will be able to do something ourselves towards the construction of the building. During the past year I was able to purchase a quantity of good lumber at a very reduced price from a mill that went bankrupt. I should like to obtain the permission of the Department to proceed with the construction of the technical school, using this lumber and completing the frame-work and exterior of the building and leaving the finishing of the interior for next year. Probably at that time the Department would be able to supply us with the balance of the materials needed. If the main part of the building were thus constructed it could be used and would give ample room for the proper conducting of the manual training classes.\n\nI should like also to obtain permission from the Department to construct a small frame house for the use of our farm instructor who married recently and is obliged to reside in the city of Kamloops. The distance of the School from the city makes it difficult for him to carry on his duties which continue from early morning until late in the evening.\n\nThe implement shed is in a very poor state of repair and is in danger of being destroyed by the wind. With the Department's permission I would move it to a more convenient\nKamloops Indian Residential School\nFOUNDED IN 1889\nIN CHARGE OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nKamloops, B.C.,______________________193\n\n- 2 -\n\nMr. Philip Phelan -\n\nplace and have it properly repaired while doing so.\n\nAll of the above mentioned construction and repairs would be done gradually during the coming fiscal year of 1941-42 and at no cost to the Department. The materials are already at hand and labor would be obtained when available. Kindly let me know the wish of the Department.\n\nThanking you for your kind assistance and continued interest in our work I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF.

New tubes for this Boiler were recommended by Mr. T. J. Arnall, S.P.P. Engineer of the Dominion Department of Public Works, following his inspection of the heating plant at the School in August, 1940. Mr. Arnall has again drawn attention to the need of new tubes in his report dated August 20th, 1941, a copy of which has been forwarded to the Department.\n\nI would recommend the supply of these tubes, and would appreciate the Department's decision by airmail. It will be observed that Crane Limited, Vancouver, B.C., have quoted the lowest price, i.e. $334.88, f.o.b. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAn additional expenditure for cutting and installing the tubes will probably be necessary as it is not expected that the school engineer can undertake this work. Enquiries, however, have been made in this respect and, on receipt of Mr. Ferguson's reply, the Department will be advised.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

The quotation received from this firm indicates that the costs of a suitable unit, excluding materials and labor for preparing the existing room for refrigeration purposes, would be $720.90. It would appear, therefore, that the total amount required would be approximately $850.\n\nI may say that the refrigeration units installed by this Company in our schools and at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital have been very satisfactory.\n\nI should appreciate being advised of the Department's decision with respect to the proposed installation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 154-0-5.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to installation of a refrigeration unit at the Kamloops Indian Residential School with three blueprints enclosed as stated in place of the five requested.\n\nYour letter of the 8th instant asked that five firms be asked to tender on this installation, for which the three prints were insufficient and it has been necessary to await the additional prints to ask for quotations from all the firms mentioned. In addition, another firm has asked to be allowed to tender.\n\nThe two additional prints asked for were for use of this office and the Indian Agent at Kamloops who would have to handle the matter locally. It would be appreciated if the additional prints could be forwarded by return air mail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 22, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, requesting additional blueprints of the proposed refrigeration unit at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I may say that it takes several days to secure additional blueprints and would involve extra expenditure. There does not appear to be any reason why you cannot obtain from the unsuccessful tenderers the blueprints which were lent to them. This should give you sufficient to meet all demands.\n\nHowever, I attach, for your own information, the blueprint which we had on file in this office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B.

Wilson, Kamloops.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to Departmental letter of January 22nd, 1942 file 154-0-5 and previous correspondence regarding the proposed Refrigeration Unit for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to forward herewith tenders received from five of the seven firms from whom quotations were requested. A summary of the tenders submitted is also enclosed.\n\nYou will observe that Hall and Young of Kamloops have submitted two tenders, one for $1799.20 which covers the installation required as per Departmental specifications and the other costing $1665.20 on a somewhat modified plan.\n\nIn discussing the proposed installation with the Rev. Principal a few days ago he explained that he was not in favor of the plan submitted by the Surveys and Engineering Branch as it would deprive the school of much needed space and suggested as an alternative that the Refrigeration Room be placed in the corner of the existing space, as indicated on the attached sketch. As far as I can determine I cannot see any objection to the Principal's proposal.\n\nFather O'Grady is of the opinion that the somewhat elaborate alterations suggested by the Engineering Division are not necessary and, after a personal examination of the space, I am inclined to agree with him.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.Ont.\nI may say that I explained to the Principal that, in view of the high cost of the installation proposed by the Engineering Division, that it was doubtful if funds could be provided for the purpose this fiscal year. Father O'Grady pointed out, however, that the school will be in urgent need of such service once the warm weather sets in, as the existing ammonia plant has broken down and could not be put in serviceable condition without a large expenditure and, rather than be placed in such a position, he would be prepared to undertake the alterations required and the construction of the Refrigerator Room under the alternative plan if the Department would approve of the purchase of the Frigidaire Unit from Messrs McLennan, McFeely & Prior, Ltd., at $934.00 and allow the sum of $416.00 for the materials required. The expenditure involved under such an arrangement would be $1350.00 as against $1665.20 the lowest tender submitted.\n\nThe firm of McLennan, McFeely & Prior Ltd., has carried out a number of similar installations for our Department in recent years all of which have been highly satisfactory. It is considered, therefore, that the Department would be on safe ground in placing the order for the Unit required for the Kamloops school with this firm. The alterations required and the construction of the Refrigerator Room could be carried out by the school if an amount of $416.00 could be provided for the materials.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nMEM.\nencl.\nOttawa, 2nd March, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Refrigeration Plant, Indian Residential School, Kamloops.\n\nWith further reference to my memorandum of January 3rd last, I am enclosing for your information copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, dated February 26th which is self-explanatory, together with copies of the correspondence, blueprints and sketch, etc., referred to therein and also with a file 154-0-5, Volume 10, and the tenders submitted for this plant.\n\nIt would appear that while the plan prepared by our Engineering and Construction Service and submitted with my memorandum of January 3rd, was in accordance with the suggestions which had been advanced and the information furnished, it is now evident from later correspondence that this information regarding the area concerned was not correct in some respects and that consequently that plan would not indicate the best location for the refrigerating plant.\n\nYour attention is particularly drawn to the opinion expressed and the recommendations made in the third paragraph of the third page of Mr. Mills' memorandum in which we concur.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMarch 4, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nACTING DEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI desire to refer to our requisition of September 30, 1941, and your memorandum of October 7, 1941, with reference to refrigeration equipment for the Kamloops Indian Residential School. As requested in the last paragraph of your memorandum, the Surveys & Engineering Branch were requested to provide a specification on which tenders could be called. They submitted specifications and blueprint copies of a suggested plan for a refrigeration unit on January 3, 1942, and these were immediately forwarded to Indian Commissioner MacKay together with the names of the firms mentioned in your memorandum of October 7.\n\nCommissioner MacKay replied in a letter dated February 16, 1942, copy of which is enclosed. His letter and the tenders were then forwarded to the Surveys & Engineering Branch and I enclose, for your information, a copy of their reply dated the 2nd instant which reached our office this morning.\n\nAs you are aware, the Kamloops Indian Residential School is our largest residential school and, as they have no refrigeration plant, I believe that the installation of one is extremely necessary. You will note that the Director of the Surveys & Engineering Branch recommends acceptance of the suggestion made in paragraph 3 of page 3 of Mr. Mills' memorandum. Funds for the purchase are available in the current year's appropriation and I should appreciate\nyour giving the matter immediate consideration in order that the necessary authority may be given for the expenditure so that the work may proceed and the account may be paid before the end of the current month.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nFile No. 154-0-5\n\nSeptember 30, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Kamloops Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 78 Allotment: 12-413\n\nSHIP TO: Rev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I., Principal, Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\nNOTE: Requisition for non-consumable equipment; state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nConsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Quantity used per month | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------------------|------------|-------|\n|          |                         |            |       |\n\n1 Refrigeration unit\n\nNote: In the current year's appropriation funds were provided for the installation of a refrigeration unit in the Kamloops School. This is our largest residential school and has no refrigerating facilities. Indian Commissioner MacKay secured a quotation from McLennan, HoFeely & Prior on a single room unit having a compressor of sufficient capacity to handle a second room. If funds could be provided for such an addition, the quotation received from this firm indicates that the cost of a suitable unit, excluding materials and labour for preparing an existing room for refrigerating purposes, would be $729.50. The additional expense of preparing the room would bring the total cost to $850.00 for which amount funds are available. Several refrigerating units have been installed by McLennan, HoFeely & Prior in different schools in British Columbia and at the Coqualeetza Indian Hospital. All of these units have proved very satisfactory. I attach for your information a quotation received from McLennan, HoFeely & Prior. I should appreciate receiving your approval for accepting their tender.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 10)\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**RECEIPT FORM**\n\n---\n\n**Supplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\".**\n\n---\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                                                 | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|\n| 1        | Universal refrigeration equipment manufactured by the Universal Cooler Company of Canada, Ltd., Toronto, Ont., for the Kamloops Indian Residential School: |\n|          | Universal cooler condensing unit complete with 3 H.P., 230 volt, three phase heavy duty refrigerator motor and magnetic starter. |\n|          | Universal cooler high humidity forced air cooling unit. |\n|          | Thermostatic automatic expansion valve. |\n|          | Heat exchanger. |\n|          | Speed control for blower motor. |\n|          | 10 lb.

The tenders and other correspondence which accompanied your letter were carefully considered both by the Surveys & Engineering Branch and the Acting Departmental Purchasing Agent. Following this it was decided to place the business with MacKinnon Sales and Service, Limited, at an expenditure of $334.00 for the refrigeration equipment. Order No. 11462, dated March 6, 1942, has been forwarded to this Company and it would be appreciated if you would interview them and have the unit placed in the Kamloops School at the earliest possible date, in order that you may certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment from the current year's appropriation.\n\nIt is noted from the second page of your letter that the additional materials required for the installation of this unit will cost $415.00. You may arrange for the purchase of these materials and when forwarding the voucher before the end of March you should attach to it a copy of your purchase order. It is understood that the school management will do the necessary work of installing the equipment without cost to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

D. Caldwell,\nActing Indian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nIn the Estimates for 1942-1943 application was made to the Department, through your office, for a new ironer for the school laundry as follows:\n\n\"New double roller ironer for laundry to replace single ironer, serial No.3111, Model M711r, steam pressure 100 lbs, made by the Canadian Laundry Co. Toronto, Ont. The capacity of this old ironer too small for this School and if new one purchased it possibly could be made use of in one of the other schools or hospitals.......$2000.\n\nShould the Department find it impossible, due to war conditions, to purchase a new ironer to the amount of $2000 I feel that a used machine, at much less cost, would satisfy our needs. I recently located a used 48\" 4 roll steam laundry ironer at the Main Machinery & Metal Co. 943 Main St., Vancouver, B.C., priced at $300.00. I have had the machine examined and it has been found to be in good condition. Although a wider machine would be more desirable yet having four rolls the ironer should dry the clothes in the one operation whereas with the machine we are using at present we are obliged to pass each article through four times before it becomes thoroughly dry.\n\nAs the ironer in question is for immediate sale, I would appreciate the Department considering the purchase of it in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nsgd. F. O'Grady, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nCOPY\nCOPY\n\nKAMLOOPS AGENCY\n207 Victoria St. West,\nKamloops, B.C.\nApril 24, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a letter received from Rev. Father O'Grady, C.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Residential School, with reference to a new ironer for the school laundry.\n\nI am aware that the Department does not generally favour the purchase of second hand machinery, but as Father O'Grady suggests, it might not be possible for the Department to purchase a new ironer at a cost of $2000.00. However, it does not appear quite possible that an ironer, in good condition, as described by Father O'Grady could be purchased for $300.00.\n\nThis letter is being forwarded for your consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) J. D. Caldwell,\n\nJ. D. Caldwell\nActing Indian Agent\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter from Reverend Father O'Grady, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School regarding the supply of an ironer for the school laundry, together with a copy of a letter from Mr. Acting Indian Agent Caldwell regarding the matter.\n\nIn the estimates submitted by the Reverend Principal an amount of $2,000.00 was included for a new ironer but this item was deleted here as it was felt that the expenditure could not be recommended in view of existing conditions. Consideration might, however, be given to the purchase of the second-hand ironer referred to by the Principal from the amount allotted to the school for equipment, maintenance of equipment and supplies, etc., for the current fiscal year.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, with reference to supplying an ironer at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nProvided you consider that the ironer requested by the Rev. Principal is a good buy at the price quoted, you are authorized to secure it. Its cost will be charged against the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Kamloops School. When submitting the account you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

I do not know what the situation is regarding priorities on this kind of material. The cast iron pipe that Mr. Giddens claims is available, can apparently be secured without any bother about priority, but if this stock goes, I do not know what the situation will be. You will doubtless have information on these points.\n\nThe School Principal is naturally anxious to have fire protection for the buildings.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.E. Taylor\nIndian Agent\n\nEnclosure;\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVANCOUVER\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letter of the 14th instant forwarding requisition by the Kamloops Indian Residential School to expend $1,134.50 for the installation of a water supply for fire fighting purposes for the protection of the new school barns. At the time this letter was received, the Reverend Principal of the School called at this office and it was pointed out to him that the total amount available for this school for this year would be $1,600.00. Consequently, he expressed the opinion that the cost of the work would either have to be reduced considerably or held over. He made enquiries in Vancouver and found that he could purchase some 4 inch pipe for an amount considerably less than was quoted on in his requisition, copies of these quotations being enclosed herewith together with those accompanying the original requisition.\n\nI have no knowledge of the suitability of the pipe quoted on, and there would be insufficient by 122 feet for the purpose required. It would, therefore, be necessary to purchase additional pipe and it is doubtful whether this would be the same type of pipe, which involves considerable doubt as to the type of fittings required and whether the hydrants would be similar to the pipe.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I would suggest that the matter be referred to the Dominion Water and Power Bureau for investigation by their engineer when he is in the locality. We could then arrange to purchase as much material as funds could be provided for during the present year, and carry over any balance until the following fiscal year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, enclosing request from the Kamloops Residential School to expend an amount of $1184.50 for the installation of a water supply for fire fighting purposes to protect the new school barns.\n\nThis request has received very careful consideration and the Department is not completely satisfied that we would be justified in expending such a large amount of money at the present time for the purpose mentioned. Is the fire hazard in regard to these barns so great that such an expenditure is advisable? Is there any definite assurance that even if the installation requested by the Kamloops School were made there would be adequate fire protection for the barns? In addition to carrying out this work it would be necessary to use material that is in great demand for purposes which are probably much more urgent than the one under consideration.\n\nIn view of the above the Department is not prepared to proceed further with this matter at the present time. If there are no more pressing demands for repairs or equipment at the Kamloops School than the one above mentioned, the Department does not see any reason for expending the funds provided in the current year's appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File 154-0-5\n\nReplying to your letter of July 31st, I would advise that apart from a few fire extinguishers the new barns and dairy building at the Kamloops Indian Residential School have no protection whatever from fire, and if a fire did occur, these buildings together with their contents would, in all probability, be destroyed.\n\nIf you will refer to my letter of July 24th, you will observe that a recommendation was made therein to have the local office of the Surveys and Engineering Division investigate the requirements of the School in respect to the protection applied for in order that if the Department approved the expenditure, a suitable and adequate system would be installed.\n\nThe contents of your letter are being drawn to the attention of the Reverend Principal, but in the meantime investigation of the situation by the Surveys and Engineering Branch might be given consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

As I did not hear from him I wrote him again on the 1st instant and enclose herewith his reply of the 2nd, in which he states that the hose is required for the interior of the main school building, whereupon, further inquiries were made and the only firm able to quote on the same is Gordon & Belyea Limited, setting out the total price of the hose at $138.00, less the fittings. As these are unobtainable and it will be necessary for the school to send down the nozzles and couplings on the old hose for attachment to the new hose, if same is authorized, as this requires the use of special machinery, the cost of the fittings will be additional to the price of the hose. I have no information as to the cost of this work but anticipate that it will be a very nominal amount.\n\nIt is contemplated that a supply of this new hose will also afford some degree of protection to the outbuildings which has been a matter of discussion in the past summer.\n\nIf funds are available I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

WARREN\n\nVancouver, B.C.\nSeptember 30, 1942\nKamloops, B.C.,\nSeptember 30, 1942.\n\nSir: Re: Kamloops Indian School Fire Protection\n\nIn connection with your recent request for a report on extension of fire protection service to out buildings at Kamloops Indian School the following is a report in that connection.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION SERVICE\n\nThe attached plan shows the layout of Kamloops school and outbuildings, also pipe lines, pump house and fire hydrants. At the time the school was built and fire protection service installed, in 1927, service was adequate, as there were only a few outbuildings in addition to the main school building at that time. Since then a number of outbuildings have been erected at some distance from the installed fire service outlets, the greatest distance from a hydrant being now 700 feet.\n\nFire protection service consists of five double outlet standard fire hydrants, four of which are housed and provided with 100 feet of rubber lined fire hose and nozzle, the fifth has no housing or equipment.\n\nWater for all services is supplied by an elevated tank under a normal pressure of about 45 pounds. The tank is supplied by pumping from the South Thompson river, pump capacity is 500 gallons per minute against 90 pounds pressure. The pipelines are so valved that in event of a fire the tank pipeline may be closed off, permitting water to be pumped to the fire hydrants close to the main building, thus providing water for fire fighting purposes at the maximum pump pressure of 90 pounds.\nNEED FOR EXTENSION OF FIRE SERVICE\n\nThere would appear to be some need for making the fire service available to all buildings of any value which may reasonably be served from the existing facilities. Outbuildings are all of frame construction and have an approximate value of $25,000. Some of these, the two barns, are quite large buildings and are about thirty-five to forty feet in height.\n\nSUGGESTED FIRE SERVICE EXTENSION\n\nIt is suggested that extension of fire protection to new buildings may be best afforded by providing 200 feet additional hose and moving one hydrant to a position on the pipeline better suited to existing conditions.\n\nWith 200 feet new hose in addition to the 400 feet already on hand, sufficient could be assembled for two fire streams to be used on the larger buildings and one stream on more distant small buildings.\n\nBy the installation of a gate valve in the main pipeline, full use could be made of the pump to all fire service outlets, resulting in much better fire pressure on long hose lines.\nCOST\n\nThe cost of the suggested additions and alterations is estimated at $419.00. Material required is:\n\n200' mill yard cotton rubber lined 2\u00bd\" hose with couplings (City of Kamloops Hose thread) $180.00\n\n1 Underwriters' play pipe 14.00\n1 8\" x 8\" x 4\" Tee flanged F.& D. 17.50\n1 4\" blind flange F.& D. 3.00\n1 8\" std. hub end gate valve with wheel 54.00\n1 8\" C.I. std. flange to 8\" socket 14.00\n1 8\" std. wrot pipe 3' long flange 1 end 15.00\n2 8\" full face gaskets 1.20\n1 4\" \" \" \" .30\n16 3/4\" x 3 1/4\" Mch. bolts 2.40\n8 5/8\" x 2 3/4\" Mch. bolts .80\n1 2\u00bd\" std. hose gate valve 22.50\n30# lead and 5 lbs. yarn 3.00\n1 valve box (materials only) 6.00\n\n$333.70\n\nLABOUR\n\nMoving hydrant and re-installing valve and valve box installation 60.00\nMoving building for hydrant shelter and remodelling. 25.00\n\n$ 85.00\n\nADDITIONAL WORK\n\nDuring the course of my visit at Kamloops School, I noted that the roofs of fire hydrant shelters were all in very bad condition, much of the original roofing having disappeared. This should be renewed in order to protect equipment stored in the shelters - cost of this should not exceed $50.00 for a good quality\nroof on all four.\n\nIt is suggested that the attention of the school authorities should be drawn to the necessity of taking the greatest care possible of fire hose in order to insure its availability in good condition when required for fire protection, also that the use of fire hose for purposes other than for which it is intended should be discouraged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.C. Warren\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOctober 29, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Fire Protection, Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reference to your notation on Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of August 14th last, we are enclosing two copies of a report by Mr. Warren in which certain improvements are suggested.\n\nThese are few and simple and comprise:\n\n(a) the moving of one hydrant to a point from which the barns and hen house can be reached more easily,\n\n(b) the installation of a gate valve between the hydrant and the reservoir to make the full pressure from the pump available at the hydrant,\n\n(c) the purchase of 200 feet of 2-1/2 inch rubber lined hose and nozzle,\n\n(d) the replacement of the roofing on the hydrant shelters to protect equipment stored in them.\n\nThe estimated cost of these improvements and repairs amounts to $465.70 and if the funds can be made available and the materials can be obtained, it is recommended that they be undertaken.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing requisition for supplies for the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I presume the toilets must be in bad condition or the Principal would not ask for replacements and consequently approval is granted for the purchase of the following:\n\n- 22 Toilets complete (composition)\n- 50 Ft. 4\" soil pipe, double hub\n- 13 4\" sanitary tees\n- 13 4\" lead sleeves with bronze ferrules attached\n- 1 45 degree elbow for 4\" soil pipe\n- 1 4\" soil pipe tee\n- 1 4\" soil pipe clean out\n- 1 6\" to 4\" soil pipe reducing hub\n- 20 Ft. 4\" soil pipe for vent\n\nI feel certain that there must be bathing facilities at this school and, while I agree that showers might be preferable, their purchase would involve the use of metal that is in great demand for purposes which are probably much more urgent than the one under consideration. Under these circumstances we are not prepared at the present time to approve the purchase of the showers.\n\nWhen forwarding the account covering the cost of the toilets you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M.

Mr. Warren should get in touch with Commissioner MacKay.\n\nDirector.\nVictoria Public Building,\nVictoria, B.C.,\nOct. 19th, 1942.\n\nMr. C. F. Dawson,\nDistrict Resident Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir: Re Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nIn answer to Mr. D.M. MacKay's letter, dated Oct. 17th, 1942 regarding the Indian Residential School at Kamloops, B.C., I will answer the third paragraph first - standard black pipe and black malleable fittings are all that will be required.\n\nNow in regard to the vertical boiler - up to 1936 the laundry was operated with a vertical tubular boiler No. 43794, rated at 9 H.P. At that time the laundry was enlarged and more machines installed. The old boiler was taken out and the present vertical boiler installed. This boiler is rated at 19 H.P. This gave complete satisfaction for a short time, but when other changes were made, the boiler required forcing. A stoker was installed and the boiler further forced. Naturally when you begin to force a boiler up to and over its capacity it means a greater consumption of coal, particularly in a vertical boiler, where the efficiency of this type of boiler is very low.\n\nIn my report to Major D.M. MacKay, dated September 14th, I recommended that the boiler be retubed and am still of the same opinion and the school operate the laundry machinery in accordance with the steam capacity. This arrangement could be carried out during the duration of the present war and I understand that owing to the steel situation it will be impossible to have a boiler manufactured unless it is to be used for essential war purposes.\n\nAgain, the steam requirements of this laundry are, according to the Rev. Principal's statements, increasing so rapidly that the boiler capacity now required is nearly four times as much as in 1935.\n\nI would suggest that a proper survey be made of the probable future steam requirements so that when a new boiler is installed, one large enough to take any possible increase in steam load be provided.\n\nEven if the present boiler is discarded I do not know of any school, except possibly Christie, that will require a new boiler as all the other schools have new laundry boilers and they are giving every satisfaction.\n\nI expect to be in Vancouver on Monday, October 26th, on my return from Alert Bay and will meet Major D.M. MacKay and discuss the whole situation with him.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J. Arnall\nS.F.S. Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of Mr. Boiler Inspector Arnall's report of the 19th of October, dealing with the condition of boiler No. 44501, at Kamloops Indian Residential School, from which it will be observed that the tubes in same are getting very thin and are in need of replacement.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion between this office, the Indian Agent and the Reverend Principal, with a view to having the retubing deferred until the next fiscal year but apparently this is out of the question, and it is possible that the material may be much harder to secure as time goes on.\n\nI enclose Mr. Indian Agent Taylor's letter of the 2nd instant submitting estimates for the work from Messrs. Car & Son for $895.00, and Messrs. H. Giddens & Sons for $615.00. If funds could be found for the purpose, I would recommend that the work be carried out as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

For this work he encloses two estimates which are attached. Mr. T.J. Arnall, engineer of the Public Works Department, has inspected the boiler and states that it must be retubed at once. He further advises that standard black pipe and black malleable fittings are all that will be required.\n\nIn view of the recommendation of Commissioner MacKay and Mr. Arnall, I believe that this boiler should be retubed and I should appreciate having your approval of placing the business with Carr & Son, the lower tenderer.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nOffice of the\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Indian Agency,\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202619\u2026\u2026\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026,\namounting to $\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026in favour\nof\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nfor\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\nLetter No\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026dated\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. I.A. 518\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**Purchase Order**\n\n**Gordon & Belyea Ltd.,**  \nP.

E. Taylor, the question of lowering the intake of the pumping unit in the South Thompson river, in order to increase the supply of water for irrigation for lands of the School.\n\nThe records indicate that the well for the pumping unit was built some years ago by Reverend Father McGuire, the Principal of the School at the time. The well was not placed at a sufficient depth to allow pumping throughout the entire irrigation season, with the result that, in years when water was low in the river, the supply available for irrigation was correspondingly decreased.\n\nJust recently Mr. W. C. Warren of the Surveys and Engineering Branch made an inspection of the pumping system and submitted a report dated December 7th, 1942, a copy of which no doubt will have been received by the Department. It will be observed from Mr. Warren's report that, in order to overcome the existing difficulties, it will be necessary to lower the intake culvert two feet and the intake well three feet. An extension of about forty feet of pipeline to the intake culvert would also be necessary. The estimated cost of the improvements required is $785.00.\n\nNo provision was made in the current year's Estimates, or those of 1943-44, to provide for the expenditure involved. The amount, however, might be made available from the Irrigation Division of the B. C. Special Vote from balances remaining from projects to be undertaken through the Commissioner's Office, Division 1, provided, of course, it would be in order to use the funds for such purpose. The pupils receive instruction in the proper use of water for irrigation at the School and it is possible that, because of this, the expenditure might properly be made from Vote 79. If any improvements are authorized, they will need to be completed during the low water period in winter.\nmonths. River levels have been lower in recent years and there is no doubt that a crop loss has occurred in some years at the School due to lack of water caused by high intake.\n\nD.M.

WARREN\n\nKamloops, B.C.,\nDecember 7, 1942.\nKamloops, B.C.,\nDecember 7, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Kamloops Indian School,\nIrrigation Pump Intake.\n\nAt the request of the Indian Agent I made an inspection of the intake serving the Kamloops Indian School irrigation system on November 21st.\n\nThis inspection was made as a result of complaints by the school principal that the pumping plant did not function properly during the first two weeks of May and the last two weeks of September and that similar conditions had occurred during the past three or four years to the detriment of crop production through lack of water for irrigation.\n\nOn checking over gauge records at Chase on the South Thompson river and Kamloops on the Thompson river, I find that the river level has been too low to supply the pumping plant up to May 15th and after September 15th in 1942, after August 15th in 1941, after September 1st in 1940 and after September 15th in 1939. Apparently this condition has been a matter of complaint by the school authorities for some years past. Mr. Fredcroft reported under date of March 14, 1931 that there would likely be difficulty in securing water at the intake after September 15th but that he was unable to determine if the additional crop secured would justify the expense of lowering the intake.\nApparently up to the time of Mr. Tredcroft's report low water in the South Thompson river early in the season had not been a matter of complaint.\n\nDuring this past irrigation season the river level did not rise sufficiently to permit pumping until about May 15th and in consequence of the long dry period preceding irrigation loss of crop was considerable. The school authorities have brought under irrigation about 20 acres of additional land which is very light soil and after the experience of the past year fear that labour expended on this land would be wasted unless they are able to secure water throughout the growing season.\n\nIn order to overcome difficulties complained of, it would be necessary to lower the intake culvert 2 feet and the intake well 3 feet. An extension of about 40 feet to the intake culvert would also be necessary.\n\nThe attached plan shows a cross section of intake works and suggested reconstruction. My inspection showed that the present culvert is not laid on a uniform grade and that the suction pipe of the pump is about one foot too short to operate satisfactorily under existing conditions, but even if these faults were corrected the intake would still be too high to supply water throughout the irrigation season.\n\nTo lower the intake and culvert the recommended amount is estimated to cost $755.00.\n\nThere is on hand sufficient pipe to provide a new culvert pipe, the value of which is $190.00, so that the actual cost of the improvement may be estimated at $975.00.\nIt would be very difficult to estimate the benefit to be derived from the lengthened irrigation season as a result of the intake being changed to a lower elevation, or to assess the crop loss occasioned by lack of water throughout the growing season, and I am unable to make any recommendation in respect to the necessity for the improvement.\n\nIf the alteration suggested is to be carried out it should be undertaken during the low water period and completed by the end of March.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.C.

Date March 31st, 1943.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to refer to voucher 534/43 in favor of Kamloops Lumber Company Limited for $83.40 for lumber for cattle guard in conjunction with fencing of Adams Lake Reserve.\n\nThis voucher was rendered in error and refers to lumber purchased by the Water Power Bureau for work on the intake at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. It was billed to this office by the Kamloops Lumber Company two days after I had been advised by the Public Works that they were billing us for the lumber for the cattle guard. There was nothing on the account to indicate that it was an order from the Water Power Bureau, and as I had ordered no other lumber, I assumed that the amount was for the cattle guard material. The error was only discovered when I received the enclosed amount for $56.04 for lumber for the cattle guard.\n\nI took this matter up today with Mr. W.C. Warren and he advised that he had called two or three times at the Office of the Lumber Company for his account but they were always closed. He pointed out to them that instructions re the rendering of the account were contained in the purchase order he gave them, but apparently they had not complied with them.\n\nIt will presumably be necessary for an adjustment to be made from Ottawa in regard to these vouchers.\n\nI received a phone advise from the P.W.D. at Salmon Arm previous to receiving the amount from the Lumber Company, so you will understand that I had every reason to assume that the amount rendered was for our department.\n\n\"H.E.

The alterations conformed to recommendations made in my report dated September 30, 1942.\n\nOn the accompanying plan is shown the change made in the location of a fire hydrant at Kamloops School. A gate valve was installed above the hydrant to permit of closing off the reservoir and allow the full head of the pump to be developed for fire service.\n\nAn unused building was moved to the new location of the hydrant and was altered to serve as a shelter for the hydrant and gate valve as well as for fire hose and equipment. The cost of these changes and installations was $218.04 of which $176.59 was spent for material and $39.45 for labour.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch paid all these costs directly and also purchased two hundred feet of hose, play pipe, hose and hydrant wrenches at an additional unknown cost.\n\n[Signature]\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\n[Signature]\nW.C.

WEBB:\n\nRe: Kamloops Indian School - Alterations to Irrigation Intake\n\nIn connection with the above, the improvements suggested in my report of December 7, 1943 and authorized in Mr. Mills' letter of January 21, 1943 on behalf of the Indian Affairs Branch were undertaken and completed March 31, 1943.\n\nThe work consisted of lowering the pump well and intake pipe on the South Thompson River used for irrigation purposes on the school property. It had been found that during low water periods in the fall and occasionally in spring, water was not available for irrigation at the pump intake. The school authorities maintained that the irrigation season was unduly curtailed by lack of water for a part of the growing season and resulted in poor yield and sometimes loss of crop.\n\nThe old pipeline consisting of two 16-inch vitrified tile pipes was uncovered and relaid two feet deeper as a single pipe 104 feet long with an extension of 36 feet of 16-inch creosoted wood stave pipe at the river end. A concrete base and head wall was constructed to support the intake end of the pipe and a screen was installed to prevent drift from entering the pipe.\n\nA sheet pile coffer dam installed to facilitate excavation in the river bed was left in place and was backfilled with rock, covering the pipe to a depth of about two feet and for a distance of about 50 feet from the river end towards the well, a riprap of rock was provided outside.\nthe coffer dam.\n\nThe concrete well curbing was lowered about two feet six inches and a concrete bottom installed in the well. The work of lowering the curbing proved to be very hazardous owing to the poor quality of the concrete. This fractured badly and broke off at the bottom during the process of lowering and had to be replaced. Three feet in height was added to the top of the well to compensate for the lowering of the curbing and three feet of ten-inch wrought steel pipe was added to the length of the suction pipe. Pumping had to be maintained throughout the operation owing to excessive seepage.\n\nThe cost of the work was $839.24 of which $186.46 was expended for material and $652.78 for labour and supervision.\n\nNo difficulty should be encountered in future in securing an adequate irrigation supply. Some difficulty may however, be experienced with ice during very cold winters. The old intake pipeline was just above the ice elevation under normal conditions. It is quite possible that with an extremely low river level some damage may be caused at the outer end of the pipeline.\n\nW.G. Warren\nAsst.

C.\n\nReferring to yours of the 14th instant re desks for the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I beg to advise as follows.\n\nThe desks are required in two groups, for children 5 to 8 years, and children 8 to 10 years. In the circular of the Globe Furniture Company, of Waterloo, Ontario, who supplied the desks at present in use at the school, No. 5 desk accommodates children from 5 to 8 years, and No. 4 desk children from 8 to 10 years. Apparently the desk numbers are not uniform with all firms.\n\nAs the desks will be arranged in four rows of twelve, the following are required:\n\nNo. 5 - 22 desks, 2 fronts, 2 backs.\nNo. 4 - 22 desks, 2 fronts, 2 backs.\n\nH.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nREPORT ON KAMLOOPS INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH SEPTEMBER, 1943.\n\nGeneral;\n\nThe Kamloops Indian School was visited frequently, and on one visit the general fire alarm was tested, and the building emptied in an orderly manner, in two minutes. The test was made after lunch, when the smallest pupils were having a rest period in the upper floor dormitories, and had to use the fire escapes. When the alarm sounded, many of the girls were employed canning fruit, and when they formed up in the yard for roll-call check-up, most of them were clutching jars of fruit which they had apparently thought worth \"rescuing\".\n\nArrangements are being made to have the Chief of the Kamloops City fire brigade visit the school to assist in forming the boys and staff into an emergency brigade, and to advise re procedure, etc.\n\nH.E.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAttention Mr. D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe wish to apologize very sincerely for the delay in answering your letter of June 21. In the absence of complete details, your letter was left to the writer's attention, who was out of town and who, eighteen years ago, sold the old pump referred to.\n\nIn looking over our old records, we find that this pump was driven by a 1/2 HP vertical motor and that the distance from the base of the motor to the bottom of the vertical pump in the laundry pit was 11'. We also refer to a letter written Father O'Grady in 1942 on the same subject. At that time we quoted $280.00 on a unit but in checking over other details, we find that we would prefer to install two intermediate bearings instead of one, which would bring the price to $295.00, f.o.b. Vancouver, exclusive of sales tax.\n\nWe would suggest that the old 1\u00bd\" pipe, which must be badly corroded by this time, be removed and increased to 2\". If this is done, the new pump will give a capacity of 50 to 60 US gallons per minute. The price quoted would include vertical pump, with column and shaft and discharge pipe for 11' setting, motor base plate from which pump would be suspended, 1 HP vertical type 1750 RPM 110/220 volt 60 cycle single phase ball bearing, automatic float switch with float and rod. In other words, the unit would be a duplicate of the old one except in a larger capacity.\n\nWe are enclosing leaflet illustrating the type of pump we\nwould supply except the illustration shows a short setting without intermediate bearings.\n\nWe shall be pleased to receive your instructions and delivery would take six to seven weeks from receipt of order.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nPUMPS & POWER LIMITED.\n\nJL Marshall\n\nJL Marshall: MH\nEnc.\nType \"A\" Centrifugal Pumps\n\nBuilt in a variety of sizes from 100 to 20,000 gallons per minute. Used especially where a large diameter impeller is necessary. Very suitable for direct connection to driving power slower than electric motors, such as gas engines. See cut.\n\nType \"SD\" Centrifugal Pumps\n\nFor direct connection to slow speed prime-movers, such as steam or oil engines. We have a variety of patterns for these pumps, both for low or high heads. Much used for condenser circulation, coffer-dam work, etc.\nAutomatic Electric Sump Pump\n\nThis pump is designed to elevate to street sewers the drainage in buildings where basement, boilers, or elevator pit, or toilets, are below sewer level, and for any other service where the liquid to be pumped accumulates in a catch basin, pit, or tank.\n\nThe unit consists of a Pumps & Power centrifugal pump, direct connected by a shaft to a vertical ball-bearing motor, which is started and stopped automatically through the rise and fall of a float in the sump. For crude sewage, we provide the inside of the sump shell with special constructed cutting edges to accommodate any tough materials. The whole discharge pipe included is mounted in one piece on a cast iron plate, as shown above. All parts can therefore be lifted out for inspection or repair by simply lifting the pit cover. We also supply cast-iron pit if desired.\n\nThis outfit is of simple and rugged construction, fitted with self-lubricating bearings which require no attention. Operation is both quiet and efficient. Floor space small.\n\nWe have built these in all sizes for over ten years and have many in successful operation throughout the province.\n\nFor further information, write us.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nKamloops, B.C.

A considerable amount of lumber is also needed for this building, but local mills will not quote on any lumber, owing to inability to fill orders on hand for many months to come.\n\nThe school are expecting to install a sawmill, and will cut their own lumber. Lack of lumber has changed the building plans and more cement will be required, hence the item of 600 sacks, as compared with 400 in the attached quotation.

Father O'Grady and Staff Sergeant A. Fairbairn I made an inspection of the above-noted school and report as follows:\n\nConstruction:\nThe main building is of brick exterior construction with wood interior. It is three storeys in height over a full sized basement. The other buildings are of wood frame.\n\nOccupancy:\nThese premises are used as a residential school for Indian children. The upper floor of the main building is given over to dormitories. The next floor is given over to class rooms while the main floor has the executive offices, library, etc. The basement houses the heating plant, the laundry, playrooms, etc.\n\nFirst Aid Fire Protection:\nThere are standpipes equipped with 1\u00bd\" hose as well as fire extinguishers of various types. A supply of rubber gaskets is required for the couplings between the standpipes and hose. I found carbon tetrachloride extinguishers in several parts of the institution. Owing to the toxic properties of these extinguishers I would advise that they be removed and placed where they may be of use in case of electrical fires. I find that the larger sized extinguishers supplied are foam type which are practically unfitted for general fire fighting. They are excellent for oil fires. Five Gallon hand pump cans are far more efficient and their maintenance is negligible.\n\nRoutes of Egress:\nThere are sufficient routes of egress to take care of the children but the indication of the routes is poorly done. There is a direct route from the different rows of beds. These beds must be laid out differently in order to allow a straight passage from the furthest row of beds to the exit doorway. I may be mistaken but I am of the opinion that the bed spaces are overcrowded according to the Health Act. Exit signs pointing the most direct routes to all exits together with standard exit signs and panic bolts on all doors leading to the exits proper should be installed.\n\nRecreation Building:\nConstruction: This is quite a large wood frame structure as a general recreation hall, gym, auditorium, etc. It will have two extra exit doors.\n\nHeating:\nThis building is heated by a very nonstandard furnace which is vented by a smoke pipe through a window.\n\nProjection Room: This hall is used as a moving picture room and has a nonstandard projection room in which is installed a 6A 35 m.m. projection machine complete with sound equipment. The room which is way below standard size is very substandard in construction having wooden walls and ceiling. There are no covers and while there are two door openings one is boarded up the other has no door on it. There is not and never has been a licensed projectionist here. Should there ever be such a thing I hate to think what would happen to the projectionist's building. I find that 16 m.m. film is also used he\nManual Arts Work Shop:\nThis is a large two storey wood frame structure on a full basement.\n\nGeneral:\nThe housekeeping conditions were very good and with the changes to the exit route indications, the exits and the recreation hall there should be very little to worry about in this school.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n\"W.A. Oswald\"\nDEPUTY FIRE MARSHAL.\n\nWAG/GW\nC. to Major McKay\nSt. Sgt. Fairbairn\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of a letter dated August 10th from the Provincial Fire Marshal, together with a copy of Deputy Fire Marshal Oswald's report on his inspection of the Kamloops Indian Residential School. A copy of this report was forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Taylor and as a result of further correspondence with the Agent and the office of the Fire Marshal Mr. Taylor has submitted the attached requisitions covering the supply of 16 five gallon pump cans and 5 panic bolts for fire escape doors at the school. These items are obtainable in Vancouver at a cost of $18.27 each for the five gallon pump cans and $11.50 each for the panic bolts, making a total cost of approximately $350.00 f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nIt would appear that in order to bring the fire fighting equipment at this school up to the standards required by the Provincial Fire Marshal and in order to properly safeguard the lives of the pupils and the buildings, the equipment should be supplied, and if funds are available it is recommended that authority be granted to purchase the equipment in Vancouver.\n\nD.M.

I would suggest that his recommendations in this matter be carried out as these five gallon hand pump cans have been found most satisfactory.\n\nWith reference to the routes of egress from the dormitory I would suggest that this matter be taken in hand immediately and that the beds be rearranged and that the necessary exit signs, etc., be installed.\n\nWith reference to the projection room and the use of 35 m.m. moving picture film I may say that 35 m.m. film is an extremely dangerous material and should be used only in a standard projection. I am enclosing a copy of the Regulations governing moving picture theatres and would ask that the use of 35 m.m. film be altogether discontinued until the projection room has been brought to a safe standard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"W.

F. O'Grady and close co-operation is maintained with him regarding all phases of school activity and of building maintenance. At school cost another large area of school ground has been levelled and will be seeded to grass to provide more playing space. Dr. Tennant continually stresses the need for the inclusion in the school staff of a graduate nurse, for whose services there is ample scope and a continuing need.\n\nFollowing an inspection of the school by the Provincial Fire Marshall, steps were taken to comply with his suggestions for improvement in the fire-fighting and fire-prevention facilities.\n\nThe children are continually under the supervision of Dr. Tennant and diet sheets drawn up with a view to observing the need of vitamin values, will be submitted by the Principal for the doctor's approval.\n\nH.E.

C.\n\nIn answer to the letter from Mr. D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., enclosing prices from three Vancouver firms for a new boiler for the Indian Residential School at Kamloops, B. C., and asking for comments on the same, I beg to report as follows:\n\nI wish to state that no specification has been asked for nor supplied from this office.\n\nIn regard to the prices of the three firms, I must point out that there are two types of settings involved.\n\nTo the price of the boiler quoted on by the Vancouver Engineering Works, and the Patterson Boiler Works, must be added:\n\nA brick setting consisting of 8700 common bricks and 1300 fire bricks - approximately $1200.00\n1 - 3\" main stop valve - approx. $75.00\n1 - 1\u00bd\" injector - approximately $50.00\n22\" Connecting breeching approx. $160.00 $1425.00\n\nTo the Patterson Boiler Works' price must be added the above items plus:\n\nSuspension frame $150.00\n\nThis will bring the cost of the boilers offered by these two firms as follows:\n\nVancouver Engineering Works $1925.00 $3350.00\nPatterson Boiler Works $1900.00 $3475.00\n\nThe boiler quoted from the Blain Boiler Works is of the Eclipse type and has a steel casing and suspension and takes up less space. We have this type of boiler at Sardis and Alberni.\n\nTo the price quoted on this boiler, must be added:\n\nInside lining of the casing $400.00\n3\" stop valve $75.00\nInjector $50.00\nBreeching $100.00 $625.00\n\nThis brings the price to approximately $3125.00\n\nFreight is extra in all cases and boiler can be shipped by truck from each shop direct to the school, but the freight on the truck will be much higher than the lining required for the Eclipse boiler. The above prices are as near as I can get them.\n\nT. J. Arnall,\nS.P.P. Engineer.\nVictoria Public Building,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSeptember 17th, 1945.\n\nMr. G. F. Dawson,\nResident Architect, D.P.W.,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: High pressure Laundry Boilers -\nat Indian Residential Schools -\nKamloops and Christie, B. C.\n\nAt my last inspection of the boilers at Kamloops School, I found that the overload of this boiler was beginning to show injurious effects in the number of leaking tubes on the top plate.\n\nOn October 9th, 1942, I made a report on the condition of the Laundry, which I am now enclosing with this report.\n\nSince making my inspection, you have received a letter from Rev. Father F. O'Grady, Principal of the School, asking for suggestions to overcome the steam shortages.\n\nIn addition, you received a letter, dated September 8th, 1945, from Mr. J. Coleman, Asst. Commissioner, stating that Mr. Ashbridge, Indian Agent at Port Alberni, asked for a new laundry boiler for Christie School and quoting price for same.\n\nOn working out the steam requirements for the laundry at Kamloops School, I find that it will take a boiler of 26 H.P. When the new mangle, now in the laundry, is installed, the steam requirements will be 34 H.P. In view of the above, I will suggest the following for your consideration:\n\n(1) Install in the laundry, at Kamloops, a 50 H.P. Horizontal Return Tubular boiler, stoker-fired, to carry a steam pressure of 150 lbs.\n\n(2) Install a reducing valve on the steam main and reduce the steam to 90 lbs. at the mangles.\n\n(3) Take the present Vertical boiler, have it retubed and installed at Christie School.\n\nIf this is adopted, there will be no further trouble for some years, and it should be done as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. J. Arnall,\nS.P.P. Engineer.\nCOPY\n\nVictoria Public Building,\nVictoria, B.C.,\nOctober 19th, 1942.\n\nMr. C. F. Dawson,\nDistrict Resident Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nIn answer to Mr. D.M. MacKay's letter, dated Oct. 17th, 1942 regarding the Indian Residential School at Kamloops, B.C., I will answer the third paragraph first - standard black pipe and black malleable fittings are all that will be required.\n\nNow in regard to the vertical boiler - up to 1936 the laundry was operated with a vertical tubular boiler No. 43794, rated at 9 H.P. At that time the laundry was enlarged and more machines installed. The old boiler was taken out and the present vertical boiler installed. This boiler is rated at 19 H.P. This gave complete satisfaction for a short time, but when other changes were made, the boiler required forcing. A stoker was installed and the boiler further forced. Naturally when you begin to force a boiler up to and over its capacity it means a greater consumption of coal, particularly in a vertical boiler, where the efficiency of this type of boiler is very low.\n\nIn my report to Major D.M. MacKay, dated September 14th, I recommended that the boiler be retubed and am still of the same opinion and the school operate the laundry machinery in accordance with the steam capacity. This arrangement could be carried out during the duration of the present war and I understand that owing to the steel situation it will be impossible to have a boiler manufactured unless it is to be used for essential war purposes.\n\nAgain, the steam requirements of this laundry are, according to the Rev. Principal's statements, increasing so rapidly that the boiler capacity now required is nearly four times as much as in 1935.\n\nI would suggest that a proper survey be made of the probable future steam requirements so that when a new boiler is installed, one large enough to take any possible increase in steam load be provided.\n\nEven if the present boiler is discarded I do not know of any school, except possibly Christie, that will require a new boiler as all the other schools have new laundry boilers and they are giving every satisfaction.\n\nI expect to be in Vancouver on Monday, October 26th, on my return from Alert Bay and will meet Major D.M. MacKay and discuss the whole situation with him.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J. Arnall\nS.F.F.

Engineer, D.P.W.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith copies of Mr. T. J. Arnall's reports covering his inspection of the boiler and machinery at the Kamloops Residential School, together with copies of Inspection Certificates for boilers Nos. 43710, 43711 and 44501. Copies of these reports have been supplied to the Agency and the Principal of the school and the originals of the certificates have been posted in the boiler room.\n\nWith reference to the boiler Inspector's remarks regarding boiler 44501, I enclose herewith copy of a report dated September 17th by Mr. Arnall from which it will be noted that he recommends the installation of a 50 H.P., Horizontal Return Tubular Boiler, stoker fired, to carry a steam pressure of 150 lbs., to replace the existing boiler in the laundry which he suggests might be retubed and installed in the Christie School. Father Mulvihill, Principal of the Christie School considers that it would be impossible to land this boiler at Kakawis and further that it is in excess of their requirements, but it is considered that this question could be left in abeyance for the present pending a decision in connection with the transfer of the Christie School to the Air Force Hospital at Long Beach, near Kakawis.\n\nQuotations on a 50 H.P. boiler in accordance with Mr. Arnall's specifications were obtained in order that we might be in a position to advise the Department of the approximate cost and Mr. Arnall's comments with respect to the quotations are enclosed. It will be noted that the cost of a new boiler will be approximately $3500.00 at the school. No provision was made in the current estimates for this expenditure or in the 1946-47 estimates as we were not aware at the time the estimates were prepared that the expenditure.\nwould be necessary. In view of Mr. Arnall's warning that serious trouble will occur due to the continued overloading of the present boiler, it is thought that if possible provision should be made in the Supplementary Estimates for the necessary expenditure. It would be appreciated if you would advise if it is likely that funds can be secured from any source in the near future.\n\nD. M.

The transportation and installation charges\nwill be less, because I have no doubt that the\nboiler manufacturer can arrange to ship the boiler,\ncasing, brick lining and mountains by truck from\nhis shop, direct to the School.\n\n4.

To add 25 ft. on each of the dressing room radiators, and install a new radiator of 75 ft. at the rear of stage. Would be an additional amount to our price of $185.00.\n\nThe Unit Heaters would be $10.00 each.\n\nThe size of the Unit Heaters 450 ft. each.\nSteam at 2 lbs.\n\nThis would make our tender FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. ($1,525.00).\n\nWe did not measure the dressing rooms to determine the size of radiators.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCARR & SON\n\nFWC/HM\n\nper...\nDecember 8, 1945\n\nMr. H. E. Taylor,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nProposed Heating Installation for Indian School Auditorium\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is proposed to carry a new 3\" steam main from boilers to main building, and before leaving the boiler room, drop the 3\" steam line to a point approximately 5 ft. below grade. At that point we drip the steam main and increase the size of steam main to 3-1/2\" until we enter the Auditorium, then divide line into one 3# and one 2-1/2\" connecting to, two (2) Unit Heaters, and two (2) Radiators in the dressing rooms. All steam pipes to be covered with 4 ply air cell pipe covering neatly pasted on. Valve steam main at the boiler.\n\nAll drips and return lines to be connected to the present pump in boiler room.\n\nReturn lines in Auditorium to be covered with 3 ply air cell pipe covering.\n\nLay a 2\" plank box 10' x 12\" inside measurements from Coal Hopper to Auditorium graded from 5 ft. to 3 ft. to drain condensation back to trap. Cover roof of box with roofing felt before back filling. The return line not to be covered in the box or the boiler room.\n\nThis price includes 2 - #35 Unifin one-speed Unit Heaters & - 50 ft. Radiators in the two dressing rooms. All necessary Traps and valves. Our price for this job complete is:\nTHIRTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS. ($1,340.00).\n\nIf #683 two-speed Modine Unit Heaters are used add TWENTY DOLLARS. ($20.00). Delivery of these Heaters are three to four months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCARR & SON\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 11)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. H. E. Taylor,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTender re Heating at Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nWe take pleasure in submitting a tender to supply and install the following Steam Heating Equipment in the Auditorium of the Kamloops Industrial School:\n\n2 - Unit Heaters of 600 feet radiation capacity each. These heaters will be equipped with two speed motors to reduce sound on special occasions in the Auditorium. Each Unit Heater to be controlled by a separate thermostat. We would run a 3/4\" steam main from present steam boilers with corresponding return line to Return Pumps. Steam main to be covered with 4 ply asbestos covering throughout. Piping from Boiler Room to Auditorium to be installed in plank box and covered with heavy roofing material and all piping in box to be covered with 4 ply asbestos covering.\n\nWe would install also 3 - 75 foot Radiators in both dressing rooms and at rear of stage. All piping to be installed in such a manner that it may be drained from the Boiler Room.\n\nAll necessary painting of radiators and piping included. All electrical work required for connecting Unit Heater Motors included.\n\nThe above completely installed and left in a workmanlike manner for the sum of One Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety-five Dollars ($1,895.00).\n\nShould we be favoured with this contract, we would appreciate receiving your order as soon as possible to enable us to obtain the necessary materials, most of which are scarce at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. GIDDENS & SONS,\nper\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part II)\nD.M. Mackay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWith further reference to yours of September 6th last, re recommendations of the Deputy Fire Marshall and the heating of the recreational building.\n\nI have finally succeeded in securing estimates from Carr & Son and H. Giddens & Sons of Kamloops, and they are enclosed herewith in triplicate. A supplementary estimate from Carr & Son is also enclosed in triplicate, giving additional information requested by me.\n\nIt will be noted that the estimate of Carr & Son provides for two 50' radiators and two Unit Heaters of 450' radiation capacity each, compared with three 75' radiators and two Unit Heaters of 600' radiation capacity each.\n\nI discussed the matter again with the Rev. Principal and he seems to think that the radiation at the rear of the stage could be dispensed with. It would therefore seem that the tender of Carr & Son would meet the heating requirements.\n\nH.E. Taylor,\nIndian Agent.\n\nHET/NC\nEncls.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nOn October 31st I forwarded you a copy of a letter dated August 16th from the Provincial Fire Marshal, together with copy of Deputy Fire Marshal Oswald's report on his inspection of the Kamloops Indian Residential School. In his report Mr. Oswald mentioned the construction of the recreation building and stated that it was heated by a very nonstandard furnace which was vented by a smoke pipe through a window. Mr. Indian Agent Taylor subsequently secured an estimate of the cost of installing steam heating equipment in the recreation building and his letter of December 27th and tenders from Carr and Son and H. Giddens and Sons of Kamloops, are enclosed herewith.\n\nAs the Department has been called upon to provide a new boiler for this school at a cost in excess of $3000.00 it is not known whether funds will be available for the installation of this proposed heating system which will cost over $1500.00.\n\nD.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to installing a new boiler at the Kamloops Residential School. It is noted that the firm request an amount of $840.00. This appears high. In Mr. Arnall's letter, which you forwarded under cover of your communication of November 23, 1945, the following statement is made:\n\n\"The boiler quoted from the Blain Boiler Works is of the Eclipse type and has a steel casing and suspension and takes up less space. We have this type of boiler at Sardis and Alberni.\n\n\"To the price quoted on this boiler, must be added:\n\n| Item                  | Price   |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| Inside lining of the casing | $400.00 |\n| 3\" stop valve         | $75.00  |\n| Injector              | $50.00  |\n| Breeching             | $100.00 |\n\n$625.00\"\n\nYou will note that he specially mentions Breeching and the quotation from the Blain Boiler Works states that any new Smoke Breeching will be extra to their quotation of $840. I would appreciate it if you would again review the quotation both with the firm and Mr. Arnall.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKamloops, B.C.\nApril 17, 1946.\n\nD.M.

Giddens & Sons, one of the tenderers, that much of the material required is in very short supply, and that ample notice is required if the work is to be completed before next winter.\n\nDue to the lifting of price ceilings, the cost of material will advance at least 6% and I suppose this increase will be taken into consideration if a contract is awarded.\n\nH.E.

I was under the impression that this building\nwas a combined recreational and vocational building.\n\nIs the quotation of Carr & Sons, dated December 8,\n1945, and submitted to this office in your letter of January 3,\n1946, still good?\n\nReferring to your letter of October 31, 1945, with\nwhich you enclosed the report of the Fire Marshall, I presume\nyou brought to the attention of the Principal his remarks regarding\nthe recreational building. Evidently the Fire Marshall thought\nthere was considerable fire hazard, not only due to lack of means\nof egress, but also on account of the operation of a 35 m.m.\nmovie machine.

J. Arnall, from which it will be noted that in his opinion, the Blain Boiler Works quotation of $840.00 plus cost of connecting breeching is very reasonable.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYour file 4-11-4\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th inst., requesting information regarding what compliance has been made with the recommendations of the Deputy Fire Marshall following his inspection of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I would advise as follows:\n\n1. Beds in dormitories have been re-arranged to allow a straight passage from the furthest row of beds to the exit doorway.\n\n2. Exit signs have been installed in dormitories.\n\n3. Panic bolts supplied have been installed.\n\n4. Extra two exit doors have not been installed in the recreational building. There are, at present, in addition to the main entrance, four fire exit doors with red lights. The school principal thinks that the Deputy Fire Marshall may have thought that there were only two fire exit doors, because, when he inspected this building, he did not go into the dressing rooms, from which two of the fire exit doors are located. He viewed the interior of the building from the main entrance, from which only two of the fire exit doors are discernible. No suggestion was received as to just where the additional exits should be placed.

Taylor,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nProposed Heating Installation for Indian School Auditorium\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRevised Estimate\n\nIt is proposed to carry a new 3\" steam main from boilers to main building and before leaving the boiler room, drop the 3\" steam line to a point approximately 5 ft. below grade. At that point we drip the steam main and increase the size of steam main to 3-1/2\" until we enter the auditorium, then divide line into one 3\" and one 2-1/2\" connecting to 2 unit heaters, and 2 radiators in the dressing rooms. All steam pipes to be covered with 4 ply air cell pipe covering neatly pasted on. Valve steam main at the boiler.\n\nAll drips and return lines to be connected to the present pump in boiler room. Return lines in auditorium to be covered with 3 ply air cell pipe covering.\n\nLay a 2\" plank box 10\" x 12\" inside measurements from coal hopper to auditorium graded from 5 ft. to 3 ft. to drain condensation back to trap. Cover roof of box with roofing felt before back filling. The return line not to be covered in the box or the boiler room.\n\nThis price includes 2 - #35 Unifin one-speed unit heaters. 2 - 75 ft. radiators in the two dressing rooms, and install a new radiator of 75 ft. at the rear of stage. All necessary traps and valves. Our price for this job complete is SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS. ($1,677.50).\n\nIf #583 two-speed Modine Unit Heaters are used add TEN DOLLARS each $10.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCARR & SON\n\nFWC/HM\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part II)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of May 4th in connection with the proposed installation of steam heating equipment in the recreation building at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I would advise that the building in question is used as a general recreation hall, gymnasium, auditorium, etc., but is not used for vocational training. Revised quotations submitted by Carr & Sons and H. Giddens & Sons covering the heating installation are enclosed herewith. These are somewhat higher than the quotations previously submitted due to lifting of price ceilings and an advance in the cost of materials.\n\nThe Fire Marshal's comments following his inspection of the recreational building were conveyed to Mr. Indian Agent Taylor some time ago and he was requested to have the various matters attended to, his report of May 15th in this connection is enclosed herewith, from which it will be noted that all items have been attended to with the exception of the two extra exit doors recommended by the Fire Marshal. It would appear, however, that these extra doors may not actually be necessary and I have written to the Fire Marshal asking for further information regarding this.\n\nD. M.

MacRitchie, Chief Priority Officer of the War Assets Corporation in Montreal in connection with the purchase of a Caterpillar D6 from the Military Training Centre at Vernon, B.C. I wish to thank you for your efforts towards obtaining this machine for our needs.\n\nAs far as I know the machine in question has not yet been declared surplus. I learned recently that all such equipment of the Armed Forces, being Crown property, is turned over, when not needed, to the Crown Assets Allocation. If the latter have no use for it it is then turned over to the War Assets Corporation for sale to the general public.\n\nSince the demand for heavy equipment is so great we may have difficulty in getting this machine from the War Assets Corporation if it is declared surplus to them. As I see it now the best procedure would be to apply to the Crown Assets Allocation to have the machine allocated to us on whatever basis they wish. Since we are under the Department of Mines & Resources they might allocate the machine to the Department for our use. However, if it has to be declared to the War Assets Corporation to be sold it should be earmarked for us. - The Army Headquarters who own the machine and the Crown Assets Allocation each must have offices in Ottawa.\n\nThanking you in advance for what attention you may give to this matter I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

O'Grady, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, British Columbia.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Improvements at Kamloops Indian Res. School, B.C.\nAttention: Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThe above school is possibly the largest in the Indian Department system of schools. It is, generally speaking, in good condition in spite of the fact that very little has been set aside for the last ten or twelve years, for general repairs and upkeep. The following demands are now made by the principal and I hope that sufficient money will be provided in the coming estimates, for each of them:\n\n(1) The school has an authorized pupilage of 285 but it has had at least 305 present on its roll and the principal now demands an increase of 20 pupils because with the increase cost of living, it is becoming impossible for him to keep this supernumerary number without compensation.\n\n(2) Only $1500.00 has been provided for general repairs and upkeep for this very large building and this sum, you will admit, is not sufficient. The principal is, therefore, asking that this be increased to $3000.00 per year. At the present time, all outside buildings have to be painted and the interior of the school should also receive a great deal of attention. It is impossible to do so with the amount of $1500.00 which has been provided in the past.\n\n(3) Father O'Grady, the principal, who has had great deal of experience in the supervising of Indian Reserves, has come to the conclusion that for his district, the establishment of a Mounted Police Post is essential and he now asks the Department to study this project.\n\n(over......)\nand, if possible, provide the funds necessary for this purpose, out of the present year's estimates. The Indians have a salutary fear of the Mounted Police and a great deal of drinking, if not all of it, would completely disappear from the Reserve under the protection of this Post. Most of the immorality and lewd conduct of young people would cease, if the constant vigilance of the Mounted Police was present. The same would hold in the case of free unions. At the present time, the Indians have much less Police protection than the White people and they are abusing their liberty with results that are becoming every day, more costly to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\n(4) The school has established a small saw-mill to provide lumber for its own needs and those of the Indians desiring to build a home for themselves, particularly for such former pupils who are getting married and who wish to establish their homes on the Reserves. The cost of this saw-mill has been around $3,000.00 and so far, only $600.00 has been received from the Department towards it. Father O'Grady is of the opinion that a larger amount should be contributed by the Department, as this mill will supply the needs of the Indians, which is the normal duty of the Department to provide for.\n\n(5) In the Kamloops Territory, irrigation is the only means of growing crops of grain and hay. This holds for the Whites as well as for the Indians. At the present time, the Indians of the Kamloops Territory have almost no irrigation facilities. If they had, they would probably cease being just labourers and would establish homes on their own lands. Would it be possible for the Department of Indian Affairs to have a survey made to find out what the cost of an irrigation project would be? A sum of money for this purpose should be provided in this year's estimates and if the scheme proved feasible, funds for this purpose could be included in next year's budget.\n\n(6) The last request of Father O'Grady is for a High School. He claims that Kamloops is sufficiently central for this purpose and he also states that his own school would provide, on the present basis of 8th Grade graduates, about 20 pupils per year. As Williams Lake, Lejac, Mission City and Sechelt Schools could also send their 8th Grade pupils to Kamloops, without very great expense, the pupilage of this High School could easily reach from 110 to 130 pupils. This number would provide four classes of about 30 pupils each.\n\nOf course, a High School would mean the building of a complete unit and would be fairly costly, but I think it is a practical solution of the High School problem, as far as our B.C. Indians are concerned and one which should receive the immediate attention of the Department.\n\nHoping that the above will be given your serious consideration,\n\nI remain, dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 14 September 1946.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, further consideration will be given to the recommendations contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of your letter.\n\nYour recommendation regarding the establishment of an R.C.M.P. station and also your recommendation with regard to additional irrigation of the land will be brought to the attention of the officials who handle such matters.\n\nWe have also carefully noted the request for the establishment of a High School. As you realize, this raises several important points and the whole situation will have to receive very careful consideration. We will certainly keep the matter in mind and we will no doubt have an opportunity of discussing it with you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nLaurier Ave. East,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to submit a tender of four hundred and twenty-two dollars ($422.00) for the above.\n\nWe have included for cutting and placing two fire escape doors with panic bolts; supplying and installing sash over north door; erecting two porches with shingled roof etc.; porches to have handrails and steps, concrete blocks at foot of steps and concrete blocks under posts; make necessary electrical connections and install lights; paint all woodwork and make good stucco work.\n\nyours truly\n\nJ.

If the amount asked for can be provided I would recommend that the application be approved, otherwise the school asked to carry out the work with their own funds.\n\nD. M.

Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to an expenditure of $422.00 for the installation of panic doors etc. at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn your letter of May 25th, 1946, you expressed some doubt regarding the necessity of these doors. However, we presume that you now consider these doors necessary and as they will likely provide additional fire protection the expenditure mentioned in your letter of September 12th is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nKamloops Indian Residential School\nFOUNDED IN 1889\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nKamloops, B.C., Sept. 18th, 1946.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of September 10th, attached to which was a copy of a letter you received from Mr. M.L. Fitzgerald, of the War Assets Corporation in Vancouver in connection with the purchase by us of a Caterpillar D6 from the Military Camp at Vernon, B.C.\n\nPrevious to our correspondence on this matter I discussed the purchase of this tractor with Mr. Fitzgerald. He stated that the Corporation had nothing to do with the machine since it was not yet declared surplus; that this equipment, being Crown property belonged to the Crown Assets Allocation, who, if they had no use for it, would turn it over to the War Assets Corporation for sale. Mr. Fitzgerald also stated that he was not sure whether we could be given a No. 1 priority and the first chance to purchase the tractor. The latter statement is confirmed in his letter to you of Aug. 26th, when he says that the sale will be subject to earlier dated priority. All this is subject, of course, to the machine being turned over to the War Assets Corporation for sale.\n\nIt is because of the uncertainty of being able to obtain the machine from the War Assets Corporation when they get possession of it that I suggested in my letter of September 3rd, that the Crown Assets Allocation be contacted to have the machine transferred to us on whatever basis they wish i.e., loan or otherwise. It is because I want to be assured of getting the tractor that I suggest the latter move. If Mr. MacRitchie can assure us of getting the machine it would not be necessary to approach the Crown Assets Allocation.\n\nI wish to thank you for your efforts on our behalf; they are certainly most appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 24, 1946.\n\nCaterpillar D6 at the Vernon Military Training Centre\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received a request from the Reverend Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School for a Caterpillar D6. It is understood that this bulldozer was used at the Military Training Centre at Vernon, B.C. We have been advised by Mr. M.L. Fitzgerald, Western Regional Sales Manager of the War Assets Corporation, that this machine has not yet been declared surplus. Therefore we are now advising you that when it is declared surplus, we would like it for use at the Kamloops Residential School. This school is the largest Indian school in Canada and has a large farm attached to it.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nFollowing our telephone conversation of today I am enclosing the particulars of the tractor located at Edmonton, Alta. and for sale by the War Assets Corporation of Calgary, Alta.\n\nThis tractor, if purchased by the Department, would fill a great need here at the School and could be used for the extension and improvement of the irrigation systems on the adjoining Reserves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nThe Department is aware of the recent representations made by Rev. Father O'Grady for the supply of a tractor for use at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI think it is agreed that a real need exists for this type of equipment not alone at residential schools such as Kamloops, but at many of the larger Reserves as well. I may say that I have held the opinion for some time that heavy tractors should be supplied to a number of our agricultural Agencies for clearing and improving land suitable for cultivation, and indulged the hope that our needs, at least to some extent, would be met from the large number turned in as surplus by various Government departments once the war ended. The War Assets organization was not in the picture at the time otherwise it is doubtful if such hopes would have been entertained as we have not been successful in getting much in the way of any type of equipment from this source irrespective of the pressing character of the need. So it would appear that if we are going to get anywhere in supplying such equipment to our Agencies it will be necessary for the Department to resort to purchase.\n\nFather O'Grady has been in touch with the War Assets Corporation, Calgary, who have advised that they have a diesel tractor at warehouse No. 30, 123A Street and 127th Avenue, Edmonton, at the price of $7,856.00, \"as is and where is.\" A copy of the correspondence regarding the unit in question, as received from Father O'Grady, is enclosed herewith. This type of machine is regarded as being eminently suitable for our purposes in this province and it is felt that if the necessary funds can be secured the War Assets should be approached with a view to its purchase.\n\nIt is fully expected that there will be a substantial balance, possibly $5,000 to $6,000, of the B.C. Special Vote - Irrigation, that we will be unable to spend this year due largely\nto lack of necessary materials and labour. In addition to this it is anticipated that there will be a substantial balance available from the Housing Vote to this province unless the supply of materials between now and the end of the current fiscal year greatly improves. Would it be possible to arrange with the War Assets for the purchase of this tractor, payment to be made in April from such balances as remain? The tractor would, of course, be the property of the Department and available for use on Reserves as required. It would, however, be advisable to have the tractor housed at the Kamloops Indian Residential School where it would be available to the school for use on the understanding that the school in return would be responsible for its proper care and maintenance, which certainly should be properly provided for in the case of a unit of such value. If it is possible to secure the machine on the basis suggested I would be prepared to recommend that the balances of the B.C. Special Vote unspent at the end of the current fiscal year be used to meet the cost.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department could give early consideration to this matter as it is understood that War Assets, Calgary, are about to offer the equipment for sale to the public early next week.\n\nD.

Before an Order-in-Council can be obtained, the Chief Treasury Officer has to certify that funds are available. Regarding your suggestion for using balances available at the end of the fiscal year in your various special votes, he would be unable to do this due to the fact that he would have no assurance that any stated amount would be left over for the purpose of purchasing this machine.\n\nIt is felt that this tractor would be heavier than would be required for the purposes described in your letter, unless of course the land to be cleared was very heavily wooded. The biggest expense in maintaining such a machine would be the payment of the driver, who would naturally have to be fully qualified in order to keep the machine in proper running order.\n\nWe do concur in the need for a machine for the purposes you mention in your letter but feel that the price of $7,836.00 for a used machine is much too great. As you are\n\n........ aware\naware, the funds in the B.C. Special Vote - Irrigation - must be spent for irrigation purposes only. As for the Housing Vote, it is expected that the project being undertaken at the Port Hardy Military Camp will take most of these funds that are available.

The biggest expense in maintaining such a machine would be the payment of the driver, who would naturally have to be fully qualified in order to keep the machine in proper running order.\n\nWe do concur in the need for a machine for the purposes you mention in your letter but feel that the price of $7,836.00 for a used machine is much too great. As you are\n\n......... aware\naware, the funds in the B.C. Special Vote - Irrigation - must be spent for irrigation purposes only. As for the Housing Vote, it is expected that the project being undertaken at the Port Hardy Military Camp will take most of these funds that are available. It is hoped that a cheaper machine can be located for your needs in the near future.\n\nDirector.\nunable provide seventy-eight hundred dollars required for Edmonton tutor stop and mail letter detailing Adams and commission matters now South.\nOttawa November 15 1946\n\nReverend Father F O'GRADY  \nPrincipal Indian Residential School  \nKamloops British Columbia\n\nREGRET UNABLE PROVIDE SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS REQUIRED FOR EDMONTON TRACTOR -stop- AIR MAIL LETTER DETAILING REASONS SENT COMMISSIONER MacKAY NOVEMBER SIXTH\n\nBernard F Neary\n\nCharge Indian Affairs  \nMines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 154-0-5 (W.T.I)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of October 4th and Kamloops Agency voucher No. 225, I am enclosing herewith a duplicate copy of prepaid express receipt covering express and insurance on sports equipment for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nD.

Father F.P.O'Grady in charge at the school plenty of work now in sight to keep the machines working full time, not only at the school but on surrounding Reserves.\n\nSuch a purchase by the Indian Department would receive the recommendation of B.C.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 14th, file 4-11-4, and the attached copy of a letter from the Department, who felt that the amount of $7836.00 for the purchase of the tractor was too heavy an expenditure, I would advise that we would be prepared immediately to provide half of the amount involved if we could be re-imbursed by the Department in the next fiscal year. All that the Department would be called upon to provide at present would be the sum of $3918.00.\n\nIf immediate authorization for the above method of procedure could be obtained the tractor could be secured at once while it is still available. The War Assets Corporation has given us the first priority and has held the machine for over a month pending a decision.\n\nThe need for this piece of equipment is so great and the use to which it can be put is so valuable that it is felt that this opportunity should not be missed of purchasing a tractor such as the one in question which, at the present time, is otherwise almost unobtainable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 154-0-5 (W.T.)\n\nI wish to refer to the subject matter of my letter of November 2nd and your reply thereto dated November 6th and wish to enclose for your information a further letter regarding the matter from Rev. Father O'Grady, Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School. It will be observed that the Rev. Principal is prepared to put up half of the cost of the tractor, i.e. $3,918.00 provided the Department will meet the balance required and reimburse the school for their outlay in the next fiscal year.\n\nAlthough the decision as set out in your letter of November 6th is quite definite with respect to the purchase of this particular machine, I felt that this new proposal submitted by Principal O'Grady should be placed before the Department for consideration.\n\nInasmuch as a machine of this kind could be used to great advantage in the construction of irrigation works and clearing the necessary rights-of-way etc., it seems to me that funds of the B.C. Special Vote - Irrigation, could properly be used for the purchase of such equipment. As you have advised, however, we are not in a position to know what the balances in this and other divisions of Vote 79 will be until after the close of the current fiscal year and consequently such funds could not at this time be applied on the purchase of equipment or for other purposes. The Department's difficulty when funds are not readily available for the purchase of such equipment is appreciated.\n\nThis type of machine is not too heavy for the work it would be required to do in this province and it would probably be found more economical in the long run to purchase heavy machines than to supply the lighter type with consequent high repair costs resulting from their use in work much too...\nheavy for them. The operation of these heavy machines could be safely entrusted to intelligent and trustworthy Indians and it is doubtful if they would be any more remiss in the proper care and use of such equipment than whites. Indians have satisfactorily operated the heavy and expensive logging tractor at Bella Coola and there is no reason why Indians on other reserves should not be equally capable of doing so.\n\nYou might let me have your decision with respect to Father O'Grady's proposal at your early convenience.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nMrs. Walter\nWould like to\nknow\nCol. Neary,\n\nThe tractor referred to appears to be a D-8 which is quite a powerful machine. Do you consider that we should buy larger than a D-4.\n\nI believe that a new D-4 can be secured for $6390. and a reconditioned - possibly for $4,000.00.\n\nWe are considering the purchase of a D-4 for road construction at St. Regis, and shipping it to points in Ontario and Quebec when it is required.\n\nIt will be noted that mention is made of men being trained to operate it, and that Indians operating are not likely to be less competent than white men. We talked this over regarding the D-4 for St. Regis, and it was considered that one man only should operate it - and that he should accompany the machine wherever it goes.\n\nTo date we have no such machines in Ontario and none that I know of in Quebec or the Prairies, owned by the Department. We have a D-4 at Eskasoni and one at Shubenacadie,\n\n(Mr. Wallon)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part II)\nCOPY FOR INFORMATION OF\n\nRev. Father F. O'Grady, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, December 17, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nTRACTOR FOR KAMLOOPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nReference - your letter 4-11-1 of December 5 -\n\nThe proposal outlined in your letter has been given careful consideration. The problem is that the Department is willing to purchase a tractor for use at the Kamloops School and for use on irrigation projects and road building in the Kamloops Agency, but the purchase of this particular machine is felt to present certain difficulties.\n\nAt the present time the largest machine in use on similar projects is a D-4. One of these is in use in Nova Scotia and has been found to be as heavy as required for all purposes. We also have one in use at Norway House, Manitoba, which is proving to be very satisfactory.\n\nThe D-8 machine is so heavy that a special carrier vehicle is required to move it from one place to another. If you intend using it on irrigation projects and for road building, then it will be necessary to use provincial highways for transporting it. The laws of the province prohibit a tractor being driven on provincial roads. Therefore you would require a tractor transporter.\n\nOn the other hand a D-4 machine can be loaded into a two or three ton truck and moved from one project to another quite easily.\n\nThe second disadvantage of using a D-8 machine is that considerably more maintenance is required to keep it operating.\noperating efficiently. This means the employment of a highly skilled driver.\n\nWould you please bring these two points to the attention of the Reverend Father O'Grady, as it is quite possible that he does not realize the large size of the D-8 machine and its very heavy costs of operation.\n\nDirector\nFEB. 1 1943\n\nKAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nBUILDINGS ACCOUNTS & C.\n\nSEE 154-0-5 VOLUME 12\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10 Volume 6450)\n\nFile 882-5, part 12\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nGeneral Administration.\n1923 - 1929\n\nFile 882-5, part 13\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1947 - 1948\n\nFile 882-5, part 14\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1948 - 1949\n\nFile 882-5, part 15\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nBuilding Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts.\n1949 - 1950\n\nFile 882-9, part 1\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nAgricultural land-irrigation with accompanying supplies and accounts (plans).\n1912 - 1926\n\nFile 882-9, part 2\nKamloops Agency-Kamloops Residential School -\nAgricultural land-irrigation with accompanying supplies and accounts (plans). 1926 - 1932\nGOVERNMENT OF CANADA\n\nREQUISITION FOR TEMPORARY APPOINTMENT\n\nTO THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION:\n\nYou are hereby notified that, because of a temporary pressure of work in this department, the employment of extra assistance is necessary.

Most of the steel, brick, stone, tile and lumber are now on the site.\n\nOwing to the unfavourable weather little progress has been made since December on the building.

His first inspection was made in the month of August. The Civil Service Commission issued a certificate in his favour for a period of 6 months, at $6.00 per day; this certificate was effective from August 21, 1923, and, it therefore, expires today. While the certificate has expired, Mr. Macaulay has only worked during its currency for a period of 93 days. Under the new regulations of the Civil Service Commission, however, it is necessary to obtain the authority of Council for continuing the services of any temporary official beyond a period of 6 months.\n\nA good start has been made on the school, and the Contractor is now endeavouring to have all of the materials required in the building delivered, in order that, as soon as the weather is favourable, the work may be rushed to completion.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, February 21, 1924.\nCertified copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 7th March, 1924.\n\n******\n\nR\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS:\n\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that by a certificate of the Civil Service Commission, authority was given for the employment of Mr. W.

Foran, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nCivil Service Commission,\nOttawa.\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Dr. Scott;\n\nWith reference to the Farm Loan Act passed by the Federal House, by means of which several of the Provinces will be enabled to finance agricultural long-term loans, I had an interview today with Hon. J.E. Brownlee, Premier of Alberta, on the subject of my prospective employment in this work.\n\nMr. Brownlee expressed the opinion that it will be next fall, at the earliest, before this Act can be brought into operation in Alberta, owing to the delay in getting all the details worked out at Ottawa. He expects there will have to be another conference between the Provincial and Federal governments, which can only take place after the conclusion of the present session, by which time the Ministers will want a little rest and recreation after their arduous duties. Then, he says, holiday time will be here, and it will be difficult to speed things up at that time of year.\n\nYou were kind enough, Dr. Scott, to give me a very good reference, which I am sure will prove of great value in connection with my application, and for which I tender my sincerest thanks.\n\nIn the meantime I wish to place my services at the disposal of the Indian Department, either in British Columbia or elsewhere, provided there is any vacancy which I might fill. When in Victoria a few weeks ago I was told that the Department contemplate erecting a new Indian school at Alert Bay; and that there may be other building work in the Province too. If so, and if the Department has not already appointed an Inspector to supervise the work, I should be pleased to serve in that capacity, at Alert Bay or elsewhere.\n\nThe Department already has full knowledge of my capabilities, having served as Inspector of Construction almost continuously for nearly five years in Alberta; in addition to which I was at the head of the Island Building Company, Ltd., which Co. erected the Kuper Island School in 1915.\n\nI cannot afford to wait indefinitely on the Alberta Farm Loan appointment, and am ready to go to work again for the Indian Department, under whom I had the honour of serving before.\nI may say I am familiar with conditions at the Pacific Coast, having operated there as building contractor over a number of years. Also, I believe my appointment as building inspector would meet with the approval of Commissioner Ditchburn, with whom I had pleasant relations during the construction of the Kuper Island school.\n\nI am leaving for Vancouver on the 27th, and may be reached at the address indicated at the head of this letter.\n\nHoping to be favoured with an early reply, and assuring you of my best efforts in the event of my engagement,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-5, part 12)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 29, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant and to say in reply that tenders have been called for the erection of a unit for the Kamloops Indian Residential School and that the contract is awarded.

If, however, you can secure from the Principal an estimate of the labour costs I am prepared to refer the matter to the Department.\n\nFor D. M.

Bruce,\nActing Indian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Bruce:\n\nIt would be appreciated if the major portion of the funds allotted for improvements to the School during the current year could be used to engage skilled labour. We are about to construct a root cellar 125 ft. long and 30 ft. wide with 9 ft. cement walls. Although the older boys could learn a certain amount from assisting in the construction of this building it is felt that the work is of too laborious a nature for them. It would be much more preferable to engage only adult and it would be appreciated, therefore, if the funds set aside for materials could be used for labor as we have all the materials on hand necessary for this building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"F.

A copy of my letter of October 5th to Mr. Bruce in this connection is also enclosed, following which I received the attached letter dated February 11th from Father O'Grady and the accounts referred to therein in the amount of $1897.37 covering labour costs.\n\nAccording to our records funds provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and equipment for this school amount to only $1750.00 and as an expenditure of $2700.00 has already been incurred for a new boiler, plus installation costs, it is thought the Department may not be in a position to meet the attached account. Father O'Grady's request for payment of the account apparently is based on the fact that the school provided the materials for the root cellar and although our file indicates the Department placed the order for these materials there is nothing to show they were supplied at Departmental expense. Under the circumstances and providing funds are available I am recommending payment of the labour costs.\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, February 26th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th inst., enclosing an account from the Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, with reference to the construction of a root cellar.\n\nAs you point out in your letter, the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for the Kamloops School has already been exceeded.\n\nWe are approaching the end of the fiscal year and there is a very heavy demand on our funds. At the present time we cannot see our way clear to paying this account but it is possible that before the fiscal year end we may have some funds on hand and if so, favourable consideration will be given to the account from the Kamloops School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEarly last year the Department provided\n25 hospital beds for use in the Kamloops Indian Residential School Infirmary. These beds were supplied without mattresses and apparently no action has been taken in the interval to provide mattresses.\n\nI am informed by Dr. P.S. Tennant that a suitable mattress can now be secured from the War Assets Corporation at a cost of $2.50 each, and it would be appreciated if you would authorize me to place an order for 25 of these for use in the Infirmary at this school. A reply by air mail would be appreciated.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Doctor Tennant,\n\nMattresses - Kamloops Indian Residential School Infirmary\n\nWe are in receipt of a request dated February 18, from Mr. D. M. MacKay, with respect to the purchase of 25 mattresses at $2.50 each from War Assets Corporation.\n\nIf you think this a wise move you are given authority to proceed. As you are aware, this is somewhat different from equipping an institution under our immediate administration and although apparently the 25 beds were obtained on our authority it is difficult to be certain at this distance that we should make the additional commitment and to the extent of 25 beds for a school infirmary.\n\nHowever, we depend on your familiarity with the local requirements and you are authorized to use your judgment in the purchase of up to 25 mattresses.\n\nMr. MacKay appears to feel that there is some urgency in this matter so that you should pass your decision to him without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Over two years ago 25 hospital beds were purchased from War Assets and supplied to the Kamloops Residential School. Mattresses were not supplied.\n\n3. Normally the infirmary can accommodate 20 beds comfortably, however during epidemics there have been as many as 60 acutely ill children in bed at one time.\n\n4. The nursing care of sick patients on low school cots is a back breaking task consequently 25 beds were ordered to cope with emergencies.\n\n5. The order for mattresses has been reduced to 20 this being the number of beds normally used in the infirmary at Kamloops.\n\nP.S.

Giddens & Sons of Kamloops, B.C. is in connection with the installation of a new stoker of sufficient feed and capacity to fire the new boiler presently to be installed in the laundry of the School.\n\nH. Giddens & Sons wired Vancouver yesterday and received the reply that there is only one stoker of this size available for immediate delivery. If it could be purchased at this time it could be installed by the Blain Boiler Works Ltd. of Vancouver, who are erecting the laundry boiler as the installation of the existing stoker, I understand, was included in their contract. I should imagine that it would be less expensive to install a new stoker than a used one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

McKay,\nIndian Agent,\nDept. Of Mines & Resources,\nP.O. Box #70,\nVancouver B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Boiler Installation,\nKamloops.\n\nOur men arrived in Kamloops on March 3rd 1947 to install the new Boiler, but found that the concrete floor was not completed, consequently they could not proceed except to disconnect and remove the old Boiler. Father O'Grady advised them that he would be ready for them in about two weeks, at which time we shall, on advice, send the men up.\n\nWe must however draw your attention to the fact that we are of the opinion that the existing stoker is not nearly big enough to take care of the new Boiler and if it is to be retained and put into use an extension of at least 36\" and a longer worm will be required to even have the stoker operative.\n\nEarly consideration will have to be given to this matter as the stoker in its present state will not operate to any advantage.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBLAIN BOILER WORKS LTD.,\n\nManaging Director\n\nH.J.Y.G\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter from the Blain Boiler Works Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., who are installing the new boiler at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, advising that the existing stoker is not of sufficient capacity to take care of the new boiler and in its present state will not operate to any advantage. A letter from Rev. Father O'Grady regarding the matter, together with a quotation from H. Giddens and Sons, Kamloops, B.C., on a new stoker are also enclosed.\n\nThis matter was discussed with the Principal at the school on the 20th instant and it was felt that the Department should be advised immediately of the situation so that a decision could be made regarding replacement of the existing stoker and action taken, if possible, before the close of the current fiscal year. Rev. Father O'Grady expects to be in Ottawa within the next few days and will no doubt call on the Department regarding this and other matters relating to the school.\n\nIt will be observed that H. Giddens and Sons, although estimating the value of the present stoker at between $500 and $400 do not make a definite offer to accept this unit as a trade-in on the new stoker but suggest that it be left at the school and they will endeavour to dispose of it for us. I am unable to recommend approval of such an arrangement. The firm supplying the new stoker should be prepared to allow a fair price for the old stoker on a trade-in basis.\n\nThe feeding and burning capacity of the unit quoted on by Giddens and Sons is slightly less than that recommended by Mr. Arnall, S.P.P. Engineer, Department of Public Works, but it is considered to be sufficient for our purposes. A\ncopy of the specification for a new stoker, forwarded by Mr. C. F. Dawson, District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, on February 8th, 1946, is enclosed for your information.\n\nI appreciate the Department's difficulty in dealing with a matter involving a fairly large expenditure so close to the end of the current fiscal year but it is being placed before you in case funds are available from which you would wish immediate purchase made.\n\nD.

We assume this figure is for immediate sale, whereas in your letter of the 20th March 1947, addressed to Rev. Father O'Grady, Kamloops Indian School, you stated that the old stoker would sell between $300. and $400. You also suggested that the old stoker be left at the school until you could find a suitable job on which to use it, at which time you would dispose of it and allow the school the credit.\n\nIn view of the difference in the trade-in allowance offered, and since it would be satisfactory to this Department to have you take over the old stoker as soon as the new stoker is supplied and installed, it would be appreciated if you could see your way clear to allowing a trade-in allowance more in accordance with your original offer to Father O'Grady.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nMessrs.

The amount, if I am correct, is $1897.37. As we have been low in funds for some time I would appreciate having the Returns at your earliest convenience.\n\nI wish to thank the Department for the extra $16.00 per pupil in the Emergency Relief Fund which Father Plourde advised we will be receiving. I trust it will apply as from January 1st. last. It will help to ease the current deficit we are now carrying.\n\nMajor MacKay advises that we may employ our Manual Training Instructor at current wages during the summer months for the construction of Indian houses six of which we have now begun. I feel that we can be of great assistance to the Department in a housing program and I hope that a large amount will be put in the estimates this year for the construction of new homes so badly needed in this area.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

Gidden's Sons of Kamloops, B.C. With regard to the first, however, payment should be withheld until the Blain Boiler Works Ltd. of Vancouver B.C. satisfactorily complete the installation. Apparently this firm sub-let the contract and we had to go the expense of approximately $200.00 to remove the old boiler, take out a wall, reset and extend the new floor and build a new cement wall. The installation took so long we were kept nine weeks of the School year without laundry facilities. The people who installed the boiler used from 800 to 1000 of our old common brick instead of obtaining new fire brick. Furthermore they did not cement the bricks of the fire box. They will have to be removed and put in properly.\n\nI would advise that until the above and other adjustments are made that payment be withheld on the installation of the boiler.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

In quoting on our requirements, however, the Company invariably specified that desks would be invoiced at the prices prevailing at time of shipment and, under the circumstances, and particularly as other local sources of supply have increased their prices proportionately, there will appear to be no option but to advise the Company that they may fill our orders at the new prices.\n\nI should appreciate receiving the Department's instructions by airmail.\n\nD.

November 26th, 1947\n\nMr. S.K. Bruce,\nIndian Agent\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Bruce:\n\nSince the construction of the School little or no attention has been given to the floors which are now wearing badly and soon will need repair. Including the Auditorium there is approximately 30,000 sq. ft. of floor space to be gone over with a sanding machine and the whole surface treated with a penetrating varnish. The cost, I am told, for contract sanding is in the neighborhood of 12 cents per square foot which would make the work prohibitive. I approached the Tremco Western Co. in Vancouver, who do a lot of work for the Department, and asked them to quote on the price of a sanding machine and edger and the paper required. I also asked them to give us a price on paints and varnishes.\n\nBesides the sanding of the floors there is also an urgent need for the painting of the walls and ceilings of the dormitories, which have not been painted since the School was built. If the Department will supply the Sanding Machines and the paint I will have the work done free of cost. We will therefore need the following:\n\n| Item Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| 1 only Porter-Cable Model No. r/s Sanding Machine      |          | $442.00    |            |\n| 1 only Portable Disc Edger 6\"                           |          | 167.00     |            |\n| No. 1\u00bd x 8\" 50 yard roll sanding paper                 |          | 15.41      |            |\n| No. 3 (Coarse) x 8\"                                     |          | 20.93      |            |\n| 50 gals.

I would also recommend the purchase of material necessary to carry out this improvement be granted.\n\nEnclosed please find requisition and quotation from Tremco Western Ltd., Vancouver, B.C. on the above equipment and paint.\n\nS.K. Bruce,\nIndian Agent,\n\n[C]\nEncl.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Bruce's letter of November 28th and enclosures referred to therein in connection with a proposed expenditure of $1117.84 for the purchase of floor sanding machine, paint etc. for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is no doubt that the work outlined by the Reverend principal is necessary nor is there any doubt but what the supply of the equipment requested would be much more economical than having the work done under contract. It is thought however that the Department has already spent more on the Kamloops school than was provided for in the appropriation this year and the question now of the purchase of the equipment and material requested may have to be left in abeyance until next year.\n\nI would appreciate being advised however if funds could be made available as it would be advisable if possible to have the work done during the winter months.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, December 6, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department regrets that owing to lack of funds, it is not possible at the present time to consider the additional expenditure of $1,117.84 requested by the principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, December 15, 1947.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nInspector's Report - Kamloops Residential School\n\nInspector Davey's report upon his recent visit to the above school has been received and carefully noted.\n\nWe have included in our 1948-49 estimates a sum for the construction of a four-classroom block at this residential school. While our estimates have not yet been finalized, it is to be hoped that this item can be left in for action next year. While the educational recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee have not yet been made, it is evident that they favour the sending of Indian high school students to provincial schools. This policy is already in effect in many residential schools across Canada. As Inspector Davey points out, there are five schools in British Columbia now sending high school pupils to nearby provincial high schools.\n\nWhen Father O'Grady visited here last summer, he informed the Department that the Kamloops High School was already overcrowded and that there was little possibility of having Indian children admitted. It is suggested, therefore, that the Kamloops School Board be approached and some agreement reached as to the possibility of having these children attend the local high school for their senior work.\n\nBernard F.

The root cellar, formerly used, collapsed from rotting of timbers underneath the ground and we had no place to store vegetables. We likewise had no place in which to store all the machinery used at the school; hence the necessity of the machine shed. A grain storage building was also a necessity because of the fact that we now have to purchase grain, when available, in fairly large quantities.\n\nAttached herewith is a list of the materials and the amounts expended. The buildings are all of new construction and it would be greatly appreciated if the Department could re-imburse the School for the expense incurred in the erection of these buildings which were necessary.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nFebruary 13, 1948.\n\nDear Father O'Grady:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the root cellar, machine shed and grain storage building which you constructed during the past summer.\n\nAt the present time I regret that it is not possible to favourably consider paying the amount requested as our funds are so limited. However, we will review our appropriation about March 15th with a view to determining what amount, if any, we can allow.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev.

Due to the necessity of making structural changes to the boiler room there was considerable delay in having the work proceeded with and on completion it was found that the installation was not satisfactory to either the Principal or the Indian Agent.\n\nI might mention that the installation work was sub-contracted to a local firm who used a quantity of second hand fire brick and ordinary brick which was not, of course, acceptable. Following considerable negotiation with the Blain Boiler Works and changes to the installation the work has now been completed to the satisfaction of the Reverend Principal and the Agent, reference Mr. Bruce's letter of March 5th attached, in view of which I would recommend payment of Kamloops Agency voucher No. 227 enclosed.\n\nI would also recommend payment of Kamloops Agency voucher No. 190 in the amount of $442.07 in favour of Blain Boiler Works covering the supply of shaker grates, Injector etc. for the new boiler.\n\nW.S.

Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn a letter dated October 22nd, 1947, Reverend Father O'Grady, principal of the Kamloops Residential School requested authority to expend an amount of slightly over $1,500.00 for material and labour in erecting a machine shop. At that time he was advised that owing to heavy commitments upon our appropriation it was not possible to give favourable consideration to his request.\n\nThis morning we received a telegram from him urging us to give approval of the expenditure required for the machine shop.\n\nFor your personal information the following amounts have been provided in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49 for Kamloops Residential School:\n\nSteam Press for Laundry and New Toilets - - - - $1,700.\nRepairs to Roof - - - $ 900.\nLevelling Playgrounds - - $2,400.\n\n$4,000.\n\nThe amount of $4,000.00 mentioned above is apportionately larger than the amount provided at any other Indian Residential School in Canada during the current fiscal year and it should be kept in mind.\nby all parties concerned that the amount of $4,000.00 for repairs and improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Kamloops School during the fiscal year 1948-49 cannot be exceeded.\n\nThese figures are not being supplied to Father O'Grady at the present time and should be treated confidentially as far as you are concerned.\n\nWe realize that the Kamloops School is being well operated under Father O'Grady but at the same time we believe that the whole situation at Kamloops should be very carefully reviewed with a view to determining if additional new buildings are absolutely essential or if the accommodation in the present buildings could be rearranged to provide for the services that are necessary.\n\nIn a large measure the success of an Indian Residential School depends upon the qualities of the principal. We do not question Father O'Grady's ability but we wonder if in the event of his being transferred to some other field of activity, another principal would be able to properly handle the very extensive set-up that now exists at Kamloops and which should provide all the facilities that can reasonably be expected.\n\nWe would like you to give this matter your very serious consideration and let us have your views before we decide in exactly what manner the amount provided in the current year's appropriation should be expended.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nKamloops Indian Residential School\n\nJuly 28 (416) Iron Freeman Stoves $1267.00\nSept 20 (510) Softballs $57.24\nSept 9 (512) Balls etc. $66.50\nDec 22 (615) Fire Hose $667.50\nJan 9 (5) Freight on Fire Hose $4.82\nDec 29 (77) Sheds $360.24\nJan 16 (92) Courses of Study $12.00\nFeb 18 (117) Freight on Sheds $10.27\nFeb 28 (118) Heating Installations $2072.00\nMar 31 (221) Boilers $840.00\nMar 23 (222) Steel Working Machine $450.40\nMar 31 (226) Sanding Paper $84.32\nMar 23 (221) Timco 2 Corn Seal $386.25\n$506.25 $5772.29\n\nPaint $399\nFurnace grate etc. $1847\nLabour re wood cellar $2738\n$8510\n\nApprox $5500\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Principal, the Rev. Father O'Grady of Kamloops Indian Residential School, he intimated that the end of the fiscal year 1947-48 left his school financially with a debit balance of approximately $10,000 which he states can be attributed largely to the purchase of a bulldozer and the erection of three permanent buildings - root cellar, machine shed and grain storage building. These buildings were referred to in my report on this school dated March 10th, 1948.\n\nAttached you will find a statement in triplicate covering the cost of lumber, nails and paint used in the erection of these buildings, which amount to $2,947.81. I might point out that the Department contributed to the extent of $826.50 to the cost of materials for the construction of the grain storage shed but it is not clear whether the materials purchased by the Department are included in the list submitted by the Reverend Principal. The low cost of lumber is due to its being produced in the school sawmill.\n\nThe Principal feels that some consideration might be given by the Department to help defray the cost of materials used in these permanent buildings as they were essential to the operation of the school and will remain satisfactory for many years to come, and thus help reduce the large debit bank balance. At his request I am forwarding these statements for your consideration and whatever action you may deem necessary.\n\nW.S.

Should there again be any last minute alteration, we will wire you accordingly.\n\nThanking you, and assuring you of our desire to be of service,\n\nYours truly,\n\nFRED M BEATTY (TREMCO WESTERN) LTD.,\n\nM.Perl.\n\nMP/L/OK\n\nBETTER BUILDING MAINTENANCE\nKamloops Indian Residential School\n\nFOUNDED IN 1889\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nKamloops, B.C., April 17th, 1948.\n\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nI sent a telegram to Mr. Bernard F. Neary, Superintendent of Education in the Indian Affairs Branch asking him if the proposed class room block recommended for this School had been approved and if we could proceed with its construction in case it had been approved. He replied not to proceed with the construction until we had received instructions from yourself.\n\nI understand that the appropriation set aside by the Department for the construction of the class room block is $40,000. While I was in Ottawa Mr. Neary gave me detailed plans of the building together with a list of materials. I have studied the plans and feel that we can construct the building fulfilling all the requirements. We would undertake the work on a contract basis for the above mentioned amount.\n\nI should like to begin work on the class room block as soon as possible in order to have the much needed class room space available in the early fall. Your expediting the matter with the Department would be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of April 15th advising that an amount of $40,000 is included in the 1948-49 Education Vote for the construction of a four classroom block at the Kamloops Residential School, I am enclosing a letter dated April 17th from the Rev. Principal wherein he advises that after studying the plans he is of the opinion that the school can construct the building in accordance with all the requirements and is prepared to undertake the work on a contract basis for the amount mentioned.\n\nWhile this might be a desirable solution to the problem of contracting the work, it is understood that it is necessary to advertise for any construction work costing in excess of $5000. I should appreciate being advised if the Department has given consideration to the construction of this classroom block under supervision of the Lands and Development Services Branch, if it is proposed to call for tenders on the construction, or if favourable consideration could be given to Father O'Grady's offer.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nMay 6, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nClassroom Block - Kamloops Residential School\n\nReference your 4-11-3 (154) of April 23rd.\n\nI have had an opportunity of discussing your letter and also Father O'Grady's tender with officials of the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nBefore any definite consideration can be given to Father O'Grady's tender, it will be necessary to have details as to the qualifications and experience of the foreman carpenter whom Father O'Grady intends to have supervise this building. Under separate cover I am mailing to you newly prepared electrical and heating specifications for this building. They are different, naturally, to those used at Eskasoni Day School.\n\nThe Lands and Development Services Branch are willing to undertake the construction of this classroom block but are so swamped with work at the present time that it is difficult to know when they will be able to undertake this project. At the present time we are open to any recommendation which you have to make in view of your knowledge of local conditions. We feel that the primary factor is how we can best erect this classroom block in time to have it in use next September or thereafter.\n\nIt should also be understood by all parties concerned that when your reply is received, we intend to submit the matter to the Minister's office and it is quite possible that they may require us to advertise so as to secure tenders if possible.\n\nBernard F.

He built the large gymnasium in the University of British Columbia, the Mount Pleasant Undertaking Parlors, the Norwood Apartments and numerous other buildings in the city of Vancouver.

Mr. Robert Swan is a brother of the Mr. Swan who constructed the barn at the Kamloops Residential School and I am given to understand that in the event the contract for construction of the classroom block is awarded to the School both brothers will work on the project.

O'Grady, C.M.I., Principal of this School, has already done considerable building at this school in erecting a manual training shop, farm instructor's cottage, etc. He has a fairly good-sized mill and has cut lumber for houses which he and his staff have erected for aged Indians. Payment for the construction of these houses has been out of Welfare Vote. He has now submitted a tender of $40,000.00 for the erection of this four room school block.\n\nWhen Father O'Grady was asked concerning the qualifications and experience of his foreman - carpenter, he advised as follows:\n\n\"The foreman-carpenter in question is Mr. Robert Swan of 2709 Napier St., Vancouver, B.C. Mr. Swan served his apprenticeship as a construction carpenter in Edinburgh, Scotland. He has great facility in reading plans and blue prints. He has had 40 years' experience in building construction.

You might let me know later at what rate you think we should pay him for this particular service. In preparing the bill of materials, we would like Mr. Swan to advise us as follows:\n\n(1) The quantity of cement and reinforcing rods that will be needed - this information should be obtained at the earliest possible date and forwarded to us so that we can have the order placed and the cement delivered.\n\n(2) A list of the other materials required can be forwarded later as soon as Mr. Swan has\nthe required information ready. In preparing this information he should ascertain the quantities of rough and prepared lumber that Father O'Grady is able to supply from his mill. On this requisition, of course, he should show the quantities of lumber needed and the price per thousand feet.\n\nBernard F.

Glenn,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHon. and Dear Mr. Glenn:\n\nAlthough I have never met you, I feel I know you from reading about you so I am taking the liberty of writing this personal and confidential letter regarding the \"The Four Room School\" that is going to be built at the Indian School at Kamloops. I understand that the present Principal, Rev. F. O'Grady, O.M.I., when in Ottawa last Feb., was told to get everything ready for the erection of this building as soon as he returned home.\n\nI also understand that he did so, that is he went to work and cut the timber and the special rafters etc. and arranged with a contractor to put up the building. The rafters are special because of their length.\n\nHow when I was over at Kamloops a few days ago, I happened to meet Father O'Grady in a store and when I asked him how things were at the school, he replied not very good and this led to a few more questions and finally, he related the whole story about the new building and what he had done and then said he recently had a letter telling him that the construction of this building would likely be let by calling tenders, that the Department, that is your Department, felt it should be constructed by others not connected with the Church. I then suggested that he should write you direct and that he would obtain more satisfactory information from you than from anyone else. He said he did not feel like doing that and I then said I would. Hence this letter.\n\nFirst of all let me say, I take a great interest in this school, it is the largest Indian School in Canada, I think,\nbut of course you would know about this, but I feel it is one of the best administered institutions in Canada and the present Principal is easily the most capable Principal the school has ever had. He has made many improvements there and has also constructed quite a number of buildings that has not cost the Government a cent, such as an Auditorium, 115 x 70. A technical school 100 x 24 both these buildings are a credit to the School and could not be built today for less than forty thousand.\n\nNow he has arranged with Mr. Robert Swan a well known and reliable contractor to erect this new building and I understand that this man will have his brother, the man who built the big dairy barn at the school working with him. Let me add that Mr. Robert Swan is an experienced contractor and has built many buildings in B.C. For example the Gymnasium at the University and has been employed by the Dept. of Education as a Building Construction Instructor. He has also constructed many other large buildings, but the point I want to stress is that he is not only a capable contractor but a reliable one as well.\n\nI am sure that if this were not so, your new Commissioner, Mr. W. S. Arnell would not recommend him or the arrangement and I am also sure his predecessor Major J. M. MacKay would also make the same recommendations.\n\nNow Mr. Glenn, knowing this and knowing the conditions that exist, political as well as economic and I think I know for I have been here for thirty eight years and have been a member of the B.C. Legislature for the last twenty years, I strongly recommend that the present Principal, namely Father O'Grady, be instructed to go ahead with the arrangements he has already started and erect this new school, and I am certain if this is done there will be no regrets.\n\nIn making this recommendation to you, I assure you I do so from no selfish reason or motive but solely and only in the best interest of all parties concerned and this Sir includes Your Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) J.

The re-roofing of the poultry house is essential. The $200 set aside for repairs to toilets is not sufficient but the remaining funds required can be handled by the school itself. The erection of a machine shop for the instruction of the senior pupils in my judgment is warranted and while to complete same will cost more than $1500, the school is willing to assume responsibility for any additional amount. It is necessary to complete the implement and grain storage shed.\n\nIn the event of my assumption as to the sum set aside for repairs and improvements to this school being in error I would recommend that the $1000 be deducted from the $2400 for levelling the playgrounds.\n\nI should appreciate advice regarding this matter as soon as conveniently possible.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nI have delayed acknowledging your letter of April 22nd relative to necessary repairs and improvements to Kamloops Residential School contemplated from our appropriation for the current fiscal year pending a further interview with the Principal, the Rev. Father O'Grady. I concur in your comments regarding the operation of a residential school of this size and activity and fully realize that its continued successful operation is entirely dependent on the Principal in charge and I have these facts in mind in making the following recommendations.\n\nThe detailed appropriation provided for this school in the Estimates as intimated in your letter totals $5000 but this amount is reduced by $1000 in your subsequent comments. If I may assume that the detailed $5000 has been authorized, and I sincerely trust it has, having in mind the reasonable maintenance of our security and the efficient operation of the school I would recommend that it be expended as follows:\n\n(1) Levelling playgrounds - - - - - - - - - - - - $2,400\n(2) Repairs to roof of poultry house - - - - - - - 400\n(3) Repairs to school toilets - - - - - - - - - - - 200\n(4) Erection of a machine shop - - - - - - - - - - 1,500\n(5) Completion of implement and grain storage shed - - - - - - - 500\nThis recommendation differs somewhat from the detailed list in your letter by reason of the fact that Father O'Grady has recently received a gift of a steam press for the school laundry and the roof repairs other than to the poultry house are not of sufficient urgency to demand their being repaired this year.\n\nCommenting on this recommendation it might be said that the playgrounds are urgently in need of levelling and particularly so this year with the contemplated construction of a four-room school block. The re-roofing of the poultry house is essential. The $200 set aside for repairs to toilets is not sufficient but the remaining funds required can be handled by the school itself. The erection of a machine shop for the instruction of the senior pupils in my judgment is warranted and while to complete same will cost more than $1500, the school is willing to assume responsibility for any additional amount. It is necessary to complete the implement and grain storage shed.\n\nIn the event of my assumption as to the sum set aside for repairs and improvements to this school being in error I would recommend that the $1000 be deducted from the $2400 for levelling the playgrounds.\n\nI should appreciate advice regarding this matter as soon as conveniently possible.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 18, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to the amounts provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, the following amounts are available:\n\n(1) Levelling playgrounds - $2,400.00. It is presumed that the official labour return forms will be prepared and submitted to us.\n\n(2) Repairs to roof of poultry house - $400.00. It is understood that the amount mentioned covers the cost of both material and labour and, of course, the materials should be purchased by you and a copy of your purchase order attached to the voucher.\n\n(3) Repairs to school toilets - $200.00. In this case also it is presumed that the amount mentioned covers material and labour and if the material costs over $100.00 you should arrange for the purchase and attach copy of your purchase order to the voucher.\n\n(4) Completion of implement and grain storage shed - $500.00. What has been said regarding items (2) and (3) applies also in this instance.\n\nWe have given very careful thought to the request for $1,500.00 for the erection of a machine shop and we are not wholly satisfied that the erection of this building at the present time is fully justified.\nWe feel that a complete machine shop is not absolutely essential, as the pupils attending the Kamloops School are too young to profit by it. Mr. Doucet feels that there is sufficient space below the present manual training building for the amount of machine shop work that is required for pupils of the age of those attending the Kamloops School. However, there should be no welding done in this particular building because of the fire hazard. Any welding necessary could be done at the forge but we realize that few pupils are capable of doing this work.\n\nWith the above thoughts in mind we are not prepared at the present time to authorize the amount required for the machine shop.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThis copy to be returned to Indian Affairs Branch when letter is signed.\n\nOttawa, June 10th, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Gillis:\n\nIn the absence of the Minister I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 29th with reference to the class room block it is intended to erect at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIt has been decided to erect this building by day labour, employing Mr. Robert Swan as foreman-carpenter. The Departmental Purchasing Agent will purchase the materials. Any rough or prepared lumber that can be secured from the mill operated by Father O'Grady will be used.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. C. Bethune,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. J.J. Gillis, C.M., M.L.A.,\nMerritt, B.C.\n\nPP/MGD\nDr. J. J. Gillis, C.M., M.L.A.,\nMerritt, B.C.\n\nLEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY\nProvince of\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nJune 18th 1948.\n\nW. G. Bethune, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary\nTo the Minister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Bethune:\n\nI received your letter in answer to mine to the Minister yesterday and want to thank you for your reply, however, although no fault of yours, I am far from satisfied with the information received and would like to have a direct reply to my letter from the Minister as soon as he returns to the office and finds it convenient to do so.\n\nI saw in some of the daily newspapers that Honourable Mr. Glenn had retired on account of bad health. I was very sorry to hear that and I hope a well earned rest will bring him back to his usual good health.\n\nIn case Mr. Glenn does not return to the Office, I would be very grateful to you if you would hand my letter to the new Minister. I have not seen many of the newspapers of late due to the floods and did not hear of anyone appointed in his place.\n\nI was pleased to hear that the new school block was going to be constructed, but I am not at all satisfied at the set up. Your letter states that it is to be built by day labour, employing Mr. Robert Swan as foreman-carpenter, all very well. Then you state that the Departmental Purchasing Agent will purchase the materials.\n\nThis means of course that the Department has a list of what I shall call \"approved dealers\" and that this purchasing agent whoever he is will have to deal and buy through them.\nI say this because it is the usual way the department has acted for some time and it is anything but an economic or satisfactory way. Personally although a strong Liberal in politics, I am very much opposed to such a method of buying and acting.\n\nIn the present case, the foreman would have to hire his help in much the same way, he would have to consult some local person before he hired anyone and would not be free to hire or discharge as he sees fit and as he should. That is the way it works. If he needed anything, any special material, he would have to wait until the Purchasing Agent secured same from one of the boys and in the meantime the work would of course slow down. Many other things enter into this system that I need not mention.\n\nAs far as buying rough or prepared lumber from the mill at the school operated by the Principal, Father O'Grady, I am not a bit worried because he can sell his lumber, rough and prepared at ease, but I am worried at the latest change as stated in your letter.\n\nWhy in the name of common sense, yes and in the name of all that is fair and economical should not this building be constructed as originally planned.\n\nThe forty thousand dollars has been appropriated, that means the department feels it will cost that much and Father O'Grady, the principal of the school is prepared to construct this block for that amount. He may lose or gain a little, personally knowing him as I do, I believe he will have a little left over but I am not sure of that, but admit he has, it will not be used for him, or anyone else, but the school. That is if he has any left over it will be used for needed improvements at the school. If there is any doubt about that, then let us forget about the whole thing.\n\nI tried to speak to Father O'Grady this morning on the long distance telephone but could not locate him. I was going to ask him what he intended doing, but if he wanted my advice about it, I would advise him to have nothing whatever to do with this block unless\nthe contract was given to him and allow him to hire anyone he liked and fire anyone who did not give satisfaction and to buy wherever he felt he could get the best and quickest action.\n\nI do know that he accepted the word of those in authority in the department at Ottawa when he was told to return to B.C. and make preparations to construct this block. He intended starting building on the first of May so that he would have the use of this block for the first of Sept., and he even made arrangement about engaging four extra teachers but of course the building will not be ready by then under the proposed setup. I am very sorry to make this letter so long but I wanted the department to know that in taking up this matter, I am only trying to protect them from any future criticism which I am sure will occur if the construction of this building follows the latest method as you suggest in your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. J. Gillis, M.D.\nW. C. Bethune, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Bethune:\n\nYou were kind enough to write me re the classroom block to be erected at the Residential Indian School at Kamloops, B.C., and not knowing whether a new Minister has been appointed, I am going to write you further re this matter, knowing that you will see that my letters are placed before the Minister.\n\nSince writing you a few days ago, I was able to contact Father O'Grady, Principal of the School and he informs me that he has just received a letter from the Indian Commissioner in Vancouver who stated that he received further communication from the Department advising that the Minister's office has approved the erection of the classroom, on a day labour basis, the department engaging Mr. Swan as Foreman - Carpenter and the necessary material for his use being purchased by the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nThis is very much as you stated and as I understood but much worse. Now let me understand this correctly and if I am wrong I want to be informed so.\n\nFather O'Grady was asked to put in a tender for the erection of this block. He did so. He was then asked by the Department to state the qualifications and experience of the Foreman-carpenter that he had selected to do the work. Father O'Grady replied by stating he had selected Mr. Robert Swan and outlined his qualifications and experience. The Department instead of writing Father O'Grady further and instead of accepting his tender as I most\nemphatically think they should have done after all the improve-\nments he has made at the school and which the department knows\nabout and mark you without costing the department one copper,\ndecided simply to go right over his head and deal directly\nwith his Foreman - carpenter, and dont forget that this man had\nbeen engaged by Father O'Grady three months before this and\narranged with him what his wages would be.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that this way of\ndoing business was unethical, unfair and discriminatory to Father\nO'Grady, to say nothing about being most discouraging to him who\nhas done so much for this school\n\nAs far as the Public is concerned, well I would\nrather not say anything at present for I find it hard to think\nthat any responsible Minister would recommend such.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

Gillis, M.D., M.L.A., Merritt, B.C., to Mr. Bethune - you file 154-0-5 (E.1).\n\nThe Minister has written to Dr. Gillis by letter of even date indicating that he will discuss the points at issue with the Director. Please have a letter prepared for the Minister's signature to Dr. Gillis further to the above-mentioned one, and at the same time, furnish a full report on this matter for the Minister's consideration, so that he may have the picture before him when he signs your draft letter.\n\nA.C.L. Adams\nPrivate Secretary\n\nMr. Hoey:\nFor draft reply as requested.\nOttawa, June 29, 1948.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nPlease find attached two letters which have been recently received from Dr. J. J. Gillis, M.L.A., concerning the building of the classroom block at the Kamloops Residential School. Also attached is a letter of May 29 from Dr. Gillis. I have also attached letters sent by the Department to Dr. Gillis in answer to his correspondence and a copy of a personal letter which I have just written to Father O'Grady.\n\nYou have shown in your letter of April 23 that you realize the difficulties of awarding tenders in excess of $5,000.00. Therefore I would ask that you contact Father O'Grady and attempt to correct the misunderstanding which seems to have arisen.\n\nWhile Father O'Grady was given partial specifications for the classroom block, officials of the Department did not commit themselves to awarding him a contract. In fact, they could not so commit themselves. It is regretted that this misunderstanding has occurred and it is hoped that you can straighten the matter out to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nDirector:\nOttawa, June 30, 1948.\n\nDear Father O'Grady:\n\nI sincerely regret the misunderstanding which has arisen with regard to the construction of the classroom block at the Kamloops Residential School.\n\nDuring the past year it has become increasingly difficult to get authority for the granting of contracts which do not conform with the Public Works Act.\n\nAs you probably know, this Act requires that all contracts in excess of $5,000.00 be advertised for and the contract awarded on the basis of the tenders thus received. This is a very slow process and during the war, it was possible because of the emergency, to award contracts directly. As I pointed out previously, this procedure has become increasingly difficult and in fact almost impossible.\n\nTherefore, in view of the need for your classroom block being completed as soon as possible, it would be preferable to build it on a day labour basis. We have received the details of Mr. Swan's qualifications and are quite prepared to pay him on a day labour basis. We are also prepared to purchase from your mill as much of the rough lumber as possible and also the beams which you have cut.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend F. O'Grady, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, British Columbia.\n\nBFH/EM\nOttawa, June 30, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nKamloops Residential School Classroom Block.\n\nPlease find attached a draft letter for the Minister's signature to Dr. Gillis, M.D., M.L.A., of Merritt, B.C.\n\nThis letter is largely self-explanatory. I also attach a personal letter which I have written to Father O'Grady and one to our Indian Commissioner for British Columbia. It is regretted that Father O'Grady is under the misapprehension that the contract for the erection of this classroom block was to be awarded to him. There have been no verbal or written commitments to this effect and we fail to see how he can have gained this impression.\n\nIn fact, in Mr. Indian Commissioner Arneil's letter of April 23 he states as follows:\n\n\"While this might be a desirable solution to the problem of contracting the work, it is understood that it is necessary to advertise for any construction work costing in excess of $5000. I should appreciate being advised if the Department has given consideration to the construction of this classroom block under supervision of the Lands and Development Services Branch, if it is proposed to call for tenders on the construction, or if favourable consideration could be given to Father O'Grady's offer.\"\n\nPlease ....\nPlease find attached memorandum which was sent to you on June 4th. You will recall that at that time you returned the memorandum with the following comment opposite Method \"c):\n\n\"This seems to be most in line with our understanding with Treasury Board\".\n\nIt is naturally very difficult to draw to Dr. Gillis' attention our policy of erecting these school buildings by the use of day labour and the purchase of materials through our Purchasing Agent. However, the attached letter is an attempt to give him as complete a picture as possible of this situation.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 29, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Gillis:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your two letters of June 16 and June 21 with regard to the construction of a new classroom block at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen Father O'Grady visited the Department last summer, the matter of a new classroom block at his school was discussed with him. In order that he might be aware of the type of building proposed, he was provided with a set of blueprints of the building. A meeting was also arranged with the engineers of our Lands and Development Services Branch so that they could get as much information as possible from him with regard to the electrical and heating specifications required for the new building.\n\nDuring the winter these specifications were prepared and were recently mailed to our Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nOn April 8, 1948, the following telegram was received from Father O'Grady:\n\n\"Would appreciate being advised if classroom block for Kamloops Indian School is approved and if we may proceed with its construction.\"\n\nHe was sent the following telegram in answer:\n\n\"Do not proceed with erection of classroom block until you receive specific instructions from Indian Commissioner Armill.\"\nOn April 17, the Reverend Father O'Grady submitted a tender for $40,000.00 for the construction of this building to our Indian Commissioner for British Columbia. At that time the electrical and heating specifications had not been finished. Therefore Father O'Grady did not have the complete drawings, specifications and other information upon which to properly base his tender.\n\nOur Indian Commissioner for British Columbia was of course aware of the Public Works Act which requires that all construction work in excess of $5,000.00 be advertised for and tenders received in the usual manner. He was also advised that the matter would have to be discussed with officials of the Lands and Development Services Branch before a decision could be reached.\n\nIt was realized that if tenders were called for, there would very likely be some considerable delay before the actual construction work was started. These tenders could not be called for until the electrical and plumbing specifications referred to above, were ready. These drawings and specifications were only finished recently and were mailed to our Indian Commissioner for British Columbia on June 11.\n\nTherefore, in deciding to hire Mr. Swan and to erect the building on a day labour basis, the department was attempting to expedite the building of the classroom block by hiring a man whom Reverend Father O'Grady had recommended so highly. In fact, we had hoped to complete the building in time for school opening in September. We instructed Indian Commissioner Arnell that we desired to purchase from Father O'Grady the timbers and other forms which he had prepared.\n\nWe have sent letters by airmail to both Reverend Father O'Grady and to our Indian Commissioner for B.C., as it is understood that they have had several discussions concerning the erection of this classroom block. I will write you again as soon as I hear from them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. J.

It is understood that the necessary materials will be purchased by the Department.\n\nThe Principal, Reverend Father O'Grady, has been in Ottawa for the past ten days and we have carefully discussed the whole situation with him on different occasions.\n\nThe following decisions have been reached,\n\n(1) The erection of the building will proceed along the general lines outlined in my letter of June 8th.\n\n(2) The Department is today ordering a car load of cement which we hope will be delivered to the school within a reasonable time.\n\n(3) Father O'Grady expects to be in Vancouver about August 1st at which time he will further consult Mr. Swan regarding the bill of materials and also interview you.\n\n(4) It should be understood that any lumber that Father O'Grady has available from his mill should be purchased, provided it meets the requirements. Of course it will be necessary for you to forward the bill of materials including this lumber so that we can obtain formal approval from the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n(5) It should also be understood that any preliminary work that has been done by Father O'Grady, such as preparing the site, will be paid.\n\n(6) Father O'Grady states that the school staff is able to handle the transportation of any materials from the station to the School, using for this purpose equipment owned by the school management. Payment for this service should be made at a reasonable rate.\n\nAn accountable advance will be forwarded later to Superintendent Bruce in order that he will have funds on hand when construction starts to pay wages weekly to those employed.\n\nFollowing your interview with Father O'Grady on the date mentioned above, we would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nBernard W.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nPP/MGD\nFurther to my letter of September 7th, we have not made as much progress in connection with the above-mentioned building as we had hoped, due partly to delay in securing sufficient details with regard to material requirements, but even so, the delays experienced so far will not likely have any effect on the progress made in the actual erection of the building for the reason that the earliest delivery possible on the required steel beams is six weeks.\n\nA quotation from Dominion Bridge Co. Ltd. on the steel required at a cost of $1380.00 f.o.b. Vancouver, is enclosed and I would ask that the order be placed with them at the earliest possible date as delivery is quoted as six weeks from receipt of the Order. I may say I have discussed this matter with Father O'Grady recently and he is not greatly concerned with the delay in the delivery of the steel for the reason that this will only temporarily halt the construction of the building, and the most important thing which is being proceeded with at the moment, is to have the cement completed before cold weather sets in.\n\nFor your information, I would advise:\n\n1. Plans and specifications were submitted to Sigurdson Millwork Co. Ltd., Vancouver, who have prepared a bill of material and tendered on supply of same. Their tender is not typed and in places it is almost illegible to a layman, consequently, I have asked them to submit another tender in duplicate which will be forwarded in a day or so to enable the Purchasing...\nAgent to place the order.\n\n2. Reinforcing wire and reinforcing rods were ordered from Evans, Coleman and Evans and have been delivered to the site.\n\n3. 14 kegs of nails were ordered from Gordon and Belyea Ltd. and part of this order has been delivered to the site. We have yet to order 5 more kegs of nails but as the nail factory in Vancouver is closed down, these are not immediately available.\n\n4. With my letter of September 7th, I enclosed lists of materials required, one of which listed the material to be shipped from Vancouver including lumber for ceiling joists and rafters, insulation, asbestos shingles, etc. We have called for tenders on the supply of this material but as there is some confliction between this list and the list quoted on by Sigurdson Millwork, some revision will be necessary before the tenders can be forwarded to you in proper form for submission to the Purchasing Agent.\n\n5. Superintendent Bruce was asked to submit specifications on the wiring, plumbing and heating to Kamloops contractors and I understand from Father O'Grady that we may expect to receive tenders on these installations within a few days.\n\n6. Father O'Grady has suggested, and I concur, that it would be desirable to finish the exterior walls of the building with Insul-brick Siding rather than asbestos shingles. Mr. Swan is preparing an estimate for the quantity of siding required and tenders will be called for on this item.\n\nIt will be apparent from the above that the matter of the construction of this classroom block is in hand and the most important thing at the moment is the placing of the order for the steel beams.\n\nW.

K. Bruce,\nAgency Superintendent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Bruce:\n\nRe: Heating Classroom Block\n\nThe Classroom Block, which is being constructed in connection with this School, calls for its own heating system being installed on the basement floor. This would be ideal were the building constructed as a unit apart from any other School but where it is attached to a Residential School it would be much more economical and practical to have the heating boiler installed in the boiler room of the main building where there is ample space and large storage facilities for coal. It would require, of course, a coal stoker.\n\nBesides decreased operating costs and added facilities for firing the distinct advantage of having the heating boiler installed in the main building is that space for two more classrooms would be gained on the basement floor of the classroom block. The basement floor would be divided into four rooms of exactly the same size as the four classrooms above and wooden beams with truss rods could then be used instead of the steel beams which may be more difficult to obtain now because of recent curtailments on the import of steel. Quite a considerable saving could be effected in using wooden instead of steel beams.\n\nI would appreciate your asking the Department for a decision in this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. O'Grady O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nKamloops, B.C. October 20, 1948.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Contracts for Lighting & Heating\nNew Four Roomed classroom block\nKamloops Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th ultimo regarding the above mentioned which I have gone into thoroughly with the Rev. Father O'Grady.\n\nI can see where there would be considerable saving of space in the new building by installing the heating boiler in the main building. The new building is located only 100 feet from the main building on the west side, the extra expense would seem to be approximately $2000.00 and by using the boiler room in the main building a considerable saving would be made in operation costs and also the necessity of using steel beams could be eliminated should the base of the new building be made into four separate rooms, wooden beams could be used with truss rods saving an expenditure of approximately $1000.00.\n\nContracts from Kamloops firms are enclosed.\n\nS.K. Bruce,\nSuperintendent\n\nEnclos\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Classroom Block-Kamloops Residential School\n\nYou will note from Superintendent Bruce's letter of October 20th and communication from Reverend Father O'Grady enclosed, that in their opinion the new classroom block could be more efficiently heated and at less capital cost by installing the necessary heating system in the present boiler room of the school block and by conveying hot water through a 2\u00bd inch main.\n\nApart from the other advantages of this proposal Father O'Grady suggests that this would leave the basement area of the new building cleared of obstructions and would enable it to be converted into four additional classrooms and would eliminate the necessity for steel beams.\n\nI feel that both these suggestions should be reviewed by the engineers who designed the building and that we should be guided by their recommendation.

If the supports were provided it would limit the usefulness of the rooms in which the supports were located.\n\nSteel beams should be used and I return the diagram which you forwarded with the necessary notations on it from our Engineers.\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 1, we had previously heard from Father O'Grady regarding the heating.

This has been brought to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch verbally, and they are to advise us as to the extent of the extra work involved, at which time it may be possible for us to offer intelligent comment.\n\nTenders with reference to the plumbing were received from Carr and Son and H. Giddens and Sons, both of Kamloops, B.C. Carr and Son quotation of $3,960.00 appears excessive for the work outlined on the plan and specification.\n\nGiddens and Sons' quotation of $1,035.00 is given \"as per plan\". They also quote an alternative figure of $1,635.00 based on piping the domestic hot and cold water from the boiler room of the Residential School to an arrangement not shown on the plan.\n\nIf the plumbing is to be installed in accordance with our plan and specification, it is suggested that the Indian Affairs Branch would be well advised to accept the tender of $1,035.00 submitted by Giddens and Sons, which seems to us to be fair and reasonable.\n\nNo mention is made in either tender of a septic tank. It is pointed out that our plan is an adaption of a standard arrangement and shows septic tank details for use in areas where a tank is necessary. The plan shows the main house drain and incoming water line capped just outside the building wall for extension by others. It is assumed that the Indian Affairs Branch will arrange to have these lines extended and connected to sources on the property outside the terms of the contract.\n\nThe following tenders on electrical work were received:\n\nH. Giddens and Sons, Kamloops, B.C. ............ $1,762.00\nC.L. Wain and Son, Kamloops, B.C. .............. $1,641.25\nFernie Bros., Kamloops, B.C. ................... $2,700.00\nPinn Electric Co., Kamloops, B.C. ............. $1,656.00\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nH. Giddens quoted, in addition to the above prices, for electrical work if certain proposed heating changes are made to the school making eight (8) full classrooms. We have no information concerning such a proposal, and we will comment only on the above prices which are based on our plans and specifications Index No. 863 for the above.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch decide on the proposals referred to, which would affect the number of classrooms, our plans would require revisions, and all firms quoting should be requested to retender on the electrical work. We would then be in a position to comment on the quotations submitted based on our revised plans.\n\nThe lowest tender received for doing the electrical work was submitted by C.L. Wain and Son in the amount of $1,641.25. This price, in our opinion, is reasonable, and it would appear satisfactory if the Indian Affairs Branch accept the tender of this firm.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith, for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch, tenders referred to this Division by Acting Director Major MacKay for comment.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncls.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nDecember 30, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to the tenders received for heating, plumbing and wiring the new classroom block at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, these have been referred to the Lands and Development Services and I enclose for your information a copy of their comments.\n\nA review of their reply indicates that the plans and specifications are not being strictly followed in connection with the construction of this building.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would confer with Father O'Grady at once and let us have your reply at the earliest possible date.\n\nBernard F.

Could you please advise whether he ever mentioned to you the building of a greenhouse.\n\nIt was not mentioned to me but in conversation with Mr. Phelan a passing remark was made. Both Mr. Phelan and I feel that no encouragement should be given to Father O'Grady to press such a project at the present time. We feel that he has ample buildings to care for and maintain at the present time without adding still another.\n\nWe have had considerable grief in the past with the operation of greenhouses at residential schools and they have not always been very successful. One exception is, of course, the St. George's Residential School at Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nI would like to discuss the matter of the buildings at the Kamloops Residential School with you when an opportunity presents itself.\n\nBernard F.

Tenders have been received from three firms and the total cost of the items requested is approximately $400.00. In view of this large amount and the Department's policy of not supplying hardball equipment it is recommended that the items 3 dozen baseball bats and 4 dozen baseballs be deleted. This would result in a reduction of approximately $145.00. It is also felt that the number of softball bats could be reduced to one dozen.\n\nThe total cost of the equipment after the above deletions will be approximately $235.00 and it is recommended that this amount be authorized.\n\nThe present enrolment at the above school is approximately 335.\n\nW.S.

In discussing these matters with the Department in Ottawa in January I was given to understand that the alterations would be approved. The firms who quoted on heating, lighting and wiring have sent new quotations, through the Indian Office, on the proposed alterations. These should be in your office in a day or two.\n\nAs soon as word is received on the alterations to the Classroom Block construction of the building can be resumed. Nearly all of the materials required have been delivered over the winter months.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. O'Grady C.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nKamloops, B.C. March 19, 1949\n\nW.S.

Install two 2 1/2\" circulating pumps with valves and by-passes. One pump would be operated at one time, the other pump would be a stand by pump in case of a break down. Increasing the boiler size by one section for domestic hot water supply and installing one indirect hot water heater, 400 gal. per hour. This hot water boiler would operate automatically summer and winter and supply hot water to the Residential school and to the new classrooms. We would cover the return mains with four ply asbestos covering, install mains in cedar box between new building and old building. We would install a 100 lb. Iron Fireman coal stoker fully automatic. We would also recommend that the chimney which is to be built in the new school be built in the corner of the old boiler house so that the new boiler would have a separate chimney. If these heating proposals are accepted there would be an extra cost on the heating plant of Four thousand, one hundred and forty-seven dollars ($4,147.00) making a total of the heating Ten thousand, nine hundred and fifty seven dollars ($10,957.00).\n\nWe would install plumbing as per plan for One thousand, thirty-five dollars ($1,035.00). If the proposed alterations are made to the boiler house we will pipe the hot and cold water from the old building to the new school building carrying our hot and cold water pipes in the same ditch as the steam mains.\nWe would also install a circulating pump in the old boiler house and supply constant hot water to the new building. This will increase the plumbing cost by Six hundred dollars ($600.00) making the total plumbing One thousand, six hundred and thirty-five dollars ($1,635.00).\n\nOur price for wiring the new school as per plans would be One thousand, seven hundred and sixty-two dollars ($1,762.00). If the proposed heating changes are made to the school making eight full classrooms. Our price would be with forty-eight fluorescent fixtures 4 tube, 50 watt complete with installation and fixtures for Three thousand, five hundred and fifty-one dollars ($3,551.00). We would also give an alternative figure on forty-eight 2 tube, 40 watt fluorescent fixtures for Two thousand, four hundred and forty dollars ($2,440.09.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian Residential School\nNew Four Roomed Classroom\n\nWe have figured the plan according to the blueprint, but suggest a more suitable arrangement for upkeep and cost of operation, which would be to install the new boiler in the present boiler room, and run about 350 ft. of 4\" black pipe to the new building underground.\n\nInstalling new boiler in present boiler room would cost approximately TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. ($2,000.00).\n\n18 x 30 x 8\" Vitreous China flat rim sink with integral overflow and drainboard is not available. We are figuring Canadian Potteries 28 x 16 x 8\" with integral waste and overflow.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCARR & SON\n\nPer [signature]\n\nFWC/HM\nOctober 15, 1948\n\nMr. S. K.

Such changes, if carried out, would affect the mechanical, electrical and structural layout. The Indian Affairs Branch when verbally informed, stated that they would advise this Division officially if the changes requested by the Principal, received their approval.\n\nWe received no advice that the alterations have been approved. The subsequent tenders numbered 8 to 14 inclusive with reference to the heating, plumbing and electrical work, are based on the proposed alterations, and since we have no record as to the extent of the alterations involved, it is not possible to offer worthwhile comment on either the heating or the electrical prices.\n\nFollowing a recent discussion with Indian Affairs officials, Col. Neary requested that we comment on the plumbing tenders at this time and that the heating and electrical comment be deferred until such time as definite information with regard to the changes, could be obtained.\n\nIt is expected that an officer from this Division will be making an inspection trip in the near future, and that at such time he can call at Kamloops and obtain the data required.\n\nIn the meantime, the two tenders covering the plumbing, are based on the proposed changes and are listed below:\n\nGiddens and Sons...........$3,525.00\nCarr and Son................$5,316.00\n\nBoth the above tenders are based on supplying the extra fixtures required by the proposed changes. In our opinion the tender of Giddens and Sons covers the plumbing requirements and is the most favourable. It is suggested that the Indian Affairs Branch would be well advised to accept this tender.\n\nWe are returning herewith the tenders accompanying Major Mackay's memorandum.\n\nYou will be further advised regarding the heating and electrical tenders when we are in a position to comment with authority.\n\nR.A.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nArrangements have been completed to have Mr. A.H. Hargreaves, the heating engineer of the Lands & Development Services Branch at Ottawa, visit certain schools in British Columbia. He will arrive in your province either the last week in May or the first week in June. As soon as we know the definite date, you will be advised. His itinerary is as follows:\n\n1. Kamloops - As stated above, we will advise you as soon as we know when he reaches the Kamloops School, and the Department would appreciate it if you would meet him there in order that the changes, if any, in the heating and plumbing may be discussed with him by Father O'Grady and yourself.\n\n2. William's Lake and Lejac - We would like to have arrangements made to have Mr. Hargreaves driven from Kamloops to the Cariboo Residential School at William's Lake, and also from William's Lake to Lejac. Possibly, one of the officials at Kamloops could take him to William's Lake and it could be arranged to have him met there and taken to Lejac. However, I have no doubt that you will make the best arrangements possible under the circumstances.\n\n3. Vancouver - Following his inspection of the Lejac Residential School, Mr. Hargreaves will travel from Prince George to Vancouver by Canadian Pacific Airways. On reaching Vancouver he will visit the Sechelt School and the Alert Bay School.\n4. Following his visit to the two schools just mentioned, he will proceed by air to Edmonton and then home.\n\nOwing to the rush of work in Head Office of the Lands & Development Services Branch at the present time, Mr. Hargreaves' services can only be spared for a limited time. However, we hope that his trip will result in our obtaining definite information regarding the procedure that should be followed in connection with repairs and improvements at the schools mentioned. We cannot guarantee to provide this year all that Mr. Hargreaves might recommend, but you can be assured that we will give his recommendations careful and immediate consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nMOA139 7=FD KAMLOOPS BC 26 813A\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH=\nDEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA= 21364\nRESERVATION HEATING ENGINEER HARGRAVES MADE PLAZA HOTEL=\nS K BRUCE SUPT.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-5 part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| April 29/49| To Prepaid Express on Basketballs for        |        |\n|            | Kamloops Indian Residential School           | 66     |\n\nPrepaid Express Receipt attached\n\nAuthority P.O. 6416 C\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This report which is self-explanatory must be amplified when Mr. Hargreaves returns to Ottawa before an estimate of cost can be furnished.\n\nCertain information was required by you for determination of policy and for that reason this interim report is furnished to you.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nMay 30, 1949  \nWilliams Lake, B.C.\n\nRe: Kamloops Indian Residential School\n\nFurther to my night letter of the 29th you are advised as follows:\n\nI arrived in Kamloops at 12:45 p.m. from Calgary by train on Sunday the 29th and registered at the Plaza Hotel. Mr. Arneil met me the following morning and we visited the Residential School, meeting Father O'Grady, the Principal.\n\nAfter clarifying the changes to the original design of the classroom block and recording them for the use of our Electrical Engineer, I measured the distance between the new block and the residential building and back to the boiler room in order to determine the extent of the revisions to the heating system.\n\nThe Classroom block is located 88'-0\" from the main building and the total distance from the block to the boiler room is 225'-0\". In view of the fact that the pipe sizes for the heating system in the new classroom block had been established, it was necessary to calculate the pump size to meet the conditions brought about by moving the boiler to the boiler room of the main building.\n\nHaving done this I requested the Principal to call in the Contractor, whose price was low. Following a general discussion, the Contractor agreed to the few minor changes without increase in price. I learned that Giddens & Sons were considered very reliable in this area.\n\nThe Kamloops School is one of the finest institutions of its kind that I have visited. The boilers are loaded to capacity but they are able to carry the load and look to be in good condition. The Principal pointed out to me the domestic hot water equipment. It is comprised of a 250 gallon storage tank with a small jacket heater and is vastly undersized. He stated that he had brought this to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch but so far nothing had been done.\n\nThere are 340 pupils here plus a large staff and this equipment cannot begin to handle the load. Mr. Arneil suggested that prices be obtained on the necessary equipment and forwarded through the Indian Agent to the Indian Affairs Branch for consideration. Accordingly I outlined a brief specification and the Principal was authorized to contact local firms and secure competitive bids.\n\nThere is no doubt that this equipment is badly needed. I believe it can be installed for less than $800 dollars. It is likely that the bids will reach Ottawa before I return and it is for that reason I now bring it to your attention.\n\nC. H.

This would take the place of the electric tank which was to be installed in the boiler room of the new school. This boiler would operate automatically summer and winter and supply hot water for the new classrooms.\n\nWe would cover the return mains with 4 ply asbestos covering, install mains in cedar box between the new building and the old one. We would install a 100 lbs. Iron Fireman automatic coal stoker. We would also recommend that the chimney which would have been built at the new school be built in the corner of the old boiler house so that the new boiler would have a separate chimney.\n\nIf this heating proposal is accepted we would make the complete installation for the sum of Ten Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-Seven Dollars ($10957.00).\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

I have reviewed our file again this morning and as far as I can see, all tenders forwarded have received attention and presumably everything is under control. When I was at the Kamloops School Father O'Grady stated that he had all the material necessary on hand. I hope that construction has started.\n\nWe do not appear to have received any reply to Colonel Neary's letter of August 10th and his Signal of August 11, with reference to contract agreement with H. Giddens and Sons, also the security deposit cheque for $1,095.70 which the Department requires. No doubt, these two matters will receive early attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nSeptember 1st, 1949.\n\nS.K.

Giddens Ltd., referring to a copy of their plumbing tender which was enclosed.\n(2) A tender dated August 23rd from H. Giddens Ltd., covering installation of a domestic hot water service in the building.\n(3) A letter dated August 17th from H. Giddens Limited, pointing out the change in the name of the firm.\n\nYour letter states that these enclosures were to be attached to the contract of H. Giddens covering installation of the hot water heating system which you mailed to this office on August 23rd. I cannot see what the tender on installation of plumbing or the tender on the domestic hot water services have to do with G. Giddens' contract on installation of hot water system.\n\nIt would appear to me that the tender for the hot water heating system will be disposed of when executed by the Deputy Minister and as the Minister has now approved acceptance of the tender of H. Giddens Limited dated March 12th, 1949, to install the plumbing as per plan and add the extra plumbing in the classroom block at a cost of $3,525.00, we need only deal with the H. Gidden's tender on the domestic hot water service.\n\nThe correspondence referred to above will be held here until an explanation has been received and if you have had correspondence from the Department requesting these tenders and copies of tenders you should so advise.\n\nW.S.

Just why all of these tenders, some of which have already been dealt with, are required, is not clear, but perhaps Mr. Hargreaves can clarify the matter. You will gather from my letter of September 1st to Mr. Bruce, a copy of which is attached, that we are somewhat confused with regard to these various tenders and Mr. Bruce's correspondence is far from helpful.\n\nContract Agreement covering installation of the hot water heating system, signed by H.

There are five sewing machines in the group there that should be replaced immediately and are indicated by a red X.\n\nFor your information, the 127-3 style machine and bench retails for $119.75.

The supply of the electric motors is, however, recommended. The amount of clothing required for the large enrolment would certainly justify the supply of this equipment.\n\nW.S.

Your File 4-11-4 (154)\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant, the Department approves purchase of the two motors for use at the above school. It is noted that you can secure these for approximately $33.00.\n\nWe will await a further letter from you regarding the necessity of supplying additional sewing machines. It is understood that this will be forwarded following Inspector Davey's inspection of the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Kamloops Indian Residential School\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of September 28th with regard to the plumbing and heating contracts in the new classroom block, and the domestic hot water installation in the main building. The latter contract was subsequently awarded to Carr & Son and it was not until Father O'Grady visited this office last week, were we aware that this installation had been the subject of discussion by Mr. Hargraves, Heating Engineer, Father O'Grady, and Mr. Giddens of H. Giddens & Sons during the formers visit to the school.\n\nI gather from Father O'Grady that the installation quoted on by H. Giddens & Sons was in accordance with requirements as set out by Mr. Hargraves and that the installation quoted on by Carr & Son is not suitable in that it will take four hours to heat water for domestic use. May I suggest that the tenders received on the domestic hot water system for the main building be reviewed with Mr. Hargraves if this has not already been done.\n\nW. S.

Bruce's letter of November 5th and enclosures attached that Carr and Sons have amended their tender to include a more suitable water heater at an increased price.

Father O'Grady wants a boiler larger than the one called for in our tender, he also wants changes made in the pipe sizes. The boiler we figured was a No.650 Cockram Steel Tubular Boiler. The one Father O'Grady wants is a No.6448 T.H. Empire Steel Welded Tank Heater cap. 2,000 imperial gal. per hour, at 50% rise per hour which is considerably larger.\n\nThe difference in the cost of installing this larger boiler over our previous tender is NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS.

This information was to be given you in his requisition.\n\nIt would now appear from the correspondence on your file 882-5 that Father O'Beady has decided on different equipment than that suggested which has resulted in an increase in cost. If Indian Affairs Branch are willing to meet the price quoted we have no objection. It can be stated however, that the equipment suggested to Father O'Beady on my visit to his school would provide a adequate amount of hot water to meet the needs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-5 part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNovember 22, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Food Mixer - Kamloops Residential School\n\nFather O'Grady informs me that an order has been placed for a twenty quart electric food mixer for the Kamloops school whereas the machine required to meet the requirements of the kitchen staff in preparing approximately 1100 meals a day is a twenty gallon mixer. I understand that the 20 quart mixer now ready for delivery was ordered from Ryan Brothers Western Limited who also quoted on an 80 quart mixer, reference their tender of August 26th enclosed. The cost of this machine is $1,785.00 plus $116.50 for an extra 40 quart bowl, whip and beater.\n\nIt is not known if the Department has funds to this extent for kitchen equipment at the Kamloops school but Father O'Grady informs me that a 20 quart mixer is of little value as it will be necessary for the kitchen staff to make four mixes for each meal. He is prepared to keep the small mixer, however, if the Department cannot provide the larger one. I have no doubt that Ryan Brothers would accept return of the smaller mixer.\n\nAn early decision with regard to this matter would be appreciated.\n\nW. S.

Blakeslee Mixer, also a quotation from N.S. Dalgleish Limited, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nThe price quoted by Russell Food Equipment Limited is considerably lower than that quoted by Ryan Brothers Western Limited and N.S. Dalgleish Limited.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Reservation School,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nAttention Father O'Grady\n\nDear Father:\n\nMr. Hall of the Marshall Wells Company, Vancouver, phoned the writer today, after receiving your wire asking that we write you in respect to a 20 gallon (80 qt.) Mixer for your school.\n\nBack in July 28, of this year, we forwarded this data to Mr. Campbell of the Marshall Wells Company, Kamloops, and we presumed that this information had been passed along to you. It was our intention at that time to have our Mr. Baker visit you on his way back from Prince Rupert, but, unfortunately, he had passed through Kamloops before we were able to contact him.\n\nOur representative covering the Interior is now in Nelson and will not be touching Kamloops again for a short time. We are sorry that we seemed to have missed you on both these occasions, but trust we will be able to serve you through the mail.\n\nYou will find attached descriptive literature on the 80 qt. Blakeslee Mixer, as well as data illustrating the various accessories that may be obtained for this machine.\n\nAs you are asking for such a large Mixer as the 80 qt. we presume you will be making your own bread. A Dough Hook is essential for mixing dough in this quantity.\n\nYou will also find it very handy to have small equipment which comes equipped with a 30 qt. Bowl; \"B\" Beater and a \"W\" whip along with the adaptor to fit the 80 qt. Mixer. This will assist you in making small batches of goods.\n\nThe prices on the above equipment are as follows:\n\n- 80 qt. Blakeslee Mixer c/w 80 qt. Bowl, \"B\" Beater, \"W\" Whip $1214.40\n- 80 qt. Dough Hook 21.25\n- 1 set of 30 qt. small equipment 94.35\n\nRANGES BAKE OVENS STEAM TABLES COOK'S TABLES BAKERS' TABLES DISHWASHERS PEELERS SLICERS MIXERS STEAM COOKERS MEAT CHOPPERS URNS SINKS REFRIGERATORS DISH RACKS FAT FRYERS GRILLES PAN RACKS FRY CUTTERS TOASTERS MEAT BLOCKS BUTTER CUTTERS APPLE PARERS AND CORERS CREAM DISPENSERS COFFEE DISPENSERS COFFEE MAKERS ROAST PANS SUNDRY UTENSILS EVERYTHING FOR THE MODERN KITCHEN\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-5 part 14)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNovember 19, 1949.\n\nThese prices are special low prices to your school, and are quoted subject to your supplying us with a certificate which we will mail to you for signatures, and which will state that it is to be used exclusively for your school.\n\nMixers of this type are controlled by the Canadian Austerity Programme, and we have sufficient funds at the present time to import this machine and would, therefore respectively suggest that you try and make your decision as early as possible, in order that we may assist you in the supplying of this Mixer with our present funds.\n\nTrusting the above information has been of assistance to you, and looking forward to receiving your valued order, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRUSSELL FOOD EQUIPMENT LTD.,\n\nG.

Beater, and Wire Loop Whip, Complete and F.O.B.Kamloops $130.00\n\nShould a Bowl Dolly or Truck be required as pictured on the enclosed specification sheet, these come extra at F.O.B.Kamloops $34.00\n\nWe can supply this Equipment immediately with an electrical specification of 220 volts, 3 phase, 60 cycle.\n\nThe prices F.O.B.Kamloops are based on the assumption that all equipment ordered will be ordered in the initial order, piecemeal orders would be F.O.B. Vancouver.\n\nThanking you for this opportunity of further quoting you we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN.S.DALGLEISH LTD.\n\nP.S.

However, before construction was started, it was decided that by heating the Day School from the Residential School the heating plant area could be utilized for instructional purposes.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch informed us in their memorandum dated the 11th of April, 1949, that changes had been made to our layout and they obtained tenders for the electrical work based on the proposed changes to be made. In our memorandum to Indian Affairs dated the 2nd of May, 1949, we pointed out that since we had no knowledge of the extent of the alterations we were unable to offer worthwhile comment on the tenders forwarded to us. In a discussion with Col. Neary, he requested that our commentary on the electrical work be deferred until such time as we were fully acquainted with the situation.\n\nOur electrical engineer visited Kamloops last November during his western inspection trip and took measurements and prepared a plan of the new layout. There was such a great variation from our original plans that it was considered advisable to prepare a new electrical design and call for competitive tenders on this basis. We have completed our electrical design and have today delivered by hand to Col. Neary six (6) copies of our plans and specifications Index No. 827, which the Indian Affairs Branch will send to the electrical contractors for re-bid.\n\nOur officer inspected the Residential School and out-buildings while he was at the site, and in this connection, we make the following remarks.\n\n(a) Residential School\n\nIt is proposed to continue to use several of the existing classrooms in this building as instructional areas when the classroom block is in operation. The lighting in these classrooms is very poor and we consider it necessary to increase the illumination.\n(a) Residential School (Cont'd)\n\nThe lighting in other areas throughout the school is below minimum requirements, and it is recommended that general improvements in lighting be carried out as required to our specifications. It is also recommended that a minimum number of plug receptacles be provided thus eliminating the hazards existing through the use of long temporarily connected extension cords.\n\nThe present distribution system is 2 wire, 115 volts alternating current and we recommend that a 3 wire, 115/230 volt system be provided and that existing open knife type distribution centres be replaced by modern totally enclosed equipment.\n\n(b) Out-buildings\n\nThere are a number of buildings located at the site, and it is recommended that alterations in the wiring be made to conform to code regulations and good practice. The electrical installations in several of the more recently constructed buildings is satisfactory and requires no attention.\n\nIn summary therefore, we desire from the Indian Affairs Branch:\n\n1. Concurrence in providing a new distribution system and improved lighting and wiring in the Residential School.\n\n2. Concurrence in providing lighting and wiring improvements in the Out-buildings in accordance with Canadian Electrical Code Regulations and good practice.\n\nWe estimate that the above mentioned work can be carried out under contract for an amount not exceeding $4,500.00.\n\nChief,\nAIR MAIL\n\nFebruary 20th, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nPO Box 70, Vancouver, BC.\n\nRe: Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to our telegram and army message of February 15th regarding the electric wiring at the above school, I enclose for your information a copy of a memorandum just received from the Department of Resources and Development.\n\nWe are advising them that we concur in the recommendations made at the bottom of Page 2 of their memorandum.\n\nFP/ST Enc.\n\nBernard F.

We approve the following recommendations from your office:\n\n1. Concurrence in providing a new distribution system and improved lighting and wiring in the residential school.\n\n2.

Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Neary's Army Signals message of this date relative to various matters in connection with the Kamloops Indian Residential School and would advise as follows:\n\n(1) Re Tank heater for domestic hot water for classroom block:\nIt will be recalled that Messrs. Giddens and Company, when tendering on the plumbing contract, quoted on an adequate size tank heater whereas Messrs Carr and Sons in their tender inadvertently quoted on a small size tank heater. Messrs. Carr and Sons' tender was accepted to complete the contract.\nAs the smaller heater quoted in their tender is quite insufficient for the requirements of the school it is considered necessary to have installed a tank heater of the proper size. A quotation was received from Messrs. Carr and Sons indicating the difference in price, installed, between the small heater already quoted on and the large heater necessary. This amounts to $988. Owing to the above circumstances quotations were not invited nor was it considered feasible to do so having in mind that the contract had already been awarded. It is considered that the price submitted is satisfactory and the purchase is strongly recommended.\n\n(2) Re Purchase of 80 quart food mixer:\nIt is noted that it is not considered advisable to supply an 80 quart food mixer at the present time. In conversation with Father O'Grady today he advises that the purchase of two 20-quart food mixers would not be sufficient for the school's purpose and would continually require both small mixers operating at one time with obvious inconvenience and additional work.\nFather O'Grady asks if authority could be obtained to secure a 60 quart food mixer. The 60-quart food mixer\ncould be economically used and would be considered sufficient. On receipt of your further comments regarding our procuring a 60-quart size, prices can be obtained. In the meantime no action is being taken to secure the 20-quart food mixer.\n\n(3) Stoker for kitchen range:\nFather O'Grady was under the impression that a quotation had been forwarded to Ottawa. Steps are being taken today to have quotations forwarded this evening by airmail so that the matter may receive attention. I am advised by Father O'Grady that Messrs. Giddens and Sons are giving an advantageous price on the stoker for the kitchen range.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Neary's Army Signals message of this date relative to the tenders received for the wiring of the classroom block at Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the lowest tenders are as follows:\n\nC.L. Wain and Son $3,956.80\nFinn Electric Company $3,954.75\nStevens Electric Company $3950.00\n\nThe Finn Electric Company and Stevens Electric Company are two new companies in the district and their ability to satisfactorily complete a contract is not known. C.L. Wain and Son are well established and have done previous work by contract at the Residential School. Their workmanship and material supplied has always been most satisfactory. In view of the small cash difference between C.L. Wain and Sons tender and the two lower tenders it is recommended that Wain's tender be accepted.\n\nW. S.

I would now recommend that the balance of the funds appropriated for Old Fort, $4,250.00 and the entire amount appropriated for Kitsegukla, $18,000.00, be transferred for completion of the Classroom Block at Kamloops. The total of these two amounts is not quite sufficient and a further transfer will be recommended later if necessary as our construction program develops.\n\nW. S.

File 154/6-1-882, I wish to advise that I have had Mr. Swan check over the unfinished work of the Classroom Block and prepare estimates of materials and labour for its completion. These estimates together with the balances owing on sub-contracts of wiring, heating and hot water installation form the list of estimates on the attached sheet.\n\nThe delay on the interior finishing of the building, which constitutes the bulk of the work yet to be done, has been due to the wiring contract not being let before March 31st. last. However Wain & Son of Kamloops now have the contract and are ready to proceed with the work. As soon as the wiring has been installed it will not take long to complete the building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

The information which you supplied has been noted, and arrangements will be made to transfer the necessary funds next week.\n\nIn making the transfer for provision of funds for completion of the three schools in the Skeena River Agency, the following action was taken:\n\n| Decrease | Increase |\n|----------|----------|\n| Hazelton | $32,000.00 |\n| Old Fort | $15,000.00 |\n| Hartley Bay | $16,000.00 |\n| Kincolith | $9,250.00 |\n| Lakalsap | $21,750.00 |\n\n$47,000.00 $47,000.00\n\nThe total amount provided for Old Fort in the current year's appropriation was $18,000.00, and as we have already transferred $15,000.00, there is only $3,000.00 remaining. Consequently, to provide the additional funds for Kamloops, it will be necessary to transfer from some project other than the two mentioned in your letter. This is shown by the following statement:\n\n....2\n| Location     | Increase | Decrease |\n|--------------|----------|----------|\n| Kamloops     | $24,000.00 |          |\n| Old Fort     |          | $3,000.00 |\n| Kitsegukla   |          | $18,000.00 |\n\n$24,000.00 $21,000.00\n\nYou will note from the above that we will require another $3,000.00, and it would be appreciated if you would send us an army signal stating the school from which you consider this amount should be taken.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIn connection with the installation of the domestic hot water unit for this School I wish to advise that Mr. Hargreaves of the Department of Lands & Development, on his visit here a year ago, approached H. Giddens Ltd. of Kamloops, who were to get the contract for heating the Classroom Block, and asked them to quote on the domestic hot water unit. H. Giddens Ltd. had already figured, in their price on the heating job, to supply hot water for domestic use by increasing the size of their heating unit. Mr. Hargreaves did not favour that method of heating water and recommended a separate installation. He outlined what was required and asked H. Giddens Ltd. to quote a price on this separate unit. Since a separate unit for domestic hot water was being called for H. Giddens Ltd. would not need now to increase the size of their heating boiler. They suggested to re-quote on their heating contract price at a lower figure. Mr. Hargreaves thought it best for them to leave their heating contract price stand but asked them, in quoting on the domestic hot water unit, to arrive at a figure less the amount they saved in not having to increase the size of their heating boiler. H. Giddens Ltd. did this. The situation changes now with another Contractor coming into the picture. Carr & Son of Kamloops were asked to quote on the domestic hot water unit by the local Superintendent and they, without sufficiently studying what was required, put in a price on a unit far too small at a much less figure, and got the contract. H. Giddens Ltd. were surprised but not disappointed because they effected quite a saving on their heating job.\n\nIn the quotation of Carr & Son on the domestic hot water unit it is the size of the heating tank that is far too small. To correct the situation Carr & Son subsequently quoted to install a heating tank to the amount of $988.00. The domestic hot water unit would then be of the same size as quoted on by H. Giddens Ltd. which is the size required.\n\nI hope the above explanation will clarify the situation of the contract mentioned in the preceding paragraphs and that some action can be forthcoming soon to proceed with the installation of the domestic hot water unit which is so urgently needed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

On enquiry we were advised the pump was in normal operation and suddenly stopped. Smoke was seen coming from the motor and the starting compensator.\n\nOn examination we found several coils in the motor burned and decided to ship it to the repair shop. An examination at the shop showed the insulation was badly perished. This no doubt is due to the age of the motor, 23 years.\n\nWe were advised that a complete rewind job would be necessary.\n\nThe cost of repairs, rent of service motor, etc. will be approximately $650.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. L. WAIN & SON\n\nC. L. Wain.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Irrigation Pump - Kamloops Residential School\n\nWe are advised by Supt. Bruce that after twenty-three year's service the insulation on the 50 H.P. 2200 volt motor operating the above-mentioned pump has perished to such an extent that several coils in the motor burned out and a complete rewind at an approximate cost of $650.00 is now necessary. This price is tendered by C.L. Wein & Son, reference their letter of May 31st attached, and includes the rental of a motor while repairs are being made. I would recommend that Supt.

Due to circumstances with which we have no connection or control, it would appear that a misunderstanding has arisen with regard to Father O'Grady's request for improvements to the domestic hot water system in the residential school. It is the purpose of this memorandum to review the circumstances known to us and to suggest a recommendation on which the Indian Affairs Branch may base their action.\n\n3. Our Mr. Hargreaves visited this school a year ago in connection with changes to the Four Classroom Block then under construction. At that time Father O'Grady pointed out that the domestic hot water facilities in the residential school were inadequate to meet the requirements for his pupils and staff. Our officer inspected these services and verified the principal's contention. Father O'Grady was advised to submit his request for improvements to the Indian Affairs Branch through the local Indian Superintendent. Since the Superintendent was away on a business trip, Mr. Arnell who was present, suggested that Father O'Grady's request should be submitted to him for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n4. Our officer outlined the requirements and it was agreed that since this work had nothing to do with the contract being carried out at the new Classroom Block, it should be classed as a maintenance item. Therefore, Father O'Grady was advised to obtain prices on the following equipment:\n\nOne - 1000 gallon domestic hot water storage tank with suitable steel supports.\n\nOne - High-Test cast iron jacket heater built for a working pressure of 75 p.s.i., having a capacity to raise 500 gallons of water per hour through 100 degree temperature rise.\n\nOne - pressure relief valve set to release at 60 p.s.i.\n\nOne - stoker to fire jacket heater having a capacity to burn coal at a maximum rate of 50 lbs. per hour. All necessary piping, valves and fittings as may be required to complete the installation.\n\nMajor MacKay:\nFor your information.\n\nDirector,\n9/8/50.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-5 part 15)\n5. Giddens and Sons were the contractors carrying out the plumbing and heating installation in the Classroom Block. They submitted a price for the work, which for reasons unknown to us, was not acted on by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n6. After they had completed their contract and moved out, the local Indian Superintendent called for prices and the work was awarded to Carr and Son, whose tender was much lower than that of Giddens and Sons. After the work was awarded to Carr and Son, Father O'Grady discovered that they had tendered on equipment of insufficient capacity and not in accordance with the requirements suggested by our officer.\n\n7. Father O'Grady's letter, a copy of which was attached to Major MacKay's memorandum, does not give sufficient detail for us to furnish complete comment.

In order for us to recommend that the Carr and Son tender be accepted, it will be necessary to have Father O'Grady submit to us an itemized list of the equipment they propose to supply. This list should include the items mentioned in paragraph 4 of this memorandum. We would also be interested to know the contractor's price.

The five forms of the quarterly report have to be certificated by you. I respectfully request you to transmit the report to the Department as soon as possible, as some delay has occurred already owing to the absence of the Indian Agent.\n\nI am glad to have this opportunity to thank you most sincerely for the kind interest you take in this institution, and to congratulate you on your exemplary zeal in the discharge of your duties and on your successful management of the best interests of the Indians.\n\nI may be permitted to call your attention to the fact that the land occupied by the School has been surrendered by the Indians for the purposes of the Industrial School; and therefore I am of opinion that the land taken by the C.N.R. for the right of way should be paid for to the School and not to the band of Kamloops Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.J. Gummisky, Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\nOttawa, 24th October, 1912.\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th instant and the correspondence enclosed from the Rev. Principal of the Kamloops School, I beg to say that the money received from the Canadian Northern Railway for Right of Way through the land referred to, which belongs to the Kamloops Indians, is the property of the Band and must therefore be placed to the credit of the Band's account instead of to the credit of the Kamloops School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nT.J. Gummikey Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReverting to the matter of irrigation of the land of the Kamloops Industrial School which we discussed during your visit to the province, I beg to say that no outlay has yet been made in the direction of having an estimate prepared, and it seems that a little has been gained by waiting.\n\nThe man I had in view to look it over has been ill and would not have been able to undertake it up to the present; but in discussing the matter with Indian Agent Smith I learned that he was expecting to obtain the services of an engineer from the Department of Interior to go into another matter relating to water for the Indians of the Kamloops Agency, and he would have him take levels at the Industrial School. That engineer has not yet come and the matter remains as it was.\n\nLast week I spent a couple of days in Kamloops attending the Convention of the Western Canada Irrigation Association and met Father La Chesne with whom I had an interview, and he appeared urgent to get matters under way, but he advised me of a new complication in the situation which to my mind would make it prudent to hasten slowly for a bit and allow matters to work themselves out. He is dissatisfied with the location of the C.N.R. right of way through through the Industrial School grounds which was arranged for by my predecessor, Mr. Commiskey, and wanted the question re-opened. Were it not that this matter of C.N.R. right of way is a factor in the irrigation project which\nwe had in view, I would not care to deal with the matter of re-opening the right of way question which I understand was sufficiently difficult in itself before it was settled; but if the C. N. R. is to be built on its present location it will affect materially the cost and efficiency of a suitable irrigation system for the Industrial School grounds. Father La Chesne gave me a rough sketch of the C. N. R. location through the school grounds and I enclose it herewith. As the buildings stand on an eminence and the railway which will pass in rear of them is on ground that is still higher, it will mean a deep cut there and a moderately high fill all along the flat and river front to the east.\n\nI also discussed the question of irrigation for the Kamloops Industrial School grounds with Mr. Young, Provincial Water Comptroller, and he promised to let some of his engineers look it over without any cost to the Indian Department for such service, and that is another reason why it might be better to let the matter rest for a bit to give the right of way situation time to clear up a little before rushing into any expenditure. Father La Chesne is anxious to get work under way this fall.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nAugust 11th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Megraw -\n\nI have your letter of the last inst. and note what you say about irrigation of land at the Kamloops Industrial school.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a tracing which shows the right of way through the school property which I hope will be of use to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. Megraw, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nVancouver, B. C.,\nJanuary 8th, 1917.\n\nA. Megraw, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with your request I have made an examination of the Kamloops Indian Industrial School Farm with the object of ascertaining the feasibility of irrigating a portion of this farm by pumping from the South Thompson River, and beg to submit the following report:\n\nThe natural conditions existing are favourable to the irrigation of this land by pumping and with a reasonable annual charge for the necessary power, it should be a satisfactory method of irrigation.\n\nThe land included in the present pumping project contains a total possible area of about 100 acres, which can be economically developed, requiring only a short pipe line 380 feet in length to deliver the water to a point where it can be distributed by flumes and ditches to all the fields to be irrigated.\n\nIn order to determine the capacity of the pumping plant required, it was of course necessary to secure the best data available as to the duty of water, or the amount necessary per acre in this district, also the number and duration of the applications.\n\nWith the natural precipitation during the irrigation season, (which will generally amount to about 5 inches) it is probably safe to state that as an average for the different crops to be grown on this soil, and under this most favourable condition of delivery, (where practically all of the water reaches the land)\ntwo acre-feet per acre would be an ample supply to be pumped during the irrigation season.\n\nIt is stated that the irrigation season extends from the first of May to the first of September and that about four applications of water are necessary during this season.\n\nThe duration of each service and the depth of water to be put on the land will vary greatly with the class of soil and the different crops, and therefore it is difficult to acquire reliable data regarding this matter, but the maximum requirement at a service should not exceed eight inches in depth.\n\nIt will be necessary to provide a pumping plant of a suitable capacity to pump sufficient water during such periods, when the greatest amount is actually needed during working hours, as no natural storage reservoir exists here which could be cheaply developed, to equalize the supply pumped, and by this means permit of a smaller pump being used.\n\nWhere one half of the crop is alfalfa and the other half grain or other crops requiring a similar volume of water, and when an economical use of the water is made under a rotation system, experiments in other localities have shown that about 19 per cent of the water should be delivered in the month of May, 26 per cent in June, 33 per cent in July and 20 per cent in August. Applying this data to the 100 acres under contemplation, the maximum pump duty will be 33 per cent of 200 acre-feet, or 66 acre-feet to be pumped in thirty days of twelve working hours each, which amounts to 2.2 cubic feet per second. (It is assumed that in this particular case the pump will be operated only during the daylight hours).\n\nAs no doubt there will be a variety of crops grown and the services of water can be regulated so that the different fields receive it alternately in sufficient quantities to suit the different crops, I have concluded that a pump of the above capacity will be ample to irrigate the one hundred acres considered in this\nThe total lift (including friction head) to the point of delivery or distribution into the main ditches is 50 feet above the average water level of S. Thompson River during the irrigation season (as near as can be ascertained) and the necessary power required to operate the proposed pump would be 25 H.P. on the pump shaft, allowing an efficiency of 50% for the pump.\n\nThe transmission line from the Kamloops sub-station to the pump house will have a total length of 1.20 miles of which 0.90 miles of poles are already installed, requiring only the additional cross-arms, pins, insulators and wires.\n\nPower is distributed from the Kamloops sub-station into the main lines at 2200 volts and will be transmitted to the pump-house through No. 6 gauge copper wires at this voltage, where it will then be reduced to 220 volts by two service transformers.\n\nWith regard to the cost of power, this is a matter which will have to be arranged with the City of Kamloops, as their present schedule of prices (as published) are prohibitory, but no doubt a special arrangement can be made based upon a reasonable charge per horse power or a lump sum for the season.\n\nAs an example of what charges are being made by other power companies for similar work, I may mention the case of the Pitt Meadows Land Company who operate a large pump at Pitt Meadows during about four months each year. The Western Canada Power Company constructed the transmission line and supply the necessary power at one cent per K.W. hour, with a minimum charge of $200.00 for the season.\n\nProbably 25,000 K.W. hours would be the total amount you would require during an irrigation season, so that the annual cost of irrigating the farm at this rate would amount to about $250.00 or about $2.50 per acre, without taking into consideration\nthe interest on the cost of the plant and assuming that the operating and maintenance are provided by the School.\n\nI may here mention that the area of irrigable land in this project, which we examined in the company of the School Principal and Agent, is smaller than I at first anticipated, but no doubt is a sufficient area to demonstrate the feasibility of pumping.\n\nA very much larger area of level land lying along the North Thompson River in the vicinity of Paul Creek, can no doubt be successfully irrigated by pumping. This large tract of land which is now being served by Paul Creek, would require a separate pumping plant on the N. Thompson River, and may receive your future consideration, after more data has been secured.\n\nWith regard to the Western portion of the land under consideration, lying between the 40 foot contour and the low area subject to flooding, there is an area here of about 32 acres of light sandy soil, a large portion of which can probably be considered as irrigable land. I am informed that \"while Father LeChesne is very anxious that the scheme be pushed to a favourable conclusion, he is doubtful if he will be able to handle this sandy area for some years to come.\"\n\nIn formulating the proposed pumping scheme, I have, however, considered it advisable to include at least 20 acres of this area.\n\nI have written to the Kamloops Council, asking them to state a price for supplying the necessary power on a flat rate basis per horse power per season, and have not as yet received a reply, but will acquaint you of their offer as soon as it arrives.\n\nThe accompanying plans, profile and other details show the proposed pumping scheme, and the following estimate of cost is based upon this type of construction.\nI may here mention that Mr. William Young, Comptroller of Water Rights, accompanied me in the examination of the ground, and that the necessary contours of the land, and surveys, sufficient to ascertain the irrigable areas and other measurements and levels were made by his Department, from which data the accompanying plans were prepared:\n\n### ESTIMATE OF COST\n\n#### PUMP HOUSE\n\n| Item                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Excavation of Bottom 30 cu. yds. @ $1.00                             | $30.00 |\n| File Foundation, in place, 200 lin.ft.@ 50\u00a2                           | 150.00 |\n| Re-inforced Concrete Pump Chamber, 29 cu. yds. @ $15.00                | 435.00 |\n| 25 h.p.

The conditions under which the pipe-line will be used are not favorable to wood, but the present high price of steel would make it advisable to consider the adoption of a wooden pipe even if its life will not exceed seven or eight years.\n\nThe reducing of the voltage from 2200 to 220 volts at the pump house (and the necessary transformers provided for in the above estimate) is a matter which you may further consider.\n\nThe chief object of this arrangement is:- greater safety to inexperienced operators, and consequently a better assurance to continuous operating.\n\nThe rotary pump provided for in my estimate of cost is a simple design, and is recommended by a number of practical men who have had experience with pumps. As the speed of this pump will be about 300 R. P. M. it cannot be direct connected with the Motor, but will be belt driven.\n\nAnother type of pump which may be considered would be a centrifugal pump designed for a moderately high head and direct connected with the motor. This would be an ideal arrangement, except that the motor would require to be placed down at the bottom of the concrete chamber. The price would probably be the same.\n\nShould you decide to go ahead with this pumping project, it will be necessary to construct the pile foundation, Concrete work and Section pipe of the Pump House, in the early spring before the water level has risen to these points.\n\nThe above estimate of cost is based upon the prices which exist at the present time, and is therefore subject to an increase at any time.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nConsulting Engineer.\n| DATE   | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Dec. 4 | To trip to Kamloops to examine proposed irrigation scheme for Indian Industrial School Farm by pumping from S.

I also enclose vouchers for engineer's account for same.\n\nThe reason the matter has been delayed so long is that the right of way of the Canadian Northern through these lands would cut up the place in such a manner as to render it scarcely worth while going to the expense of irrigating, and as the school authorities and the Railway Company were fighting it out, I didn't feel justified in incurring any expense until they had arrived at some settlement. That settlement was effected about the end of September by the Railway Company choosing another route, but it was so difficult for me to obtain an engineer, and I was in hopes that I might be able to have all or a good deal of it done by the engineers of the Provincial Water Branch, that I refrained from concluding arrangements with any outside engineer. Finally Mr. Young wrote me that he was too short-handed to spare any of his men, but recommended Mr. H. M. Burwell of Vancouver to whom he offered to give all the assistance he could, and he promised to supply data from his own office for Mr. Burwell's use that would lessen the expense very materially.\nmaterially. This promise I have reason to believe was fully carried out by Mr. Young, and the assistance he gave is acknowledged by Mr. Burwell in his report. Altogether I think Mr. Burwell's account is reasonable for the service he has rendered and I recommend payment.\n\nA new difficulty, however, has arisen that may make it doubtful whether any scheme for development of the project may be proceeded with. Father La Chesne, the Principal, who was the moving spirit in the matter and had the business capacity to carry it through, has been ordered to join his regiment in France.\n\nNevertheless the engineering work has now been done and the estimate of cost made, and this will now be ready for them any time they may want to take it up; for unless they do something better in the way of farming at this school than has been done in the past, its usefulness will be limited from an industrial point of view. In this part of the province farming is the industry for the Indian and that is what he should be taught.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nDuncan C.

Burwell\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C. March 18, 1917.\n\nBuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Sup't. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just returned from a visit to the Kamloops Indian Industrial School where I had a conversation with Mr. Smith, the Indian Agent, and Father Salles, O.M.O. acting principal.\n\nI. The chief question we discussed was that of the installation of the proposed new irrigating plant. I understand that a competent engineer's plans and estimates have already been submitted to you, and no doubt you are very anxious to see the work completed. I am satisfied it will be a great boon to the school, especially during these hard times, and if it is your desire that the work be undertaken and finished this year, I would respectfully suggest that the foundations for the Electric pump be laid at once -- that is before the river rises. Nothing can be done as soon as the water begins to rise -- and thus a whole year will be lost unless the work is begun at an early date. Only thirteen acres are now under cultivation, but when the new plant is installed they will be able to irrigate a hundred.\n\nII. Another point to which I would respectfully draw your attention is the condition of the farming implements -- nearly everything is old and worn out. A new plough is needed, and also a new wagon, and new disc harrows and rakes. The horses, too, are about 18 years old and are practically useless today. Certainly the school urgently needs a fresh work team and a set of harness -- and also a carriage horse as trips to town must be made several times a week.\n\nIII. The last request I now beg to make is that you would raise the pupilage from 60 to 64. Mr. Smith assures me that the school has accommodation for 68 children. An increase of even four paying pupils would be of assistance and would be much appreciated at a time like this when the price of food and clothing has almost doubled since the outbreak of the war.\n\nSincerely trusting you may be able to grant the above requests, which the Indian Agent I am sure is ready to endorse, I have the honour to be,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\nOttawa, March 29, 1917.\n\nRev.

Megrav,\nInspector.\nOffice of Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nSoutheastern Inspectorate,\n\nVernon, B.C.,\nFebruary 22, 1918.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to advise the Department that the question of irrigation has become very urgent in the Kamloops Agency and has taken up a good deal of my attention of late. So serious has the situation become at the Kamloops Industrial School that something must be done to enable them to continue and the disadvantages they have to contend against are fully set forth in a report made to the Department by Indian Agent, J.F. Smith, under date of February 5th, 1918.\n\nIrrigation at the Industrial School. This matter was taken up in the fall of 1916 when Mr. Burwell, C.E. of Vancouver, was employed to examine the feasibility of installing a pumping plant and made report thereon under date of January 8th, 1917. His estimate, I am assured, can be reduced nearly $1000.00 without loss of effectiveness and probably with considerable betterment in some regards; but a good deal of the saving effected by alteration of part of the plan might now be wiped out by advance in the cost of electrical supplies and other material since Mr. Burwell's estimate was made. As Mr. Burwell speaks of Kamloops City power rates being prohibitory, the Council were asked that they could do to meet the situation. They have now given a rate of 1\u00bd cents per kilowatt hour for the Industrial School scheme and 1\u00bc cents per kilowatt hour if the larger scheme of pumping from the North Thompson on to the Indian Reserve is adopted. They are able to supply over 1500 horse power and are using only about\n600 horse power, so it is to their advantage to make the rates low enough to dispose of as much of it as they can.\n\nThe school is of little use in its present condition, so far as teaching farming to Indian pupils is concerned, when they are unable to grow sufficient food stuffs to maintain themselves and must buy all their supplies at the present high prices. They have been receiving their grant all along as an Industrial School with the main object in view to teach the Indian boys how to farm, and the desired results are not being obtained.

Mcgraw,\nInspector.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, March 12, 1916.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Scott,\n\n1st. Re Water-supply and Irrigation of Land of Kamloops Industrial School.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe following notes were taken from the several files relating to the water-supply of the Kamloops Industrial school and the various attempts and suggestions made to date to irrigate the school land for farming purposes.\n\nUp to January 2, 1892, the water-supply for both domestic and irrigation purposes was furnished by a windmill pumping water from the Thompson River into a wooden tank located in the attic of the school building but owing to the inadequate supply of water thus obtained an additional quantity had to be carried to the school by the pupils, a distance of 400 feet, with an elevation of about fifty feet.\n\nOn January 2, 1892, Rev. J. A. Bedard of Victoria applied to the Department for an additional irrigation plant, for the Industrial school, consisting of a 12 foot geared aerometer, a pneumatic low pressure pump, air compressor, 50 foot wooden tower, shaft, fittings, a 2000 gallons water tank and the necessary piping to lay a pipe line from the river to the proposed site of the tank, a distance of about 400 feet. The estimated cost of the work was given at $956.00, but upon the recommendation of Mr. A. W. Vowell, Indian Superintendent, who stated that the scheme as thus suggested would not give satisfactory results, the work was not carried out.\n\nOn March 17, 1893, Mr. A. W. Vowell reported to the Department that the water-supply for both domestic and irri-\nirrigation purposes was almost a failure and that provision would have to be made to improve the situation especially as to the irrigation of the school land and a detailed report was subsequently furnished by Agent J. W. MacKay suggesting that the old wind-mill be repaired so as to provide irrigation for the school garden and lower part of the school reserve and that a new pumping plant be installed which could be operated by hand or belt-driven to furnish the required supply of water to the school building. The estimated cost of this new pumping apparatus including the well, wooden tank and piping amounted to $240.00. No action was taken by the Department in this matter.\n\nOn February 7, 1906, the Principal of the school, Rev. M.N. Carion, applied for a grant of $250.00 to install a new wind-mill similar to that already suggested by Rev. J.A. Bedard in 1892 to irrigate a few extra acres of land in the school reserve. Upon the recommendation of both the Indian Superintendent and Agent the amount of $250.00 was paid by the Department for the machinery only, and the labor was furnished by the school authorities.\n\nOn March 21, 1912, an architect, Mr. J. Partlett, engaged by the Department to make an inspection of that school reported that the water-supply was exposed to contamination owing to the bad location of the intake pipe and recommended that the pumping of water for domestic purposes from artesian wells. No action has yet been taken with reference to this suggestion.\n\nOn January, 28, 1913, Mr. R. Bell, an architect from Vernon B.C., also made an inspection of the school especially of the water-supply. He, in his report, mentioned that the 3 H.P. gasoline engine which had been purchased by the school to operate the pump was worn out and that the whole\nplant was far from being satisfactory. He suggested the installation of a new pumping system which would be driven by electricity, the cost of which would only amount to $700.00, in view of the fact that electricity was being brought to the school at that time. The proposal was not carried out owing to lack of funds.\n\nOn June 2, 1913, the Principal and the Agent made a strong plea that the 3 H.P. gasoline engine above mentioned be replaced and the request was granted on August 6, 1913. The amount authorized for the change was fixed at $250.00.\n\nOn April 13, 1915, an amount of $87.20 was expended in repairing the old wind-mill used for irrigation of farm land.\n\nOn July 4, 1917, an amount of $52.50 was also expended in repairing the gasoline engine also used for irrigation purposes.\n\nOn March 8, 1917, another request was made by Rev. J. Welch for the installation of a new and complete pumping plant for the irrigation of the school land, but same was not taken into consideration owing to the reduction in the school appropriation.\n\nOn April 8, 1917, the Principal, Rev. J.B. Salles, reported that only from five to eight acres of land were being cultivated and that considerable loss was suffered owing to the lack of proper and sufficient irrigation and applied for some help towards improving the present condition.\n\nFinally on February 8, 1918, Agent J. Smith informed the Department that the failure in last year's vegetable and hay crops was due to the insufficient and poor system of irrigation, and stated that 100 acres of good land could be utilized if irrigated and that such improvement would enable\nthis institution to grow sufficient vegetables and other farm products.\n\nThe school reserve has an area of 352 acres of which only 8 acres are being cultivated; this compels the authorities to pay, each year, a considerable sum of money for vegetables and other products which could be obtained from their own farm if some reliable system of irrigation could be provided, such as that described in the following item.\n\nOn December 4, 1916, a complete survey was made of the school reserve by a civil engineer of Vancouver, Mr. H. Burwell, with a view to preparing the necessary plans, estimates and reports on the feasibility of irrigating a sufficient portion of the school farm. According to Mr. H. Burwell's notes on the proposed scheme an additional 100 acres could be economically developed along the shore of the South Thompson River. The plant consisted in summary of pumping the water with an electric driven pump a distance of 350 feet to a distributing tank from where it could be carried to the different portions of the fields by means of wooden flumes and ditches.\n\nThe cost of the whole installation at that time was estimated at $4,500.00, and its annual maintenance and operation $300.00.\n\nAlthough several requests were made to this Department by the Principal, the agent, etc., who all agreed on the urgent need of this improvement, the Department decided that the work as proposed could not be taken into consideration at present owing to war conditions.\n\nI may add that upon examination of the proposed plans and estimates, I think that several changes could be made which would reduce both the cost of the installation of the plant and its operation, if the scheme is to be carried out at a later date.\n\nJ.

Accompanied by Mr. Smith, Indian Agent, Mr. Varcoe, district engineer, Water Rights Branch, and Mr. Cline, I have made inspection of Indian Reserve and Industrial School grounds looking into irrigation requirements; have advised Mr. Smith we will prepare plans and estimates for pumping proposition to irrigate one hundred acres school land with idea of installing plant at once. Stop. In the Indian Reserve there is the question of increasing irrigable reserve by improving efficiency of gravity system and also by bringing several hundred acres under cultivation by pumping. This will require detailed topographic surveys of agriculturally till reserve on Thompson river flats. Have advised Mr. Smith we will make survey and submit report as soon as possible without interfering with other work.\n\nR. G. Swan.\nPROPOSED PUMP INSTALLATION\nFOR\nIRRIGATION OF 100 ACRES\nKAMLOOPS INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL RESERVE\n\nScale - 1 inch = 5 feet\n\nPUMP HOUSE\nInside Dimensions 10' x 10'\n\nMarch 20, 1918\nG. J. Collins\nMarch 30th, 1916.\n\nDesign and Estimates for Pumping Plant\nFor Irrigating Land at Industrial School\nKamloops Indian Reserve.\n\nPrevious surveys and investigations have developed the essential facts in connection with the proposed irrigation project. One hundred acres of land are to be irrigated by a pumping plant capable of delivering water at the rate of 1000 G.P.M. into a ditch 50 feet above low water. Electric power can be obtained from the power plant of the city of Kamloops, situated about 6500 feet away and on the opposite side of the river.\n\nIn preparing the design submitted, the effort has been to provide, at a reasonable cost, an installation of standard pumping machinery of the required capacity which will operate reliably under the local conditions. In this, we have been guided by the actual performance of a plant of similar capacity which was installed last spring just across the river from the proposed location of the present plant and operated under similar conditions.\n\nIn order to have a cheap and simple installation, the pump and motor are to be set above high water, where they can be mounted on an ordinary concrete block foundation, without danger of being injured by the water. With this type of installation, the suction head should be kept as low as possible and in any event should not exceed 25 feet.\n\nGauge readings have been kept on the Thompson river at Kamloops by the B.C. Hydrometric Survey since the spring of 1911. The highest water for the different years was as follows:\n\n| Year | Gauge Height |\n|------|--------------|\n| 1911 | 14.8         |\n| 1912 | 12.8         |\n| 1913 | 14.6         |\n| 1914 | 12.0         |\n| 1915 | 10.2         |\n| 1916 | 13.9         |\n| 1917 | 14.4         |\nThe highest water for the last seven years was 14.8 feet.\n\nThe elevation of the pump foundation for the plant on the Vic Ranch on the south side of the river is 16 feet, and of the bottom of the lower chord of the new C.N.Railway bridge is 21 feet. We have decided to adopt 18 feet, which is 3 feet above the highest water for the last 7 years, but below the level of the 1894 flood. If another exceptionally high flood should come some year, the motor can be removed for the few days of extreme high water.\n\nThe ordinary height of the water during the irrigation season is from 2 to 12 feet on the gauge, so that the suction lift of the pump will vary from 16 to 6 feet. Very little water would be pumped at the 16 foot lift.\n\nThe elevation of the outlet of the discharge pipe is to be 30 feet above the centre of the pump. The total vertical lift, therefore, would be from 36 to 48 feet.\n\nThe discharge pipe will be about 350 feet long and most of it will be 8 inch wood stave pipe. The suction pipe will be 25 feet long and will be 8 inch steel pipe. The discharge of the pump at a total head of 50 feet is to be 1000 G.P.M. Under these conditions the friction head would be about 14 feet.\n\nThe total head to be pumped against, therefore, will ordinarily be somewhere between 50 and 62 feet, with short periods in which the limits may be passed in either direction.\n\nIn such an installation as the one proposed, some method must be provided for priming the pump, since a centrifugal pump will not pump air. The method proposed is to use a foot valve on the lower end of the suction pipe, with a hand force pump to fill the pipe. This is quite a simple and reliable method except that a foot valve may get out of order occasionally and provision must be made for cleaning it.\n\nIt is quite an advantage to have some method of preventing sticks and other foreign substances from entering the pump and from interfering with the proper action of the foot valve; but if an ordinary small mesh screen is used on a pipe set directly in the river, it is apt to become clogged with...\nweeds, leaves and small sticks. For these reasons it has been decided to dig a well and connect it with the river by a timber pipe about 2 feet square buried in a trench below the lowest water level for the irrigation season. The pump will take water from the well which will be kept at the level of the river by the flow through the timber pipe. A coarse screen of iron rods can be placed over the outer end of the timber pipe, and if necessary a fine screen on the lower end of the suction pipe below the foot valve. Then if anything interferes with the foot valve or fine screen, it is a comparatively simple matter to disconnect the lower part of the pipe and raise it up for examination and cleaning.\n\nThe well and trench must be dug and the timbering finished while the water in the river is low, preferably before the middle of April.\n\nThe pumping unit proposed consists of a 6 inch Centrifugal pump, capable of delivering 1000 U.S.gallons per minute against a head of 50 feet at 800 R.F.M., direct connected to a 25 H.P. 3 phase, 60 cycle, 220 volt, electric motor. This can be delivered from Vancouver within 3 weeks of the placing of the order.\n\nThis plant could supply 65 acre-feet of water in a month of 30 days, working 12 hours a day. This would be sufficient for 100 acres of land in the driest month.\n\nAt present prices, 6 inch steel pipe would cost at least $2.00 a foot, so that to provide steel pipe for the whole length of the 350-foot discharge pipe would cost $700.00 plus the freight from Vancouver.\n\nIt is proposed to use instead, 350 feet of 6 inch wood stave pipe, wire wound and asphalt coated. This pipe will be safe for pressures up to 75-foot head, and can be purchased at Vancouver for 52 cents a foot. It will not be buried, but will be placed on sills and not allowed to come in contact with the ground.\nUnder these conditions, it should last at least five years and probably ten years or more. Its first cost just about equals the interest for five years at 5% on the first cost of the steel pipe.\n\nEstimate of Cost.\n\nPump house and well\n\nConcrete foundation block\n2 yds. concrete at $10.00 20.00\n\nDirect-connected centrifugal pump and electric motor with starter 830.00\n\nHand force pump and 50 feet 1 inch galvanized iron pipe for priming centrifugal pump 30.00\n\nPump house 10 feet x 10 feet, frame 100.00\n\nTimber for lining well and box for trench to rise 5000 feet E.W. at $20.00 per ft. 100.00\n\nLabor for digging well and trench 50.00\n\nTotal for pump house and well $1130.00\n\nPipe Line.\n\n350 feet discharge pipe-6 inch wood stave pipe at $2.50 per foot (Vancouver) 182.00\n\n1 Cast Iron pipe reducer from 6 inch flange 0.1. pipe to 8 inch wood pipe 25.00\n\n20 feet-6 inch steel of 0.1. pipe at $1.50 30.00\n\n1-6 inch long radius elbow 10.00\n\n1-6 inch standard flanged gate valve 33.00\n\n2-8 inch Cast Iron elbows 30.00\n\n25 feet 8 inch steel pipe @ $2.00 foot 50.00\n\nPipe fitting and erecting about 100.00\n\nTotal for Pipe Line $460.00\nTransmission Line\n\n2 - 15 K.W.

This line is about 6000 feet long and cost $1300. to build. It was paid for by the owners of the ranch on the understanding that the city can take it over at cost when there are other plants to be served from it. Until the city does take over this line, some arrangement would have to be made with the owners.\n\nPossibly the city of Kamloops would supply the transformers, which would reduce the necessary expenditure by $500.00\n\nIn the whole season, probably 2 acre-feet of water would be required per acre. With an efficiency of 50% in the pump and 95% in the motor, the amount of power required per acre would be about 300 kilowatt hours. The rate quoted by the city\nis $0.15 per kilowatt hour, so that the cost for power would be about $4.50 per acre each season.\n\nThe cost of power for 100 acres of land on the Vic ranch last season at a somewhat lower head was $300.00 at the same rate for power.\n\nAn interest and depreciation charge of 15% on a plant cost of $2,500.00 would be $375.00, or $3.75 an acre if distributed over the whole 100 acres. This would give a total charge of $8.25 per acre, for power, interest and depreciation.\n\nIt is assumed that the ordinary attendance and maintenance would be looked after by the Industrial School in connection with the regular irrigation and farming operations. There might also be a rental charge for the use of the section of the transmission line from the power house to the Vic ranch until it is taken over by the city.\n\nThe design and estimates herewith submitted have been prepared by the engineers of the B.C.Hydrometric Survey under the direction of R.G.Swan, Chief Engineer.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nDivision Engineer\nB.C.Hydrometric Survey\n\nJ.F.Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report submitted by Mr. C.G.

A week's delay in getting started on it, however, was likely to cause some trouble, for the water in the river was rising and the ditch and well had not been completed. Considerable seeding had been done on the school farm and garden in anticipation of completion of the pumping system. This gave the farm a much more encouraging look than I had seen on any former visit.\n\nA.

On account of the short time allowed, it was necessary to submit our report without waiting to get a definite agreement from Mr. Dawson.\n\nWe find now that Mr. Dawson wants to charge a rental of One hundred dollars ($100.00) a year for the privilege of using his line. This rental charge is merely for the use of his transmission line which he will continue to use himself as well, and is quite distinct from the city's charge of $1 per kilowatt hour for power. In spite of the fact that you stated you would not be willing to pay more than $50.00 a year, he refuses to make any reduction in his original figures. The amount he asks seems rather high.\n\nFortunately, however, there is another way of transmitting the power. The first cost will not be very much more than the original plan, and it will not involve any annual rental. After a careful inspection, we have found that the present two-wire lighting circuit to the Industrial School is in good condition, and that by adding a third wire and building some 1700 feet of\nline, we will obtain a system which will be quite capable of transmitting the necessary current. This whole system will belong to the Department and will be almost entirely on the reserve.\n\nThe cost of the re-construction and extension work has been estimated very carefully, and it would be about three hundred dollars ($300.00) more than the original plan. This seems quite a reasonable capital expenditure to save an annual charge of $100.00 and if you consent, we will make this change in the transmission line plans. It will increase the total estimated cost for the plant from $2800.00 to $3100.00.\n\nI am sorry that this feature was not referred to more fully in our original report, but at that time we did not realize that Mr. Dawson would insist on such a high rental, and we did not know that the cost of re-constructing the present lighting system to the Industrial School would be so low, since previous estimates by the other engineers were much higher.\n\nI am enclosing a plan of the two transmission systems which will help to explain the general situation.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nDivision Engineer\n\nJ.F. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nI beg to enclose herewith a report from Mr. Cline, Divisional Engineer of the Hydrographic Department.\n\nIn submitting same I beg to say that we failed to make satisfactory arrangements with the proprietor of the farm directly opposite the Industrial School to transmit the current over his wire. On further investigation it was found that by adding another wire to our existing pole line, it would be capable of carrying the necessary current, thus eliminating an annual overhead charge of $100.00. The Engineer has decided to adopt the latter course, and install an independent line, with an extra cost of $300.00.\n\nAll the machinery is now on the ground and is being installed.\n\nSpecial report on work will follow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6450, file 882-9 part 1)\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nKAMLOOPS AGENCY\nMay 14, 1918.\n\nTo The Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Co., Kamloops, B.C.\n\nDATE | DETAIL | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n| Hot water range boiler supplied to Kamloops Industrial School | $34.90\n\nP.O.
