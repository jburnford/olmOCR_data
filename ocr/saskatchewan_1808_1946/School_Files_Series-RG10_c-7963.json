A competent teacher has been secured to begin duties after the summer holidays. This Department is allowing a tuition grant at the rate of $20.00 per capita, per annum, based on the average attendance as shown by returns which should be prepared by the teacher at the end of each quarter and forwarded by you for transmission to the Department.\n\nYou should, upon the occasion of your next visit to Moose Lake, encourage the Indian parents to take advantage of the facilities offered for the education of their children so that there will be a regular attendance of the children of school age. The teacher should include on the quarterly returns for submission to this Department only the names of Indian children. When forwarding these returns, please state the name of the Secretary-Treasurer of the school board to whom cheques in payment for the tuition grant should be sent. We have informed His Lordship of the tuition grant that will be allowed for the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

I do not know where His Lordship got this information or why he is so anxious to see the school in the matter. The school is in operation now and has been in operation for several years past. We have agreed to work in conjunction with the diocese if a qualified teacher is furnished but thus far they have not been able to recommend a teacher to us.\n\nWe are glad to note that your Department is prepared to make a tuition grant of $20.00 per capita per annum, based on the average attendance, for any Indian children that attend the school. It may be possible to secure the attendance of some children whose parents do not wish them to go to the residential Indian schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. R.

The appointment of the teacher is made by the provincial authorities, and this Department only allows a grant based on the average attendance. The question of placing any Indian children of school age in residential schools would receive favourable consideration if the present arrangements for the carrying on of the combined day school are unsatisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

R. A. HOEY, SUPT. OF WELFARE & TRAINING,\nTO RIGHT REV. W.W.H. THOMAS, D.D., BRANDON, MAN.\n\n- Original on No. 128-6-1 -\n\nRe Moose Lake Combined School.\n\nA return, giving the names of the Indian children only, should be forwarded at the end of December, March and June to Indian Agent Lovell. He will certify it and forward it to the Department. In the event of the 6 children attending we will allow an amount of $15.00 a teaching month toward the salary of the teacher.\n\nIN A LETTER TO MR. THOMAS LAMB, MOOSE LAKE, DATED JANUARY 7, 1941, MR. HOEY STATES AS FOLLOWS:\n\nMr. Lovell, in a letter to the Department dated October 18, 1940, intimated that in his judgment the Moose Lake School would be unable to accommodate any Indian pupils. Mr. Lovell adds: \"There will be over 50 half-breed children going to school, which will make it overcrowded without the attendance of any Indian children.\" In view of this information from the agent that the space available in the school was required for the accommodation and instruction of half-breed children, we decided to make a small grant of $15 a month to defray the instructional costs of 4 or 5 Indian pupils who might be enrolled at the school.\n\nNow that the attendance appears to be approximately 11, there is no reason why an adjustment of the grant cannot be made. You tell us in the last paragraph of your letter not to offer a white man 50\u00a2 a day and board himself. I must emphasize again that the teacher of this particular school is not employed by this Department, nor have we assumed any responsibility for his appointment or for his teaching services. We are simply paying a grant to defray the cost of a small number of Indian pupils who may attend the Moose Lake School. The instruction of so-called half-breed children is wholly and in a very absolute sense the responsibility of the Provincial Government.\nMemorandum:\n\nMISS DAVIS\n\nWhen the returns are received from the Moose Lake School please see official letters of November 28, 1940, before making any payment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nProvince of MANITOBA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFor Quarter Ended December 31st 1940\n\n| Name of Teacher | Name of School | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount due |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Arthur G.

I feel confident that I forwarded them to the Agent in The Pas as I always do. I quite remember spending a whole day making reports before leaving for my vacation, Vital Statistics, Provincial School reports\u2014monthly & annual\u2014and the Indian Dept report. They must have gone astray somewhere.\n\nHowever, I have made it out again in duplicate & am forwarding it, in the same mail as this, to the Agent in The Pas for his signature; so you should be receiving it in due time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPercy J.

I have a number of seats in the warehouse which I took over from the old Pas Day School, and after navigation opens I will send a few of them to Moose Lake to replace the broken ones down there.\n\nThis school is the best in the Agency.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

This arrangement is approved, and it is hoped that you will be able to provide for the necessary seats at the Moose Lake school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Mr. Waite.\n\nThere were 6 girls and 3 boys present. The school had been in operation for three weeks at the time of my visit, and was only getting nicely started.\n\nThe teacher asked me if the Department would pay him janitor's fees of $2.50 per month, as was paid previously; he also asks for ten pieces of lumber 1\" x 4\" x 10', which he will attach to the desks to make them movable to make room for the pupils when taking their physical exercise. He also requests metal 1 tim., and glass 2 panes size 20 x 30. The cost of the lumber and glass should not exceed $6.00. I beg to recommend that it be supplied.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Mr. Waite. It is noted that the Indian pupils are making progress in their studies.\n\nRegarding the payment of janitor's services, I beg to say that all this Department promised to provide was a tuition grant at the rate of $20 per capita per annum for the Indian children in attendance, payment of which is based on the average attendance as shown by returns which should be prepared by the teacher and forwarded through your office. Please state whether the provincial authorities contribute anything towards payment of janitor's services. I should also be pleased if you would state the number of white children, if any, enrolled.\n\nYou may purchase and have delivered the 10 pieces of lumber, 1\"x4\"x10', which the teacher requires to attach to the desks to make them movable and provide space for the pupils when taking their physical exercise. You may also purchase the putty required and 2 panes glass, 28 x 30\". We note that the cost will not exceed $6.00.

At times we have supplied glass for broken windows needing repair and we have always supplied the desks when they were needed, but as it was not our building I spent no more than necessary on it.\n\nThe building is in fair shape except for need of paint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

After you have had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the responsible parties, I shall be pleased to hear the decision arrived at regarding the carrying out of the painting of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I also saw one of the school trustees and he told me that there would be no trouble in getting the school fixed up next Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. W. G. Tweddell, Indian Agent at The Pas, forwarding an account from Mr. T. Lamb, of Moose Lake, Manitoba, for provisions and material supplied by him to Indians and half-breeds for painting and general repairing of the Moose Lake School.\n\nMr. Tweddell knows nothing of the arrangements, but in his letter to the latter Mr. Lamb stated that the Manitoba Government supplied paint, linseed oil, turpentine, and brushes. Presumably, the Department has some arrangement with the Manitoba Government concerning the management of and repairs to this school, and I shall be glad if the Department will furnish me with particulars of these arrangements, so that, in future, I may know how to act in such circumstances. The account that Mr. Lamb has forwarded amounts to $19.50 and this includes an item of $1.00 for the purchase of 10 lbs. of nails. In addition to this it appears that this merchant also supplied 2 gals. of oil and 1/2 gal. of paint that was short and 150 feet of 1/2\" V joint for flooring and repairing two closets. The charge for this is not stated, but Mr. Lamb wishes to recover it. Will the Department please inform me what disposition to make of these accounts and what instructions to give to the agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-114 Gem. of the 19th instant, relative to a communication which you received from the Indian Agent at The Pas enclosing a report covering the cost of provisions and material supplied by the teachers of the Moose Lake Combined White and Indian Day School to Indians and half-breeds for painting and making general repairs to the school building.\n\nIn this connection I have to refer you to your letter dated November 7th, 1928, forwarding the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton, in which he recommended that the school building be painted. This matter was taken up with the former Agent, Mr. Waddy, and he informed the Department that the building is owned by the Manitoba Government and that Government offered to supply the settlers of the Moose Lake district with enough paint to paint this building, on condition that the settlers do the work. It is thought that the account which you receive should be forwarded to the Provincial Department of Education Winnipeg. This Department also provides a tuition grant at the rate of $20 per capita per annum on the average attendance for the Indian children, and we are not responsible for any other costs in connection with the upkeep or running expenses of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Indians volunteered to do the work free, but asked me to request four windows 48 x 48, 20 lbs of 3\" nails and a small amount of grub for the work.\n\nPotatoes and garden seeds all planted and doing fine.\n\nThere is an island in Moose Lake on which there is some very good Spruce timber, and the Indians would like to dispose of it. It would be necessary to look the timber over before passing an opinion on the matter.\n\nTwo cases of destitution were visited, and Special Rations asked for.

Richardson, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nMr. Christianson's Report on Schools in The Pas Agency:\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honor to report that while in The Pas Agency recently, installing the new Acting Indian Agent there, I visited and inspected the Moose Lake Indian Day School and the McKay Indian Residential School.\n\nMOOSE LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL,\n\nThe building is just off the edge of the Reserve and is the property of the Provincial Government.\n\nAt the present time the school is being taught by Mr. F. Lumb. I am quite sure that this young man is very much interested in his work, and he has the proper qualifications, having had normal training as well as having previously taught at the Gordon's Residential School.\n\nThere are 25 children on the register, and on the day of my visit, which was very stormy, there were 17 present,\u201412 Indian and 4 Halfbreed children. I might say there is quite a Halfbreed settlement adjoining this Reserve. Grades I to IV are being taught at this school at the present time.\n\nThis being the first time I have visited this school I do not know what progress the children have made, but I am quite sure that the present teacher will meet with splendid results if he remains there.\n\nI do not know what the arrangement is between the Department and the Province of Manitoba, but as I have stated above\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA.\nMOOSE LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, (Cont'd).\u2014\n\nstated above, the building is owned by the Government and was no doubt built to enable the halfbreed children to get an education. However, I presume that at the time the building was erected, some agreement was entered into between the Manitoba Government and the Department of Indian Affairs. The building itself is in a fair state of repair, and last summer it was painted inside and out by the Indians and the trader who lives right near the school, the paint having been furnished by the Provincial Government. There were several panes of glass broken and the holes patched up. The desks were in very bad shape, but these could be fixed up with very little difficulty. However, a new stove is very urgently required in this school, the sides of the one now in use having caved in from long use and over-heating. The hinges are broken off the door, and it would be practically useless to repair this, as the front is also burnt out. It will be readily seen that it is very difficult to keep the building warm with a stove of this kind. Moreover, it is not safe to put on a very big fire. Not knowing what the arrangement is I cannot say whose place it is to furnish the stove, but in any event, the McLary's Camp Comfort Wood Burning Stove would meet their requirements satisfactorily.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is also not known who is responsible for the upkeep of the school. You will note that a stove is badly needed.

He is a qualified teacher and will, I think, obtain good results.\n\nThere are 11 Indian children attending, and I understand the Department pay $350.00 per annum towards the upkeep of the school. The children are arranged in grades from one to four, and appear fairly well along in their respective grades. Mr. Lumb, who was in charge of this school last year, did excellent work, and as a result, a big change is noticeable among the Indian children. Biscuits are supplied to the children for lunch.\n\nThe building is in need of some repair, but this, of course, rests with the Provincial authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

The teacher, the Rev. A. Scrase, spent $30.00 recently, out of his own funds to purchase lumber and material for desk and forms. He wrote to me to see if there was no way in getting a refund of this expenditure.\n\nI wrote to the Provincial Department of Education about the matter and they refused to do anything about the repairs, as they stated they paid part of the teacher's salary and it was the trustees duty to keep the building in repair. The school is in an unorganized territory and there does not seem to be any method of taxation arranged for school purposes, consequently there is no money available for repairs.\n\nThere are about 15 Indian children attending this school, a number of half-breeds and one or two white children. I am anxious to get the building repaired and keep it in repair, as the condition it is in now, is bound to affect the health of the Indian children. I would like to know what action I can take to get these repairs done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to repairs required at the Moose Lake School.\n\nThis building is not the property of this Department, and we are, therefore, not prepared to authorize any expenditure in repairing it.\n\nAs far as we know, the Moose Lake School is the property of the Provincial Department of Education, and possibly it would be advisable for you to again write them and inform them that, as the school is in unorganized territory, no method of taxation is arranged for school purposes and, therefore, there is no money available for repairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I am aware that this place is outside of Treaty limits, but it is one of those necessitous and somewhat exceptional cases which sometimes receive aid from the Department. For some years past the Indians at this point have been asking very earnestly that a school might be established, and the Missionary in charge, the Rev Mr Gaudin, has strongly supported the application. Desiring to have all possible information before taking action the Rev Mr McDougall was instructed to enquire and report the facts in the case. Early last summer he visited Nelson House, and as a result of his enquiries a qualified teacher was obtained and sent out. I trust that the Department will place this school on the list to receive the customary aid, and that instructions may be sent to the Commissioner to forward the blank forms and registers for the use of the teacher.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary\nOTTAWA, 13th November, 1899\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRev. Dr Sutherland's letter of the 10th instant herewith asks for a grant for school which has recently been established by the Methodist Missionary Society at Nelson House in the Territory of Keewatin. Nelson House is, as Dr Sutherland states, outside of treaty limits and no provision is made for a Methodist school at that place. The Census return for '98 shows that there are 115 Roman Catholic Indians in the neighborhood of Nelson River, the numbers of other denominations and pagans not being given.\n\nThe Church of England receives a grant of $200.00 for each of six schools in the Diocese of Wessex, which embraces the district around Hudson's Bay.\n\nThis is the first application that has been received from the Methodist Church for a school in this locality and the Department has no information as to the number of Indians claimed by them as being of their faith, nor of the number of children of school age.\n\nThe amount of the grant given day schools outside treaty limits is limited to $200.00\n\nI think the Department should be furnished with further information on the above points before it can fully consider this application.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant applying for a school recently established by your Society at Nelson House in the Territory of Keewatin; and in reply I am directed to say that it will not be possible to make any grant to this school this year, but your application will be submitted to the Minister when the estimates for next year are under consideration.\n\nI think it would be well for you to furnish the Department with more definite information as to the number of Indians belonging to the Methodist faith at that place and also the number of children who would be likely to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nRev. A Sutherland D.D.,\nToronto,\nOnt:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th ultimo, No. 191433, respecting the school recently established by the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church at Nelson House, I beg to say that in a letter received some time ago, from the Rev Mr Gaudin, missionary at Nelson house, he informs me that there are some 80 children of school age, and a host of little ones growing up; of these about 20 usually remain near enough to attend school a good deal of the time, and for the others at least something could be done during the summer.\" He further points out that if provision could be made at the Mission for from 10 to 20 of the children whose parents go to the woods during the autumn and winter, quite a large school could be maintained during the year.\n\nI cannot at the moment give the exact number of Indians connected with the Mission, but a number of years ago more than 300 had identified themselves with the Methodist Church, and there has been considerable increase since that time.\n\nI can readily see that there are difficulties in the way of securing a grant from the Department where application is made in the middle of the year; but I have understood that it is within the authority of the Department to meet special cases out of unexpended balances that have been voted by Parliament for the Indian work. The need of a school at Nelson House was so great that the Rev\nJohn McDougall, when visiting that point last summer, promised them a teacher without delay. If under these circumstances the Department can make a proportionate grant for the current year it will be much appreciated.\n\nIt might not be out of place to add that we are expending annually upon the Indian work over $42,000 in addition to what is received from the Indian Department, and about one-fourth of this amount is expended in the educational work.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMO.\n\nDepartment of the Interior,\nDominion Lands Office,\nOttawa,\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nThis grant cannot be authorized at present.\nPlease advise Mr. Sutherland.\n\nDeputy Sup't General.\n\n10th Jan., 1900.\nOTTAWA, 13th January 1900\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th ultimo in further reference to your application for a grant to the school recently established by your Society at Nelson House, in the District of Keewatin, I am directed to say that the Department regrets that a grant cannot be authorized for this school at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Sutherland D.D.,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto\nThe Minister of Interior,\n\nGovernment Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nWe have the honor to inform you that Mr. John Simmons, Inspector of Indian Agencies, has just visited us as a representative of the Government, bringing us the information that in the very near future we may expect an offer of treaty negotiations from the Government at Ottawa, and whereas we are given to understand that when such time of treaty shall be arrived into, one clause shall be educational, we as a band assembled in council deem it wisdom on our part to petition the Government through the Department of Interior with regard to the kind of school most suitable to the requirements and needs of our people.\n\nWe therefore advance the following reasons in favor of the establishment of a boarding school amongst us:\n\n1. The work done in the past in our day-schools has...\nbeen faithful. But in the face of the best efforts, the Day School has proven and continues to prove a most inefficient factor from an educational standpoint. The school has been centrally located but this is of very little real assistance. The dwellings are so scattered and scattered over so great an area that the nearest children can reach the school only with great difficulty and much hardship. Many days it is utterly impossible for them to reach school at all.\n\nII. The school cannot be kept open throughout the year. It is only in the winter months that school is at all possible. Small children are not to be allowed to cross the lake in bark canoes.\n\nIII. There is but a very small percentage of the children who are of school age who are here during the months that school is open. The fathers are all hunters; their hunting-grounds are many miles away and they take their entire families with them. To these children especially (over 125 children) the Boarding School will be a boon.\nWhen winter sets in the parents can change to their hunting-grounds leaving their children behind. When summer comes again the children and parents could once more be together for the holiday weeks.\n\nII. We would feel no necessity to call upon any other neighboring bands to furnish children since we can from our own families furnish at least one hundred school age.\n\nI. The Canadian Northern Railway is constructing a branch line from Edmonton to Fort Churchill. This survey line runs close to Nelson House. One is only about ten miles distant and the second is about forty. Indications at present point toward the use of the main line. When that road comes through the question of transport of supplies becomes a matter for easy settlement.\n\nThe above statement of our case we humbly present for your careful consideration making not when Treaty is entered into by the\nGovernment with us that no further provision be made for the education of our children through the day-school but that as soon as railway communications are opened up a Boarding School be established at this point for us.\n\nSigned on behalf of the members of the band by\n\nChief Joseph Hartie\n\nCouncilors\nMurdock Hartie\nPeter Moore\nOttawa, September 23, 1907.\n\nChief:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of letter of the 26th ult., signed by yourself and Councillors Murdock Hartie and Peter Moose, asking that when treaty is made with your band provision be made for the establishment of a boarding school in place of day schools, and in reply I beg to say that the same will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nChief Joseph Hartie,\nNelson House,\nKeeatin District.\nOttawa, September 23, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Chief and Councillors of the Nelson House band have written, asking that when treaty is made with them, provision should be made for the establishment of a boarding school there in lieu of day schools. They want this made one of the terms of the treaty. In all previous treaties the Crown simply agrees to maintain a school in each reserve set apart, whenever the Indians of the reserve shall desire it. This refers only to a day school. The Department has never yet admitted any obligation to provide boarding schools under treaty, and if an exception were made in favour of these Indians you may rest assured that all the other bands who have taken treaty would expect similar treatment.\n\nThere is considerable agitation for the extension of the boarding school system, and the assumption by the Department of the full cost of maintenance and management. It, therefore, rests with the Department to decide whether it should change the educational clause in the treaty or not. I went fully into the question of the extension of the boarding school in my memorandum of July 10, last, on Dr. Bryce's report of inspection of schools in Manitoba and the Northwest.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, ___________________________190____\n\nSee letter on 228487 re, need for new school building.\n\nEx'd\nSir,\n\nThe Methodist Church established their Mission at Nelson House in the year 1874 under the pastorate of the writer of this report. They have continued the work through 35 years at a cost of at least $1000.00 per year. They have therefore some right to ask for assistance when it is remembered that they must have spent $5000.00 to show their own good faith.\n\nThe Roman Catholics entered the field in the eighties but have not carried on a very vigorous or a continuous work and have paid little attention to School work. It seems only right however to mention the facts and state that they have a Church there and a considerable membership.\n\nThe population is about 400 and these may be divided in the proportion of one third Catholics to two thirds Methodist or say 150 of the former Church and 250 of the latter.\n\nThe child population numbers 235. Of these 122 are girls and 113 are boys. Admitting the two thirds ratio then the Methodist Church should claim at least 150 children.\n\nIt should be explained however that many of the Men of this Band are hunters who do not locate near the Mission or for that matter anywhere else. They are moving from one place to the other and are known as \"wood Indians\" men who live in tents and take their families with them and spend only a short time in summer at the H.B.Post or near one of the Mission stations. It is assumed that two thirds of the whole number are of this class and that would reduce the\nMethodist School going element to about fifty (50)\n\nIt is well known that the possible attendance is never the actual attendance and making allowance for those that are \"grown ups\" or who are the children of non-progressive parents not in sympathy with the Schools the Methodists should be able to command an average attendance of 25 or 30.\n\nThe situation of the Methodist Mission is favorable to attendance especially in winter as it is about midway between the \"Fort\" on the one side and the \"Ootawain\" on the other. In summer canoes must be used and the difficulty would increase but a considerable number tent on the hills near by so that a sufficient number of children would be always near, who could walk to School.\n\nThere are about 15 houses within a radius of three miles from the Mission and the locality is favorable for the erection of a School building.\n\nI am persuaded that the only kind of building that could be erected would be one of logs. Lumber cannot be freighted into the country. The expense would be so high that no one would recommend it. A few boards for floors and ceilings might be made by means of a whip saw. Logs might be procured at a distance of from 4 to 6 miles. Labor is cheap about one dollar a day being the rate of wages. If shingles were used they would have to be bought on Lake Winnipeg and moved down at great expense (9.00) per 100 lbs so that Mica Roofing would be best. Nails would also have to be bought in Selkirk and freighted down in the York boats of the H.B.Company.\n\nAs to the cost of building at Nelson House I think an approximation might be made as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Procuring Logs        | 100.00 |\n| Sawing Boards         | 100.00 |\n| Erecting Building     | 200.00 |\n| Doors windows nails   | 30.00  |\n| Mica roofing freight etc | 70.00 |\n| **Total**             | **500.00** |\nAs to the party to build the School\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company at Norway House Mr C.C.Sinclair might undertake the work. It is no reflection on the Methodist minister now in charge to say that he is inexperienced and not practical for he is quite young and this is his first charge.\n\nThe Rev Mr Ferrier might send in a man with skill enough to complete such a work but high wages would be charged and the Company is rather averse to strangers entering the best fur bearing part of their territory as it gives undue prominence to their business.\n\nI do not know any person at Nelson House whom I could recommend as a suitable builder but the Agent at Norway House could procure men and control the expense and this is probably the wise course to pursue. Let the Agent send reliable men down to put the building in shape for practical use.\n\nI would suggest in conclusion that the bark be removed from the logs and that the corners be dove-tailed.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Semmens\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nMr. Benson\n\nOttawa, 190\u2014\n\nI am somewhat doubtful as to\nthe advisability of erecting a school-house\nat Nelson House at an early date\nowing to the habits of the Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nRegarding the application for a new school building at Nelson House I beg to say that the Department considers that it would be premature to expend anything in putting up a school building there at present on account of the nomadic habits of the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th instant, #191433/1 intimating that the Department considers it would be premature to spend anything in putting up a school building at Nelson House on account of the nomadic habits of the Indians, I can only say that the reason which prevents the erection of a school house has equal force against the appointment of a teacher. We are quite aware of the nomadic habits of the Indians at Nelson House, and for this reason have repeatedly recommended the establishment of a Boarding School on a small scale where the children could be kept and taught during the time their parents are absent on hunting expeditions. Unless the Department can see its way to some arrangement of this kind, I fear that any attempt at school work at Nelson House will have to be abandoned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Butterland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in reference to the erection of a school building at Nelson House.\n\nIn reply I beg to remind you that the Department now pays a grant towards the salary of a teacher at this point and that the school has been in operation for some years. Before the territory in which this school is situated was taken into treaty the grant was only $200.00, but this has been increased to $300.00. The September quarter return has not yet come to hand, but when it does the salary will be paid at the rate of $300.00. It is only with reference to the erection of a permanent building at the present time that the Department is in doubt, and in the meantime it is presumed that the arrangement which has been in existence for some time past will be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

I note that the returns for the September Quarter have not yet come to hand, and I will write the missionary at once to have a duplicate sent forward. I will also ask the missionary to report again upon the actual facts in the case, with any suggestions he may have to offer for improving the attendance and making it more permanent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

By this you will see that the teacher is left alone on the reserve over half the time.\n\nSchool opened on Monday, January 20th, 1913.\n\nAttendance,- There are 45 pupils on the roll, 16 boys and 29 girls. The children live far from the school, attendance is very irregular, and everything but punctual. The children are all clean and well clothed.\n\nSchool is held in the church, which is far too large, requiring two stoves to make it comfortable. The school building is in bad repairs making it unfit for school purposes.\n\nProgress, all pupils are in standard 1, a few can add to a hundred, and the rest are at the A, B, C's, etc.\n\nFuel,- The Indians are very slow about getting wood, the teacher in years past has supplied over half the fuel required.

He also complains that the school house built here is too small and very cold, so that he has been using the kitchen of the mission house for a school room, and that now so many are coming that he has had to use the church as a school, but which is a very cold building and hard to heat.\n\nI am starting for Nelson House tomorrow, and I will thoroughly inspect the old building used as a school formerly, and report more fully on conditions there, and what is best to be done towards providing a new school which should be able to accommodate forty pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Report of Inspector J.

These articles should be purchased as cheaply as possible and, if they exceed in value the sum of $10.00, you should obtain competitive prices and purchase from the firm quoting you the lowest price.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure of the sum of $10.00 per month in the purchase of the supplies required for the mid-day meal. You should consult the teacher in regard to the supplies which she requires and a quantity to the extent of the above sum may be purchased each month.\n\nYou should forward properly certified vouchers from time to time covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the supplies for the mid-day meal, and properly certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded by you covering the cost of the utensils mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We are informing our Agent that we will allow Mr. Hutty salary at the rate of $6.00 per day for each day he teaches. The Department desires, however, that the services of a teacher be secured for this school at an early date.

MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDepartment of Indians Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI am writing your department on behalf of the Nelson House Band. They have taken up with me, asking me to communicate with you, the matter of a Boarding school at their reserve, for the children of that district instead of the day school as heretofore.\n\nThey think that a Boarding school would be in every way more satisfactory than the day school, because the Indians are away all winter trading and trapping and consequently their children are none of them able to attend the day school. So very few are available to attend the day school during the winter months that the expense of keeping the day school open is quite useless, whereas if a Boarding school were in operation all the children on the reserve and in the district could be at the boarding school and so receive a much needed education, all the year round.\n\nThis matter the Indians took up with the Rev. Arthur Baumer, when he was visiting the reserve this summer and meetings were called by the Indians to discuss the situation. The Indians voted unanimously in favor of a Boarding school, and to do away with the Day school. They are very anxious to have the school built at once, and to have it on their reserve in a place convenient to all. They realize the importance of having their children educated and find that the day school does not in any way supply the need. They want their children well educated so that they can go out and take their place earning a livelihood among the white people and become the best of citizens.\n\nAs to location of the school they wish that, if the matter is favorably considered by your department, the school shall be built at Beaver Dam, on the Burnt Wood River. This is the most advantageous point in all that country from many points of view. There is abundant fish all the year round and extensive hay lands, and is accessible to everybody.\n\nThis letter is written today at the request of representatives of the Nelson House Band, who are here present, in The Pas Today. They desire a reply as soon as possible and would like to have action taken at once with a view to having the school built at once if favorable to your department, which they sincerely hope it will be.\n\nThey discussed this proposition with Indian Agent Waddy on his recent visit to their reserve and requested his assistance, which he is very willing to give. The matter is being taken up with him today as well as with your department by this letter.\n\nAn early reply is requested and that your reply be addressed to Chief Patrick Constant, of The Pas Indian Reserve. This because of the distance away from here of the Nelson House Reserve, and the long time taken in getting mail to and from that place. He will act as a sort of attorney for them in this matter at their request and will know what to say and do in regard to the situation when you reply.\n\nKindly answer as soon as possibly and oblige,\n\nYours Very Sincerely Etc.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nAugust 4th 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Indians of the Nelson House Reserve have been asking for years for a school to be built there and operated under the auspices of the Methodist Church. Some of them are in town here now and have been in touch with the local Indians and they are writing you a letter which I enclose herewith.\n\nI have not seen the letter but have a fair idea of some of the contents as they have been asking me questions every day for the past week. In order to give you an idea of the present standing of matters at Nelson House I enclose my office file regards what has been done lately.\n\nThis is a mixed-up business from the start, but last week I got at the real truth of why the Methodist Church people ask for a day school when the Indians require a boarding school. Mr. Barner told me then that Senator Lougheed when Minister told the Churches that the Department did not intend in future putting up small boarding schools which would become a liability on the funds of the churches or the Department, but that the outlay in small schools and the churches were not financially fixed to pay over charges above the grant. This is the first time I had even heard of such an agreement.\n\nIn 1919 and each year after that the Indians asked for a boarding school, but I knew the funds were low and kept the matter shelved for the time being. Last year matters came to a showdown, the Indians asked that the matter be sent to the Department for a decision, so I took the question up with Mr. Ferrier at Brandon to see how the Church stood. His answer is on my file.\n\nThe Indians want something and I have been careful to keep them friendly with the Church. They know that schools are being built elsewhere and I have told them that if they get the co-operation of the church that the Department listens to their recommendations.\n\nI firmly believe that the real solution of the school question there is a boarding school; if the time is not opportune a day school would do temporarily and any orphan could be sent to Brandon school.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 11, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nI have your No. 2827-143 of the 4th instant, enclosing a petition of the Nelson House Indian Band with reference to a boarding school to be conducted under Methodist auspices. You may inform Chief Pat. Constant and the Nelson House Indians that there are no funds available for the erection of a residential school at the present time. As you were informed in official letter of the 6th instant, the Department is considering the advisability of arranging for a day school building which will provide better educational facilities for the children at this point.\n\nI enclose the correspondence which was taken from your agency file.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nThe Pas., Man.\n\nAugust 16th, 1923\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose the return for the June quarter from the teacher of the day school at Nelson House Reserve, I just received the return.\n\nI did not have an opportunity to inspect the school at annuity payment time as the pupils had been having a holiday, but I inspected the work in the scribblers. There is not much to show for the time some of these pupils have been at school, as usual they attend very irregularly.\n\nI saw Rev. Mr. Barner a few days ago and he had in mind the building of a day school at this point, as the church building is not fitted up as a school room yet. The children live so far away from the Mission that a day school will never reach the whole population only a few near it families will get attention.\n\nI am in communication with Rev. Mr. Ferrier at Brandon regards request for the Indians for a boarding school talked about also last six years. He will probably see Rev. Mr. Rutty this week, and when things are in shape the Department will be advised as to what these gentlemen consider should be done; the present arrangement is not satisfactory, though as matters are at present it is better than not having any school as it does help a few families.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Miss D. Hall, the teacher of the Methodist Day School at Nelson House left for her home in Winnipeg some time ago and will not return to her duties on account of ill health. Her sister Miss J.E. Hall who holds a Manitoba professional certificate as teacher has gone in to Nelson House to teach the school noted. She informs me that Rev. T. Ferrier is recommending her appointment to the Department.\n\nMiss Hall states that her sister taught for some 18 days during the summer holidays when the Indians were all on the reserve and that her sister intended putting these days in on the December quarter; and that if the new appointment is approved she will be able to allow these days to be counted. As this might complicate matters the Department might consider allowing Miss D. Hall payment for month of October if she sends in school return for one month. She did not teach in October.\n\nThe month of November cannot be counted so the new teacher asks if she may be allowed to teach on any Saturday when the Indians are home and if any days are made up it be allowed as the month of July next, to allow for the ten months of the school year.\n\nThe young lady seems quite capable of doing the work required at Nelson House.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 14th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, informing the Department that Miss D. Hall, teacher of the Methodist Indian Day School at Nelson House, has given up her duties. While you have not stated the date she left Nelson House, it is presumed that it was at the end of September, as it is noted that she did not teach during October.\n\nThe appointment of her sister, Miss J. E. Hall, as teacher to succeed her is approved. We will allow her salary at the same rate as was paid Miss D. Hall. I may say that we cannot pay salary for any period in the school year exceeding 10 months, as the payment of all salaries is based on that length of service. I may say further as the cheques for salary for this school are forwarded to the treasurer of the Methodist Church they will, no doubt, arrange for the payment to Miss D. Hall and her salary for the yearly teaching period. When we receive the quarterly returns from Miss J. E. Hall covering the period she teaches to June 30th, next, consideration will be given to the amount of salary the Department will forward to the Church authorities.\n\nUnless the Indian children are perfectly willing to attend on Saturdays, the Department would not be favourably disposed to have the school open on that day. This matter, however, will be left with the teacher and yourself to arrange.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Maddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:\u2014\n\nIn reference to my letter of the 4th December last and answer #128-11-1 of the 14th December last regards teacher at Methodist Indian Day School & Nelson House reserve, I beg to state that Miss Hall has requested permission to keep the school open during July and August, and the Indians have promised to send the children to school. At this time of year the whole family are home from the hunting ground and the attendance will be good. I beg to recommend that the department agree to this arrangement.\n\nMy former letter stated that Miss D Hall had taught 18 days in summer of 1925 and that she wished this time allowed to her sister. There has been salary allowed in January, March and June quarters, and the Department can estimate the number of days Miss Hall will have to teach in July and August to complete the ten months work and advise me if they will allow her to get credit for the 18 days her sister taught school.\n\nI had no school work to inspect when at Nelson House as the people look upon this time as a holiday and carnival, however from the scribblers of the pupils etc I could see that the ones who attend school are advancing in their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the request of Miss J. E. Hall, teacher of the Nelson House Methodist Indian Day School, for permission to keep the school open during July and August, as the Indians are home from the hunting ground and the attendance will be good.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if Miss Hall keeps this school open during the present month, we will allow her payment for same. As you were informed in official letter of December 14th last, we cannot pay salary for any period in the school year exceeding ten months. Miss Dorothy Hall was allowed payment for the month of September, 1925, and Miss J. E. Hall has been paid for the period from November 1st to June 30th, making a total of nine months for which salary has been paid during the school year closed June 30th. We will allow Miss J. E. Hall payment for the current month, in order to complete eleven months in the school year. We prefer that this school remain closed during the regular summer holiday period, and the teacher should immediately close this school and arrange to reopen it on the 1st of September, next. Please arrange with her to forward a return showing the period taught by her during the current month, when a cheque in payment of one month's salary will be sent.\n\nI may state that all cheques for salary for this school are forwarded to the Treasurer of the Methodist Church, Toronto. The Treasurer has, no doubt, paid the Misses Hall their full yearly salaries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, requesting to be advised as to whether the authorities of the Church under whose auspices the Nelson House Methodist Indian Day School is conducted have a permanent teacher in view.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that as you were advised by official letter of December 14th, last, the Rev. T. Ferrier had arranged for Mrs. Hutty to carry on the work as teacher at this school until such time as he could obtain the services of a suitable teacher and we have received no further word from him in the matter, but are communicating with him today with a view to ascertaining when he will have another teacher, and to give the name, qualifications, etc., of the teacher whom he may nominate. When we have full information, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, January 26, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Waddy, The Pas, requesting to be advised if you have obtained the services of a permanent teacher for the Nelson House Methodist Indian Day School. Mr. Waddy states that Mrs. Hutty, who is at present carrying on the work, only took charge to help out temporarily, and until the services of a suitable teacher could be obtained. The Agent states that she has a family and house to look after.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed as to whether it is your intention to send in a permanent teacher to this point at an early date, or whether Mrs. Hutty will carry on for the balance of the present school year. If you have a teacher in view, I shall be pleased to have the name, qualifications and experience, and the date on which you expect the new teacher will be at Nelson House to take over the work from Mrs. Hutty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

T. Ferrier states that he has secured the services of Mr. Clay who taught at Island Lake, and who is now attending Wesley College, as teacher of this school. Mr. Clay cannot, however, proceed to Nelson House until college closes. In the meantime it is hoped that Mrs. Butty will be able to carry on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

(RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nThe Health Rules\n\nThe Fifth Rule\n\nBy Dr. J. L. BIGGAR\n\nMany people might think that there is no need for a Health Rule about playing. Most children do not need to be told to play. They do so instinctively and enthusiastically. Sometimes they do not want to do anything else.\n\nBut there is a need for the rule, because there are children who for one reason or another are not keen about playing and especially about playing in the open air. There are several things which may cause the development of the not-playing habit. An illness may begin it, or moving from one town or school to another so that one's old friends are lost, or new friends have to be made with strangers. Sometimes when a child has no brothers or sisters, he, or more often she, prefers to help with the work at home rather than to play with other boys and girls. But the most frequent cause is too great an interest in stories so that one exciting book after another is a great deal more attractive than playing in the open air.\n\nThese are only a few of the reasons why it was thought necessary to make a rule about playing outdoors. Too many boys and girls do not get the open air exercise that they should have if they are to grow up strong and healthy. Too many grown-ups did not learn when they were young the very great importance of fresh air, sunshine and muscular activity. If they had, there would be more really strong and healthy people.\n\nIf I ask you your grandparents what was thought in their younger days about this matter, you would probably be surprised, because it is only comparatively recently that the importance of good habits in this respect has been fully realized. And the rather unfortunate thing is that just as this realization is becoming clearer all sorts of vehicles to save us from activity in the open air are becoming more and more popular. To-day nobody in the city walks if it can be avoided and even in the country people are beginning to think that children should be taken to school in cars or buses.\n\nYou may say, of course, that walking is not much of a play, and that it is a great deal nicer to go to school by street car or an automobile and save time and energy for playing. But, if you stop to think, you will see that \"playing\" is very hard to define and that almost everything including messages and chores, can be made into a game of some kind or another.\n\nNot long ago a man told this story: \"There were two old men,\" he said, \"both about eighty, both rather feeble and slow but not really incapacitated by their many years. Both of them had wooden sticks in their hands and both were taking long walks over grassy places. They were doing more or less the sort of thing and each seemed to be enjoying himself. One of them had a prong on the end of his stick and with this he was picking up scraps of paper and putting them into a bag he carried on his shoulder. The other had a metal piece at the end of his stick and with this he was hitting a ball. The same sun shone on both of them and when midday came both of them were very hungry and other plain food. One was the richest man in the world playing a game of golf and the other was a park-keeper earning his living by keeping the grounds tidy.\"\n\nThe Rule says to play \"in the open air every day.\" Thirty or forty years ago Mark Twain said that people were always talking about the weather but that no one had ever done anything about it. It is just as true to-day. All of us are inclined to be perpetually dissatisfied with it. Too hot, too cold, too dry or too wet, too still or too windy,\u2014always too something. Yet it is from the weather, which gives us the open air every day, that we gain our health and vigor. Fresh air and sunshine, rain and wind, cold and heat, are God's best gifts to man.\n\nThere is no stimulant to be compared with a bright frosty morning out-of-doors. Nothing has ever been found so beneficial for our well-being as sunshine. No effort brings so happy a reward as a walk in the open air with the wind and the snow and the rain. These are the things which send the blood racing through the veins, bringing colour to cheeks and sparkle to eyes, cleansing the bones with clean firm flesh, and freeing the mind of worry and depression. Truly the weather is nature's health giver.\n\nIn Canada we are among the most fortunate of nations. Our brilliant sunshine, our hot summers and the clear sparkling cold of our winters, our open spaces where the clean wind carries the tang of our forests and waters, the ice for skating, the forests for camping, the birds of the air and the beasts of the field for studying, the flowers for finding, the trees for knowing \u2014 truly ours is a glorious climate. And, properly dressed, it is never too cold nor too hot, too wet or too stormy to play, either at games or at work, in the open air every day and by so doing, to gain health and strength and energy and vigor and happiness.\nThe Story of Nehemiah Teaboy\n\nBy CHARLES CLAY\n\nThis is the story of Nehemiah Teaboy of Nelson House, Manitoba, as he told it to me the other day when I went up to visit him and his mother and to buy from them a pair of moccasins to replace my old and almost worn-out pair.\n\nI am an Indian boy. I was born thirteen winters ago in a rough log cabin that stood, along with several others, on the rocky shores of Round Lake near Kegewah Lake. It was from there, the winter rendezvous of several Indian families, that our fathers hunted and trapped.\n\nI belong to the Muskego tribe of the Cree Indians. My name is Nehemiah Teaboy and I like it very much. The first part is from the Bible, being the name of one of the books. My grandmother's sister named it out for me when I was born. There is a story about the second part of my name and I shall tell it to you.\n\nLong, long, long ago, when my father's father's father's father was a young man, there were no white men living in this part of the country. Of course, they had been to see my ancestors before that and to trade for the furs which they had caught, and my ancestors had travelled many days to see the strange white men, but the white men had not come to build dwellings and to live with them before. These white men came along with a trading company of men called the Hudson's Bay Company. They built big houses of logs and traded with the fur, tea, knick-knacks, guns, powder, cloth, and beads for the furs which my forefathers caught.\n\nIn summer my ancestors used to bring their dogs and all their belongings and pitch their wigwams near the Company's post; then in winter they travelled far away and trapped and hunted.\n\nNow, in those olden days, my great-great-grandfather's name was Kekanaskaskan, which means \"a quilt.\" The white men found this name so hard to say and to write that they changed it. My great-great-grandfather liked to drink the white men's new drink made of leaves called \"tea,\" so the white men of those days called him \"Teaboy.\"\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company still have a fur trading post and my people still trade their furs to them; but things are very different now than when my ancestral name was Kekanaskaskan. Instead of old-fashioned guns, bullets and powder and shot, we have modern highpower rifles; instead of using the light of fires to see by at night, we have candles and lamps; instead of birch bark canoes, we use canoes made in a far-off factory; instead of dressing in rabbit skins in wintertime, we use woollen clothes. My people have been taken under the care of the white man's government and we have a Reserve where we can build houses. There is a church and also a school. If my great-great-grandfather saw all these things now he would be very surprised.\n\nOur Reserve is around a large lake called Waskewasko which is away in the northern part of Manitoba. About 140 miles away is the nearest station of the new Hudson's Bay Railway. In the summertime we often go down there to see the trains and other strange sights of the white man.\n\nWhen I first saw a train I was very afraid of it and ran away as fast as I could go; but when I saw that the eskototapanask didn't chase me and that the other boys and girls didn't run, I soon came back and was no longer afraid. We call the train eskototapanask, which means \"fire-toboggan.\"\n\nIn summer, most of the Indians of this band come and live on the Reserve. Some of them have houses; others live in wigwams. The Hudson's Bay Company's fur trading post is at the Reserve as well as the church and the school. The nearest Reserve to us is over a hundred miles away and when we go there, as well as to the \"city,\" we have to go by canoe in summer and dog-sled in winter. There are no permanent camps along the way.\n\nIn winter, nearly all the men of this band go away to hunt and trap. Sometimes the women and children live on the Reserve, but that is not often; generally, the men take their families with them. This winter my father and one of my big brothers went away into the far north to trap the white fox. They went away by dogteams and left here last November. The white foxes live just on the edge of the Barren Lands about thirty miles north of here. Father and brother intended to build a shack just where the timber stops growing, for there are no trees on the Barren Lands. From this shack they will go out with two traps lines with about eighty traps in each. They took enough flour and tea and land clothes and ammunition last there. There are many white foxes in parts of the country which they can kill for meat. It is now the beginning of April and we have had no word from them. Father said they would be back after the first of May or month or sooner, so we expect them any time. I hope they have killed lots of foxes for there are many nice things at the Company's post that we would like to have.\n\nMy other big brother and his wife and my mother and we smaller children have lived all winter in our house on the lake which is about a mile from the school and four miles from the Company's post. Brother is feeding us until father comes back; then father will look after all of us again.\n\nBrother whose name is Moses has a trapping up the river and around some other little lakes. I go with him when he looks at his traps. He drives a team of five dogs. I run ahead of the dogs so they will pull better. Sometimes.\nwe are away for two or three weeks. We take our blankets and grub and canoes and live out in the open. We dress in moose-hide moccasins and mitts. They have many pretty beads on them. I have a moose-hide coat, too, with beads on it; it is a caribou-skin made of a caribou-skin with the hair left on. These coats are short so we can run. They have hoods on them to keep our heads and faces warm and to keep the snow from falling down our necks when we make a camp in the bush. The women make the moccasins and mitts and coats for us. Next winter I am going to have a pair of moose-skin trousers, too; I have to shoot the moose first.\n\nThere are seventy-five traps in my brother's trapline. We have caught several foxes, some mink, many weasels, just three otters, four lynx, and have snared three lynx. We use brass-wire snares for the lynx and not traps. I like to be with my brother looking at the traps. It is hard work sometimes but I don't mind the work. Often I drive the dogs while my brother is forerunner. Soon we will be lifting all our traps up.\n\nThis winter I went to school only a little while. I would rather work than go to school. It is all right for my little brothers and sisters to go to school but not for a man like me.\n\nThere are still no signs of springing, though it does get mild about noon on calm days. The ice on the lakes will last for another month or more, but on the rivers it will break up sooner. To-morrow, Moses and I are going out to set our traps and bring them in. By that time father and Jeremiah will be back from the north. Then we will all go away for the spring rat-hunt. Mother and my little brothers and sisters will stay here too. They will be glad to have a holiday for they have gone to school nearly every school day this winter.\n\nWe will put all our things on our two jumpers and go over to Waskwawin Lake. That is about a three days' journey from here. We will only have to sleep three times. Amos Moose and his family are going with us. It will not take us long to pack up. We will take enough flour and tea and lard to last until the ice goes out. We will not use toboggans to go with, but jumpers. Toboggans are like flat turned-up boards, but jumpers have two runners. We use jumpers in the spring because the snow in the bush melts long before the ice on the lakes and rivers. This water runs down on to the ice of the rivers and lakes. Sometimes it is a week or more before the water has run through the cracks and the ice has left it free, and we may have to travel through four or five inches of slush. The runners on the jumpers keep things from getting wet.\n\nWhen we go on the rat-hunt we will lash our canoes on to the jumpers because we will not return until open water and we will need them to come back with. We will put what we are taking with us, blankets, canvas covers, pots, pans, pails, traps, rifles, food, and clothes, into the canoes.\n\nWe are not taking any meat along except we may kill a moose or two and we like to eat the muskrats after we skin them. They are good.\n\nWhen we get there we will make a camp. We will not make a house, only some pole tepees, and we will live in them. We make a tepee, or wigwam, by standing poles up in a circle about ten feet across. The tops of these poles meet and interlock. We cover them inside with pieces of canvas, birch bark, and spruce bark. This bark is easy to peel off in the spring months.\n\nAt first we will have to trap the rats through the ice; but it will soon be broken up and the ice melts in the shallow swamps where some of them build their houses. The rats like to swim in the creeks and these open up when the river breaks its banks. We set our traps along these little streams and this is how we do it. Rats like to eat bark from poplar saplings. We cut a sapling and place it along the slope bank of a stream as if it had drifted there and stuck. To the sapling we fasten the trap. Then we set it under the water at the most likely point where the rats will climb up. When he gets caught he tries to swim away and drowns. My father and Jeremiah and Moses and I should get about two hundred rats. We have to go about a dollar and a quarter apiece for them, but that we can never tell; sometimes they sell for a lot and other times they don't.\n\nNow I must run along. Mat- thias is going to kill two muskies yesterday and he is having a feast this afternoon and a dance this evening. Moses and I are going over to his place.\n\nAnd that is the story of Nehemiah. (He said as he told it to me the other day, when I went up to visit him and his mother and to buy from them a pair of moccasins to replace my old and almost worn-out pair.)\nBetty in Dreamland\n\nFantasy by GWENDOLINE READ\n\nPublished by the Forestry Branch, Department of the Interior, Canada.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nSpirits of the Trees\nBetty, schoolgirl\nSugar Maple\nMiss Maxwell, schoolmistress\nDouglas Fir\nThe Stove\nWhite Pine\nThe Red Demon\nYellow Birch\n\nScene I\n\nA schoolroom. Table, chair, stove, door, window. Betty seated at the table with writing material, head leaning on her hand, staring disconsolately out of the window.\n\nBETTY.\u2014It is awful to be a girl! To have to go to school! And worse than awful to have to stay in, on a glorious day like this, when there's a puff of the breeze is an invitation to run out and play. Here I am, cooped up in this dingy hole, and expected to write an essay on trees. I am sure it would do me far more good to be playing outside, studying Nature than way that having to write about trees about it, and guessing it. Who cares how long a silly tree lives, or whether its leaves are pointed or round? After all its main use in life is to burn well or build well.\n\n(Yawning) Oh dear me! I do feel very sleepy. Well, I suppose I must make a start sometime.\n\n(Throws up pencil, stares at exercise book, then gradually her head nods and she lays it on her arms on the table.)\n\nCurtain\n\nScene II\n\nSame schoolroom with the spirits of the trees standing artistically arranged, and the stove. Betty asleep at the table. Waking, looks wonderingly at each, rubs her eyes.\n\nBETTY.\u2014When on earth are you funny little creatures?\n\n(Walking round each, inspecting each in turn)\n\nSome of you are quite pretty. I am sure you cannot be mortals, so you must be fairies or brownies. Why, yes! I do believe you are the real brownies from the woods (clapping her hands) oh! oh! How perfectly lovely!\n\nYELLOW BIRCH.\u2014No, Betty, we are not brownies, but very old friends of yours. You may not recognize us, as we are at present. I am the spirit of the Yellow Birch, from which the desk is made; The White Pine, table (indicating each in turn), from whose wood the desk is made; White Pine, which provides the wood for the door, and White Spruce, the wainscoting and the paper on which you write. The stove you, of course, recognize, and dear me, I was nearly forgetting the Douglas Fir.\n\nDOUGLAS FIR.\u2014(Complainingly and very crossly.) Yes, indeed! and we have really come to tell Betty what we think of her! Silly trees, indeed! (turning to Betty) I wonder where you'd be if you hadn't a shelter to keep the cold and the draughts out. I have come all the way from British Columbia, through 250 miles of dignity, going through dreadful things, too. Being cut off in my youth, dragged and planed\u2014\n\nSUGAR MAPLE.\u2014(Turning to Betty in apologetic way) Don't take any notice of him, Betty. Douglas Fir always did have a lot to say\u2014though there aren't many people who can keep even him quiet.\n\nBETTY.\u2014And who is that?\n\nSUGAR MAPLE.\u2014The Red Demon! (They all shudder and look alarmed.)\n\nBETTY.\u2014What is the matter with all of you? Why do you look so terrified?\n\nDOUGLAS FIR.\u2014If hundreds and hundreds of your family had been devoured as mine have been, you would shudder. It is often mortals like you that let this demon loose.\n\nBETTY.\u2014Yes, yes! but tell me who he is. Is he an evil spirit? He sounds dreadful!\n\nTHE STOVE.\u2014I am not afraid of him, he feeds me every day\u2014though it's true I do get very red at times in my attempt to control him, and he caused this crack in my side (showing the crack).\n\nBETTY.\u2014(Stamping her foot) I'll hang all your silly heads together soon, if you will go on talking in riddles. WHO IS THE RED DEMON?\n\nALL TOGETHER.\u2014FIRE!\n\nBETTY.\u2014Well, I do believe what you are making such a fuss about. Like all hot-tempered people you have to handle him with care. Very little will start him and cause a lot of trouble. Again, like one's temper, if you let it run on there is no knowing where the fire will end. So let us change the subject. Tell me about yourselves. You see, I have been kept in to write an essay on Canadian trees, so you quaint little people can help me a lot. Sugar Maple, you are so pretty that I am sure you must be in great demand.\n\nSUGAR MAPLE.\u2014(With much hauteur) I suppose I am the most distinguished\u2014\n\nDOUGLAS FIR.\u2014(Interrupting) Nonsense! (Turning to Betty) Sugar Maple is as full of airs! You ought to go to British Columbia and we'd\u2014YOU!\n\nBETTY.\u2014Oh, Douglas Fir, please stop being so arrogant, and let us hear what Sugar Maple has to say. Of course, we all know \"The Maple Leaf\" gives him a special right to be proud, being Canada's emblem and therefore his leaf is the emblem. Indeed, I should be proud of it myself.\n\nSUGAR MAPLE.\u2014We are also proud of the beautiful bird's-eye wood, which is so much sought after for special pieces of furniture\u2014and then, of course, we also supply sugar. Unfortunately, insects are a great plague, and if only mortals...\nsit on my arms here and whisper into my knotty ears and we could exchange many a secret. I know more about the world by standing still and listening to the birds than you do or could if you had twenty foolish legs to hustle you about.\n\n\"Would you believe it, last week some Cedar Birds (perhaps you call them Cherry Birds) were eating my berries while singing of the some coming to theirs from Northern Canada, and they made me their common tree! Yes sir, I was the general headquarters. The two flocks mixed together, and such a lisping and chattering!\n\n\"Bohemians were telling Cherry Birds all about the new north, and how Canada is becoming peopled far away where your legs could never carry you without help. And they said that Northern Ontario which, not so long ago, was forest, is now becoming mining and farm lands.\n\n\"One slender limb Cedars were telling Bohemians all about some terrible floods on the Mississippi River, down where Bohemians seldom go, and of floating barns and swimming people, and of water rushing down and covering the land. They were most astonished to see rivers going so wild, but all the rivers will go wild in spring when the snow melts, and dry up as dry as a bone in summer, if men with two legs and no sense go on cutting down all the trees, for trees hold back the water in spring and let it out of the ground gradually all summer.\n\n\"Oh, I heard many things they said, but what I liked best of all was what they said about me. They liked me very much; they enjoyed my berries, and made me so happy I want to sing. Listen, and I will hold my leaves in the wind and sing you a song\":\n\nSONG OF THE MOUNTAIN ASH\n\nOh, I am a fruiting-gay fountain,\nSpray-drooping my clusters of red,\nOh, I am the Ash of the Mountain,\nWho heard what the Cherry Bird said:\nHe said, \"Oh what lovely, ripe berries!\"\nAs jowlyly weeped:\n\"They're juicy and better than cherries,\nI'll eat a few, saving the rest.\"\nHe told the Bohemian Warzing,\nHis name Canadian bird,\nAnd when they came unexpectedly lisping,\nI listened and caught every word:\nThey said, \"Here's a tree like a fountain,\nWith drops of a fay-frozen dew;\nHurray for the Ash of the Mountain!\"\nThen admiringly they flew.\n\n\u2014WALLACE HAVELOCK ROBB.\n\nAutumn Poetry\n\nThere is one song of autumn that has become a sort of birthright of every Canadian. It is \"The Passing of Autumn,\" by Archibald Lampman. No poem is so often or so lovingly quoted at this time of year.\n\nThe wizard has woven his ancient scheme\nA day and a starlit night,\nAnd the world is a shadowy, pencilled dream\nOf color, haze and light.\nLike something an angel wrought, maybe,\nTo answer a fairy's whim,\nA fold of an ancient tapestry.\nA phantom, rare and dim.\nSilent and smooth as the crystal stone\nThe river lies serene,\nAnd the fading hills are a jewelled throne\nFor the Fall and the Mist, his Queen.\nSlim as out of aerial seas\nThe elms and poplars fair\nFloat like the dainty spirits of trees,\nIn the mellow, dreamlike air.\nSlivery-soft by the forest side\u2014\nWine-red, yellow, rose\u2014\nThe wizard of Autumn, faint, blue-eyed\u2014\nSwinging his censer, goes,\n\nThere are many other autumn songs by Canadians, that lovely one by Wilfrid Campbell, for instance\u2014\n\nAlong the line of smoky hills\nThe crimson forest stands,\nAnd all the day the blue-jay calls\nThroughout the autumn lands.\nNow by the brook the maple leans,\nWith all his glory spread,\nAnd all the marshes on the hill\nHave turned their green to red.\nNow by great marshes wrapt in mist,\nOr past some river's mouth,\nThroughout the long, still autumn day\nWild birds are flying south.\n\nThe End of Summer\n\n\"When poppies in the garden bleed,\nAnd coreopsis goes to seed,\nAnd pansies, blossoming past their prime,\nGrow small and smaller all the time;\nWhen on the mown fields hot and dry,\nBrown dust from thistle to thistle flies,\nAnd smoke from forest fires at noon\nCan make the sun appear the moon;\nWhen apple seeds, all white before,\nBegin to darken in the core,\nI know that summer, scarcely here,\nIs gone until another year.\"\n\n\u2014Edna St. Vincent Millay.\nIT WAS a bright, warm, Saturday afternoon in early September when Zechariah Loonfoot, my young Indian friend, and I strode through the bush along the path that led from the Mission buildings to a bit of sandy beach about a half-mile up the lake shore. Had we followed the trail, we should have been a half-hour scrambling over great rocks and skirting deep bays; the path, though in a few places a little muskeggy, was much shorter and easier. In minutes we pushed past the fringe of willows on the edge of the forest-growth and came out on the beach. Fifty yards on each side of us the wind swept the break-end, and the shore continued as steep, rocky ledges, sometimes shelving and sometimes dropping sharply into the lake. From the water to the trees the yellow sand could have been paced in a score of long steps.\n\nA breeze blowing off the lake soon dispersed the swarm of mosquitoes that had gathered there that followed us out of the bush.\n\nAs usual, when Zechariah was around the Mission and we were able to slip away without the smaller children following us, we hurried off with our clothes as a race for first into the water; and as usual, Zechariah, who wore only a shirt, a pair of pants, and moccasins, and what were once socks, was splashing and blowing before I rushed into the cold, crystal-clear lake.\n\nEven in the hot summer days we had been glad to get out of the water; it was so cold; and so it was that soon we were sprawled full-length on the sand, Zechariah's dark-brown skin glistening in the dazzling rays of the low September sun.\n\nOurs was a strange companionship. I was the teacher of the school on the Reserve which was in fact the Mission, and Zechariah was a young Cree Indian lad about sixteen years old. He could speak and understand a little English, and I could speak and understand a little of his native language. Sometimes I would try to tell him about the great outside world which he had never seen; about the roads and trains, and large boats, and high build- ings, and bridges, and other man-made wonders; while he, in his turn, would try to tell me about his life and the things he had done.\n\nThat Saturday afternoon, in early September, I was the first to break our silence.\n\n\"You are going away soon, Zechariah?\" I asked him in his language.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered in English, clipping the word off short, as was his habit.\n\nWe lapsed back into silence. In a few minutes I asked again:\n\n\"Where are you going to trap this winter?\"\n\n\"Kesatinew Sani?\" he replied this time in Cree.\n\n\"Old Man River, eh?\" I returned, to make sure I understood him.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" he grunted, as he gazed out over the lake with his sombre, black eyes.\n\n\"When are you leaving?\" I questioned, after another short silence.\n\n\"Maybe next week;\" this time he spoke in English.\n\nSilence dropped between us once more.\n\n\"How do you go from here?\"\n\nZechariah made no move to answer my question, but I understood him and waited; I knew that when he became impatient he often shut up into impenetrables. I lay still on my stomach, and, chin cupped in my hands, idly watched the tiny waves breaking, one following the other, on the rippling sand.\n\nSuddenly he stirred himself, reached for a bit of stick that lay near by, and began to smooth out the sand that was between him and me. I sensed a story.\n\n\"It's like this,\" he commenced; and here I set down for you just what he told me, partly in English and partly in Cree:\n\n\"That is Forgetful Lake,\" he made a little circle in the smoothed area of sand, \"and this is where the Mission is;\" he stuck a bit of twig on the shore of his round of Forgetful Lake, \"the directions will be the same as Nature.\"\n\n\"You know how every fall most of my people leave the river and move away to trap through the long winter. Summer is over and some of them have already gone. There are not many fur-bearing animals near the Reserve; they have been killed off or frightened away, so we have to scatter over the country in order to get enough to make a living. Several families will together and build shacks on the bank of a lake or river. They may travel a week, or even two weeks, from the Reserve before they make their camps. In these camps or camps they will live all winter, and from them the men will set out their trappings.\n\n\"I think my father has decided to leave maybe next week. There are about twenty of us going up to Old Man River. We shall make a camp together. There are my...\"\nfather, and mother and my two sisters, and my young brother and myself; there are my maiden brother and his wife, and family of four; there are my father's brother and his wife; there are my mother's sister's husband and family, of six children; that's twenty-eight of us,\" he counted them off on his fingers.\n\n\"It will take four eighteen-foot canoes to carry us and our things, for we shall take all the things from our homes except the hand-made beds and tables and chairs, and the stoves. We will not need the furniture in our camp, and we will make firesides instead of carrying stoves. We shall have to take with us all our bed-clothes, our pots and pans and pails, our axes and guns and traps, our clothes and food. We shall last until Christmas or longer, lard and tea and sugar and jam and baking-powder, cartridges for the guns, fish-nets, and odds and ends. We shall have to put in the canoes too, for our dogs and their harness and the toboggans; we shall need them for winter travel.\n\n\"When we leave here we shall go up the Rat River,\" said he marked on his sand map with his stick the course of the Rat River, which empties into Footprint Lake on the west. \"Although this river flows from the northeast, and where we are going is on Old Man River is northeast of here\u2014this roundabout way is the best canoe route. We have about 350 miles to go and if we are not held up by heavy fall winds or rains we should make it in a little over two weeks. We go up the Rat River to its head. There are twenty-three portages around rapids, but they are mostly short ones.\n\n\"Along the Rat River there are several lakes. Here is Swan Lake,\" and he drew on the sand a small circle a short distance up the river. \"The next lake is Pemachikamaw, and it was put on the sand map.\n\n\"What does Pemachikamaw mean?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"It is Cree for Grass Lake,\" Zechariah answered. \"It is a long, narrow lake lying at right-angles to the river. We cross over it about the centre. Between Cross Lake and Swan Lake the country is very rough and there are many falls and rapids while we shall have to go around. They make new roads. When we come to a portage we all have to get out and everything must be carried over it. The women and children all help. When the canoe is across we have to put the canoe in the water again and reload it.\n\n\"Portaging is hard work. We use pack-straps. They are long leather straps fastened to a wide head-piece of leather. The straps are tied around the ends of a box or something, leaving a loop with\n\n\"When everything is across we have to put the canoe in the water again and reload it.\"\n\nthe head-piece in the centre of it. Then this head-piece goes across the forehead and the box rests on the back. The rear end of the load is placed on top. We usually carry from two to three hundred pounds, but I have seen men trot over a portage with 400 pounds. The women and children carry the awkward things across the portages, such as paddles, oars, loose blankets and small articles. If it is a long portage, oars are fastened to the thwarts, the distance and one man carries it over, but on a short portage two men take it, one at each end, and jog over with it. An eighteen-foot canoe weighs about 170 pounds, but they are very awkward and bump into the trees.\n\n\"At night we shall make camp wherever we happen to be. If it rains, we shall make shelters out of canvas covers. Our beds will be our blankets laid on a mattress of spruce-boughs on the ground. Our camp fire will give us heat and light. Each night we camp we shall have to set a net to get fish for the dogs and for ourselves. We shall lift it each morning and take it with us.\n\n\"Other lakes on the Rat River are called 'Footprint Lake,' Notigi Lake and Karsakuwikamak Lake,\" and he marked them down on his sand map. \"Wuchusk means 'rat' and the lake is so named because its shores are low and muskrats build their houses there. Notigi means 'old-wife.' Long, long ago, when my father's father was a little boy, an old woman stood on this camp on the shores of this lake. She was never found, because a spirit took her away to keep his fire burning. Ever since the lake has been called Notigi Lake. 'Nenawitwik' means 'narrow.' This lake is long and narrow, and is but a widening of the river; hence the name.\n\n\"We go right along the Rat River until we come a little wind creek among some sand and stone hills. That is a height of land. We must then cross over a three-mile portage, and then go down, down, and go down it. That brings us to a large lake called Ithinwey, or Indian Lake, which is a part of the Churchill River.\" Indian Lake was named after the Indians, in a north and south direction. \"We go down this lake, keeping close to the shore. It is too big to go out in with our small canoes. We shall not make camp near the edge of this lake. It is joined to Sandy Lake by a short river which we go down.\" And Zechariah drew the lake and river, changing the course to run by east. On this river is Missi, or Big, Falls. It is only twenty feet high, but it is many hundred feet wide. It makes an awful noise. We go across Sandy Lake, and then to the Churchill River to where Old Man River empties into it. There are many portages along the Churchill River. Then we follow Old Man River and travel about a day and a half to where we are going to make our camp. That will be near a wide, shallow rapid where the fishing is good.\"\nZechariah completed his map by adding the Churchill River, running east and the Old Man River entering it from the north. Where the camp was to be he stuck another small twig.\n\n\"First, the men will build our winter homes. These will be square, log shacks, two of them. They will be about ten feet on a side. The roofs will be low and flat, made of poles covered with moss. There will be no windows, but the light will come in through a hole in the roof. These holes will be just over the heads of the fireplaces, which we shall make, one in each shack, of mud and stones and stones. The walls will be chinked with moss. The floors will be the ground covered with spruce boughs, and will be our beds, tables and chairs. The fireplaces will give us light at night.\n\n\"It will take them two or three days to build these houses. The women will set the nets just below the rapids and catch fish. We have many dogs and that will mean a great many fish during the winter months. We catch them in the fall and hang them up in racks. The days are cold enough to freeze them until they freeze solid. To hang them we use sticks about thirty inches long and about one inch thick. Ten fish are threaded through the tails on to each stick. These fish sticks are hung up in a rack out of reach of the dogs. Each dog needs a good-sized fish a day, so we shall have to kill about 5,000 fish. They are very plentiful there, and that will mean only a few days' work.\n\n\"Usually, as far north as that, about the middle of October the smaller lakes and rivers have frozen over and we can travel on them. But a lot of snow comes before the waters freeze solid. From our winter camp we shall set out our traplines. There will be four of them running out in different directions. We will average about 150 traps apiece, as well as snares and deadfalls. We don't know how long they will be yet; that depends on what the fur signs are like. Our traplines generally take a week or ten days to go out to the end of them. They keep us busy.\n\n\"There are many falls and rapids which we shall have to go around.\"\n\n\"We shall live in our shacks all winter. While the men hunt and trap, the women will tan the moose, dress the hides, make coats, pants, mitts and moccasins of them. We do not tan the other animals dry, but use them as stretchers. That will be part of the women's work, too. The animals we catch in our traps\u2014foxes, lynx, mink, martens, weasels, wolves, otters, die, and we skin and freeze stiff. We have to bring them to camp and thaw them out before the women can skin them and dry the pelts.\n\n\"Just before Christmas, my father and I plan to come back by dog-sleigh. We shall bring two teams and carry what fur we have killed. The winter route is across country. Zechariah drew almost a straight line from the camp to Footprint Lake\u2014and we can make it in about six days coming out. We shall stay for Christmas and take back with us supplies for the camp. The trip loaded, will take about nine days, as they are so short then and we cannot travel by night.\n\n\"We expect to come out for Easter time. Then my big brother and my uncle will come then. They will bring down fur and take back supplies. The days are getting shorter and the trip will be shorter and easier.\n\n\"In the spring, when many of the animals are past prime, the muskrat season begins. Old Man River is so far north that we can trap rats up there. Then we shall pack up our whole outfit and come back by the canoe route. We shall be here again around the end of June and shall fly all summer in our houses. Treaty time is about the middle of July, when we get our Five Dollars each and the twine for nets and the cartridges for guns.\n\n\"Before we leave it, we shall have danced and sung the summer away and it will be time to get ready to go north for winter trapping again.\"\n\nHis story came to an abrupt end. For several minutes we lay there; he, slowly erasing his sand map with deliberate strokes of his stick; I, watching his brown face with its fine features\u2014the flashing black eyes, the thin nose, square chin, small, generally silent mouth\u2014an Indian, I thought, a nomad of the North.\n\nAs yet I made no comments on what he had said; I had learned that silence was to him the best appreciation.\n\nSuddenly I became aware that a cool shadow was across me; the sun was sinking behind the trees.\n\n\"Time to go, Zechariah,\" I stirred.\n\nHe looked toward the sun.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in his precise way.\n\nWe hopped up, brushed off the saplings and were quickly dressed. A few minutes later we were padding our way along the bush trail in the direction of the Mission.\n\nNovember Eve\n\nBy REBECCA HELMAN\n\nThe sleet and snow raced with the rain,\nAnd clattered on the window pane;\nThe wind whirled by, the wind lay still,\nThe snow ran down from the farthest hill,\nAnd shook the boughs on the bare old trees,\nAnd bent the saplings to their knees.\n\nThe wind swooped down from a huge black cloud,\nAnd he laughed and sang and his voice was loud.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" cried he, \"turn on the light,\nFor you must stay indoors to-night,\nSo stir the fire and find a book!\"\nAnd he laughed and laughed till the windows shook!\nOttawa, July 13th, 1929.\n\nRev.

Don't be so slow!\"\nThe pumpkin eyes then twinkled \u2014\nThe lantern was aglow!\n\"The John Harpers, you mean? It is his way. We Indians have always lived in bands, and even when the white man's government made treaty with us we were given reserves to make our homes on. We do not mix our tribes much and thus there is a lot of close intermarriage. Some of the family names have been swallowed up. My people are fond of naming children after relatives and in this spirit will allow a child who has been named after some one who has done something big. Many years ago there was a man the white traders named John. This man travelled 260 miles across country in three days to carry news of a strange sickness and seek help for his people. So you see the standing of one of the family names and the fortune attached to 'John' caused five John Harpers here.\"\n\nI smiled inwardly at his naive explanation.\n\n\"You people like names from the Bible, don't they, Isaac?\" I asked, hoping to draw him out again.\n\n\"Yes, netotam, they are good names. My English name is Isaac. I like it. I like Indian names too. Kahasaskakannes means 'little quill.' I have four brothers and a sister, Laban, Joshua, David, Joseph, Solomon and Rebecca. They are good names also.\"\n\nWhen Isaac named his brothers and sister so, I recalled an incident of my first year's teaching among Indians. It was preparatory to the settlement. An old father had chosen, all in good faith, Beelzebub, as the name for his new son! It was only after much and long arguing that the father finally gave up the idea; he went home deciding to choose another name.\n\nThe day of the christening arrived, and little Macdonald was named Nochachadnezzar, for nothing would induce the father to change again!\n\n\"Have your brothers and sisters Indian names, too?\" I asked Isaac after some minutes silence.\n\n\"We all have Indian names,\" he answered shortly.\n\nI saw I had asked a tactless question. The old man was hurt. There was, I saw then, Indian pride in the older of the twins. Even if the white man could plant new names of his choosing on them, they could have their own names also.\n\n\"And these names, Isaac,\" I continued, \"in an effort to keep a warm atmosphere between us, how are they given?\"\n\n\"Sometimes they are the name of an illustrious ancestor. Sometimes they are given because of a place where one is born, such as Kecheesun, 'big rock.' Sometimes they are given because of something that happens the time of birth, such as Tawelwaim, 'thousand-moon.' These names sometimes change. You know David Spence? His name used to be Sokenep, 'loud-water.' But later someone was called by this name. Now we call him Maskwanapao, 'the bear-man.' It is sleep time.\"\n\nIsaac broke off his narrative with characteristic Indian abruptness. Fully aroused, he slipped between the folds of his rabbit-skin robe and cuddled up like a curled dog.\n\nMore leisurely, I pulled off my mocassin, unbuttoned them up in my coat for a pillow, crawled into my elderdown sleeping-bag, loosened my belt and braces, and stretched out with a contented sigh.\n\nThe stars overhead twinkled brightly. The Great Dipper was standing on its handle, the Three Moons Hunters were dropping behind the treeline. The Night that was near us was at peace. Isaac's heavy breathing indicated sleep. My last recollection was a dull pop of a cooling fire-brand. I fell asleep.\n\n---\n\n**Autumn Glory**\n\nAutumn mist on the hill tops  \nAutumn dew on the grass  \nOne little shimmering sunbeam  \nAlmost afraid to pass.\n\nAutumn chill in the breezes  \nAutumn clouds in the sky  \nWonderful, reddening autumn leaves  \nSummer's passed with a sigh!\n\n\u2014Freda West\n\n(Taken from the portfolio sent by the Westminster Bridge Road Improvement Committee to the \"Pierrot,\" Glace Bay, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.)\n\n---\n\nIn October\n\nNow come the rosy dogwoods,  \nThe golden tulip tree,  \nAnd the scarlet yellow maple,  \nTo make a day for me.\n\nThe ash trees on the ridges,  \nThe alders in the swamp,  \nPut on their red and purple,  \nTo join the Autumn pomp.\n\nThe maple tree has her crimson  \nAlong the pasture wall,  \nAnd all the bannered sumacs  \nHave heard the frosty call.\n\nWho then so dead to valor  \nAs not to raise a cheer,  \nWhen all the woods are marching  \nIn triumph of the year?\n\n\u2014Elise Carman.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6240, file 527-1, part 1)\nThe Adventures of Mostly Neck\n\nBy WALLACE HAVELOCK ROBB, OF ABBEY DAWN\n\nThis is a thrilling story, with photos, especially for the readers of \"The Canadian Red Cross Junior.\"\n\nTHIS is not a long story, but it is a happy one. \"Mostly Neck\" is the odd name we gave to a bird in our Sanctuary. And how do you suppose he got that name? Well, it is one of the nicest stories that could ever happen.\n\nI'll tell you about it.\n\n\"Mostly Neck\" was a sick, sad, sorry, and starving bird. He was a prisoner held by a cruel, hateful wife who fastened around his leg. And how he managed to break away from the mean and hard-hearted person who held him captive no one can say.\n\nAll I know is this: He had been found in a garden in Kingston, trying to catch a bug or two for breakfast, or a toad\u2014oh, the poor toad! I suppose he could swallow a toad, but toads are much like frogs, and these birds live on frogs and such like. Anyhow, there he was, standing among the stalky plants and trying to look as much like one as possible, for he is a Bittern.\n\nAround this poor, unfortunate Bittern had gathered a crowd. Everyone was afraid to go near him, for fear of his sharp beak. Very wise people I should say, for one jab of that swordlike beak would stab like a knife!\n\nSo the people craned their necks to see the bird at him, and he craned back at them and, I suppose, that is how it comes that these long legged and long necked birds are commonly called cranes. He has a very new thought for a silly and double reason. You see, he is a Bittern, and he lives among the reeds and rushes. Now, here's a strange thing: Mother Nature has made his tall stout body so he could not be so conspicuous, so easily seen, when in his home surroundings. But after she looked him over she saw how easily she could see him among the reeds. Mother Nature said something like this: \"Tut, tut! This will never do! You're still so fat and bulky that any stranger could pick you out and see you plainly. I shall have to paint you in long, straight lines. I'll make your feathers grow so that when you hear people or enemies coming, just crane and stretch as tall and thin as possible.\"\n\nAll the children wanted to see him, so they were permitted to view him at close range.\n\n\"Oh, look!\" said one, \"What a shame! Look, Mister, the wire is cutting his legs.\" So we gently removed it. Then another said, \"He's a crane, all right; I have seen ones like him in the marshes. His legs are the biggest part of him!\"\n\n\"Go on!\" countered another chap about twelve years old, still holding his little sister on his back so she could see better, \"Legs nothing! He's mostly neck!\" And when he swallows a frog it has a long way to drop it.\n\nEveryone laughed with glee and glee, for they knew the bird was in kind hands. So I said, \"We'll let the Bittern go free in the Sanctuary at Abbey Dawn, but we'll call him 'Mostly Neck' until he is able to fly away.\"\n\nPoor Mostly Neck was so empty that he nearly died, for the mean people who tied him a captive either could not feed him or had not the sort of food he liked. But we soon fed him, and before night he was feeling better. Another night we tried to put some life into him that he tried to fly and actually did fly from the kitchen table to the sink. So we said, \"Let Mostly Neck go. He's well enough to find his own food.\"\n\nAnd would you believe it? he was in such hurry to fly away. So I said, after I had sent my lad, Joe, for my camera, \"I'd like to get your picture for the children of the Red Cross Junior, and tell them of your adventures. Will you stand still, Mostly Neck?\"\n\nMostly Neck stiffened up, stretched his neck to its limit, craned, and tried to look his streaky best. Then, when he heard the camera click, he quietly retreated to the safety of the sanctuary reeds. He flew up a few hours later, but descended again in another marsh in the sanctuary.\nOLD ISAAC had often agreed to take me muskrat hunting with him, and as the weather promised to be particularly fine, I persuaded him to set out Friday afternoon after school. We loaded a small canoe, tied it on a sled, a snowshoe runner, and stowed our outfit in it\u2014a .22 rifle, a shotgun, traps, hand-axes, paddles, some rope, bed-rolls, and the grub-bag.\n\nIt was three mile above across the great ice cake that persisted in the lake, for it was thick and strong, and the rays of the May sun had made little impression except along the edges where it was shallow. Even there it was only melted ten or fifteen feet from the shore because the bottom shelved away rather steeply. The smooth runners of our sled sped easily along, and when we reached the other side of the lake where a small creek emptied, we untied the canoe, slid it into the water, loaded the sled on it and paddled off up stream.\n\nIn Manitoba's north the snow on the land melts long before the lake does, and the resulting water floods streams which pour it down to rivers and lakes. It was up one of these flooded streams that we paddled, or with the first spring thaw the muskrats, or \"wachusks,\" come out of their winter lodges and search the banks of running water for fresh roots and the new bark of trees along the shores.\n\nWe spent the first day nosing up stream, making rat sets at likely spots. This was done by cutting aspen saplings, sticking them in the mud along the water's edge, and setting the trap under water close by. When the rat, swimming along in the stream, felt the twig, he would come inshore to feed on the bark and he would step into the trap.\n\nFriday night found us five miles up the creek, camped along the shore. A blazing fire lighted a mat of spruce boughs which kept our feet off the cold ground, and which would have been our bed. Our stomachs were satisfied with boiled duck, for during the day we had surprised a flock of mallards and old Isaac had\n\n\"My name, netotam, is also Kekanaskaskannes,\" and old Isaac sipped more tea.\n\n\"But you have two names. How is that?\" I asked.\n\nMy old Indian companion knocked the finished embers from his pipe, rolled it in green much moss of a bear's bladder, and picking up a blazing twig from the fire relit it. I watched his methodic movements with little patience for a second, but then the meaning of it, not a story, some interesting comments. An Indian isn't to be hurried when you want him to talk.\n\n\"Old is this way, netotam,\" and he was comfortably squatting cross-legged on his rabbit-skin bed-roll, \"Long years before the white man came we all had Indian names. There was Kechechekesik, 'big star,' and Mesenepe, 'big water,' and Papase, 'the woodpecker,' and many others. But when the white man came he couldn't remember our name in our strange tongue, so he gave us names in his own language. My father was Metonoconehik, 'big wood,' and he was named James McPherson by the white traders. My father's brother was Wastasekot, 'bright nose,' and he was named Samuel Ross. And so were many of our men. But while the white man called us new names in his strange language, we were always named by our own people also.\n\n\"Sometimes the white man when he gave us new names just translated our Indian names; Oskan became Edward 'Bone,' Kechekeesik became John and so on. And again our old names were sometimes used. You know John Napatapew. That means 'a row of birds.'\"\n\nIsaac lapsed into silence and I feared my entreaties was to stop. Perhaps I could draw him out.\n\n\"But if you were all given new names,\" I asked, \"how is it that there are five men on this reserve with the same name?\"\n\nThis is Isaac, my old Indian friend who told me so much about the names of his people that starlit May night as we sat around the fire on spruce boughs before a camp-fire.\nOttawa, August 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the authorities of the United Church have nominated Mr. David W.

Accept my thanks for this.\n\nA matter which has just arisen through the receipt of a letter from Mr. David Hanna, of Nelson House, calls for consultation with you. Mr. Hanna refers to a letter, dated August 12th, stating that the Indians are moving away from Nelson House this Fall and that there will be very few people left there this Winter. He has been in conversation with the traders from Indian Lake, one of whom has offered him the use of a building for school purposes, and Mr. Hanna is of the opinion that it would be a good thing to go to Indian Lake before the freeze-up and see if it is possible to conduct a school at that point, where there is hope of having an attendance of about twenty children. This will, of course, be in the form of an experiment, and it may or may not be wisdom to carry it on after the end of November.\n\nMr. Beaton and I have talked the matter over and we have decided that before taking any action, we ought to have your judgment.

The Department is now in receipt of a letter from the authorities of the United Church in which they state a recent letter received by the Reverend Mr. Hanna advises that the Indians are moving away from Nelson House this fall and that there will be very few people left there this winter. Under these circumstances, Mr. Hanna recommends that he proceed to Indian Lake and open a school. He further advises that he has been offered the use of a building for school purposes at this point.

We desire to nominate for the position Mr. Nelson Gaudin. It is unnecessary for me to say anything about Mr. Gaudin's qualifications, as he has previously taught at Nelson House. He is twenty-five years of age; he is the son of our missionary at Cross Lake, understands Indians thoroughly, and speaks Cree fluently.\n\nA year from now we hope to have Mr. Gaudin return to finish his college course and we have a man in view for this position who will be a university graduate.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Squire, who up until the time that he had his banns called was known in the community as \"Bill Clarke.\" As far as one can learn, he is not the type of man who can be considered much of an asset in the community. I feel rather strongly that we should send a new teacher into Nelson House the 1st of January, but before making a nomination I write to ascertain what the attitude of the Department would be.\n\nNeedless to say this is a very great disappointment to us, as well as to the Principals of the Round Lake Residential School, where Miss Ironstar did her public school work, and the Brandon Residential School, where she took her High School and Normal training and where she taught for a couple of years.\n\nHoping to hear from you at an early date,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

I would request that you forward a nomination, giving particulars as to qualifications, etc., and same will be submitted to the Minister for approval.\n\nIt may be difficult for a new teacher to get in to Nelson House at this season of the year, but it is hoped that arrangements can be made for the change as from the first of January, next.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

The only place for her to live at Nelson House is with the Hustons and they are occupying the small house in which the Woman's Missionary Society nurse formerly lived, as our house was burned two years ago and has not yet been rebuilt.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nAs you will remember from previous correspondence, Miss Irene Bell is being transferred to the Junior Room at Christian Island.\n\nFor the Nelson House Indian Day School we wish to nominate Mr. Swart Monias. Mr. Monias is a member of the Island Lake Band, a graduate of our Norway House Residential School where, on passing the Entrance examinations, he secured the highest marks of any pupil in the jurisdiction of that Public School Inspector. He has since spent several years in the Brandon School acquiring both Junior and Senior Matriculation with First Class Honours, and has recently completed his Normal training in the Brandon Normal School with great distinction. I have letters from the Principal and the Director of Physical Education at the Brandon Normal speaking in the highest terms of Mr. Monias, both as a student and a teacher.\n\nIt has been my privilege to keep pretty closely in touch with him for six years. I know his ability as a teacher from having seen him in action as a supply teacher in the Brandon School on the occasion of one of my visits.\n\nHe will marry an Indian girl, also a graduate of the Brandon School. The United Church of Canada has a small house at Nelson House which will be placed at his disposal, and we are prepared to pay travelling expenses for himself and his wife to the School even though this is a pretty heavy item. There is no furniture in the residence which we are offering him, and I am wondering if the Department could make a small grant towards furnishing it.\n\nI hope that you will see your way clear to approve of this nomination and that the salary will be set at not less than $25 a teaching month, which is the present rate. I would appreciate an early reply in view of the fact that Mr.\nMonias desires to visit his people before going into Nelson House. He has not been home for several years.\n\nWe realize that this is an experiment, but our missionary at Nelson House, Rev. A. C. Houston, who is a young man only three or four years out of College, has promised to give Mr. Monias every assistance, and there is probably no place in Canada where we could try him out to better advantage.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB:BJ\nOttawa, July 20, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the nomination of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, the Department is approving the appointment of Mr. Ewart Monies to take charge of the Nelson House United Church Indian Day School on September first, next.

Lovell, Indian Agent at The Pas, and I am writing to him and asking him to advise the Department as to the best way of getting some house furnishings out to Nelson House, as I am not acquainted with the methods of transportation to that particular point. On making enquiries here, however, I am advised that it would not be possible to get furniture to Nelson House until the winter time when it could be shipped from the N.B.Railway to freight it out to Nelson House. The shipment would, I imagine, go by Hudson's Bay Railway to Wabowen, and be freighted out from there to Nelson House.\n\nWith reference to the furnishings for the teacher's house, I have made a list of what I consider will be necessary, not including such things as bed linen, towels, table-cloth, etc., such alike. The cost of the items listed amounts to approximately $175.00 at Winnipeg; the list having been made up from Eaton's catalogue.\n\nI am requesting Mr Agent Lovell to advise the Department as to getting the furniture to Nelson House, immediately on receipt of my letter.\n\nAs Mr Monias will travel to Nelson House via The Pas, I expect, it would be well for him to report at the office of the Indian Agency there, where he would no doubt obtain information that would simplify his journey somewhat, between there and his destination.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Monias, the teacher at the Nelson House Day School, (United Church) was taken sick and has entered the Pas Hospital. The doctor says he is suffering from appendicitus and will probably have to undergo an operation. He will therefore be away from his work for some time. He left Mrs. D.

Mrs. Squires is the former Miss Dorothy Ironstar, who taught at this school two years ago.\n\nMr. Monias left Nelson House on Nov. 24th and Mrs. D.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 9th,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Nelson House Day School\n\nAs you know, Mr. Ewart Monias, who taught school at Nelson House last year, is dead. We are having very great difficulty in finding a teacher to succeed him. Dr. Cornie makes the suggestion that your Department appoint Mrs. Mary O. Pay. Mrs. Pay is a fully certificated teacher of the Province of Manitoba. She is the daughter of our missionary, Mr. J. T. Blaikie; her husband is serving overseas, and she has two small children. At the present time she is living with her father and mother. Mrs. Pay would not find it possible to undertake the whole charge of the school, but if your Department were willing, she would give half of her time and for the rest of the period employ Miss Elizabeth Hutty as a sort of assistant. Miss Hutty is a young woman, whose father is a former minister of ours but who is now a trader at Nelson House. She has her Grade X, Manitoba. I think that, under all the circumstances, the school would fare very well, although the proposal is a little irregular. The salary would go to Mrs. Pay, who would share with Miss Hutty.\n\nI should be glad to know whether or not this meets with your approval. Would you kindly write me in care of the General Council, Bridge Street United Church, Belleville, where I will be for the next week.\n\nI am advised by Dr. Cornie that the school is in need of extensive repairs. There should be a new set of school books. The building should be fumigated and cleaned. The school door does not close \"by more than a full inch at the bottom;\" the stove is badly broken, and there are no storm windows. I think that steps should be taken to remedy this condition at once. I have no doubt you have means of communicating with the Agent, so that the matter can be undertaken.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pay, who is a fully qualified teacher, be appointed to take charge of the above-noted school.\n\nThe arrangement you suggest is, as you say, somewhat irregular or unusual, but I am disposed to think that in view of the acute shortage of teachers existing throughout the Dominion it is the best arrangement we can possibly make. Mrs. Pay will be allowed salary at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month plus cost-of-living bonus which at this date amounts to approximately 17%. The Department will be glad to interested in what arrangement Mrs. Pay may make with Miss Nutty, provided we have an assurance that the classroom work will be conducted regularly and effectively.\n\nI am today communicating with the Indian Agent, asking him to take immediate steps to have the repairs necessary at the school undertaken and completed at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Mr. Lovell thought it advisable to have a dozen of the younger ones stay at home. This, I think, was a wise decision rather than have so much overcrowding. Had many of these pupils not lived so far from school, arrangements might have been made for them to attend in two groups half a day each. This tends to keep up their interest in the school. I understand that there will be a certain number going from here to South Indian Lake to take part in fishing operations next fall and winter. This will take them to a place where there is no school at all so there will be no worry about school attendance for them.

Had many of these pupils not lived so far from school, arrangements might have been made for them to attend in two groups half a day each. This tends to keep up their interest in the school. I understand that there will be a certain number going from here to South Indian Lake to take part in fishing operations next fall and winter. This will take them to a place where there is no school at all so there will be no worry about school attendance for them. Even with this doubtful relief I see very little prospect of improvement at this point next year.\"\n\nOwing to the housing accommodation situation, the erection of public buildings has been curtailed this year. Consequently, it is not possible to consider erecting new schools. However, if there is any building available that could be rented, we would be prepared to make an attempt to open a second classroom at the Nelson House United Church School for\nthe academic year 1946-47. Is there also over-crowding at the Nelson House Roman Catholic School? If additional desks are required, please submit a requisition. Desks are available in three sizes - large, medium and small - and if requesting more desks, you should state the sizes and the number of each size needed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nApplication FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nI hereby make application for employment in the ........................................

T. A. BOWMAN,\nfor Indian Agent.\nOttawa, June 21, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Nelson House U.C. Indian Day School,\nNo. 527,\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Margaret Thompson, teacher of the above school, has submitted her resignation to the Department, effective 1 July, 1947. This resignation has been accepted and no further payment of salary should be made to this teacher after that date.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nMr. Philip Ahearn,\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Major McKay, Commissioner for B.C., was giving evidence last year before the joint committee studying Indian Affairs, he mentioned that several day schools there (I think it was 8) were operating on a 2 day basis\u2014one shift in the morning, another in the afternoon. This was because of lack of accommodation\u2014a condition which also prevails here. I wonder then, if the above plan could be put into operation here this following year?\n\nThe reasons for this suggestion follow. First, there are a large number of children on the reserve. Even though there are two day schools, one U.C., the other R.C., and more than 30 were away at Residential School, many children are not enrolled. In the year...\nIn 1945-46, there were 57 enrolled at the R.C. School, until the agent sent almost half of them home. In 1946-47, enrollment was kept down to 40, and an average attendance of 27 was made possible only by the use of tables, biscuit boxes etc., to supplement the desks in the school. Of the 23 at the R.C. day school this past year 14 were Protestant children attending there in part because of proximity, in part because of the shortage of accommodation at the R.C. School.\n\nFurthermore, the agent apparently refuses the family allowance regulations, until such time as there is accommodation for all children. Warning have been given the parents, and I have recommended that children be cut off because of irregular attendance without reasonable excuse. Nothing was done about it by our agent. It is getting to the point where this is causing hard feeling in the community. Some children do not see why they should attend regularly when...\nothers do not, and continue to get F.A. This has been brought to my attention on more than one occasion. Apart from this, there is the difficulty which the teacher encounters in trying to make classes move along shortly when 50% of them come perhaps 3 days in 5.\n\nI will list a few attendances to illustrate my point.\n\n1. Nelson Linklater (15) absent October 5 days\n   November 5\n   December 3\n   January 5\n   February 6\n   March 8\n   April 10\n\n2. Sandy Spence (15) - attended school until late October. Went off trapping until Christmas. Worked several days at Mr. Smith's until late April, when once there he went trapping. Besides earning money he continued to get F.A.\n\n3. Babian Moor - an R.C child who enrolled Oct. 15 at v/c school. She attended quite regularly until Christmas - one day since.\n\nI shall not dwell longer on this point, but cannot something be done about it?\nTwo further questions: (1) Does the Department ever pay for transport? This service is very scattered, and I think if some arrangement could be made whereby children are brought by canoe in summer and team in the winter, a more consistent attendance could be realized.\n\n(2) And lastly, how does one get a grant for hot lunches? It was not until recently that I knew this could be obtained.\n\nAlthough I will not be in charge here next year I will be remaining in the community, and intensely interested in Indian education.\n\nHoping for an early reply,\n\nI am,\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Mrs.) M. Thompson,\nTeacher &c. School.\nOttawa, November 3, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nIn official letter of June 23rd last we requested you to nominate a teacher for the Nelson House Indian Day School.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nI have your memo of June 29 advising me that you have appointed a nurse to the day school at Nelson House. The Indian Health Services shipped in a nursing station (prefab.) last winter and Mr. Connolly is at present organizing that a work crew go in to put in a basement and erect the building. I understand all the furniture was sent in during the winter. It is expected that this unit will be ready for occupation by the time the fall school term starts. There will be plenty of room in this nursing station for the accommodation of the teacher as well as nursing station staff.\n\nW.L. Falconer, M.D.,\nAsst. Director, Indian Health Services.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nThe attached letter is self-explanatory in which Mr. Murray Thompson states that the new school, at present being erected on the Nelson House Reserve, is not large enough to accommodate all the pupils of school age. It is suggested that the old school be operated along with the new. Would you please advise if this will be in order so that the matter may be taken up with Dr. Best of Winnipeg?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnc.\nRev. M. S. Thompson, B. A.\nUnited Church Mission\nNelson House via Wabowden, Man.\nJune 21/48.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nFederal Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was in your office some ten days ago enquiring about plans for the coming school year at Nelson House. I pointed out the need for more accommodation than the new school provides and suggested that the old school should be operated along with the new. You asked me to set forth the particulars in writing.\n\nThe Nelson House band has more than five hundred members. This does not count those who in recent years have taken up their residence at South Indian Lake. Of the above number at least two hundred and twenty seven are children of sixteen or under. One hundred and nineteen are from six to sixteen, one hundred and eight are under six. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants are represented. Taking a Protestant child to be \"one born of Protestant parents\" there are ninety five of school age and eighty one under it. There are twenty four Roman Catholic children of school age and twenty seven under it. In these figures I have included the children of four non-treaty families, six of school age and six under.\n\nIn the past the community has been served by two day schools, one Protestant the other Roman Catholic, each with\naccommodation for about twenty-five pupils. But as might be expected denominational lines have not been clear-cut. Without exception the children have attended the closer school. For instance during the school year 1946-47 fourteen out of the twenty-five attending the Roman Catholic School came from nearby Protestant homes. At the same time only one Roman Catholic child was attending the Protestant school. This sort of thing will continue so long as there are \"separate\" schools.\n\nThe parents of this reserve are almost unanimous in their desire for the residential school system. They expressed themselves that way in a letter to the Commons' committee on Indian Affairs and again at a meeting before the Indian Agent last summer. But they have objected in the past about having to send their children so far away. Right now the priest, Father Thiboutot, is active in signing up families, Roman Catholic and Protestant, who want to have their children in a boarding school on or near the reserve. With or without foundation, Father Thiboutot still hopes such a school will be built under the auspices of his church. We are inclined to accept the apparent decision of the department that this reserve is to be served by day schools.\n\nFrom what I have said it will be apparent that both the new and the old schools should be operated during the next\nyear and that plans should be made for early expansion of school facilities. The information I have given can be presented to and verified by Mr. Law when he comes next month. Rev. C. H. Best should be notified as soon as it is known that another teacher will be required. His address is 441 Somerset Bldg., Winnipeg.\n\nI am sorry to burden you with this rather lengthy summary but I think it does raise all the major factors to be considered.\n\nA very rough sketch of our community is enclosed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMurray S.

Law,\nAgency Supt.,\nThe Pas,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe chief of this band, Richard Hartie, yesterday asked me to write this letter for him. It relates to the school question.\n\nHe wishes you to know that the priest, Father Thiboutot, is trying to capitalize upon the secrecy which at the moment surrounds the school policy of the department. The people of this reserve have declared themselves in favor of a residential school on or near the reserve. It now appears that the Protestant majority are to be served by day schools. In the hope that a residential school under the care of the Roman Catholic church may yet be built, the priest is collecting the names of those who would place their children in such a school. Whatever the end result of his labours it will not present a true picture of the religious affiliation of this band. It merely indicates the strength of the preference for the residential school.\n\nI take the liberty of enclosing a copy of the letter that I sent to the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.

The information I have given can be presented to and verified by Mr. Law when he comes next month Rev. C.H. Best should be notified as soon as it is known that another teacher will be required.

This nursing station will be close to your United Church School (both the old one and the new prefabricated one). I have been advised by Dr. Falconer of the Indian Health Services that it is expected that the nursing station will be ready for occupancy by September 1.

This nursing station has been constructed in such a way as to provide accommodation for the teacher. We have not received any petition from the Roman\nCatholic missionary with regard to a residential school.

I have just returned from Nelson House, and the present United School is very crowded. About twenty-five children, who should be attending school, are being deprived of an education - through lack of space.\n\nI would recommend that a second school be opened in the old building, formerly used as a school. This building would need some repairs, such as whitewashing, replastering, and doors and windows repaired. I would estimate this would cost around $250.00.\n\nWe have a Grade 2 Assistant at this point now, Mr. Arnfinson - who is a very good man. He would be able to supervise the repairs to this building. We will have a few desks there, and tables can be made, which should do for this winter.\n\nMr. C.A.F. Clark did not continue with the party from Churchill, as he could not stand the cold weather.

She appears to me to be more or less untidy and a little sloppy in her methods. However, the school was not in operation when I visited, as it was early in the morning.\n\nMr. Grafton inspected the school after my visit and I am forwarding his report. There are 43 children on the roll and 25 of school age living around the village who are not attending school owing to a lack of accommodation.\n\nI would recommend that the old school building be repaired and another teacher hired to look after these pupils. I would estimate the cost of repairs at about $250.00.

Hall, teacher of the Methodist Indian Day School at Nelson House, has given up her duties. While you have not stated the date she left Nelson House, it is presumed that it was at the end of September, as it is noted that she did not teach during October.\n\nThe appointment of her sister, Miss J. E. Hall, as teacher to succeed her is approved. We will allow her salary at the same rate as was paid Miss D. Hall. I may say that we cannot pay salary for any period in the school year exceeding 10 months, as the payment of all salaries is based on that length of service. I may say further as the questions for salary for this school are forwarded to the treasurer of the Methodist Church they will, no doubt, arrange for the payment to Miss D. Hall and her sister for the yearly teaching period. When we receive the quarterly returns from Miss J. E. Hall covering the period she teaches to June 30th, next, consideration will be given to the amount of salary the Department will forward to the Church authorities.\n\nUnless the Indian children are perfectly willing to attend on Saturdays, the Department would not be favourably disposed to have the school open on that day. This matter, however, will be left with the teacher and yourself to arrange.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

E. Hall, teacher of the Nelson House Methodist Indian Day School, for permission to keep the school open during July and August, as the Indians are home from the hunting ground and the attendance will be good.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if Miss Hall keeps this school open during the present month, we will allow her payment for same. As you were informed in official letter of December 14th, last, we cannot pay salary for any period in the school year exceeding ten months. Miss Dorothy Hall was allowed payment for the month of September, 1925, and Miss J. E. Hall has been paid for the period from November 1st to June 30th, making a total of nine months for which salary has been paid during the school year closed June 30th. We will allow Miss J. E. Hall payment for the current month, in order to complete the ten months in the school year. We prefer that this school remain closed during the regular summer holiday period, and the teacher should respectfully close this school and arrange to reopen it on the first of September, next. Please arrange with her to forward a return showing the period taught by her during the current month, when a cheque in payment of one month's salary will be sent.\n\nI may state that all cheques for salary for this school are forwarded to the Treasurer of the Methodist Church, Toronto. The Treasurer has, no doubt, paid the Misses Hall their full yearly salaries.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is presumed that the children mentioned are Caroline and Richard Moose referred to in your 1103/142 of February 9th.\n\nPlease let me know if Mr. Hanna was absent from the Nelson House School for the whole month of January. If so, you should advise why it was necessary for him to be absent from the school for this period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nSamuel Lovell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMay 2nd, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter No.128-11-3 of the 25th ultimo, regarding the Nelson House U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nWish to say Mr. Hanna must have been absent from the school all of January, as he arrived in The Pas January 6th, 1932 so must have left South Indian Lake, where he was teaching school at the end of December 1931.\n\nHe returned to The Pas January 28th, 1932 and left the next day for Wabowden, and would get back to the Nelson House Reserve around the beginning of February.\n\nAfter Mr. Hanna left the children going to Residential school, here, he went to Winnipeg, and as far as I know no authority was granted for this.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 9th, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWhen the March quarter return of the Nelson House U.C. Indian Day School was received, it was noted that the school was only open for part of the quarter and inquiries were made from the Indian Agent regarding the reason for this. It is found that the teacher, Mr. D.W. Hanna, left the reserve about the end of December and reached The Pas on January 6th, bringing with him some children to be placed in a residential school. He then proceeded to Winnipeg and did not return to The Pas until January 28th and would, therefore, be unable to reach Nelson House until about the first of February. You will note, therefore, that he was absent from the school for the full month of January.\n\nThe Department, however, was not aware of this when the March quarter return was received and cheque #7897 for the full quarter's salary was issued and sent to you on April 13th.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is considered that the Department should not have allowed salary for the month of January and a deduction will be made when paying the June quarter salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

W. Hanna, the teacher at Nelson House, was absent for the whole of January, and have already called his attention to the fact that he should not have left his school without permission. He claims that he secured permission from the Indian Agent before leaving The Pas. Moreover, he has promised that the school will continue during June, until he has completed the minimum number of teaching days during the present academic year. We are quite satisfied to have the adjustment referred to made when you issue the next cheque, because we feel sure that he will make up all of the lost time, as he has promised.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Mr. Gaudin of Nelson House Keewatin. I will quote from his letter. \"We received two years ago, the promise of a grant of $150.00 for the erection of a school house at Nelson. I rendered one account in March 1904 for which I received payment $51.38. I was then notified by the Secretary of the Indian Department at Ottawa in future to send such accounts, through the Indian Agent at Norway House\". This of course all transpired before I came to Norway House, and I can only acquaint you with what Mr. Gaudin has said.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Stewart, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nNorway House\n\nJanuary 5th, 1913.\n\nRe Nelson House Day School\n\nSir,\n\nDuring the first part of the winter I wrote to the Revd Mr Wright of Nelson House Mission and requested him to give me a true report as to the condition of his day school. I enclose herewith a copy of his letter re Nelson House Day School, and can only add that he has made out a report of the school there as I saw it myself during treaty. I simply endorse what Mr Wright has written as to what would be required to give the Indians of Nelson House a decent school for their children.\n\nI am of the opinion that the Indians will build the school themselves with Mr Wright supervising it without pay providing the Department will furnish the articles required in Mr Wright's letter and also allow them these rations while working on the school.\n\nAs Mr Wright says the school they have at present is practically useless unless this is done. Trusting I have made every-thing clear.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nYour letter #116 duly received and reply would say that I have carefully examined the present school building and would beg to make the following report and suggestions.\n\nThe building is 16x20ft and 10ft post, inside measurements. It is simply a log building, with poles and bark for a roof. The walls are uncovered, having received a coat of mud inside and out. The floor is of single thin, unplanned lumber. The windows, four in number are eight lights, 10x12, two of these are in good repair, only requiring a few panes of glass, the remaining two were destroyed, and have been re-placed with storm windows of a smaller size. The logs in this building are all sound and good and of splendid size.\n\nI am of the opinion that if this building was taken down and re-built, properly finished is all that is required; and would meet the requirements for some years to come. I would suggest the following improvements.\n\nReplace the roof with proper lumber, then give it a covering of Rubber Roof Felting. Sheath the whole inside, viz., four walls and the ceiling, and lay a double floor of matched lumber. Give the windows proper attention, would suggest twelve lights size 10x12. A good mud chimney could be easily built, and would serve as a protection against fires. The outer walls if properly mudded is all that is necessary.\n\nIf the above suggestions are carried out the following materials are necessary.\n\n50 lbs, 2in, Nails, 50 lbs, 2\u00bdin, Nails, 25 lbs 3in, Nails 10 lbs 4in, Nails, 12-Rolls dry sheathing paper, 10-rolls rubber roof felting 4-pairs, Window Sash, 12 light, 10x12, 1-Door latch with screws, 1-Pad-Lock and fixtures with screws, 12-lengths stove-pipes, 7in, for chimney, For rations to men cutting logs, rafting them to schoolsite\n\n(over)\nSir,\n\nsaving logs into lumber, building school over again, the following amount has been suggested to feed the Indians while building school:\n\n15 sacks of Flour, 500 lbs of Bacon, 125 lbs of Tea.\n\nLogs are hard to get, being more than a day from here to get the right kind and size.\n\nI have talked with the Chief etc., and I think that there will be very little trouble to get them to do their part.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to say that the above repairs are necessary, for the building as it is, is useless.\n\nTrusting that the above information is what is required.\n\nI am,\nYours truly,\nH/T Wright.\n\nMr J.G. Stewart,\nIndian Agency,\nNorway House.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to forward a School Report for the month of January, from the Revd H.T. Wright, Missionary and School Teacher at Nelson House.\n\nBy his report you will be able to judge of the conditions of the school building at Nelson House, and how nearly impossible it is for a school teacher to keep school open, owing to the reasons mentioned in his report.\n\nI beg to submit for the Department's careful consideration why Indian Boarding schools of not too expensive nature should be erected at Nelson House and Split Lake for the benefit of the Indian children at these places.\n\nAt Nelson House there are over 200 children of school age, as I took the trouble to have them mustered out and counted. These are pretty evenly divided between the Methodists and Roman Catholics. At Split Lake there are quite a number of children also, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 75 or 100, these all belong to the Anglican Church, and as such are not taken in the Methodist Indian Boarding Schools either at Norway House or elsewhere, or probably more likely the different Denominations don't wish to mix up the children, but wish to keep them separate, and educate them according to the faith to which they belong.\n\nThe only solution that I can see to the education of these children lays in some sort of a Boarding school that the children could be housed and kept at school while their parents were away at their hunting grounds.\n\nSuch a building could be constructed of logs and shingled with steel shingles so as to make it fire-proof, much the same as the H.B. Company's buildings are covered with. The building should be two storey's in height. On\n\n(over)\nOn the lower floor a dining room of say, 18 x 18, a living room for the girls on one end 18 x 18, and one on the other end of the building for the boys, 18 x 18 with a kitchen attached to the building say, 20 x 30; this would make the building a length of 56 ft x 20 ft wide. Upstairs, sleeping quarters for the boys and girls and teaching staff would be laid out accordingly. A class room 18 x 30 and a store-house 18 x 20 could be erected apart from the main building. The expense of these buildings put up with the material of the country ought not to cost a great deal.\n\nThe only material required to be freighted in would be doors, window sash, nails, steel shingles, building paper, tar paper, also desks for the school, furniture for the boarding department, and stoves and kitchen utensils.\n\nA building like this I should think might be built at a cost of two or three thousand dollars or very little more. Lumber for the building would be sawn on the ground.\n\nThe H.B. Company have had no difficulty in putting up buildings almost as big as this for stores and dwelling houses, and they seem to have been built at a reasonable figure. A boarding school of the size and cost that is going to be erected at Norway House, is not what is wanted at Nelson House or Split Lake. It is such a building as the H.B. Company is in the habit of putting up at their Trading Posts, that is required for the present, so that these Indians' children will have a chance to get their children educated.\n\nIn regard to labour two good carpenters from Selkirk or possibly they might even be got at Norway House, would be sufficient with the help of the Indian labour down there. The food for the school would depend largely on moose and deer meat and fish of all descriptions, with the necessary amount of flour, bacon lard, tea, sugar, condensed milk and Butter.\n\nIn submitting this report on the probable cost of such schools required at Split Lake and Nelson House, I beg to state that I only wish to show the Department what these Indians and Missionaries want for the present.\n\nIn future years when the country (over)\ncountry is opened up more by railroads, then more suitable buildings could be erected at a reasonable cost. But this is far distant yet, so I have outlined a building that could be put up for the present, which would be of more use to the Indians' children, and give more satisfaction to the Missionaries, as then they would be able to educate the children properly at their own homes.\n\nEducation among these Indians living so far out from civilization is necessarily slow, and will never be accomplished by day schools, as the children are never there to attend school but are taken away by their parents wherever they can find food for them and for which one can hardly blame them.\n\nBy adopting this kind of school a beginning would be made and as their children grow up and marry and in the course of time have children, they would naturally see the benefits of education and be glad to learn so as to be able to earn their living in a different manner from what they are now doing, for the country in the future I fear will be very much depleted of fur which at present is their chief mode of gaining a livelihood, and thus by educating them now, gives them a better chance to cope for the welfare of their families in the future.\n\nRespectfully submitting this for your careful consideration.\n\nI have the Honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 28, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo enclosing a copy of a communication received from Rev.

Mr. Nutty their Missionary, that the Department build a new day school on their reserve, as the old school was inadequate for the number of children that could attend school. A site for that purpose has been laid off by Mr. Robertson, but as it was considered a little out of the way, the Indians proposed another site that would meet the wishes of everybody. The old day school that was built some years ago was not up to date, they required a larger school and one that would be fully equipped for teaching their children in a proper manner. Mr. Nutty informed me that by keeping the school in operation all summer, that 40 or 50 pupils could be easily induced to attend school, the teacher to take his holidays in the latter part of September and October. There are a hundred children on this reserve of school age, and I think that Mr. Nutty is the first Missionary that has recognised the idea of keeping the school going in the summer, as the only reasonable way of getting the part of these children educated.\n\nThe Chief and Band after some deliberation, asked that a day school be built of the following dimensions, and that it be equipped as a day school should be:\n\nSchool building to be 36ft.x 22ft.\nPorch 8ft.x 8 ft.\nTo have windows, 4 lights to a sash, glass to be 10in. x 12in.\n2 doors,\n6 pairs of butt hinges and screws,\n1 keg of nails, 2\u00bd in.\n20 lbs \" 3 in.\n20 \" \" 4 in.\n20 school desks,\n1 teacher's table with lock and key,\n1 \" cupboard for keeping school material, lock and key,\n2 chairs, 9 yards of blackboard cloth,\n4 blackboard cleaners, 1 Globe, 1 set of Lesson cards,\nTo be roofed with three ply of rubber roof felting,\nWall of building to be 8 ft. 6 in. high,\nLumber for roof, flooring and joists and scantling to be whip-sawed on reserve.\nRevd. Mr. Nutty agrees to supervise the building of the school.\nRations for men to build school to be provided by the Department.\nTwo carpenters from Norway House asked for to build school properly. Indians agree to do all the rough work, such as cutting and hewing logs, whipsawing lumber and rafting.\nIt would be necessary for Mr. Nutty to have flour, bacon, tea and sugar for rations forwarded this summer if possible, as the work of getting out the logs for building and whipsawing, will most likely be done next fall or winter. It is the intention of Mr. Nutty to have a hot meal at noon for the children, as those who come from a distance, will come more readily, knowing that they will not be hungry. In my letter dated May, 7th, No. 735 I mentioned Mr. Nutty's application for the necessary material required for giving a hot meal once a day. I may as well give you the list that Mr. Nutty prepared.\n3 doz. cups and saucers, granite ware.\n3 \" soup plates,\n4 \" dessert spoons, Brittan\u00eda metal,\n6 yds towelling,\n6 yds. crash for dish cloths,\n1 lge pan for washing up dishes,\n1 large cooking pot, for soup,\n40 ft. of oil cloth for tables,\n15 lbs of table salt,\n25 lbs. of pressed vegetables, for soup,\n50 \" pearl barley for soup,\nIndians agree to furnish fish and meat when available.\n\nx x x\n\nJ.

A school house is very much needed, also school supplies. Mr. Nutty, who has charge, thinks that the work might be done in the way of getting out lumber and logs, by the native people. I would like very much if the Department would take this matter up. In the meantime I would ask you to ship at once the necessary supplies for carrying on the primary work that will be done in such a school. Ship them to \"W. E. W. Nutty, Nelson House, via Lake Winnipeg, Man.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 1)\nOttawa, October 4, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 6th of August, last, in which you state that a new school house is needed at Nelson House I beg to say that this matter will be considered when the estimates for next year are being dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Peppier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR J.R.BURN ON THE NELSON HOUSE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe old building used as a school house, here, is in a very dilapidated condition and unfit for use as a school house. They have taken out logs for the erection of a new school building. These are on the ground. I think it would be well to consider the advisability of granting some financial assistance towards taking down the old building and erecting a new building sufficiently commodious to meet the requirements of this school.\n\nReport dated,- October 7th, 1915.\nTo The Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nYours of October the 4th, #191433/5 received. We are sending out Elijah Sinclair to be the teacher at Nelson House. He was at Deer Lake for the summer and did excellent work there. Your Inspector and Agent and others have reported very favorably to me as to his influence and work among the Indians at Deer Lake. He is a very good carpenter and while here in the Brandon Industrial School he made a specialty of carpentry work, and he has done considerable of it on the Reserve and other places since leaving the School.\n\nIn making provision for building the school, it is just possible that he would be able to oversee and look after the building of it as well, if not better, than anyone we may be able to send in from far. I would suggest that a grant of about $1200 or $2000 would be sufficient. I think that this school and the one at Cross Lake should be at least 30 x 40 ft. Such a building would not cost so much if it were not for the enormous present that will have to be paid for purchasing certain pieces of lumber, hardware, doors, windows, etc., that will have to be sent in. I trust that provision will be made for both of these schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./M.C.H.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 1)\nOttawa, November 26, 1915.\n\nRev.

I was sorry that I missed you in The Pas for I have not seen you since two years ago. However, I thank you for your part in getting me down the line. It means much to me. I met the Dr., and got my mail. Many thanks for that also.\n\nNow about Nelson House School, we have to give up the idea of a Boarding School there at present, so we must do the best we can with the Day School. I think the Department ought to erect a School House which would give some standing to the educational work. In the meantime the Church will be used, of course. Mr. Hutty and Miss Jackson think those dishes can be used to good effect if you will send them out, and if you will secure the necessary food. They will give a hot meal this winter.\n\nMr. Perrier secured a Miss Winter for Teacher, and she came to The Pas this week expecting to go out, but both Mr. Hutty and Miss Jackson think that in view of the scarcity of canoes and men, the lateness of the season, and the fact that all the people will be away fall fishing for the next six weeks it will be well for the teacher not to go out until the snow comes. Miss Winter has therefore gone back to Brandon to wait till November when she will come in time to catch the train to Mile 137 on the 23rd. November where Mr. Hutty will meet her with a dog team, and see her safely out. She will call and talk matters over with you. Ask the Dr. what he thinks of her. I feel sure she is the right person for the place. I know you will give her all the encouragement possible.\n\nShould there be any change in the train dates please notify Mr. Perrier and Mr. Hutty at once so that there will not be any misunderstanding. Also see that Miss Winter goes to Mile 137.\n\nIf there are any other matters please write me. I got those pictures off to Mr. Hutty by the men who brought me out.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours Fraternally,\n\nArthur Barner.\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nThe Pas, Man.,\nSeptember 19th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that Rev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Methodist Missions, has asked me if the Department will consider erecting a day school building at Nelson House.\n\nThe building used there at the present is the Church, but it is not satisfactory altogether as the children come a long way to school, and the intention is to give a lunch at noon. Such the church people rather object to having cooked in the church. Also they wish to have the school in separate building to give the educational work some standing as distinct from church work.\n\nUp until lately I understood that the Methodist Church intended to start a boarding school at Nelson House, and eventually this is what will be asked for as there are so many children at this point, so if an application for day school is considered it would be waste of money if a boarding school was to be erected in next few years.\n\nNo doubt we could carry on a school up at Nelson House, but I think the church people could still let us use their building until the question of a boarding school is decided.\n\nI enclose, herewith, Mr. Barner's letter.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. W. Waddy.\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nIndian Department,\nRegina.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward you, herewith, copy of a letter I have received from Mr. Waddy commenting upon the application of the Rev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Methodist Missions, to have a Day School building erected at Nelson House. I also enclose copy of Mr. Barner's letter, to which the Agent refers. The latter pertinently remarks that if the erection of a boarding school is contemplated it would be inadvisable to build a day school. I forward the correspondence for the information and decision of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, October 1st, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication with reference to the application made by the Rev. Arthur Barner, Superintendent of Methodist Missions, for the erection of a day school building at Nelson House.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department has no funds available to erect a building at this point. It is considered that the present arrangements for carrying on school can be continued and the classes held in the church building until such time as the question of a boarding school is decided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nREGINA, SASK.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that the teacher at Nelson House Day School informs me that she is teaching the children in the Methodist Church building. She complains, however, of the trouble she has to keep the children warm as the place is so big, and she asks that she be supplied with a canvas 10 feet by 20 feet so she can shut off a section of the building.\n\nThe request looks reasonable, and I beg to recommend that the canvas be supplied.\n\nThere are no tent firms here doing this work, but the Department could have it supplied by a Winnipeg firm if the expense is approved. It could be forwarded in my care.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, Dec. 22nd, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, recommending that a canvas be supplied for the use of the Nelson House Indian Day School, in order to assist in keeping the building warm and to prevent draughts.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is considered the supplying of this material would not serve the purpose of making the building warm. If you consider that the use of another stove would add to the comfort of the building, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the same. A stove of the Quebec heater type or similar would be the most serviceable. If you are able to arrange for the transport to the school of a suitable stove, you may purchase the same, as well as the stove pipe required.\n\nIf you purchase this stove you should, if possible, obtain competitive prices and make the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. All expenditure in connection with the purchase and transport of the stove should be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The missionary in charge has been requesting this for a number of years. Your agent at the Pas will be able to give you further information as to the need for a school. I would suggest that an amount of $3,000 be incorporated in the estimates for this purpose.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[T. Ferrier]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I examined the writing books of the pupils, and the ones who have attended steadily are doing well. This school will not be a success until a building is put up, the children being taught in the kitchen of the mission house at present, it is very unsatisfactory all round.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Ferrier  \nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\n\nThe Secretary,  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe a new day school building at Nelson House:\n\nI have a report from Mr. Hutty and also one from Rev. Mr. Barner who has recently visited this mission. Rev. Mr. Hutty has a number of logs sufficient for a building 25' x 48'. We are now constructing the building. The material needed will be ship lap for gable ends, flooring, ceiling, windows, doors, casing, shingles, wood fibre for mortar between the logs, bricks, lime for chimney, and hardware such as nails, lock etc. The cost of this material in the area will be in the neighborhood of $350, or $400. The cost of freighting from the Pas to Nelson House by boat and cartage of $1,000 will I believe fill the bill. I understand there are a dozen school desks in the mission house. A few others may be required. Your Agent Mr. Waddy, will be familiar with the whole situation and no doubt will be able to give you a detailed statement of exact amounts of the above materials required.\n\nI would appreciate very much the Department authorizing Mr. Waddy to make the necessary purchases and have the materials sent in at his earliest convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 1)\nOttawa, August 8, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, in which you report that the Indians, under the supervision of the Methodist missionary, are constructing a new log day school building at Nelson House. I have not yet received your request for material to finish the building and in reply I have to inform you that I am corresponding with Mr. Indian Agent Waddy for his report and recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, August 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools has reported that the Rev. Mr. Nutty, Missionary at Nelson House, has arranged with the Indians for the construction of a new log day school building. The Rev. Mr. Perrier requests that shiplap for gable ends, flooring, ceiling, windows, doors, casing, shingles, wood fibre for mortar between the logs, bricks, lime for chimney, and hardware such as nails, lock, etc., which will be necessary to complete the building, be supplied by the Department. It is estimated that the cost of the material will be $400 and the freighting from The Pas to Nelson House, $500.\n\nPlease let me have your report and recommendation and, if possible, secure and forward a detailed list of the equipment necessary, with an estimate of the cost. You might also secure an estimate of the freighting on this material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLICIQUES CANADA\n\nPooh Copy\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nAugust 29th 1924.\n\nRe letter 128-11-5 of the 8th inst., I have not answered previously on account of getting figures on freighting the material to Nelson House for the proposed day school.\n\nIn reference to material I enclose a list I had the lumber company figure on some time ago from the information of Rev.T.Ferrier. The material will probably be about the same but the price will change at any time up to the present it has remained steady. The cost shown is $306.10. The hardware such as nails would be about $30.00. The outside figure for freight would be Ry. 100.00 and teaming 500.00.\n\nThe Hays say they may get the freight done for $4.00 per cwt next winter, but my figure is at rate of $5.00 per cwt. Lamont and Davidson give same information, so we could expect a cost of at least $400.00 for teaming alone.\n\nI have not included any cost for painting this could be left over a year if considered necessary.\n\nI would not recommend a day school at this place for the Methodist Church if there was any probability of getting a boarding school, but as there is no outlook for the latter just now I recommend that the building be proceeded with.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 3, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott.\n\nThe Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Mr. Indian Agent Waddy have, on several occasions, recommended that a day school be built at Nelson House. They make this recommendation because they have been informed that boarding school facilities cannot be provided for some years. On the first ultimo Rev. Mr. Ferrier reported that he had learned the Indians were constructing a log building and he urged the provision of $350 worth of finishing material and the allowing of $500 for freight. Mr. Indian Agent Waddy was asked to report and to make a recommendation. He has intimated that $388.10 will be required for finishing material and that at least $500 will be required for freighting. He recommends that the day school be provided if there is no probability of a residential school in the immediate future.\n\nI wish to recommend that the $388 expenditure be allowed. The Methodist Church have conducted a day school at Nelson House for many years, with practically no assistance from the Department in the matter of capital expenditure.\n\nRussell J. Ferrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to your letter of the last ultimo, with reference to the new log day school building at Nelson House. I am pleased to inform you that Mr. Indian Agent Waddy has been instructed to purchase the finishing material required and to arrange for its delivery at Nelson House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, September 4th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 2873-110 of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the material needed to complete the Nelson House Indian Day School and the cost of freighting the same. In reply I have to authorize you to purchase the finishing material necessary for this log building. Your estimate of $538.10 should not be exceeded. Competitive prices should be secured and when you are submitting a certified account, in duplicate, in favour of the firm given the business, you should support it with a statement showing the prices quoted.\n\nI have noted that the railway freight bill will be approximately $100 and that at least $400 will be needed for teaming the material from the railroad. You are authorized to have the material shipped and delivered at Nelson House. The Department will rely on you to keep the expense in this connection as low as possible. Proper receipts and vouchers covering railway and freight charges should also be forwarded. An accountable cheque for $300, to pay for the teaming, is being directed under separate cover. Enclosed is a requisition for the freight on the railway.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

I have the honor to request that I be allowed to purchase two 36\" stoves, Camp Comfort, one for each building. Also twenty lengths of stove pipe and one elbow for each place. The approximate cost of the two stoves and all the pipe is $64.00. It may be slightly less.\n\nWhen I was at Shoal Lake and Red Earth last week, both the teachers asked me if it would be possible for the Department to renew the stoves at those places, as those in use are badly cracked and when the teachers go home at noon the fires have to be put out to avoid setting fire to the buildings. If there are any funds on hand for such purposes I would be obliged if the Department can see fit to allow of expenditure to supply similar stoves to Shoal Lake and Red Earth as are asked for above for Nelson House.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAsst.

If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase made from the firm quoting you the lowest price. You should arrange for the freighting of the stoves to the respective schools.

(RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPooh Copy\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose two requisitions for school material for Day School No. 1, Nelson House Reserve. The first requisition is for stationery for the school. The second is for equipment required for the new school, which is being constructed. The teacher asks for 3 desks, and 3 rear seats. These are double seats, No. 35. She states they are made by the A.S. Co. I would be obliged if these were supplied.\n\nIn reference to the hydroplate blackboard. It might be well to allow this, although up to the present we have always used the blackboard cloth. This blackboard cloth is very good for a few months, after which it becomes shiny, and practically useless. The teachers use it for a considerable time after it loses its value, with the result that it is hard on the eyes of the children.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst.

A beaver plate blackboard, 21'x4', with chalk trough and moulding, is also being ordered to be sent addressed to you, The Pas, and when this arrives please arrange to have it forwarded and set up in the school.\n\nRegarding the extra desks, teacher's desk and chair required, I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of this equipment. It is noted you state that any standard type of school desk will be suitable, and you may therefore place an order with one or other of the following firms, viz:\n\nWestern Seating Co., 179 Bannatyne Ave. E., Winnipeg, Man.\nE. N. Moyer Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, Man.\nChristie School Supply Co., Brandon, Man.\n\nYou should obtain 3 double desks, No. 5; 3 double rear seats, No. 3; 1 teacher's desk or table and 1 teacher's chair, plain, suitable type.\n\nBesides the above equipment, you may also purchase and have forwarded to the teacher 1 tea kettle and 1 tea pot.\n\nYou should obtain accounts, in duplicate, which you should certify when the goods have been received and forward to the Department in order that payment can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I wish to inform you that it is considered inadvisable to provide this building at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nSir:\n\nUnder Vote No.7 in The Pas Estimates for the fiscal year equipment is asked for to fill requirements at the Days Schools, and the Agent advises that this should be purchased as soon as possible. May I ask you therefore to give me the necessary authority.\n\nAs far as concerns the item of $500.00 for equipment for the new schools at Nelson House, these latter were not built under the direction of this office and I do not know what is needed, or has been asked for. If the Department wishes to spend what has been requisitioned for a list of the articles to be bought should be furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 20th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 205-11A of the 15th instant relative to the request made to you by Mr. Agent Waddy, The Pas, for authority to purchase equipment for the schools in his Agency, and especially with reference to the new Roman Catholic and Protestant day schools at Nelson House.\n\nIn connection with the Nelson House schools, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Waddy has already been authorized to purchase stoves and other supplies for each of these schools, and the desks have been supplied. I shall be pleased to have a list from the Agent enumerating the other supplies which are required for these two schools, as well as for any of the other schools in his Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nJuly 15th 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose report of visit to the Day School at Nelson House.\n\nThe new building is about completed it will be ready for occupation in a few weeks. I supplied what I thought was a sufficient number of windows for the place. I intended them for the side of the school but they only were placed at the back, not allowing enough light for the pupils. It will be necessary to put in two more windows at the side, I beg to request that I be authorised to supply them.\n\nThe teacher asks if it would be possible to have storm sash supplied, if so it would require eight.\n\nShe also asks for beaverboard to cover the walls above the wainscott. I do not see the need of it myself, but if it is seen in the future that a lining is required for the walls I will take the matter up again.\n\nShe also asks for kalsomine for the walls, on the other schools in the Agency we use white wash. The ceiling is shiplap, and the teacher asks if it could be covered with V. Joints. She is living in a pretty cold part of the country so I think this should be supplied, it would require 750 F.B.M. and could be sent in next winter.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 21st, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant enclosing the report of your visit to the Nelson House Methodist Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that the new building at this point is about ready for occupation. You may arrange to supply two more windows for the side of the building; also to have the eight storm sash supplied. You may also purchase and have supplied the quantity of kalsomine required for the walls of the school building. You should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the windows and the kalsomine.\n\nWe are not prepared to authorize the supplying of the beaverboard to cover the walls above the wainscott as the necessity for this is not seen.\n\nIf you consider that the 750 F.B.M.of ship-lap should be supplied to cover the ceiling you may arrange for the purchase and forwarding of this quantity at a time most advantageous to having it sent to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

I would have to get authority immediately in order to get the lumber in as it could not be taken in by canoes, so I would have to get it in during the time the lakes and rivers are frozen over.\n\nThe material and labour for painting the interior of the School would cost about $35.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Pas, Man.,\nAug. 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter 128-11-1, dated the 29th ultimo, and further to my letter of recent date in connection with a house belonging to the United Church at Nelson House, which they intend to use as a residence for Mr. Monias, the new teacher.\n\nI was up to Nelson House last week and I found the building the United Church refers to. It was formerly used as a warehouse but has been converted to a residence recently. It needs some repairs and kalsomining as the roofs leaks. The cost of the repairs would be about $50.00. May I please have authority to spend this amount.\n\nAs regards the furniture, I think this had better be left until the winter time. It is almost impossible to get furniture into Nelson House during the summer months as the river is so rapid and it has so many portages. The furniture would in all probability be damaged during the journey and the cost would be prohibitive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I please be authorized to spend $50.00 on repairs for the United Church day school at Nelson House Reserve. The plaster has all fallen out and one can see right through the logs in numerous places.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, referring to the house intended for use as a residence by Mr. Monias, the teacher appointed to the Nelson House United Church Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada visited the Department recently and requested that certain furnishings be supplied. We have requested Mr. Inspector Hamilton to arrange for the purchase and forwarding to the teacher, Wabowden, Man., of a small supply of furnishings.\n\nRegarding the repairs and kalsomining, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $50 in having the work carried out. I would request that you have the repairs completed at an early date.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified concerning the expenditure incurred for material and labour. If it is necessary to pay for the labour in making the repairs, the voucher should state the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSeptember 3rd, 1936\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have been away at the Western Ontario Leadership Camp and on returning find that Mr. Stewart Monks went into Nelson House single. There is therefore not as much urgency in regard to purchasing furniture for the house which he will occupy as I indicated in my recent conversation with you. If the goods have been shipped, no harm will be done, as his marriage is merely postponed and he will have to set up housekeeping for himself when he arrives at his destination. However, instructions for the purchase of this furniture have not been sent; there is just a possibility that he might be able to borrow enough from the white people in the community to get through the winter.\n\nMy conscience tells me that I ought to notify you of this change in plans, though I am rather secretly hoping that the furniture has been purchased and gone forward. I do not regard a bachelor's life in that North country as very desirable - even when he has all the comforts of home.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth Leaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, September 8, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the third instant, I have to inform you that Mr. Inspector Hamilton, Winnipeg, was authorized, on the 20th ultimo, to purchase and forward furnishings for the residence that will be occupied by the teacher of the Nelson House United Church Indian Day School. It is noted that Mr. Ewart Monias, the teacher, is still unmarried, the event being merely postponed, and that he will, no doubt, be able to use the furnishings in setting up housekeeping for himself when he arrives at the school. I may add, further, that the local Indian Agent, The Pas, has been authorized to expend an amount not exceeding $50 in having some repairs and kalsomining done to the house.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letters dated the 17th ultimo and the Department's reply of the 22nd of the same month, regarding the repairs required to the school building and teacher's residence at the Nelson House United Church Indian Day School, I have to say that it is noted you were authorized to incur an expenditure of only $50.00 in carrying out some repairs and kalsomining to the building that will be used for a teacher's residence. I have now to inform you that you may also expend $50.00 in repairing the school building.\n\nAfter all the above work has been completed, please forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the purchase of the materials, and accounts, in triplicate, covering the labour. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated. These accounts should be attached to proper voucher forms, certified in the usual manner and forwarded for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS.

I purchased the lumber from S.Donkey, which he had whipsawed himself, and as he was a little short, asked Mr.Hutty to give him the value of the $5.00 in food, which he did while I was there. Mr.Hutty should, of course, obtain a receipt from the Indian and attached to the account.

You forwarded your voucher No. 56 dated May 8, 1940, for payment of the rental for the period April 1, 1939, to March 31, 1940. However, it is noted that you did not forward a voucher at the end of March, 1941. We are arranging for payment of this amount and it will, therefore, not be necessary for you to forward a voucher for the period mentioned but at the end of March each year until further notice you should submit for payment the voucher covering this rent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, September 11, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. Mary O. Fay has been nominated by the United Church for the position of teacher at the Nelson House Indian Day School and this nomination has been approved by the Department. We are sending forward herewith the usual questionnaire forms, which should be signed by this teacher and returned to the Department in due course.\n\nDr. Dorey, in referring to certain repairs that are urgently needed at this school, states:\n\n\"The door does not close by more than a full inch at the bottom. The stove is badly broken and there are no storm windows. I think that steps should be taken to remedy this condition at once.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would take the action necessary to have these repairs completed at once. In this connection it might be advisable for you to have a report from time to time on the repairs required at the schools in these outlying and remote districts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

I would advise that we have requested a new school for Nelson House United Church in our estimates for the past three years. The old one is overcrowded and we cannot put anymore desks in it. I had to send 15 children home last year due to lack of space.\n\nWe have requested a new school and residence in this year's estimates, and would appreciate if we could be granted authority to order material this winter. The only means of transportation is by tractor, and if permission is not given to buy material this winter, it will mean a delay of another year.\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nTAB/d\nOttawa, September 24, 1947.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nNelson House U.C. Indian Day School\n\nThe question of providing a new day school at Nelson House is one that has received active consideration here. However, the problem has been, as elsewhere, to interest a contractor in its construction. The Indian Health Services intend to erect a prefabricated nursing station and nurses' residence, combined, at Nelson House in the near future. It is their hope that the North American Buildings Limited in Winnipeg will have this building ready to ship in by tractor and train during the winter. It has been purposely made large enough so that the teacher can live with the nurse or nurses. It is our hope that this company can also prefabricate a school for us for erection at Nelson House. Mr. Carpenter of the above company has just today visited my office and hopes to have the blue prints ready for our consideration in another month. We will be advising you later concerning this building programme.\n\nBernard F.

This nursing station will have ample accommodation for the teacher of this school. It is felt that in such isolated places that it will be to the advantage of all concerned if the teacher and the nurse can live together. This, of course, excludes the possibility of there being a male teacher at such a place. It is hoped that the company concerned can finish this building to reach the deadline at Wabowden. You will note that we have requested a delay until January 1, 1949, if the former date cannot be met.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to arrange for the excavation of the basement using local labour.

Also arranged for board and room for the Supervisor and men he might bring with him, for constructing the school and nursing home. The location of the school was staked out in line with the nursing home, and game warden's residence. I also arranged for the excavation of the basement for the school building.\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nNelson House Nursing Station,\nNelson House Day School\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of May 21st asking for co-operative scheme in regards to erecting the day school at the time of the erection of our nursing station. I have delayed acknowledging this correspondence until I had thoroughly gone into the matter.\n\nCircumstances with our construction programme are such that I have two carpenters working at Nelson House and am making arrangements to erect the foundation at the same time as the rest of our construction. So that when the erector goes up to erect our nursing station he will also be able to erect your day school. Mr. Law had previously staked out the location for the nursing station and it was shown to me by Mr. Hutty, free trader, in the district with whom our Departments carry on a considerable business and co-operative interests. Mr. Davis was in Norway House last week and we revisited the site and I established the lines of the building and we made arrangements for the excavation to proceed immediately and to obtain suitable stone, gravel and sand for the construction of your school basement. I have advised my carpenters that they are to keep an exact time account of the hours that they spend on either of the above mentioned projects so that the Departmental charges may be correctly distributed. Mr. Hutty is keeping separate accounts for the work done on the day school and the nursing station in regards to the local labour. Carpenters rates are $1.50 per hour each man with board and allowances.\n\nThe ..........\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 2)\nThe blue print supplied for the construction of this building indicates an area of the basement set aside for toilets but North American Buildings have told me that the facilities have not been supplied at the request of your Department. In consultation with Mr. Davis I have advised that in the event of a future desire to put in these facilities that the cast iron sewage waste pipe should be located in the floor and through the footing to the exterior of the building at the time of construction of the foundation. I believe Mr. Davis is taking the necessary steps to obtain the required pipe for this job.\n\nIn regards to finishing the building, i.e., laying the floors, putting on the trim, doing the painting, etcetera, I do not wish to take any responsibility for this work. You can probably make arrangements locally to obtain a carpenter to do this work but I expect that the schedule of constructing nursing stations will have reached such a peak that I will not be able to spare my carpenters from our particular work. I hope that our nursing station and your dayschool will be in the stage of erection by August 1st.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.J. Connolly,\nSupervising Engineer,\nIndian Health Services.\nJuly 22, 1948.\n\nMr. R. G. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nNelson House U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nIt is presumed that you have discussed with Mr. Connolly of the Indian Health Services, the question of the joint erection of the nursing station and day school at Nelson House.\n\nWe have received a letter from Mr. Connolly concerning these arrangements and we note in the final paragraph that he states as follows:\n\n\"In regard to finishing the building, i.e., laying the floors, putting on the trim, doing the painting, etc., I do not wish to take any responsibility for this work.

Therefore, we are arranging to send him an accountable advance of $250.00 to cover immediate expenses in this regard.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMr. E. Law,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Law,\n\nNelson House Construction\n\nFollowing conversations with Inspector Davis and Superintendent Neary it has been agreed that as soon as the nursing station at the above point has been completed that the erection will proceed on the erection and finishing of the school. The Department has two carpenters engaged at Nelson House. They have already spent considerable time in the building of the foundation of the school and their services will be transferred for the erection work and finishing of the school. When the painter arrives at Nelson House and has finished painting the nursing station his services will also be transferred to the Affairs Branch for painting the school. It, therefore, is only necessary for you to obtain a heating man to do the installation of the furnaces and heating pipes. We feel you should plan to be present at shortly after September 1st. It would be advisable for you to keep in touch with Mr. John Johnson, North American Buildings Erector who is now on the site and find out when he will commence the erection of the school, and his general progress from time to time at that unit.\n\nOn completion of the school the erector and the two carpenters should be brought to The Pas to erect the garage for the doctor. Five Indian labourers should be supplied for this work at The Pas. In view of the fact that this important work is taken the erection goes to Nelson House and because the expenses we expect that you will make the necessary arrangements to bring the erector and two carpenters to The Pas and return them to Norway House. Will you kindly keep in touch with the progress of the work so there will be no delay and their work may be expedited at Norway House. It will be necessary for you to contact Mr. Hughes occasionally in this respect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.J.

Some of the doors have swelled a bit since the heat has been put on and will have to be dressed down. A couple of lock sets should be replaced. I will take up this matter with the Prefabricators. Inside window stops were not put on in the basement windows and these will be attended to by a local carpenter. I arranged with a local Indian to build a railing around the back porch landing and steps. Arrangements were also made to have the grounds graded and drained.\n\nThe glazed door for the basement entry was wrecked in the transportation but was temporarily repaired and will have to be replaced next year. Lowererow of coats hooks should be provided immediately for the small children. A stove for the kitchen, a water cooler and pails should also be provided.\n\nI am told that chemical toilets are being provided for the basement installations this I do NOT recommend as the space provided is not ventilated and does not have a window. The outside facilities could be used for this year and provision made for the above next Spring. Also a mistake was made in placing the doors to the proposed toilets\u2014they are hung backwards, and should be changed before being put into operation.\n\nMr. Hutty (trader) and the Chief of the Band asked me to request that the Department turn over the old School for Community use. Mr. Hutty was at one time owner of this log building. And supplied frames windows and doors for its completion. Thus he has a personal interest init. He recommends that it should be disposed of 1. as a local community hall 2. as home for a deserving case 3. or to any benefit of the indian reserve but not to a non Indian person.\nWould give the above your generous consideration and advise the interested parties.\n\nI wired Mr. Law that the caretaker for the Nursing Station would not have time to look after the School and that he should have someone appointed immediately to make care of the fires and the cleanings. I tried to organize the Indians to clean the windows over the week-end. I hope it was successful. Dustbane should be supplied in ample quantity for sweeping. I requested Mr. Law to send in two kegs immediately.\n\nI expect that Mr. Law has arranged for painters to go in soon. I wired him that they should have the necessary quantity of paint with them on their arrival. Dr. Corrigan removed the paint from the Nursing Station and it will have to be resupplied. I advised Mr. Law to this effect.\n\nI trust the above matters meet with your approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nO'Connell MEIC\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your letter of October 15th, file 527-5(EL), regarding painting Nelson House United Church School, the paint for this building has just arrived in The Pas, as Dr. Corrigan flew into Nelson House and took the paint for the school along with that of the Nursing Station to Norway House.\n\nI will be unable to finish the work on this building until after freeze-up. As no authority was given to anyone to use this building before floors and painting was done, however, this school has been in use for sometime now and I do not know the condition of the floors. It is almost impossible to secure a sander in The Pas, so I would like to have authority to have these floors sanded by hand before applying the varnish.\n\nIn regards the toilets for the school, I mentioned to you in Winnipeg that new ones were made a year ago for the old school and I would have them moved up to the new school.\n\nIn regards to the old school I believe this is an excellent idea in using this for a community centre, as the band on the whole would be benefitted by this, I would suggest that it should be moved near to the sports field before being put in use for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Law\nSupt. Indian Agency.\nNovember 13, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. PRATT.\n\nRe: Nelson House, Manitoba.\n\nIn a letter dated October 11th from Mr. C.J. Connolly of the Indian Health Services we were informed as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Hutty (trader) and the Chief of the Band asked me to request that the Department turn over the old School for Community use. Mr. Hutty was at one time owner of this log building. And supplied frames windows and doors for its completion. Thus he has personal interest in it. He recommends that it should be disposed of 1. as a local community hall 2. as home for a deserving case 3. or to any benefit of the Indian Reserve but 4. not to a non Indian person. Would you give the above your generous consideration and advise the interested parties?\"\n\nWe have forwarded a copy of this letter to Superintendent Law and asked him to let us have his comments regarding the suggestion that the old school be used for a Community Centre. In a recent reply he writes as follows:\n\n\"In regards to the old school I believe this is an excellent idea in using this for a community centre, as the band on the whole would be benefitted by this. I would suggest that it should be moved near to the sports field before being put in use for this purpose\".\n\nWe have no objection to the old school being used for the purpose suggested above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nNovember 13, 1948.\n\nMr. E. Law,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 25th ultimo regarding the painting of the Nelson House U.C. School.\n\nIt is noted that you will be unable to complete this work until after freeze-up.\n\nWe also approve your suggestion regarding the sanding of the floors. It is understood that you will keep the cost as reasonable as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/HN.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' report dated January 4th on the Nelson House U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nThe teacher of this school is Miss Ruth Jardine. She appears to me to be more or less untidy and a little sloppy in her methods. However, the school was not in operation when I visited, as it was early in the morning.\n\nMr. Grafton inspected the school after my visit and I am forwarding his report. There are 43 children on the roll and 25 of school age living around the village who are not attending school owing to a lack of accommodation.\n\nI would recommend that the old school building be repaired and another teacher hired to look after these pupils. I would estimate the cost of repairs at about $250.00. Some desks would be required, but for the time being tables could be erected by Mr. Arnfinson, who is a fairly good carpenter.\nTHE SPORT SHOP\nFRANK I. RITCHIE\nSPORTING GOODS & C.C.M.

Indian Day school at Nelson House,\n\nTeacherage. I understand the original plan was to have the school teacher stay at the Nursing Station. This however, was never put into practice, due to the fact that the nurse in charge did not find this satisfactory. I think in future accommodation for the teachers should be kept in mind in building new schools.\n\nI received word from Nelson House this spring that there was two inches of water in the basement of this school. My Assistant Agent on that Reserve was instructed to drain the basement and level off the ground to provide better drainage from the outside walls. Most of this water I believe drained into the basement from the stairway entrance on the outside of the basement. I would like to inspect this school further before making any suggestions in connection with the two room suite being put in the basement. I will be at Nelson House on my Treaty trip the end of July, and will advise you further on my return.\n\nToilet accommodation. On my inspection of this school last September while the erectors of this building were still there, I told them that chemical toilets were to be installed in the basement, according to our plans. I pointed out that proper ventilation should be provided for these toilets before they were installed. However, Mr. Connolly visited the school shortly after, and proposed that outside toilets be used. It was after his recommendation that I asked Col. Neary, when attending the Superintendent's Conference...\nin Winnipeg, if we could have the outside toilets from the old school, which had been recently built, moved to the new school, as the chemical toilets had not been shipped in. If there is to be a suite in the basement of this school, we will definitely require good ventilation for these toilets. A further check will have to be made to see whether this is possible, and I will include this information in my report, after the Treaty trip.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Law\nSupt.

F. Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAcknowledging your letter of June 30th, file\n527-5 (E), in connection with Nelson House U.C. Indian\nDay School.\n\nOn a recent visit to this school with our\nRegional Supervisor, Mr. R. S. Davis, we discussed the\npossibility of installing chemical toilets in the basement\nof this school, and we decided against this, as there is\nno means of obtaining adequate ventilation now, and there\nis a possibility that we might have to build another\nclassroom in the basement.\n\nWe have enough children on this Reserve to fill\ntwo classrooms, but the average attendance is much lower\nthan it should be. The reason for this is that during\nthe trapping season the trapper takes all his family to\nthe trap line, leaving the classroom practically empty for\nabout two months. Until we make them see the necessity of\nleaving their wives and children at home I don't think it\nadvisable to send materials in for a second classroom in\nthe basement.\n\nI instructed the Assistant Agent at this point to\nput more fill around the basement walls, and this should\nprevent further trouble with water in the basement.\n\nI have arranged for the teacher to obtain board\nand room with the Assistant Agent at his home, but I am\nincluding in next year's estimates, a small building to be used as a teachersage.\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nE.

SCHOOL BUILDING\nClassrooms-number, condition, lighting, ventilation, heating, paintwork; water supply; power; janitor service; basement; cloakrooms.\n\nOne classroom in this building.\nCondition: classroom - fair\nLighting: fair, more windows needed (see note)\nVentilation: poor\nHeating: furnace in basement -\nWater supply: lake\nPower: none\nBasement: very poor, fills up with water every spring and every rainfall.\nCloakroom: hooks and nails on wall of closet\n\n2. PLAYGROUND\nCondition, equipment, adequacy.\n\nPublic compound and thoroughfare in front of school used as playground. No equipment.\n\n3. TOILET FACILITIES\nLavatories, Wash basins, towels, drinking facilities.\n\nOuthouses: a disgrace (see note)\nNo washing facilities\nNo drinking\n\n4. TEACHER'S RESIDENCE\nCondition, furniture.\n\nFurnace needs repairs or replacement, seems to be dangerous at present\n\n5. INDUSTRIAL ARTS AND HOME ECONOMICS\nAccommodation, condition of plant, tools and equipment, supplies-tools and equipment.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nExtension repairs needed:\n\n1. Basement fills with water every spring or even every heavy rain. For the last eight years, nothing has been done, although promised many times. Water from the large field in front of the school passes around the school on its way to the river. It goes through the basement windows and cracks in basement walls and goes out the basement door at the rear when it has reached the door's level (three ft.)\n\nFOR ACTION BY\n\nSCHOOL INSPECTOR\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 527-5, part 2)\nIn my opinion, a dike-wall should be built in front of the school and two canals or ditches on each side of the school. (preferably cement) this would stop the water from getting to the school and would allow it to run to the river without passing through the basement. This was recommended seven years ago by a would-be engineer but was never carried out.\n\n2. Lighting: More windows are needed in front. Two windows were recommended 6 yrs. ago. This was approved but somehow only one was installed.\n\n3. No light in vestibules: When outside door and classroom door (inside) are closed, there is complete darkness in the small vestibule. The outside door should be fitted with a window pane.\n\n4. Toilets: They are an absolute disgrace. This is the worst I have seen for many years. Doors have fallen off of their hinges. Very dirty, the sight of them is enough to make a person throw up. (In fact I nearly did.)\n\n5. Washing facilities: At present there is no washing facilities at this school. Washstand, basin, slop pail and reservoir urgently needed.\n\n6. Drinking facilities: At present no drinking facilities.\n\n7. Blackboards at back or room just nailed to wall, no chalk trough.\n\n8. Cloakroom: this consists of hooks and rails on wall of closet. Rod, shelf, hangers type would easily be installed in closet at side of room. (back)\n\n9. Kitchen now being used as a storeroom for books, supplies etc. If shelves put up in front cloakroom closet, all supplies could be stored there.\n\nThis could be a nice practical classroom if organized properly. Right now it is not good.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 527-5 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT NELSON HOUSE\nU.C.

If he teaches continuously each school day until the end of July, he will have completed a full teaching year of ten months. This will only allow the month of August, next, as summer holidays, as it is expected the school will reopen again on the 1st of September, 1926.

This did not reach here until September 8th and, in paying the teacher's salary for the quarter ended March 31, 1932, a 10% deduction was made.

Last\nwinter all my potatoes,\nten bags, froze, and this\nwinter the same thing\nhappened to the twelve\nbags I had and all my\ncanned vegetables froze also.\nTo me, it is quite a\nloss as the cost of living\nis very high up here.\n\nAll the pupils whose\nallowances had been\nsuspended now got\ntheir refunds and are\nattending a hundred per-\ncent.\n\nYours truly\nRoland S.

Owing to lack of authority from the Department to go ahead, I have not been able to do much except keep it in the best of repair, without spending too much money. I received authority from the Department in 1946 to put siding on the teacherage, but found it impossible to buy same. I expect to be in Nelson House towards the end of March, and will give this school and teacherage a thorough over-hauling, and will make my recommendations upon my return.\n\nI might add that this teacher, Mr. Leuze, is very dissatisfied with everything in connection with his work, probably due to the fact that his salary is low, and I sincerely think that he should be given an increase.\n\nHoping this will clear this matter up to your satisfaction, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 528-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 28th, 1947.\n\nMr. S.

It is noted that you intend to visit Nelson House about the end of March and that you will report further when you return to your office.\n\nWith regard to your recommendation about the teacher's salary, I enclose one of our regular application forms which you should have Mr. Lauze complete and return.

Thus, we will have on hand by the Spring a complete bill of materials as required for a one-room school. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Superintendent Law and am attaching thereto copies of the standard bill of materials for this school. It would be appreciated if Mr. Law could submit a requisition attached to one copy of this bill of materials. On this requisition he can indicate the names of local suppliers for the lumber required. It is presumed that it would be cheaper to buy the lumber in The Pas than in Winnipeg. However, we will await your comments concerning this.\n\nIt is not necessary to have this bill of materials retyped on the requisition form but merely state on the requisition form as follows -\n\n\"To bill of materials as required for standard one room school with attached teacherage.

Please find attached a map prepared presumably by the local missionary, and sent here by Father Plourd.\n\nMajor Clark states that the missionary has weakened his case a little by implying that children from Dog Point homes do not attend as well as those from homes numbered 8 to 19 inclusive.

School. I am enclosing copy of a letter from Mr. Law, which is self-explanatory.\n\nMr. Law has recently visited Nelson House and he suggests putting the school where the old teacherage now stands - which is on the Church property. I am still of the opinion that the school should be put on the reserve at Dog Point. However, as the lumber is on hand at the old teacherage site it would probably be as well to go ahead with the building of the school there.\n\nThis property I understand is owned by the Church and they probably will be transferring an acre or two of land to the Department. The transfer should take place before the building commences. In this connection I believe it will be necessary for a Surveyor to survey this land.\n\nPlease advise by wire if it is satisfactory to build the school near the Church in order that the gravel may be sent in at once.\n\nYou will note by the sketch, which I am returning herewith, that we will have to secure some land for a playground between the school and the Rectory. I have marked same with red pencil. The land marked out for the school site would not be large enough\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Davis:\n\nAcknowledging your letter of February 4, 1949, your file 208-4A, in connection with the location of the Nelson House R.C. day school.\n\nI have just returned from Nelson House, and a lot of the materials for this school have been checked and stored in Mission buildings to protect it from the weather. There is a considerable amount of materials to go in yet. Mr. Launz will forward bills of lading as soon as everything has arrived.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I would suggest that the new school be located near the old teacherage, where the materials are now stored. At the time when these new materials will be needed it would be next to impossible to secure any means of having them hauled to the location on Dog Point, and the cost would run into hundreds of dollars, as it is only a rough trail. There is no storage space at Dog Point, so they could not be moved in the winter. There are only two teams at Nelson House, one owned by Indians and one by Mr. Hutty. Mr. Hutty requires his full time for his own use, and I doubt if the other team could pull half a load even to Dog Point.

School at Nelson House, I have been in contact with Mr. McKenzie who built the school of the same type, at the Peguis Reserve last year. Mr. McKenzie has given me his contract price of building this school as $6420.00. I do not consider this price too high as the price of wages has increased and the cost of living would be much higher at Nelson House than outside.\n\nWould you please advise me as soon as possible in order that I may let Mr. McKenzie know, and he can make preparations to go in at an early date.\n\nI am stating that we have a house to build in the Nelson House Reserve.

This tender covers all transportation and boarding costs and is felt to be fair and reasonable.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the erection of this building as outlined above, this being the most suitable arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried on to completion in order to provide educational facilities for the Indian children of the Nelson House Reserve.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, May 9, 1949.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.\n\nRequesting authority for the provision of a one-room Indian Day School on the Nelson House Indian Reserve, The Pas Agency, Province of Manitoba, for which funds are provided in the 1949-50 Estimates.\n\nTwo extra copies of Order-in-Council are required.\nOttawa, May 9, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nNelson House R.C.

The following is what we will supply.\n\nWe are prepared to provide all supervision, labor, board, and lodging to build the above mentioned school. For a lump sum price of $6250.00.\n\nI might add I have a crew now building a house at Norway House for the registered trap lines and as they will be finished in approximately 2 weeks. I would be prepared to move them to Nelson House.\n\nI Remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Matthews\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

are provided in the 1949-50 estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, to complete the erection of a one-room Indian Day School on the Nelson House Indian Reserve, The Pas Indian Agency,

Day School\nYour File No. 205-7 (128)\n\nWe have your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing the attached assignment from the Matthews Construction Company to the Dominion Bank at The Pas, Manitoba, in connection with the tender that has been accepted for the erection of the above mentioned school.\n\nI enclose the regular power of attorney form which the company will have to complete in duplicate. On receipt of this form properly filled out, the matter will be submitted to the Treasury Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nAir Mail\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have just returned from Nelson House where the R.C. School is being built. The school is well underway and they are making a very good job of it. The basement has just been completed. It was noted that water could be secured in the basement without going very deep.\n\nI instructed Mr. Arnfinson, Assistant, Indian Agency, Nelson House to have a well dug and cribbed with material we have on hand at a cost of not more than $100.00. I hope my action meets with your approval. I would request that you forward a $100.00 advance to Mr. E. Law, Superintendent, The Pas, in order that he may pay the men while working on the well.\n\nWhile the school is fairly near the lake it is on a high hill and it will be necessary for someone to haul water. Therefore, a well will certainly be a great asset to the school.\n\nR. S.

Neary, Superintendent\nof Indian Education\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 28, 1949, file No. 528-5 (E) regarding the old school and teacherage (R.C.) at Nelson House. The school and teacherage are of very little value being old log buildings. It was my intention to have these buildings pulled down and the material given to the Indians to build homes. I still feel this would be the solution to disposing of these buildings.\n\nI am certainly not in favour of the buildings being used for dances etcetera as social events could be held in the school. If the Church authorities need these buildings for any special purpose, and as they will be used by them for the benefit of the Indians, I feel it would be in the interest of all to hand them over to them at a cost of not more than $50.00.\n\nR. G. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nNovember 9, 1949.\n\nDear Father Pleurde:\n\nNelson House Indian Day School\n\nI have now received a report from Mr. Regional Supervisor Davis indicating that it is his intention to have these buildings demolished and the material given to Indians for the purpose of building homes.\n\nI presume from your letter that the Bishop would be in favour of this plan. Naturally, Mr. Davis agrees that these buildings should not be used for a dance hall or other entertainment centre.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you as to whether it would be the Bishop's wish to purchase these buildings or whether he is prepared to have them used for the purpose indicated by Mr. Davis.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard E.

There were, however, numerous reasons offered given why the children not attend. Some said the school was too far away off, some of the children had but scanty clothing, others were needed at certain times to help their parents, and it was hard for smaller ones to come.\nto school alone. Some alleged they had tried to induce their children to come to school and had not succeeded.\n\nThe Chief was of the opinion that the parents needed urging and he proposed going around among them with his party tomorrow with this object. I imagine this action on the part of the Chief will have the desired effect, as numbers of people have promised to send their children more regularly.\n\nSo the school is a very important part of the work at this mission. I regret very much it is not more successful. With the other part of Mr. Houttard's work, I am very well pleased. The attendance of the Indians on Sundays, the neat and tidy way in which improvements have been made in the mission premises, in the past year, and last, but by no means least, the progress made in the language all convince me that Mr. Houttard has qualities that fit him for the position he holds.\n\nAnd now, my Lord,\nthat the importance of the school question has been upon both parents and teacher, I trust we shall have better things reported in the near future.\n\nLove, my Lord Bishop,\nSincerely yours,\n(ego) R. O'Harra,\nSuperintendent of Indian Missions\n\nTo Most Reverend\nMetropolitan\nDear Mr. Reed,\n\nA report dated September 15th was sent me from the Assistant Commissioner complaining of the unsatisfactory condition of the school at the Sioux River, Oak River school, under Mr. Hartland. I had heard something to the same effect at Birtle from the Agent there.\n\nThis report has been a matter of regret and surprise to us, as we have had every reason to suppose that we had in Mr. Hartland, a young man of devotion and ability, much above the average.\n\nWe sent Archdeacon O'Harra to visit the mission, Mr. Burman was unable to go with him. His general report of the mission work of Mr. Hartland was, as we had supposed and anticipated, it is very favorable and all who hear points to the same conclusion.\n\nBut the school is unsatisfactory. Archdeacon O'Harra made a separate report touching learning on the school, which I enclose.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The difficulty of any regular attendance has been always very great at that reserve.\n\nMr. Hartland seems to us to be carrying on the general work for the Indians so effectively and encouragingly that we regret very much that there is this difficulty about the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nW.

That if not at least four attend, they are sent home. That Chief Sinn has kept an account of the attendance for the year.\n\nNote. The first statement bears evidence of truth. The teacher admits that he only teaches half a day, and says that the pupils are exceedingly impractical. The instructor states that if only a few pupils attend they are sent home again. I requested the instructor to see Chief Sinn, as this information reached me as I was leaving by train, and to send me his statement of attendance. I append a copy of the same.\n\nExtract from letter of A.S. James, dated Oak River Dec. 22, 1891, addressed to Mr. Moore.\n\nAs you requested me to take Chief Sinn's statement about the school, I have done so. He cannot give me the dates, but he knows the months and how many days the school has been opened in each month. He says there was school for 10 days last April, 17 in May, and 6 in June, and that the school was not opened again till the 15th of October. Since then the school has been open a good part of the time. He says that he has spoken to the teacher, and the teacher told him he would not teach if there were less than 6 children.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I propose to apply in the first place to Mr. Cleaveland, for a young lady interested in mission work to come out and help me. He has promised considerable missionary assistance if I carry out this idea. Altogether I hope to raise $150 or $200 per year by the teacher's wages & for board. I do not at any time seek help which be a great advantage as the girls could be taught many useful arts. My mother is eager to see how this will turn out in this direction. If you think my plan feasible, kindly put the idea before Mr. Cleaveland. The Archivist is all well. In case I am allowed to carry out the plan do you think the Dept. would give a grant of $50 per year towards the expense.\nI asked Mr. MacKee's opinion on this matter. He thought it would be a good thing if I could get the assistance of a lady. He further thought that the Dept. would not object to the arrangement on condition that I be made responsible for the expenses.

Mayne Daly\nMinister of the Interior,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret very much to have to call your attention to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in connection with one of the Indian schools under my supervision. I refer to the Indian School among the Sioux Indians at Oak River near Griswold.\n\nFor some years, there has\nHas been an unpleasant correspondence between the teacher Mr. H. Hartland, in charge of the school, the Indian Agent Mr. Marke, and once in a while, the authorities at Regina.\n\nThe Archbishop of Rupert's Land has had numbers of letters written from these parties as well. The whole matter has been laid before me from time to time, and I have felt so keenly that there was so much of personal feeling mixed up in the matter, on all sides, that I had hoped a little advice, and a little patience would have brought about a more desirable state of things.\n\nMr. Hartland has been instructed.\nChurch Missionary Society\n\ninstructed to conform to the rules of the Department as closely as possible, and as far as he is able, to give satisfaction to the officials over him; but it seems quite clear that there is a desire to magnify trifles, and to make it hard to have all parties work together with the harmony and cooperation desirable.\n\nThirty years' experience among Indians has taught me that there is much to bear with even in trying to elevate them, and success need not be looked for if agent\nagent and teacher do not co-operate, and sink all petty feelings in the grand object of lifting these poor creatures on to the level of white men.\n\nI shall go up and visit the mission, have a talk with Mr. Hartland, and once more urge upon him the importance of doing his utmost, not only to elevate the Indian, but to give satisfaction to the Department; but I should like a word or two of advice given to Mr. Agent Markle to co-operate with Mr. Hartland, and instead of throwing the entire blame of the non-attendance of children...\nChurch Missionary Society.\n\nChildren upon the teacher, to make an effort to induce the parents to send their children with more regularity. I fear the times he has done this are but few.\n\nI never have to write the Department about any of the many schools in connection with our church. We generally get on without, but there is more trouble with the little school in Griswold than with all the others put together, and therefore I feel a word from head-quarters is called for.\n\nIn the other reservations, the\nThe Agents co-operate with the teachers to get a large attendance. I think this would succeed at Griswold.\n\nTrusting this matter will have your early attention,\n\nI am,\ndear Sir,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\nR. Phair,\nSept. Ind. Mission\n\nMy address is simply -\nVen. Archdeacon Phair\nWinnipeg\nOttawa, March 16th, 1894.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Reverend Archdeacon has written to the Department about the difficulties which have occurred relative to Mr. Hartland's school at the Oak River Reserve. He speaks of visiting the mission, and hopes that good will result, and expresses a hope that in order to assist towards the attainment of that very desirable consummation, you will do all in your power to induce the parents to send their children regularly to school, and I have no doubt you will do your best in the direction indicated. I may say, however, that while we have promised the Archdeacon to request you to meet his wishes in this respect, we have made it clear that the Department does not attribute any of the fault of lack of attendance in the past to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

You are aware that there is no upper floor in this building; if there was, it would steady the ends; and to guard against a mishap to building, I will be glad if you authorize me to get an iron bolt, 7/8\" or 1\", and have same placed through the building from one end to the other, and tightened up with nuts at ends that project through the wall; also if considered necessary, after that is done, a 4\"x4\" scantling placed on top of this rod, and fastened to the inside ends of building; or if you suggest a better way of overcoming this difficulty, I will carry it into effect.\n\nObediently,\n\nJ. A. Markle\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to the Return for the quarter ending 31st December 1903 of the Oak River Sioux school forwarded to the Department on February 13th accompanied by a voucher for a grant of $62.33 as for the 54 days school was open during the quarter.\n\nThe Return shows that a portion of the grant for December quarter was deducted viz., $12.12, through 10 days illness of teacher and 1 day on November 14th when school was closed and time not claimed as holidays.\n\nThe teacher has since requested that the 10\u00bd days referred to be reckoned as part of the 9 weeks holidays available for fiscal year 1903-04. I would therefore ask that a cheque be sent to him direct in his favour for a further grant of $12.12.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst Commissioner\n\nTo Deputy of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA 10th August 1924\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st inst:\nI beg to inform you that the 10\u00bd days of December Quarter last referred to therein during which the Oak River Sioux School was closed owing to the illness of the teacher will, in compliance with your request, be counted as part of the nine weeks' holidays allowed teachers of Indian Day Schools and a cheque therefor for $12.12 will be forwarded the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 1st instant I have to request that in future you will be kind enough when making requisition for teacher's salaries in cases where there is a doubt as whether a deduction should be made for holidays, to allow the payment for full time making deduction at the end of the year for holidays taken in excess of the number allowed by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nDuring my late visit to the Red River Reserve School, I inspected the day school, as the teacher was ill\u2014having furnished a doctor's certificate to that effect. I observed that there were no privies at the school, and as there are some 25 children on the roll, boys and girls, it is necessary that one should be provided.\n\nThe former could build a suitable one, if he were allowed, say $15 or $18 to buy materials (lumber, shingles, nails).\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector\n\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina,\nOct. 30th,\nDear Sir,\n\nI have spoken with Mr Agent Markle, with regard to your letter and will act on his advice viz: \"To leave the matter in your hands.\"\n\nAnd in future to try and meet the wishes of the Department.\n\nThe 13 days overdraft of holidays, I will deduct from holidays for next fiscal year, and time lost during present quarter, to be deducted from my grant.\n\nOn some occasions when school has been closed earlier than usual, the circumstances have been unavoidable.\n\nI will not however try to justify my actions, but will act differently in the future.\n\nI beg to thank you for your forbearance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.

Mr Agent Markle gave his sanction to my absence in Winnipeg but his letter was delayed, owing to his absence from home.\nSioux Mission,\nGriswold,\nSept 4th 1895\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I shall probably be leaving the Mission at a very early date, at the end of September if possible. This step is being taken in the interests of the School as a change of Teacher might prove beneficial in every respect. At present I have not any other position in view, and as I have my Mother to support, and winter will very soon be upon us, I beg to ask your favor with regard to the various sums which have been deducted from my salary, on account of illness and other causes.\n\nI shall leave here in very poor circumstances and shall have a hard matter to live until I get employment.\n\nI shall be glad if under these circumstances, you will use your influence in the matter stated above as the money, if only a small sum will be of very great service to me at this time. I beg to ask also if you will kindly ask for an early remittance of the salary which will be due me on my retirement from the work here as I shall need the money to go away with. Hoping to receive your favor,\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(signed) H Hartland\nAssistant Commissioner,\nRegina.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of 23rd would say that I have arranged to stay on here until end of December, or in case a successor is not appointed to take my place, shall remain until this matter is satisfactorily arranged.\n\nI saw Mr. Muckle and explained the matter to him. By remaining till end of December, I am completing three month's notice which I am entitled to, and which is required by the Church authorities according to agreement. From what I understood I expected that had I left here at end of present quarter my salary would have been paid till end of December; my supposition was incorrect, and consequently I shall not be moving till I receive further notice. To do so now would cause me great loss and inconvenience, which I cannot afford.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) H. Hartland.\n\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nSioux Mission, Griswold,\n9th October, 1895.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI again beg to appeal to you with regard to the different amounts deducted from my salary on several occasions.\n\nIt is my intention to retire from the Mission at end of December, and as my mother, (who is getting on in years, and who is entirely dependent upon me for her support) is anxious to return to England, I shall feel most grateful if you will use your influence with the Head Office with regard to the reductions.\n\nAlthough small the money under present circumstances would be of very great service to me. In any case I shall find it a difficult matter to get together sufficient funds to enable me to leave for England.\n\nI trust you will extend to me your kind favour in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) H.

These deductions were apparently made for unauthorized absences, and if Mr Hartland had performed his duties faithfully he would have received the full grant.

The attendance is very irregular, the reserve is large and the majority of the children live too far away to attend with any regularity.\n\nThe pupils so far have made but little progress, Mr. Harris appears to be doing his best but complains that it is impossible to make much headway. He thinks that the children should be forced to attend, I do not agree with him in this. My opinion is that the school should be closed, it cannot be made a success, as matters have been for the past year it is money thrown away. It is conveniently situated to two Industrial Schools where the children would be better trained than it is possible in a reserve day school.\n\nThe exterior of the school building requires\nrequires repainting, a sum was placed in the estimates for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nS.

E. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 19th. instant re the Oak River Day School, I may say the Teacher resigned, to take effect on the 31st. December last. Since then the school has been closed. On the 9th. ultimo I wrote His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land, enquiring whether he would select another Teacher for the position. He replied on the 16th. of the same month that he was anxious to keep the school open, if possible, but that the parsonage on the reserve, the only place where the Teacher could board, was so cold that it had to be abandoned for the winter. They intend to build a new mission house early in the spring, and when it is completed they would be glad to have a Teacher again appointed. I recommend that another opportunity be given His Grace to secure an attendance of pupils for the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 3, 1866.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., in reference to the Oak River day school, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will consent to give another opportunity to His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land to endeavour to secure a more regular attendance at this school before definitely ordering it to be closed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nExtract from Inspector Swinford's report on the Oak River and Pipestone Creek Reserves, dated 30th Nov. 1907\n\nThere is an easy remedy for this by transferring the present day-school building situated about one hundred feet from the agency house into an office. It is adapted for an office in every way and I very much doubt the possibility of its ever being required again for a school. In any event we have Industrial and Boarding schools adjacent both east, west, and north, that will take care of all the children the parents can be induced to have educated.\n\nAn office is necessary here, as during my visit the Indians were coming to interview the Agent from 9 A.M. until 9 P.M. and it was difficult to get any work done in the office. This will be better understood and realized when it is remembered there are about fifty-five farming Indians here who constantly require advice, disputes settled, and the hundred and one things the Indian thinks the Agent should help him in.\n\nThe day-school was closed for want of pupils at the time of my visit and no pupils had attended since the 4th September last. According to the register there are 33 children of school age in the vicinity of the school i.e., on the reserve, and the average attendance during the last three quarters has been as follows viz:-\n\nMarch quarter 5/619 Boys 3. Girls 7. Register\nJune 5/285 4 9\nSept. 1/003 1 6\n\nThe teacher informed me that he had done everything he\nhe could to induce the children to come, but without effect and he considered it useless to continue the school any longer, but was most enthusiastic in his arguments favoring the establishment of a boarding school there. However I did not encourage this as I am of the opinion the Industrial Schools at Brandon & Elkhorn and Boarding Schools at Birtle and Portage la Prairie can well take care of the educational problem on these reserves.\n\nNotes. It would be well to convert the school building into an office.\n\n(sgd) J.A.J.McK.\nAsst.Commr.\n\nI concur.\n\n(sgd) J.A.K.McK.\nAsst.Commr.\nSir,\n\nReferring further to your letter of the 27th instant upon Mr. Inspector Swinford's report of the 30th ultimo, I would direct your attention to the fact that nothing is said as to the statement in the report that the day school has been closed because no pupils have attended since the 4th September last, nor as to the recommendation of the Inspector that the School building be converted into an office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSee also correspondence\n7284032?\nRelate File\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, regarding the proposal to close the Indian School at Oak River Reserve, and convert the school building into an Agency office, I beg to say that there are no funds available for the purpose. If you consider that the project should be carried out you should make the necessary provision for expenditure in your estimates for 1909-1910.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nHon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, January 20th, 1910.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nAs Your Grace is aware the day school on the Oak River reserve was closed in the fall of 1907 on account of lack of attendance.\n\nThis is a point where it should be possible to maintain a good day school and the Department is of opinion that one of the features which militated against its successful operation in the past was the combining of the duties of teacher with those of the missionary. There are 121 children of school age on this reserve, many of whom are within a reasonable distance of the school, and it is thought that there should be a good field for an energetic teacher who could devote his or her whole time to the school work. The Department in making this suggestion is reflecting in no way upon the work of the Missionary, whose duties in administering to the spiritual needs of these Indians must be sufficiently onerous without having added to them those of teacher.\n\nIf Your Grace could secure for this reserve a capable female teacher with proper qualifications, whose heart would be in the work, the Department would be prepared to pay a liberal salary. It is presumed that a single teacher could board with the resident missionary as a former teacher did.\n\nThe Department realizes the great difficulty\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nexperienced by your Church in obtaining the services of devoted teachers; but, nevertheless, many have been found for the Indian school service, and of late it has been the policy of the Department to recognize the work of such in a substantial manner.\n\nThe Department would be glad to hear from Your Grace in reference to this matter at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nGriswold Agency  \nJanuary 1st, 1910\n\nSir,-\n\nXXX XXX XXX\n\nThe interest of Oak River Band in education is now and again expressed by questions as to the intentions of the Department re the pay school, and also as to the kind of schools this Oak River band is likely to get. At an early date there will likely be an expression of their combined wishes developed into concrete form.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(signed) J. Hollies  \nIndian Agent\n\nTo the Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYours of Jan. 20th, No. II6953/1 is to hand. It has been a great regret to me also that the School at Oak River had to be closed. When I was up there a short time ago I had an interview with some of the leading Indians and asked them to suggest any possible way by which the School could be reopened. They urged what almost every Reserve does, viz., that the only solution was the establishment of a boarding school in their midst. I told them that I did not think that at all practicable, at all events while the School at Ekhorn was in existence. I then broached the question of an \"improved Day school\". They appeared to take to that but they admitted that no school would succeed unless there was compulsory education. I asked how compulsory education could be carried out and their reply was \"by appointing constables on the Reserve of leading Indians\".\n\nAs to the securing of a competent lady teacher I shall be only too glad to cooperate with the Department in looking out one if you will kindly let me know what the salary will be. I cannot do anything without first knowing that. How would it do to experiment at Oak River with one of the proposed \"improved Day Schools?\"\n\nYours most truly\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Hawley is a graduate nurse and holds a teacher's certificate and the work she has accomplished on the reserve and in the school-room since her appointment in September, last, has exceeded the expectations of the Department. For a person with similar qualifications the Department would pay a salary of $50.00 a month. If it is not possible for Your Grace to secure a nurse and teacher, the Department will pay a salary of $500.00 to a competent teacher who\n\nMost Rev. S. P. Matheson, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Rupert's Land,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nholds a professional certificate.\n\nThe Department, in view of past experience with the Indians of this reserve, is not prepared at the outset to incur the large expenditure necessary to establish a day school of the improved type at Oak River. Should they show a disposition to avail themselves of the facilities it is now proposed to offer them to obtain an education for their children the Department would take into consideration the question of increasing the accommodation, etc., if necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1910.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to call Your Grace's attention to official letter of the 14th ultimo in reference to the appointment of a teacher to take charge of the Oak River School, which has been closed for sometime.

I have also received communication from the Indian Department regarding the same.\n\nBefore I applied for this position I was informed by His Grace, the Archbishop of Kingston, that the salary for the above position was at the rate of\nhiring a woman to do my housework which would mean about $350.00 per annum and that is my reason for saying I cannot see any way to accept this sum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nCharlotte Maggs.\n\n$500.00 per annum, but Jane now informed that it will be only at the rate of $350.00 per annum. I can't see any way to accept the appointment for less than $600.00 per annum. I would be willing to try the position at the pleasure of the Indian Department, as I feel confident I can make the school a success, as the wife of the missionary I have labored with him for the past five years, and I feel that I have the respect and confidence of the parents and their children.

(RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-1, part 1)\nTaken out of annual report for March 31, 1912,\nof Inspector S.J. Jackson, Stonewall, Man.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nThe state of affairs among the Indians in the\ninspectorate is good from the standpoint of having enough\nto eat and drink and good clothes to wear, but I should\nlike to see more interest taken by the Indians in the\neducation of their children. The Department of Indian\nAffairs is spending a very large sum of money every year\non the day school, and little or no benefit is to be seen.\nThe teachers, as a rule, are not capable of imparting what\nknowledge they possess, and some system of training should\nbe devised to prevent this waste of the public funds.\nThe day school on the Oak River reserve is still closed, not for want of pupils, but through the indifference of the Indians on the subject of education. Fourteen of the children are at Elkhorn Industrial School, also a few at the Brandon Industrial School; but there are seventy-two children on the roll of the reserve between the ages of six and fifteen, also twenty-five between fifteen and twenty, leaving say fifty without education owing to negligence on the Indians' part.\n\nOn the Oak Lake reserve there are about twenty school children who do not go to school. Birtle Indian Boarding School, they say, is too far away, and being Presbyterian, they are, through the influence of the lay-reader, kept from the Elkhorn School, which is less than forty miles from the reserve. The heads of the Presbyterian Indian work informed me that they will make a special effort to get these children to the Birtle Indian Boarding School as soon as their addition is finished.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA. October 5, 1912.\n\nThe Schools Branch,-\n\nIncl. I inclose herewith a letter from Mr. Aikins, M. P., to the Minister, regarding the school on the Oak River reserve at Griswold. Will you kindly let me have a full memo. regarding this.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, October 15, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nIn reference to Mr. Aikins' letter of the 30th ultimo to the Minister in regard to the need of a school on the Oak River Reserve at Griswold (Sioux) I beg to say that there was a day school in operation on this reserve for many years prior to 1908, when it was closed on account of the very unsatisfactory attendance, the average having dwindled down to one while the Rev. Mr. Maggrah was in charge.\n\nThis school was carried on under the auspices of the Church of England and continued for some years after it should have been closed for want of attendance.\n\nThe Department was in frequent correspondence with the church authorities regarding this school before it was closed and after that the correspondence was kept up with a view to having it re-opened under a competent teacher.\n\nIn June, 1911, the Archbishop of Rupert's Land suggested the engagement of Mrs. Maggrah, wife of the missionary\nmissionary, as teacher for this school. She was offered an initial salary of $300.00, which she declined, saying that unless she was paid an initial salary of $500.00 per annum she would not accept the position. The Department informed Mrs. Maggrah that it was not disposed to pay her that amount, as she was not a qualified teacher.\n\nArchbishop Matheson was then informed that, in view of the fact that the opening of this school was at best only an experiment and that as Mrs. Maggrah's qualifications were hardly satisfactory, it was considered advisable to continue the efforts to recruit children from this reserve for the Elkhorn and other industrial schools.\n\nThere are enough children on the reserve of school age to justify a day school being maintained there, if a competent teacher could be placed in charge, and the Department has signified its willingness to pay a fair salary to a qualified teacher, but past experience has shown that it is simply a waste of money to carry on the school with the class of teachers furnished by the church authorities.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean\nSecretary Admin Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAlong the line as we go we have had considerable trouble with the Roman Catholic religion and their school. The Catholic mixture causes division among the agency (Griswold). After all, Catholic religion is not a divine matter, but the matter of against one another attacking one to the other. For the sake of next generation this thing must be stopped, but we are powerless to meet this difficulty unless our Government and their Council to keep us out and be disposed clean out the illegal business going on with the Catholic, which is bad effect on our Indians' getting away. Mr. Morin has said that the meeting of the priest from Shell Island at Griswold, the Indians have had pretty near come to a fight.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-1, part 1)\nThe same priest came here (Peyton) and took James Kasto, wife & two girls away as he (priest) pay their fare to St. Appelle to return. The James Kasto family are Presbyterian, and not long ago a boy of Kasto went to Bertha & Church. So now the Kastos family in congregation state. This winter being done to Demar family on the same line. The priest sent him the Lasswell, his interpreter came along with considerable sums of money and took whole of Demar family away and leave two boys over there. But after a while Demar wanted his boys to return home and would send one of them to Bertha & Church. Demar said he had signed the application form for the boys and also not been member to the Catholic & Church but Demar said as priest paid their expenses both ways and he done according to the wishes of the priest but not legal. This also we would wish your Department to consider and let the boys to return home and send them to their own Presbyterian School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Thunder\nMissionary\nSir,\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find:\n\nAgents Report for the month of May.\nCopy of Agents Diary.\nCopy of Clerks Diary.\nDay School Report with snap shot of a few of the Pupils.\nBank Adjustment Account with Managers Certificate.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 8, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing reports and photograph of the pupils of the Oak River Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

She has been a Matron for two years and she seems to be just the person needed for this work; I think she could be got for $25.00 + board herself.\n\nIf the Department has decided to consider this matter, I should like to hear as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJas M.

Scott,\nDeputy Supt:General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI hope you arrived home safely; I am sorry that I did not see you again before I left Brandon.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to one of the subjects we were talking about on the train; the Oak River Day School has 26 pupils on the roll and last month the average attendance was 23; it is more than one teacher can manage properly, to teach, prepare a hot meal at noon and keep the school clean.\n\nI would advise that Miss Havard's salary be raised to $600-00 per year. The general salaries for teachers teaching this grade of work in Manitoba is $650-00.\n\nI take her out canvassing for pupils and we give her as much help as we can.\n\nI would recommend that a Matron be got as soon as possible to assist Miss Havard; two could work it better than one and they could live in the school and board themselves.\n\nIt would only cost about $60-00 to furnish two rooms.\n\nA good Matron could be got for $300-00 or $350-00 per year.\n\nI think the school is the best thing that could have been started on the Reserve; the Indians are taking a keen interest in it and it will be an excellent feeder for the Elkhorn Industrial School.\n\nKind regards to Mrs Scott and yourself and hoping that you will both be able to pay us a visit next year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIELD MATRONS ON INDIAN RESERVES\n\n1.\u2014Much of the ill health among Indians grows out of overcrowding in their small houses. Whenever more than two persons occupy space less than $10 \\times 10 \\times 10$ feet for each person, you should report matters to the office of the Indian Agent. You should urge upon the Indians the necessity of proper ventilation and the admission of fresh air by such means as are available. The Indians should also be advised against the practice of frequent overcrowding due to visiting.\n\n2.\u2014As the excessive infant mortality arises so frequently from artificial feeding, it is essential that mothers equipped with means to nurse their children. But as nutrition is essential to health, careful inquiry must be made in all cases where artificial feeding is utilized. Cow's fresh milk ought to be always available, but it is essential that it is served in clean utensils. It may be boiled, then be heated and kept the air several times into the can or well standing in cool water. Thereafter it must be placed in a box kept in ice or in a cellar or other cool place away from flies. It is equally essential that feeding bottles be replaced by a clean tin for the milk, and that special feeding utensils be provided. The dangers of giving cracked bread or other scarcely food until three months after birth, ought especially to be impressed on mothers.\n\n3.\u2014As personal cleanliness is very gradually learned, the mother is to be taught this especially for the sake of her child. The dangers of eye infection at birth (ophthalmia neonatorum) ought to be especially taught, and a warm solution of boracic acid used for cleansing the eyes for the first days after birth. This may be applied with good effect by pointing to individual cases of blindness in the band dating from birth. Similarly the daily bath for the baby, always in a warm room, must be insisted upon, and incidentally the keeping a supply of clean clothes for the baby should be urged.\n\n4.\u2014As the child grows he is able to play on the floor, and danger results from the dirt on the floor with tuberculosis infections too often prevalent in the small, badly kept houses. The duty first is to urge constantly the scrubbing and cleaning of floors, and for the baby it is essential that a clean sheet or rug be placed where it can creep about, so that it does not come into the dirt on the floor. It is certain that the tubercular infection is transmitted thus rather than any other way.\n\n5.\u2014When the child is running about, the dangers are lessened in a degree, as he can get into the fresh air; but it is the general experience that the next great danger to the infant is when contagious diseases, as measles or whooping cough, occur. The mother is too often ignorant of the nature of these diseases, and the first sickness is generally allowed out of bed only to die from supervening pneumonia due to cold and exposure. You should insist on these children being kept in bed until the bronchitis and cough have passed in measles, and during the feverish stage of whooping cough. When scarlet fever or diptheria occurs, insist on a physician being called.\n\nAs you may be at a distance from a medical officer, it is well to know that parasitic diseases, such as pediculi and ringworm, are liable to affect the school children. For such cases a mixture of tallow calamine and salicylic acid of quick lime and sulphur in parts of 1 to 1, and boil them well for two hours and then work them into an ointment with fresh fat, if no vaseline can be procured. For cockroaches in houses, sprinkle borax generously around the cracks of the floor and see that bedsteads are carefully cleaned with oil if they become affected.\n\n6.\u2014Practical instruction should be given when possible in plain cooking, sewing, washing and the cutting and mending of garments, as well as other branches of knowledge essential to proper management of a home.\n\n7.\u2014These are hints that will prove of much value when each Field Matron succeeds in gaining, through kindly interest, the confidence of the housekeeper. Through such visiting the teacher will succeed in getting parents to see that their children attend school regularly.\n\n8.\u2014You should keep a diary and you will be expected to make monthly reports showing the nature and extent of duties performed. This report should be forwarded through the office of the Indian Agent.\n\nDUNCAN C. SCOTT,\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to letter from Mr. Agent McDonald in which he recommends that the salary of Miss Havard, teacher of the Oak River Day School, be raised from $500.00 to $600.00 and that she be allowed a matron to assist her. I beg to say that the returns from this school show that there is an enrolment of 23 for the June quarter with an average attendance of 15.7. Mr. McDonald says that the enrolment has increased to 26 with an average attendance of 23 and that it is more than one teacher can manage properly and prepare a hot meal at noon and keep the school clean. If this is the only work the matron would be required to do there would be no need to have one, as an Indian girl could be hired for $10.00 a month who would look after the preparation of the meal and the cleaning of the school, but as there are 322 Indians on the reserve there would be ample field for the services of a competent field matron.\n\nMr. Agent McDonald has again written stating that he can secure the services of Miss Florence Blake, who\nwho has been a matron for two years and would be a suitable person for the work. He says that her services could be obtained for $325.00 a year and she would board herself.\n\nIf the Department approves of the appointment of a field matron her duties should not be confined to the school, but she should be required to take up the work outlined in the Memorandum of Instructions for Field Matrons on Indian Reserves approved by you, a copy of which is attached hereto.\n\nMiss Havard had nine years' experience in teaching in England and came highly recommended.

The said priest who came to our Reserve lately and confer with his adherents and said the day school on the Reserve here is a sin for the people. Therefore I have to advise to my adherents that they should not sending their children to the day school.\nhere but send to my school at Japppelle so they took one child namely my little Watson who's belonging to my school here without notifying her mother she mother is very sorry and crying after her girl for home. Further the more about pulling the half of this band by the said priest which is causes more trouble to our Band and smashed up the good will gone towards another. Some of the people who has been baptized under our church he (the priest) Baptized them over again so on the breaking the Sacred Rite. If we only can keep one Religion here would suit us here all as it has\nbeen before.\n\nNow again we pray very humbly to your kindly will to consider our rights again again as to the days school we have had enough children to establish a good days Boarding School here if not we shall be obliged to send them elsewhere.

I think it would be advisable to send this child back to the Reserve with Mrs J.

Are you a member of the English Church on the Reserve.\nA. No, but I attend there sometimes and Mabel was baptised in the English Church on the Reserve.\n\nQ. What Church do you belong to?\nA. Presbyterian.\n\nQ. What School do you want your child to go to when she is old enough?\nA. Portage la Prairie Boarding School; where I was educated myself.\n\nI think there has been a lot of unnecessary excitement in regard to this.\n\nI do not know of any interference by the Priest with the Oak River Day School except that this girl was a Pupil there.\n\nAs soon as I found out she had left the Reserve I did all in my power to have her returned. It was the Grandmother who took the child; not the Priest.\nI expect this child will be returned to the Reserve shortly and I will see that the Mother of the child looks after her. This child was going to the Oak River Day School and was getting along well. I think some notice should be given to the Teacher or Agent before they are taken away.\n\nThe Teacher, Mrs. McDonald and myself have done our best to make the School a success but we are the only ones who are working for it on the Reserve.\n\nSince the authorities at Qu'Appelle have decided to return this girl I do not see what more we can do about it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 6, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th ultimo in further reference to Mabel Wasuda, who was placed in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and is to be returned to the reserve on religious grounds, and enclosing a copy of a letter from the Principal of that school stating that this girl will be returned to her mother, who is a Protestant.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion that some notice should be given to the teacher or agent before a child is taken away from a day school, as was done in this case, and placed in an industrial school I beg to say that the Department requires that this should be done and you will be good enough to see that this rule is carried out in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Kindly advise the Department why you decided to make this change in the holidays for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Stewart\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

McDonald,\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 23, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you state that you closed down the day school on the Oak River Reserve on Tuesday as a precautionary measure on account of the epidemic of influenza, I beg to say that your action in this matter is approved. You should see that this school is not kept closed any longer than is necessary and you should instruct the teacher, when making out her returns for the current quarter, to state thereon the number of days the school was closed on this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGriswold, Man.\nGriswold Manitoba,\nNovember 12th, 1918.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Day School on the Reserve is not opened yet as the quarantine is still on the Reserve, but the epidemic of Spanish Influenza seems to be past now, unless some new cases crop up.\n\nJas. McDonald,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 427041-33 of the 19th instant advising me that Miss Inches has resigned her position as matron on the Oak River Reserve.\n\nIt seems to me that the suggestion to pay Miss Havard $10.00 per month to cover the extra services rendered by her in cooking the mid-day meal until such time as a new matron has been engaged, should be adopted. The objections which Miss Havard has to residing alone on the reserve during the winter could not have been raised if the Agent's house was situated on the reserve as it ought to be. A change was made from the reserve to the town of Griswold some years ago, but I think it would be an opportune time to consider the erection of a house for the Agent on the reserve, where accommodation could then be provided for the school teacher and matron.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgm. W.M. Graham.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nCommissioner.\nOttawa, 3rd September, 1918.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th August in which you reported that Miss Indhes, the field matron at the Oak River Reserve left recently, I beg to say that the Department will make payment at the rate of $10.00 a month to Miss R. Havard for cooking the mid day meal and doing other necessary work on behalf of the Indians until other arrangements are made. You will be expected to see that the teacher is driven to and from the reserve, and that no expense other than that above referred to is incurred under the present arrangement.\n\nYou have stated that it will be necessary to have a matron reside on the reserve with the teacher during the winter. If you hear of a woman who is likely to fill the position of matron to advantage, you should make full report in the matter to the Department immediately when the question of her employment will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJas. McDonald Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCriswold, Man.\nOttawa, 18th, June, 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant, I beg to say that, pending further arrangement for field matron work at the Oak River Reserve, the Department will make payment of an additional $10.00 a month to Miss Havard, the teacher, for her services since the 1st of May, 1920, in preparing the mid-day meal at the Oak River Day School, and in attending to other duties which would naturally fall to the lot of the field matron, if one were employed. Payment in Miss Havard's favour will be made upon presentation of vouchers duly certified by you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJas. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGriewold,\nMAN.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Miss R. Havard, the Teacher on the Oak River Reserve informs me that the Church wishes her to move to another Reserve so that they can combine the duties of the Church and School on the Oak River Reserve.\n\nI do not think Miss Havard is very anxious to change places, as it is farther North and the remuneration is no more than she is receiving here.\n\nI do not approve of changing Teachers on the Reserve, as the Teacher Miss Havard has been here seven years and has done excellent work. I have my doubts if the next one will stay any length of time in this work; so far, there have been three different Missionaries on the Reserve in the seven years and if the Teacher changed as often I do not think the children would make the same progress they have been doing.\n\nIndian Children are bashful and hard to get along with at first.\n\nDoes the Department approve of this change? So far, we have received no word from you in regard to this.\n\nMiss Havard's Quarter does not run out until Sept 30th and she has been teaching the first two weeks in July would it be necessary for her to remain here until the end of the quarter in order to get her holiday money that she is entitled to or shall I send in the returns to August 31st?\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJas. W. Donald.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 30, 1920.\n\nRef. Sir,\n\nThe Department is informed that it is the intention to remove Miss R. Havard from the position as teacher on the Oak River Reserve to some other reserve, in order that the duties of church and school may be combined on the Oak River Reserve. Our Agent, Mr. McDonald, has said several times that he does not approve of this change in teachers, as Miss Havard has been on that reserve seven years and has done excellent work, also that she is not very anxious to make a change.\n\nI should be pleased if you would state whether it is the intention to make the above change and, if so, what arrangements you are making to continue the work at Oak River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, July 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you inform the Department that it is the intention of the church authorities to remove Miss R. Havard, the present teacher at the Oak River Reserve, to another reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Rev. J. H. Edmison, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, is being written to regarding the proposed change. As soon as a reply is received from him you will be further advised.\n\nI may say that your letter was the first intimation that the Department has received that there was a change contemplated in the teacher at this school. If Miss Havard begins duties at another school her salary would be continued without any reduction for annual holidays, but if she resigns or leaves her present duties salary can only be allowed her for the period which she taught since the first instant and in that event returns should be prepared by her showing the attendance and days taught. If she is to be continued at Oak River, it will not be necessary to forward a return for the current quarter until the end of September, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJas. McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGriswold, Man.\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nAss't Deputy and Sec'y.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:- Your No. 116953/1.\n\nI have yours of July 20th, in which you intimate\nthat we are planning to remove Miss R. Havard from the position\non the Oak River Reserve. This communication should have gone\nto some other denomination, as Miss Havard is not one of our\nteachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EMoC.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-1, part 1)\nOttawa, August 9, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is informed that it is the intention to remove Miss R. Havard from the position as teacher on the Oak River Reserve to some other reserve, in order that the duties of church and school can be combined on the Oak River Reserve. Our Agent, Mr. McDonald of Griswold, states that he does not approve of this change in teachers, as Miss Havard has been on that reserve seven years and has done excellent work, and also that she is not very anxious to make a change.\n\nAs Miss Havard was appointed teacher of this school on your recommendation, I should be pleased if you would state whether it is the intention to make the above change and, if so, what arrangements are being made to continue the work at Oak River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

D. A. B. Steedhart, a clergyman of long experience and a graduate of the Manitoba University, who accepted it, but after meeting the Agent refused to go.\n\nThe position has now been offered to the Rev. T. D.\nDiocese of Rupert's Land\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\n\nAugust the 13th 1920,\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYour letter addressed to Canon Jeffery re Miss Havard and the proposed change on the Oak River Reserve, has been handed to me for reply.\n\nPrevious to leaving for England, His Grace the Archbishop instructed me to visit the Reserve with a view of making some arrangement for the appointment of a resident clergyman, and suggested the combination of Church and School if found advisable.\n\nFor some time past, and indeed since the resignation of the Rev. A. Birch some two years ago, we have carried on the work with the assistance of two local Catechists and a monthly visit of an ordained man, but this has been found entirely unsatisfactory and a return to the former state advisable.\n\nThe Indians refuse to contribute to the stipend of a clergyman believing it to be the duty of the Church, or the Department, to provide such without cost. Hence we have found it extremely difficult in the past to attract good men to the work, or to keep them in it for any length of time, on the stipend which the Church is able to offer. Thus it was considered in\nOttawa, August 17, 1920.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant regarding the proposed change in teachers on the Oak River Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the arrangement made for the combination of teacher and missionary on this reserve and of the appointment of Rev. T. D. Conlin to carry on the work of teacher to replace Miss Havard. The Department will continue salary to Mr. Conlin at the same rate as was allowed Miss Havard, namely, $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools. It is presumed that Mr. Conlin will be prepared to take up his duties as teacher when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays, on or about the first of September, next.\n\nIt is noted that Miss Havard has been offered and has accepted the position as teacher at the new school on the Peguis Reserve. Her appointment as teacher of this school, which is known as the Peguis Center School, is approved. Her salary will be at the same rate as was paid her at Oak River.\n\nMr. Agent McDonald, Griswold, is being informed of the approval of the Department of the appointment of Rev. T. D. Conlin at Oak River and Mr. Agent Carter of the appointment of Miss Havard as teacher of the Peguis Center Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen.

T. D. Conlin, of Fairford, who, previous to entering the ministry, was a professional teacher in England and who formerly taught at Shoal River. The Department is approving of the appointment of Mr. Conlin as teacher of the Oak River Day School and will allow him a salary as teacher at the rate of $600.00 per annum together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 during the time it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nMiss Havard\u00e9, the late teacher, has been offered the position as teacher of a new day school which is being started on the Peguis Reserve, and the Department is informed that she has accepted this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst.

T. D. Conlin of Fairford, who, previous to entering the ministry, was a professional teacher in England, has recently taught at the Shoal River Indian Day School, has been appointed as teacher and missionary at Oak River. The Department is approving of his appointment as teacher and will allow him salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus during the time it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nMiss W. Havard, who formerly taught at Oak River, has been offered and has accepted the position as teacher in the new day school which is being opened on the Peguis Reserve and which is known as the Peguis Center Indian Day School. Her appointment as teacher of this school is approved, with salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum and the bonus.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M.

This I could not do on a quarter's salary and I doubt, at the price of things today whether it could be done on a six months' salary, and this\nSchool (Peguis) is not on an equal\nto the one I am now at.\nI am hoping the church\nor the Department will find me\na more convenient school very\nshortly, as I would like to\ncontinue in the Indian work.\nI want to finish out the\nSeptember quarter here.\nI have the honour to be\nyour obedient servant\nR.

There has been a misunderstanding somewhere as she has not accepted the position as Teacher on the Peguis Reserve; this business seems to have been carried out in a very peculiar way.\n\nI would advise that Miss Havard be allowed to teach at the Oak River Day School until the end of September.

The Agent advises that Miss Havard be allowed to teach at the Oka River Day School until the end of September, in order that she can obtain her full salary for the quarter and he states that after the end of September she would not care who the church put in her place.\n\nAs she is an old teacher and has given satisfaction, the Department would be pleased to accede to her wishes as far as possible and, if Rev. T. D. Conlin has not taken up his duties, it might be well to allow Miss Havard to remain till the 30th of September, next. However, this matter will be left in the hands of yourself and the church authorities, but I should be pleased if you would communicate with Mr. James McDonald, Indian Agent, Griswold, Man., regarding the matter.\n\nMiss Havard considers that she has not been fairly dealt with and the Agent states that she informed him on the 23rd instant that she did not give anyone to understand that she would accept the Peguis School.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher for the new school on the Peguis Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nVen.

McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGriswold, Man.\nCHURCH OF ENGLAND OBSERVES CENTENARY\n\n(Continued from Page 1)\n\naccomplished the work which had been outlined for the church to do.\n\nThe present age, he said, was an age of mental unrest. Many circumstances were in mental distress. For such people there was only real comforter, but it was necessary that they should turn their hearts to Him if they were to obtain that comfort which He offers. There was no other source of real comfort in the world which could provide relief.\n\nAgain and always blind, Dr. Peck gave a missionary message in which he declared that God had called him to preach Christ. That mandate must be known His marvelous works. Today, he said, the world's greatest need was the Savior. The most monumental work among the Indians would be done by the church because they had never improved the situation. If the church did not succeed, he said, as it had in the past, surely Bishop Reeves deals with Christ's commandment to His church to go into all the world and preach the gospel. The church had been, to some extent, successful in its activities and to some extent had tried to carry out its mission. The missionary work, however, had been done by those who had been given the same power which had enabled the Jewish church to carry the message from different nations was manifest today. The church must have the desire to learn the Indian language and culture in order to reach the people of the north.\n\nIn about 120 years, he said, much had been accomplished in Western Canada. In 1874, when he came, there was not a single Christian Indian, while today there are thousands of Christians. For the work which had been accomplished, he said, he was thankful. The Church of England had been the first to bring Christianity to the north than any other missionary organization. Much had been achieved, he said, but the present work must be continued. The Forward Movement would be carried on by the church with new objectives, and the present day members of the church must be prepared to meet their responsibilities if the church is to continue to exist.\n\nRev. Canon B. W. Heeney, of St. John's Anglican Church, spoke briefly, emphasizing the importance of the Christian church to obtain the spiritual welfare of the Indians. He said, \"If the church does not pick up the Indians, something being done, the government will take over.\" He then introduced Rev. J. F. Ahenakew, who said that he came to Manitoba in 1874, being one of the first three Indians sent by the Anglican church to go to Saskatchewan and the Red River district. He was also the author of the well-known book, \"Red Indians of Canada.\" He said, \"I have spent my whole life in missionary work among the natives. I have translated much translation work during my missionary career, including the Bible and other northern points.\"\n\nHe then spoke of the remarkable development of the Anglican church in Western Canada, since he started his work 139 miles north of Edmonton. In those days, he said, he had to supervise the work of the church throughout the whole of Alberta and Saskatchewan, while today, these provinces are divided into three dioceses, having three bishops and an archbishop.\n\nAt the Sunday school service in the afternoon, Dr. Peck took an active part in the morning service addressed by Mr. Ahenakew. An interesting feature of this service was the singing of hymns by the Indians present quoted or sang the hymn, \"Jesus, Lord of All,\" in several different Indian dialects.\n\nMr. Ahenakew is in the city to attend the Anglican centenary celebration. He said he would visit Holy Trinity church some time this week. He said he intended to continue his study of medicine, as he intended to serve the Indians in the capacity of a medical missionary.\n\nAT HOLY TRINITY\n\nOct. 10, 1920.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think if you will look up the reports of the Teacher the Missionary has not been more than four times a year to visit the School for the last\nthree years, they took absolutely no interest in it at all; after all the time and trouble I have taken with this School I hate to see it turn out to be a failure, and they got rid of the best Teacher they will ever have; naturally I feel sore at the way things have turned out.\n\nAnother thing, Miss Havard was Teacher for the last six years and she advanced the children faster in one year than three years than she did the three years previous because she understood the Indians and knew how to handle the children.\n\nDoes the new Teacher undertake to keep the School clean and are the children to have their hot dinner? I understand he is a single man.\n\nI am inclosing a clipping from the Winnipeg Free Press, his statements and mine do not tally for I have found the Department do the work and supply the money and the Church have done nothing to speak of at least, in this Agency.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJas W.

J. H. Hill, B.A., as teacher of this school and his appointment has been approved. The nomination of the teacher for this school rests in the hands of the church authorities. Archdeacon Thomas informed the Department that Mr. Hill would commence his duties on the 1st instant.\n\nIf the school is re-opened you should endeavour to obtain the supply of fuel necessary for the coming winter and have it delivered at the school as soon after the teacher arrives as possible.\n\nWith reference to the serving of a midday meal to the children I beg to say that you should take this matter up with the new teacher and, if he is willing to do this, you may furnish him with the supplies required for the purpose.\n\nThe late teacher performed the janitor's work at this school and it is expected that Mr. Hill will attend to these duties.\n\nThe Department is aware of the interest you took in the work of this school when it was under the charge of Miss Havard and it is hoped that you will continue your interest and give Mr. Hill any assistance you can and that he will meet with success in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJas.

J. H. Hill, B.A., to the position of teacher on the Oak River Reserve and the re-opening of the school.\n\nIn a recent communication from Mr. Agent McDonald he recommended that this school remain closed until the spring, as he stated that it was hard to get the children to attend in the winter and also on account of the difficulty in obtaining fuel. He was requested to endeavour to obtain the supply of fuel necessary and informed, as advised by you in your letter of the 17th ultimo, that Mr. Hill would arrive on the reserve to commence his duties on the first instance.\n\nThe Agent and yourself are in a better position to decide as to whether the school should re-open or not, in view of the fact that you have already engaged the services of a teacher, whose appointment the Department has approved. I shall be pleased if you will take this matter up direct with Mr. Agent McDonald and if it is decided in view of the difficulty in obtaining fuel and the small number of children who would likely attend during the winter months, that it would be well to allow the school to remain closed until the spring; the Department would consent to this arrangement being carried out.\n\nI beg to add that Miss Hayward, the late teacher, made a success in her work at this school and the Agent reports that the citizens of the district were proud of the school and the way it was conducted by her and that it reflected credit on the Department.

It was our intention to place a missionary at Oak River, (a very good teacher) and recommend him to the Department for taking charge also of the school. I saw the man last week and offered him the post but while he was considering it I had the following communication from Mr. Hill re the Oak River situation, namely:\n\n\"The Inspector of Indian Agencies was here last week to arrange for the removal of the Agent back to the reserve and, in consequence of the fact that the Agent's house is now used as the School, for the using again of the old school-house. Mr. McDonald, the Agent, informs me that the school is a cold building and not fit for use, and suggested that I should inform you of the intended change.\"\n\nIn view of that, all action is held up for the present and it is a question now whether the man whom I had in mind will consent to go under the circumstances. There is a great scarcity of both missionaries and teachers at present and it may be impossible for us to procure a suitable man in the near future. If the old school is unfit for use, as it is claimed, it might be possible as a temporary arrangement for the Department to secure the use of the basement of the Church for school purposes. It is quite a comfortable place but the Synod might ask a small rent for it. If there are any further developments either Archdeacon Thomas or myself will let you know. With kind regards, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has no funds with which to make the repairs that will be required to put the old school building in good condition.

If satisfactory arrangements can be made for carrying on the school in the church basement, I will be pleased if you will also arrange for the securing of the services of a suitable teacher.\n\nAs soon as the Department is informed as to whether the accommodation mentioned above can be obtained, instructions will be given our Agent to have it fitted up for school purposes.

I cannot understand this as we have a school right close to the Agency and close to the Missionary's residence and school should be held there. There might be a few minor repairs needed, but if school is to be conducted in the Missionary's residence I do not think it would be satisfactory, not only to the Missionary, but from our own standpoint.\n\nKindly advise me if there is any reason why the school building should not be used.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

Hyeon be appointed Teacher of the Indian Day School for the fall. We think it necessary to suggest that his appointment be for a period of one year, and that any extension shall entirely depend on his success in the work.\n\nWe are willing to offer the use of a large room in the Mission House for school purposes, and in lieu of rent request that the sum of $75 be paid to Mr. Hyeon to assist in meeting the expenses of heating for the year.\"\nOttawa, September 9, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 19th ultimo concerning the Oak River Indian Day School, and asking if there is any reason why the school building on the reserve should not be used by Mr. Hyson, the teacher lately appointed.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the information available from the files is that the school building was erected in 1892. In 1913 the Department decided to use the church basement rather than repair the old school house. This course of action was never taken, because immediately after Mr. Agent McDonald into the town of Griswold. This released the agency buildings which have been in use for school purposes until last year, when the Agent was returned to live on the reserve.\n\nLast year Mr. Agent McDonald stated to the church authorities that the old school building was cold and not fit for use, so we suggested that school be held in the basement of the church. As no teacher was available at this time, this plan was never completed. This year, when the school was opened for the summer months, Mr. Agent McDonald advised against using the church basement on the grounds that it would not be a healthy place for studying, and he and the church authorities recommended to the Department that we use two rooms in the missionary's home.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education visited the Oak River reserve this summer, and found the school being conducted fairly satisfactorily in the missionary's home. Mr. Hyson who was moved from the Fairford reserve, understood that two rooms, which open into each other in the missionary's home, were to be used for school purposes.\n\nGraham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nIf you or your Inspector find that the old school building could be put into good condition without too much expense, the Department is quite prepared to arrange to have the school held there. I might state that the public school Inspector in his report mentions that the old school building could be used. The Department, however, has to pay attention to the facts on file, and to Mr. Agent Macdonald's opinion that it was too cold to be used in the winter time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, September 8, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 30th ultimo concerning the Oak River Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department approves of the appointment of Mr. A. Nyson as from the last instant, and we agree with you that any extension of his engagement should depend entirely on the success with which he meets. The salary allowed Mr. Nyson will be at the rate of $800.00 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law. His wife is to receive $100.00 per year as janitor, and for performing such services as Field Matron. We are prepared to pay fuel bills up to $75.00 per annum, in lieu of rent, so long as the school is held in the two rooms of the missionary's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Thomas,\nSynod Block,\n901 Somerset Block,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, No.137-3-1 concerning the Oak River Indian Day School, and in reply to say that I have carefully noted the contents of your letter.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education has been on the Reserve this summer you say. I think if he made an examination of this building he would have found that it was not in the condition that the Department have been led to believe that it is. That is, that it is unfit to use as a school room. I cannot understand how the Department was led to believe that teaching school in the basement of the church would be more satisfactory than holding it in the school. As a matter of fact Mr. Inspector Murison was on the Reserve a little time ago examined this school building and found it in no bad shape, aside from some minor repairs and the fixing of the windows. This summer I had the exterior of this building painted.\n\nI must say that I think the Department have not been getting accurate information from the sources where it should expect to get it. I last believe that the Agent's house on the Reserve was unfit for occupancy and when I sent an Inspector down I found that the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nhouse was in good shape and took steps at once to have\nthe Agent sent back to the Reserve, where he should never\nhave been moved from in the first place. The same remarks\napply to the school. The school should have been carried\non in the building that was built on the Reserve for the\npurpose.\n\nI am personally going to visit this\nReserve in the near future and I will have the satisfaction\nof seeing the building and will report just what repairs\nare considered necessary. As the school has been started\nin the residence I am not going to ask that any change\nbe made until I visit the Reserve, however, it is just\npossible that Mr. Hyson would prefer to carry on the school\nin the residence as it would mean perhaps, that it would\nbe less trouble to him to do so, but this is not to be\nconsidered if we decide that the school should be held in\nthe building that was erected for the purpose.\n\nMight I suggest that in future before\ntransfers take place, and if the Department is in doubt\nas to conditions on the Reserve that this office be commu-\nnicated with as I feel satisfied we could save a lot of\ntrouble and give the Department first hand information\nregarding buildings and conditions existing on Reserves.\nHad I been consulted in this matter, I can assure you\nI would never have recommended that Mr. Hyson open school\nin his residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Because, if so, it will cost at least $1.50 per ton to draw it out.\n\nWill the cartage be included in the above $75.00 or will this be extra?\n\nI have no Interpreter at this Agency or horses fit for this work.\n\nAwaiting instructions, I have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJas Mr. Donald.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, September 25th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the fuel to be supplied in lieu of rent for the mission house for school purposes in connection with the Oak River (Sicoux) Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the sum of $75.00, which is allowed for this purpose, is to include all expenses in the delivery of the fuel at the school. We will pay accounts up to this amount only, as the sum of $75.00 is the full amount to be allowed in lieu of rent for the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

McDonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGriswold, Man.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR CHRISTIANSON ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE AND MANITOWAPAH AGENCIES, DATED SEPT. 15, 1922.\n\nThe Indians do not appear to be friendly disposed towards Mr. Hyson and his family and I understand that threats have been made by them not to allow their children to attend the school while Mr. Hyson was the teacher there. I did not investigate this matter as Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, had arranged to visit the reserve for the purpose of looking into the complaint made against Mr. Hyson. Several Indians told me that the Hyson family looked upon Indians as if they were no better than dogs, and after staying at the school for two nights I came to the conclusion that Mr. & Mrs. Hyson and their daughter, a young lady of about 19 years of age, were not in sympathy with the Indians, and it is undoubtedly a mistake for these people to be engaged in Indian work. I believe since my visit to the school that Mr. Hyson has been transferred to the Griswold Agency, but unless he and his family become more sympathetic towards and tolerant with the Indians, he will meet with no more success there than he did on the Fairford reserve.\nI would particularly draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks in regard to Mr. Hyson, the school teacher, who has been transferred to the Griawold Agency. I may say that I have heard from different sources that Mr. Hyson is not the proper type of man to be engaged in Indian work, and I was sorry to see that he had been transferred, as in my opinion he should not have been retained in the service of the Department.\nOttawa, October 9, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your covering letter and Mr. Inspector Christianson's report on the Manitowapah Agency, concerning Mr. Hyson, who has been transferred to the Oak River Sioux Indian Day School on the Griswold Reserve. I have noted that it is your opinion that Mr. Hyson should not have been retained in the service of the Department.\n\nThe Department has received a full report from Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, in this connection, and we are prepared to give Mr. Hyson another opportunity. At Fairford, he failed because of his intolerant and antipathetic attitude toward the Indian people. He and his family realize this mistake, and are being given another opportunity at Griswold. Mr. Hyson is quite capable of giving faithful service as a school teacher and, if he becomes sympathetic in his attitude, may do satisfactory work. If he is not successful at Griswold, this Department will be ready to inform the Church of England authorities that he will have to be taken from Indian school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, M.S.A.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI was not at all pleased with the school on the reserve, at which there were six pupils, four of whom were regular in their attendance and two were not. These children did not look clean, and had an unkempt appearance.\n\nThe class is being taught in the mission house, which is not a very good place for it to be held, but this accommodation will have to suffice during the winter months.\n\nI was not impressed with Mr. Hyson, the teacher, who has only been in charge of this school for a month, and who, as you are aware, was transferred to that point from the Fairford reserve. He is not tidy, which is an essential qualification in our school teachers if the children under their charge are to be taught to be cleanly and tidy. It is most regrettable that Miss R. Harvard, who was in charge of this school for nearly six years, was transferred to another reserve. She performed her duties most efficiently, and took a great interest in her pupils to whom she taught many industrious habits such as sewing and gardening. The Department paid her a salary of $600.00 per annum. Mr. Hyson, who is also paid by the Department, receives a salary of $800.00 per annum, and in addition is paid $200.00 per annum by the Church authorities for mission work. It seems to me that the Department should have more control over the teacher at this school, and as I have already stated, it is a pity that Miss Harvard was transferred, as ever since she left the school the work there has deteriorated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 11, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 29th ultimo concerning the Oak River Sioux Indian Day School on the Griswold Reserve. I have noted that you are not impressed with Mr. Nyson, the Teacher, and that a great loss was sustained at this point when Miss Havard was transferred in 1920.\n\nAs you were informed in official communication of the 9th instant, Mr. Nyson is on trial for one year, and if he does not meet with success, the Church of England Authorities will be asked to nominate a teacher more sympathetic to the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Hyson, the teacher, does not get along very well with either the agent or the principal of the Elkhorn Residential School. His Lordship agrees that Mr. Hyson's engagement should be from year to year only and that, if he does not show satisfactory progress, his services be discontinued.\n\nMemo \"file\"\u2014\n\nMr. Hyson is not doing much at the school. This is due to his own fault.\n\nR.F.A.\n\nMarch 26\n\nTeacher's success will depend on his efforts.\n\nR.F.A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. June 21st, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Oak River Day School in the Griswold Agency, which I visited on the 13th instant.\n\nThe classroom is in the Missionary's residence on the reserve, where what was intended for a dining-room and sitting-room, with an arch between, is used for this purpose. The room is fairly large and is well lighted and provided with good ventilation. A large window in the East, two in the South, and one in the West side of the room provide good light. An ample supply of single desks is provided for the number of pupils enrolled.\n\nMr. A. Hyson is in charge as teacher. He has had 23 years experience in England, and 13 years in Canada, but does not hold a certificate for Manitoba. There are 22 pupils enrolled; 11 boys and 11 girls. The average attendance for the past five months has been slightly over 63% of the enrollment. All the pupils are in the lower standards; 17 in Standard 1, and 5 in Standard 2. The attendance is very irregular and as a consequence\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nInspector Murison's Report on the Oak River Day School\n\nas a consequence the progress is not satisfactory, to my mind. There is, in my opinion, no good reason why the attendance should not be good at this school. The distance from the school at which the children reside is not greater than at Little Pines or Cote reserves, and other points where we are getting a much more satisfactory attendance. This is attributable, I am fully convinced, to indifference on the part of the parents. There were only eight children present on the day of my visit, although the parents had been notified the previous day that I was going to visit the school. In view of there being two residential schools within thirty miles of this reserve, viz:- Brandon and Elkhorn, to which the Protestant children could be sent, and the Qu'Appelle School at Lebret, which can be reached direct by railway, to which the children of Roman Catholic parents could be sent without imposing any hardship on the parents, I am of the opinion that the Department would be justified in closing this school, and insisting on the compulsory attendance of the children who are physically fit at the residential schools. There are 71 children in the Band from six to fifteen years of age, and only nineteen of these are in attendance at residential schools. Apart from these and the 22 enrolled at the Day School there are 30 of school age who have never attended any school. Of course there are a few who are physically unfit, but the number is small. I have been visiting this school for the past six years, and have brought the importance of providing the children with an education to the attention of the parents. They, however, appear to have no sense of responsibility.\nInspector Murison's Report on the Oak River Day School\n\nresponsibility regarding the welfare of their children in this connection, and I feel that so long as they have a Day School on the reserve, it provides them with an excuse for depriving their children of obtaining an education. I have spoken strongly on this matter because I feel that these people have been given the opportunity and have not taken advantage of it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nD REGINA, SASK., July 12th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a report on the Oak River Day School in the Griswold Agency. The report is not satisfactory. The attendance is small and I quite agree with the Inspector when he says that the continuance of this school is merely an excuse for the Indians to keep their children from attending residential schools.\n\nIt appears that every effort has been made to get these children to attend this Day School, but with little result. The progress in the class work is, I would say, unsatisfactory. The Department should consider, I think, the recommendation made by the Inspector.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 204-9 of the 12th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Murison on the Oak River Indian Day School. I note that there are 71 children of school age belonging to the Indian Band, 19 of which are enrolled at residential schools and 22 in the local day school. This leaves 30 of school age who are not attending any school - most of whom are physically fit.\n\nIn September, when it is determined what vacancies there are at Qu'Appelle, Elkhorn and Brandon, a letter will be directed to you with reference to placing these 20 or 25 children, who are not in attendance at school, at these three institutions. When the action is being taken on the reserve, the parents of those children who are attending the day school should be given to understand that, if the attendance is not up to the mark, the day school will have to be closed and all children placed in residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. Nov. 4th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Day School of the Griswold Agency.\n\nThe school is held in the Mission House owned by the Church of England. The two rooms on the South side of the house have been taken for class-rooms. These rooms are well lit, but an archway separates the two rooms, allowing only two rows of seats to extend the full length of the rooms. The other rows of seats are broke by the projection of the arch on either side.\n\nThe blackboard is not at the front of the children but on the side wall, and consists of a piece about 8 ft. long. On account of the arch, the board can only be seen by those in the front half of the school. Those behind the arch can see very little, some not at all.\n\nAt present there are 25 on roll. The day I attended, there was 6 present. The average attendance for quarter ending September 30th, was 17.8; for that ending June 30th - 12.6. There are seven or eight children on the reserve of school age, not attending school, which should not be the case. These added would bring the roll up to 33.\n\nAll these pupils are either in grade 1 or 2, and range from 8 to 13 yrs. of age, which figures do not speak well of advancement made. The parents of many of these children are away much of the time in summer, and consequently the children are with them instead of being at school.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nbeing at school. Then in the winter, some have as far as 3\u00bd miles to come and many are really not physically fit to walk this distance, with the result that perhaps they come one day and stay home the next. Then again, only odd Indians have time pieces, so that the children come to school any time from 8 to 11 A.M. They can't help it because they do not know the time. Under these conditions and with boarding schools as close as Brandon and Elkhorn and Lebret, it seems to me the only solution, whereby their children may have a decent education is to close the Day School and move these children to boarding schools. They would then be able to attend regularly the class-rooms, and also receive attention for any of their physical ailments.\n\nMr. Hysen is the teacher, and it looked to me as if he was just as satisfied if 6 were present as 20. He is an old man and entirely out of date, and I doubt if under the best of attendance, much progress would be made.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a short report on the Day School in the Griswold Agency. This report shows that the attendance at the school is far from satisfactory, and it seems to me that the Department would be well advised to close this school and transfer all the children to the Elkhorn Boarding School where they would get a real training. The Griswold Agency is so close to Elkhorn that this seems the natural place for them to go.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 24, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 204-11 of the 9th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Oak River Sioux Indian Day School. I note your recommendation that this school be closed and the children transferred to residential schools. I am writing to His Lordship the Bishop of Brandon in this connection and will have a further communication for you at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAht.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 24, 1926.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that recent reports concerning the Oak River Sioux Indian Day School have led the Department to seriously consider its closing. The Inspector of Indian Agencies writes in part as follows:\n\n\"The parents of many of these children are away much of the time in summer; consequently the children are with them instead of being at school. . . . . . . . . The children come to school any time from 8 to 11 A.M.\"\n\nIt is suggested that the only way of educating these children is to place them in residential schools.

(RG 10, Volume 6241, file 520-1, part 1)\nIn addition to obtaining these figures, the accuracy of which can be relied upon as they came from the books of Mr Clarke, the very excellent Indian Agent, I also carefully investigated the management of the School, and endeavoured to form a just estimate of the qualification and ability of Mr Hyson to properly discharge his duties. My conclusions are as follows, namely\u2014\n\n(1) There is essential need for the continuance of the Day School at Oak River, and that if the said School is efficiently conducted it can be, and I trust will be, one of the largest Day Schools in the West.\n\n(2) That there are too many children of school age (71) and too great a number closely following in their wake (54) to depend on their absorption into the Residential Schools.\n\n(3) That the present enrollment and average attendance is an evidence of the inability on the part of Mr Hyson to attract the pupils to the School, or to interest and instruct them when they are in attendance.\n\nI beg leave, therefore, respectfully to recommend that the Indian Day School at Oak River be retained. That the services of Mr Hyson be discontinued at the end of the present school year. That a qualified Teacher be appointed to succeed him, and that the said Teacher be a married man whose wife shall be required to take the Junior Class.\n\nI shall count it a privilege to be permitted to nominate such a man, and will assist in every possible way to promote the success of the work.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I interviewed the Teacher, then the Agent, and last of all I talked with some of the leading Indians on the Reservation.\n\nThe following is the result of my inquiry, and upon which I base my subsequent recommendation:-\n\n(1) The population of the Reserve, as given in the Census of 1926, is three hundred and six souls. Of this number seventy-five per cent are members of the Anglican Church, and of the remaining twenty-five percent nine families are Roman Catholic, and the rest Pagan.\n\n(2) There are resident on the Reserve 125 children between the ages of 1 and 15 years. Of this number 54 are under the age of 6 years, and 71 are between the ages of 6 and 15 years. In addition there are 26 children in Residential Schools, namely- Elkhorn, Brandon, Portage, Le Frette.\n\n(3) From the School Register I gathered that the present enrollment in the School is 24, being made up of 17 boys and 7 girls, and that the daily average attendance is about 15.\nOttawa, January 14th, 1927.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 8th instant, recommending that the Oak River Sioux Indian Day School be continued and that a new teacher be engaged for the coming academic year.\n\nThe Department is pleased to have your full report on school conditions on this reserve, and I should be grateful if Your Lordship would nominate a suitable worker for the post who could take up duties on September first next. Towards the end of the current academic year, the Department will inform the Indian Agent that Mr. Ryson's services are not required after June 30th. The Department will allow the new incumbent salary at the rate of $100. per teaching month. If the attendance is such that the engagement of a second teacher is necessary, consideration will be given to the payment of a small stipend to the teacher's wife.\n\nI wish to thank Your Lordship for your co-operation and your efforts to make this school a success.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is His Lordship's firm belief that the day school should be given a further trial, and the Department has agreed. It is understood, however, that Mr. Hyson, the present teacher, will be relieved of his duties as from June 30th, next.\n\nI should be grateful if you would let me have a report concerning the advisability of fitting up the old classroom for the coming academic year. It is quite possible that the present arrangement - classes being conducted in the teacher's residence - should be discontinued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant #133-3-1 with reference to the Oak River Day School.\n\nI note that His Lordship, the Bishop of Brandon is of the opinion that the Day School should be given another trial, and that the Department have agreed to this. I am quite satisfied in my own mind that this school should be closed and the children of this reserve, which is more or less Anglican, should be sent to the Elkhorn School where they will get a much better training.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is very doubtful if the school will be kept open any length of time, the building of a new classroom would be a great mistake, and the old classroom you mention in your letter has been moved and converted into a storehouse for Department use, so that it is not available as a school. This building was idle for a number of years and the school authorities did not think it worth while to make use of it so the Department have taken it over.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 24, 1927.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 6th instant, I have now to inform you it is extremely doubtful that funds can be found for the erection of a suitable classroom at the Oak River Sioux Indian Day School. The old classroom has been converted into a storehouse and is no longer available for school purposes.

We note that this house permits of two large rooms being utilized on the ground floor, both of which are well lighted and ventilated and one of which is suitable for classroom purposes.\n\nIf the services of a qualified teacher are obtained to begin duties the beginning of the next school year, on or about September 1st, 1927, the Department will allow a salary at the rate of $120.00 per teaching month, which is to include all services performed at the school. At the present time, we allow Mr. Nyson salary at the rate of $95.00 per teaching month and Mrs. Nyson an allowance of $100.00 per annum for janitor's services. Besides, the sum of $75.00 is allowed for fuel, in lieu of rent for the building. We will continue the allowance for fuel, but the salary above mentioned will include payment for the janitor's services.

A snow storm occurred in the morning and the\nroads were very bad; this, Mr. Hyson explained, was the\ncause for such a small attendance. I again visited the\nschool on April 6th, and found six pupils present, five\nbeing there on the previous day. I will admit the\nweather and roads were bad, but it is impossible to\neducate children with such attendance.\n\nThe average attendance for January was 14.\n\" \" February \" 10.6\n\" \" March \" 14.\n\" \" the quarter being 11.2\n\nIn reality, only about half the children enrolled are in\nattendance.\n\nIn addition to the children enrolled, there\nare the following who, I believe, should be sent to\nboarding schools if they will not attend day school:\n\nViola Eastman, 8 yrs. old - 4 miles from school,\nnever attended school.\n\nGeorge Williams, 12 yrs. old - never attended school.\nHe is H.C., but does not wish to go to Lebret; asked\nto attend Brandon.\n\nAlbert Elk, 10 yrs. old - never attended school.\n\nW.

However, I might add that many of the children have yet to learn to speak English, so that in view of such a condition, progress is slow. I am of the opinion that little effort is exercised, except by the Agent, in trying to secure a fair attendance. In spite of having a day school on the reserve for so many years, little progress has been made, and I have no doubt this has been partly due to the fact that the children attend very irregularly. I still feel, as I stated in my last report, that the only remedy is to close this school and send the children to boarding schools. This would entail no great hardship on the parents, as the schools are close and can be easily visited. It would allow the children to be in regular attendance, without having to endure so much cold weather with perhaps insufficient clothing and lack of proper food.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

At the time Miss Stapleton was appointed, His Lordship the Bishop of Brandon was informed that the Department would continue to allow the sum of $75 per annum for fuel in lieu of rent for the building, but that we were not prepared to allow any stated amount for janitor services but would consider the payment of accounts from time to time covering the cost of scrubbing the school. It was considered that the sweeping and dusting of the classroom should be performed by the older pupils under the direction of the teacher.\n\nRelative to the irregular attendance, I would refer you to official letter of July 9th, last, regarding the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton, in which he gave a list of the children who did not attend, and requesting you to arrange to have them placed in the respective residential schools of the religion to which they belong and to which their parents desire to have them sent.

May I ask the Department if it would be possible to pay her about $50.00 per annum for preparing the mid-day meal and attending to other necessary domestic duties at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It is to be understood that this amount is payment for both the preparing of the meal and the scrubbing of the school and same will be paid upon receipt of the usual certified vouchers, in duplicate, from time to time, for the amount due at the above rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nInspector Murray's Report on Oak River Day School\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to report that I visited the Oak River Day School on April 4th, and found 16 pupils in attendance - 5 boys and 5 girls, out of an enrolment of 30. The bad state of the roads through the snow thawing makes it impossible for some of the children to attend until the water subsides. The average attendance for the March Quarter was 16.22. The pupils were fairly clean, and were warmly clad. They presented a healthy appearance, and I am informed that there was little sickness amongst them during the past winter. The pupils enrolled are all under the age of 12 years. Miss Stapleton, a Deaconess of the Anglican Church, is in charge as teacher, and is assisted by Miss Watkins, who attends to keeping the school clean and preparing the midday meal. It is Miss Stapleton's policy to send the children on to a Residential School when they have attained the age of 12 years, and to operate this Day School as a preparatory school. The classes are held in two rooms connected with an arch.\n\nI noted that the ventilation was very good, but this will be-\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nInspector Murison's Report on Oak River Day School.\n\nwill be better when the storm windows are removed. For recreation the children are provided with swings and a football. During the winter months sleighs are provided for coasting.\n\nMiss Stapleton appears to be getting along very well with the Indians on the Reserve, and I consider that her influence amongst them is excellent. Church services are conducted by her on Sundays, and the men gather during the week in the basement of the church for a social evening, when they are given a talk by the teacher.\n\nThe building in which school is held is the property of the Anglican Church.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., April 12th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI enclose herewith a report of a visit made to the Oak River Day School by Mr. Inspector Murison on the 4th of April.\n\nYou will note that there were 16 pupils in attendance and that they presented a healthy appearance.\n\nThe report on the whole shows that the school is doing satisfactory work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

The Department notes that there has been a good attendance and that the teacher, Miss Stapleton, is performing satisfactory services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

December 18th, 1930.\n\nInspector Hamilton's Report on Oak River Day School,\nGriswold Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on\nthe Oak River Day School, inspected on December 11th, 1930.\n\nThere is no school building at this\npoint, and the classroom work is carried on in the\nMissionary's house. The room used is not suitable as\nthe lighting is poor, and ventilation bad.\n\nThe roll calls for 24 pupils - 12 boys\nand 12 girls, and I found 12 children present. The\nattendance is irregular, and I noticed that some of the\npupils were very late. The average for September was 11,\nfor October 10, and for November 12. The grades are\narranged as follows:\n\nGrade I - 16\nII - 4\nIII - 4\n\nThis is the first time I have visited\nthis school since Miss Stapleton took charge, and\nundoubtedly some progress has been made. The children\nread fairly well, and their book work was tidy and\nclean. The children sing a number of songs, and are\nmuch brighter and more alert than when last inspected.\nIf the pupils could be made to attend more regularly,\nI believe progress could be accomplished.\n\nThe children are made to wash on arrival,\nand also before lunch is served at noon. They were\nclean and\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nclean and tidy in appearance.\n\nA noon-day meal of porridge, cocoa, and biscuits is provided for the children. I noticed they are not fond of the porridge, and I think if vegetable soup could be substituted for the porridge, it would be appreciated.\n\nAt present there are a number of children who attend school very irregularly, while others are not even enrolled. I doubt if these children can be recruited for Elkhorn or Lebret without police assistance. I talked to most of the parents, and in the majority of cases they expressed willingness to send the children to Brandon. These Indians often drive to Brandon, and could no doubt more often see their children if enrolled there. The fact that they are not allowed to send the children to Brandon makes them more determined not to allow them to attend any boarding school. Some of the children have long distances to come, and will never be regular attendants at day school. The following is a list of the children and their ages as near as I could obtain:\n\n**Oak River Reserve.**\n- Louis Tacan       June 5th, 1917.\n- Alfred Tacan     May 5th, 1919.\n- Norris Tacan     Dec. 3rd, 1921.\n- Joseph Runearth  9 or 10.\n- Mary Ann         8 yrs.\n- Melita Hapa      6\n- Roy Hapa (Herbert) Born Jan. 1921.\n- Lucy MacKay      Born April 4th, 1921.\n- Sophie Williams  Born April 22nd, 1922.\n- Ruth Branth      Born Aug. 1st, 1922.\n- Olive Downan (Elkhorn) Sick - should be examined and returned, if fit.\n\n**Oak Lake Reserve.**\n- Crow - 1 girl, 1 boy.\n- Chatikanna - 1 girl\n\n\"X\" means - At present enrolled in Day School, but attendance irregular.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that I am today in receipt of a communication from Miss W. H. Stapleton, Teacher at the Oak River Indian Day School, in which she informs me that she has just recovered from an attack of typhoid fever, having been in bed for eight weeks. Miss Stapleton asks for leave of absence to proceed to England for a rest and she informs me that her boat leaves during the second week in February and that it will be necessary for her to leave Oak River on the 8th. She also informs me that Miss Wilkins, who has acted as janitor and assistant, will act as teacher during her absence. While the arrangement, to my mind, is not an ideal one, still I do not know that there is anything else we can do.\n\nI shall be glad to have a reply from the Department by wire advising me whether Miss Stapleton may have the desired leave of absence and whether her pay will continue during this time. She advises me that she will be absent from the Reserve until about the middle of May or possibly a little later, an absence of approximately three months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection at the Oak River Day School, which was made by Mr. Hamilton on December 11th.\n\nYou will note that the register at this school calls for a pupilage of 24, but that the average attendance is between 11 and 12. It seems to me that if this does not improve we should take steps to send the Protestant children from this reserve either to Elkhorn or Brandon, and the Roman Catholic children to Lebret. There is accommodation at all these schools, and I do not see why this condition should be allowed to exist on the reserve. I am writing to the Agent, instructing him to see these Indians at once and advise them that if there is no improvement in the attendance of their children at Day School they will be sent to Boarding School.\n\nThe classroom work carried on here appears to be satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Beveridge, Provincial School Inspector.\n\nThe Department will note the number of children enrolled as being 12, and that the average attendance for September was 5.71 and for October 7.33. As the Elkhorn and Brandon Residential Schools are located in close proximity to this reserve, there has always been a question in my mind as to whether this day school should be continued. In my report of November 4th, 1926, I pointed out the difficulties experienced in obtaining regular attendance, and suggested that the pupils would no doubt obtain a better education if transferred to one of the boarding schools. I am still of the same opinion. It will be noted that Mr. Beveridge states the pupils' success is \"Fair\", and in the general remarks he points out that the school has lost some ground during the past year, possibly due to the absence of the regular teacher. It will also be noted that the regular teacher in her qualifications does not state any standing or normal training, although she has a number of years teaching experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We are pointing out to His Lordship the difficulty in obtaining a regular attendance, and suggesting that the school be closed as from the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next, and the children placed in the Elkhorn Residential School. Upon receipt of His Lordship's reply, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 21, 1932.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of the Provincial School Inspector on his recent inspection of the Oak River Indian Day School. The enrolment at this school is twelve pupils only. The average attendance for September was 5.71 and for October 7.33 pupils. As the Elkhorn Residential School is located near this Reserve, it is doubted whether the day school should be continued; the pupils being placed in the residential school. There has been difficulty in obtaining a regular attendance, and it is considered that the children would, no doubt, obtain a better education if transferred to a residential school. The Inspector points out that the school lost some ground during the past year, possibly due to the absence of the regular teacher.\n\nI am forwarding the above information for Your Lordship's consideration, and should be pleased to have your views as to the closing of this school as from the end of the present school year\u2014June 30, 1933, and the placing of the children in the Elkhorn School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Thomas, D.D.,\nBishop of Brandon,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter 133-3-1 dated December 21st, I note that the matter of closing the Oak River Day School has been referred to His Lordship, the Bishop of Brandon. The average attendance for the month of January was reported to be 75, which is no improvement over the month of December.\n\nI shall be glad to be advised if any understanding has been arrived at between the Department and the Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

Last year, owing to her enforced absence from the school through an attack of typhoid fever, progress was much hindered, but she has now fully recovered. In addition to her teaching duties her voluntary ministrations as a qualified Nurse increases the bond between herself and the people and, should the school close the Reserve will lose one whose work and influence is a potent factor in the harmony of the place. For twenty-three years she has worked amongst our Indians in the West and is regarded by all as one of their best friends.\n\nThese, I think, are the main features to be considered in the case, and while I fully recognize the necessity upon the Department, in these difficult times, to effect economy in every possible direction, yet I recommend and urge that the work at the Oak River Day School be permitted to continue, even though it may have to be done at a further reduced salary. I am confident from all I can gather that the closing of the School would react most detrimentally upon the Indians on the Reserve, and I earnestly hope in their behalf that the Department will not find it necessary to take the proposed step.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Brandon.\nDIOCESE of BRANDON\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMarch 6, 1933.\n\nRe: Oak River Indian Day School.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nI regret the delay in replying to yours of December 21st regarding the proposal to close the above Indian Day School at the end of June.\n\nThe whole subject bears so vitally on the well-being of the Reserve and the contentment of its people, that I felt it was most desirable for me to confer with the Agent, the teacher, and some of the leading members of the Band before attempting to give my considered opinion on the proposal made. I was able during the past week to visit the Reserve and now respectfully submit the main features of the case for your consideration.\n\n(1) There are 82 children on the Reserve at this date, and of this number\u2014\n\n12 are on the School Roll.\n7 are of school age and will shortly attend.\n9 will reach school age next year.\n7 in the year following.\n47 younger children of ages between infancy and five years.\n\n(2) The average attendance during the past few months has been only a fraction over five, but it is generally acknowledged that this is due to the exceptionally severe winter we have had in the West. Some of the children living at a distance of two miles and more from the School.\n\n(3) There is, I find, an antipathy on the part of the parents to send their children to the Residential Schools before they have reached at least the age of 10, except in the cases of orphans and children in destitute homes.\nOttawa, March 13, 1933.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 6th instant, regarding the proposal to close the Oak River Indian Day School at the end of the present school year, June 30th, next. In this connection I have to advise that the Department is making further enquiry. When the report asked for is received, a definite decision will be given in the matter and you will be advised.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. W. Thomas, D.D.,\nBishop of Brandon,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, March 13, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith, for your information, extract from a communication received from His Lordship the Bishop of Brandon, with reference to the matter of closing the Oak River Indian Day School at the end of the present school year.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your No. 204-11 of December 6, 1932, and February 21st, last. I would request that, after fully considering His Lordship's report and opinion in the matter, you will advise the Department whether you would recommend the continuing of the school or not. No doubt, if the Indian parents were informed that, if their children did not attend the day school regularly, they would be placed in the Elkhorn Residential School and the day school closed, this might lead to a larger and more regular attendance.\n\nBefore definitely deciding whether this school is to be continued or not, the Department will await your views, after considering His Lordship's report. In the meantime, His Lordship is being informed that the Department is making further enquiry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

School room opened on the 11th and Miss Wilkins substituted Miss Stapleton as teacher for remainder of month and Miss Lauder is substituting Miss Wilkins as janitor.\n\nOn advice from her doctor, Miss Stapleton is contemplating taking a trip and her partner Miss Wilkins, is willing to carry out her duties whilst she is away.\nOttawa, February 5, 1932.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the first instant, informing the Department of the illness of Deaconess Stapleton, teacher of the Oak River Indian Day School. It is noted that Miss Stapleton will require a rest from her duties in order that she can recuperate.\n\nThe Department has approved of leave of absence for Miss Stapleton and will allow her salary until April 30th, next. Approval is granted for Miss Wilkins, who has acted as janitor and assistant, to perform the duties as teacher during the absence of Miss Stapleton. We were informed that the arrangements for the carrying on of the work by Miss Wilkins were made by Miss Stapleton, and, as our funds this year are extremely limited, there will be no increase in salary to Miss Wilkins for the period she acts as substitute teacher. It is understood that, besides the teaching duties, she will continue her work as janitor and preparing and serving the pupils' midday lunch.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F.

These buildings would accommodate approximately 27 children each. The children at the Oak River School number in all 17, so the attendance only 77%. The present building could properly speaking only have air space for 9 children.\n\nThe cost of the school office, high averaging $5 per foot of course in certain places but west it is difficult to put lumber or other material without paying a high price for it. At a rough estimate I think the cost per cubic foot should build these schools not over $343.20 for the structure.\n\nAs regards the comparison of the plans I would state that the school plans prepared in this Department were done so with the view to economy as well as to give an a much better structure than generally built in the interior portions of the country and along the river lines.\n\nFor Mr. [Name]\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ramping from $595.00 with stone foundations to $850.00 and from $556.00 with block or slate foundations to $800.00. The tender of J.B. Pentland $795.00 stone + $555.00 footer block foundations being the lowest.\n\nMr. Hayter Reed's estimate for the building is $500.00. Please see his letter turned down. In my check estimate for the building I considered such a building as specified should be done for about $350.00 without stone foundations being about 7\u00bd cents per foot. Of course this does not allow any thing as regards profit on the work being only the actual cost of the structure.\n\nThe lowest estimate being $595.00 with stone foundations, the tenderer would undoubtedly be well paid for his work to make a good profit.\n\nConsept: Mr. Reed under.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Also ask if the building could be put on blocks instead of having a stone foundation\u2014there is nothing mentioned in the specification about foundations. For anything definite in writing, if I'm not mistaken\u2014The approximate estimate made in the Dept. was say \u00a3360 for structure and ask if other tenders were called in. Bentland was of opinion that lower tenders would be used, so did he think the lowest tender is Bentland's fair price for the structure and if so the work had better be proceeded with at once\u2014and the contract papers and bonds had better be made out.\n\nA.

H. Portland, at $595.50 for stone, and $555.50 for brick foundation.\n\nYour remark immediately preceding the lowest of tender states: \"The fact seems of the opinion that the nature of the soil requires such foundation.\" Is it intended by this that...\nThis Dept. is to understand that the Agent thinks a stone foundation necessary. This is not clear from the context.\n\nThe tenders having been examined are thought to be high. The estimate which was made in the Dept. of a structural unit that the contractors quoted was $350.00, your own estimate being $500.00, which presumably covered the whole cost.\n\nWill you be kind enough to say whether or not you think that Mr. Portland's offers of $595.00 and $555.00 are reasonable, and whether it would be really worth while to ask for new tenders. In any case it would appear that nothing can be done towards completing the\nthe schoolhouse, as men-\ntioned in the 7th Minister's\nletter of the 19th May,\nbefore the 30th instant,\nand the money available\nduring the current year\nwill therefore cease before\nanything can be done.\nBut so far as I am able,\nto submit an item in\nthe Supplementary Estimates\nfor the ensuing year\nto cover the cost of\nbuilding the school.\n\nI shall be glad to\nhear from you on the\nsubject with the least\npossible delay, and if\nyou are of opinion that\nthe present tender\nshould be accepted, con-\ntract and bond will be\nimmediately prepared\nfor execution by the\nContractor.\nOffice of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\nManitoba and N.W.

I have the honor to state that I am of opinion that nothing would be gained by asking for new tenders, as Mr. Puckett offers to complete the building for $595.00 with a stone foundation, and $355.00 with wooden cells, are as low as can be obtained from a contractor in this country.

I would suggest that the lighting system be checked over. More, and stronger lights are needed, and several minor repairs to the floor and verandah are now necessary.\nOttawa,\nDecember 5, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\nA.\n\nMr. W. Young, Indian Agent, Griswold, Man.\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Oak River School Inspector Moore states that the room used in the residence for school purposes is insufficiently lighted. He recommends that more and stronger lights be installed and that minor repairs to the floor and verandah be made. I should appreciate a report from you regarding these suggestions and indicating the expenditure that would be necessary to carry them out.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.of Mines & Resources,Ottawa.\n\nRe your letter 133-3-5 re Oak River Indian Day School:\n\nThis classroom is located in one room of the Anglican Manse on this Reserve. The church have their own private lighting system, which consists of a six volt storage battery and a small wind generator. I therefore do not feel that it is our place to interfere with the plans of this classroom or their own private lighting system.\n\nThe day Inspector Moore visited this school happened to be a dark, foggy day. Miss Smears, the teacher claims that under ordinary conditions the light which comes in through the windows is quite satisfactory.\n\nI feel that what we really need is to build our own separate day school, but until this can be done, a few repairs are needed, as follows:\n\nCovering for hall floor leading into classroom:\nThe app.cost of good grade of linoleum $18.00\n\nOne Blackboard and easel app.cost 18.00\n\nThe verandah step needs only minor repairs and we can do that work ourselves. The labourer here could lay the linoleum.\n\nW. Young\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 23, 1945.\n\nMr. W. Young, Indian Agent, Griswold, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $18.00 for linoleum for the hall leading to the classroom of the Oak River School. You may also purchase a blackboard and easel at a cost of $18.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Acct.

Glen, P.C., M.P.,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nDuring the recess I left with Canon I. A. Norris, of Brandon, the reports of the meetings of the Committee on Indian Affairs. He had not had the opportunity previously of reading these reports and some other literature.\n\nCanon Norris has now returned them to me and in an accompanying letter he refers to the handicap under which the Mission at Griswold Reserve is working as a result of there being no school building on the reserve. As it is, they are using a small room in the Mission House. I visited the Reserve in October last and was in this room which is much too small and altogether inadequate. It was merely a sort of excuse for a school.\n\nCanon Norris urges that some provision be made in this regard and he suggests that possibly a building could be secured and moved to the Reserve from the airport at North Brandon or from Souris. Personally I think the suggestion would be well worth considering.\n\nThe buildings at the Brandon airport were for quite a while under the disposal of the Central Housing and Mortgage Company but I understand they are now turned back to War Assets. The buildings at Souris were taken over by the Province, it having first priority after the Depts.\n\nWhen you are less rushed than you are at present, if that time should ever occur, I will be glad to discuss this matter personally.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. E. Matthews, M.P.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFebruary 18th, 1947.\n\nTo the - Acting Deputy Minister\n\nAttention Director of Indian Affairs\n\nAttached please find letter to the Minister, dated Feb. 17, 1947, from J. E. Matthews, Esq., M.P., House of Commons, Ottawa, concerning representations by Canon I. A. Norris, Brandon, with regard to the lack of a school building on the Griswold Reserve, and suggesting that a building be secured and moved to the Reserve from the airport at North Brandon or from Souris.\n\nPlease have a letter prepared for the Minister's signature to Mr. Matthews (Dear Ewen)\n\nN.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, March 3, 1947.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nEducational Facilities on the Griswold Reserve\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of similar file dated February 19, concerning the above noted subject.\n\nMay we have a reply from you, stating your opinion in connection with the suggestions from Mr. Matthews.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter together with a copy of one from Mr. J. E. Matthews, M.P., Brandon. For your information I attach a copy of a letter from Mr. Young concerning this matter.\n\nI agree with Mr. Matthews and with Mr. Young that provision should be made, without delay, for a Day School on the Oak River Reserve. I think it would be difficult to move a suitable building such a long distance and, of course, the bridge over the Assiniboine River presents a real obstacle. I think Mr. Young is right when he says the building would have to be dismantled.\n\nI recommend that tenders be called for the erection of a Day School and that the idea of moving an old building be discarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nRe your letter 204-11A dated February 24, 1947:\n\nI certainly agree that a school building is needed on the Oak River Reserve.\n\nI am doubtful if a suitable building could be moved from either Souris or Brandon Airports, due to the fact that it would have to come through one of the Assiniboine bridges. These bridges are overhead structure, and would not permit a building of any height or size to be moved through them. It would be necessary to dismantle and rebuild if airport buildings were used.\n\nI have not been able as yet to purchase new lumber to repair Indian homes or build an implement shed, but I do note that contractors seem to be able to procure lumber for their projects.\n\nI believe that if the Department called for tenders for the erection of a Day School on the Oak River Reserve, that a contractor would be able to secure the lumber and erect a building.\n\nW. Young,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCOPY\nOttawa, March 7, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Bean:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 17, concerning the educational facilities on the Griswold Reserve.\n\nIt is our intention to build a number of Indian day schools and teachers' residences in Manitoba during the 1947-48 fiscal year. I have written to Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, concerning your proposal that we might move one of the former R.C.A.F. buildings at Brandon to the reserve for use as a school. You will be interested to know that at Stratford we are now using three former army buildings as schools and that they have proved very satisfactory.\n\nHowever, the main difficulty according to Mr. Hamilton would be that the buildings would have to be moved through one of the Assiniboine bridges. Unfortunately, these bridges are overhead structures and would not permit a building of any height or size to be moved through them. Therefore it would be necessary to dismantle and rebuild the entire structure. As we would have also the additional expense of excavating the basement, putting in cement foundations, erecting the chimney, etc., it is unlikely that we would save much money or have a sound building in this event.\n\nThe building situation will largely determine the locations of the schools to be built this year in Manitoba. There are many places in urgent need of such day schools and\n\nJ. H. Matthews, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nInspector\nInspector Hamilton and his agents will do everything possible to have these buildings erected this year. A further letter has been written to Mr. Hamilton regarding our building programme for Manitoba.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will be interested to know that at Brentford we are now using three former army buildings as schools and that they have proved very satisfactory.\n\nHowever, the main difficulty according to Mr. Hamilton would be that the buildings would have to be moved through one of the Assiniboine bridges. Unfortunately, these bridges are overhead structures and would not permit a building of any height or size to be moved through them. Therefore it would be necessary to dismantle and rebuild the entire structure. As we would have also the additional expense of excavating the basement, putting in cement foundations, erecting the chimney, etc., it is unlikely that we could save much money or have a sound building in this event.\n\nThe building situation will largely determine the locations of the schools to be built this year in Manitoba. There are many places in urgent need of such day schools and\n\nJ. H. Matthews, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nInspector\nInspector Hamilton and his agents will do everything possible to have these buildings erected this year. A further letter has been written to Mr. Hamilton regarding our building programme for Manitoba.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary\nSupt of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr Neary:\n\nI am instructed by the Executive Committee of the Diocese of Brandon to make application to the Indian Dept for certain assistance in regard to the Oak River School at Griswold.\n\nAbout a year ago the well at the school was condemned. As we were unable at that time to obtain help in digging a new well we have been forced to obtain our water at the agency. This is most unsatisfactory not only because it is at some distance from the school but also because if the Agent is away we sometimes had to leave the children without water.\n\nWe have now obtained an expert to dig a new well and the work is in progress. Our Executive feel however that it is hardly fair to expect Church to assume all the responsibility for the maintenance of the school particularly as we have already expended just over $500.00 in the last year in insulation and new roofing. We therefore request that your Dept should aid us in this latest expense and assume the cost of providing water for the school.\n\nAs you are aware, we have for years provided the accommodation for the school and have never received any rent for the same or any help towards its upkeep; we therefore feel that we are not absolved altogether out of the way, particularly as it is certainly the responsibility of the Indian Dept to see that the children at school have sufficient and good drinking water.\n\nTrusting that this matter will receive your prompt attention,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, July 4, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Norris:\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 27. We have referred the matter to Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, in Winnipeg, and will write you immediately we have a further report from him.\n\nAs you probably know, our plans call for the erection of a new school on this site.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

In view of the difficulty that we are experiencing in building schools elsewhere, it is possible that you might consider changing from the erection of a school, for example, at Nelson House, to the erection of a school at Oak River. At least at the latter place we have the possibility of having a building erected. We would appreciate hearing further from you in this regard, with a definite recommendation as to whether we should shift our building plans.\n\nA copy of this letter has been sent to Mr. Indian Agent Young.\n\nBernard F.

I am not in a position to give a tender on a complete job as I cannot get materials. I will do the work under the following conditions:\n\n1. Rate of wages for myself - $1.25 per hour. Rate for my assistant J. Smalle - $1.00 per hour. Rate of wages for H. Oakley - .75\u00a2 per hour. Rate of wages for Indian labour may run from .60\u00a2 to .70\u00a2 an hour.\n\n2. Permission to use labourer's house, which now is vacant.\n\n3. Wish permission to work a ten hour day - if conditions and weather permits.\n\n4. If cement and material for cribbing is made available before the end of August I will proceed with the basement at the beginning of September.\n\nAfter I have completed the basement I will be obliged to return home to do certain work but will return as soon as possible and if materials are available I am confident the building can be completed by December 31st. I have a small power saw which is of great assistance. A cement mixer will be available for the foundation wall.\n\nI will keep time sheets and submit same to the Agent. If possible I would request payment on the 15th and the end of each month as my men will require their wages. I must be advised at once if the Department wish me to proceed with the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nReplying to your letter of July 4th regarding the well on the Sioux Indian Mission at Griswold, Man., I quite understand the question of this well coming in with the new school but we could not wait as both our missionaries and the children were without water. We have, therefore, had the new well dug at a cost of approximately $160.00. We, of course, will pay for this but I still feel that your Department should be responsible for part of the cost, regardless of whether another well will have to be dug for the new school.\n\nWe feel that the Church has carried a very large part of the expense of keeping the school open for many years past, and that we are not asking anything out of the way in suggesting that your Department share some of these expenses with us.\n\nI would very much like to discuss both this and other matters with Inspector Hamilton, whom I have never yet met, and I would be grateful if you might suggest to him that we should arrange a meeting when next he is in Brandon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, August 11th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Norris:\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the new well that has been provided at the Sioux Indian Mission.\n\nI understand that the water from this well will be available for pupils and staff of the Oak River day school and we are prepared to pay half the cost.\n\nPlease forward a receipted account from the person who dug the well. This account should show that the total cost of the well was $160.00. When we receive this, we can arrange for a refund of $80. to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Robertson, Kenton, Manitoba. I know Mr. Robertson and Mr. Smalle both are good carpenters and fairly fast workers. The rate of wages are reasonable and no request was made for extra pay in connection with overtime. Mr. Robertson stated he would put the basement wall in and then he had work to do at home in connection with extracting honey. As soon as this work was completed he would continue with building the school.\n\nHe and his men wish permission to cook and sleep in the labourer's house which, at present, is vacant.\n\nI attach a sketch of the grounds at the Griswold Agency. If we can build on location No. 1 that would be my choice. It is a better location than the Mission or Agency and not too far from the Mission where the Department know how much land belongs to the Mission? If not possible to obtain location No. 1 then we can hardly do otherwise than take location No. 2, which, in my opinion, places the buildings rather close together.\n\nAfter the location is approved and if the Department decide to proceed, Mr. Young should be given an accountable advance to pay for gravel or excavation work. An advance of $500.00 would, no doubt, be sufficient for a start. Mr. Robertson is prepared to stake out the basement as soon as the location is picked.\n\nWhat direction does the Department wish the front of the school to face? It is necessary to know which direction the classroom windows should face so that the best light be obtained for the children.\n\nIf the work is to proceed then cement and crib material should be ordered for immediate delivery. The balance of the material could arrive any time shortly after September 15th. Please advise the Department's decision and if acceptable advise -\n\n1. Re location and land owned by Church of England\n2. How the building should be set for light\n3. Who will supply the cement and lumber for cribbing and when it can be expected.\n\nIt is my intention to get the basement in as soon as possible and, no doubt, cement will be difficult to get.\n\n-over-\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: School, Oak River Reserve, Griswold Agency\n\nMr. Gow arranged for one of his men to accompany me to Griswold Agency to make a selection of a site for the new school. Attached is a report. You will note preference is given to Location No. 1.\n\nI called on His Lordship, Bishop Thomas, of Brandon, and in searching his records he found that in August of 1908 permission was given to occupy three acres on Section 23 subdivision 15 on the South West corner for the purpose. This letter was signed by J. Lush, Secretary to the Indian Commission. Mr. Young and I made a careful check of the maps of the Reserve. We are convinced that the three acres is a portion of the 40 acres known as Agency property. Therefore, the site desired is legally already Agency property. I might just add that Bishop Thomas and also Canon Norris were very pleased that the school was to be built and stated that if the land belonged to them it would be an order to cooperate with the Indians and that there would be no charge for the land. In view of this information I arranged with Mr. J. Denbow, Brandon, to start next week digging the basement and we expect the work to be completed by September 6th.\n\nIn order that there would be no delay in the program, I called at the Lumber Company, Brandon, and the Monarch Lumber Company, only to find that they were both out of shiplap and 2 X 4 dimension. In searching about I found that the Beresford Lumber Company had just received a carload of this material. Mr. Kitchen, the manager, agreed to supply our requirements and I placed an order for the necessary dimension and shiplap. Mr. Young is arranging for the delivery. I was unable to see Mr. Robertson, builder, but Mr. Young will contact him and arrange to have the basement started ready to be extended next week. I also instructed Mr. Young to arrange for the immediate delivery of the gravel. I expect by the end of next week the basement will be dug, the cribbing lumber on the site and also the gravel and nails, with the exception of shingle nails.\n\nPlease advise if the Department has arranged for the purchase of the necessary binding wire used in tying the cribwork. Also, have they included in their purchase the iron rods necessary for reinforcement. I understand from Mr. Van Every, Ashdowns, that No. 10 Gauge wire will be available Tuesday, September 2nd. He states that half inch round iron bars 16 feet long for reinforcing are also available. If these have not been included in material already purchased, may I have authority to place the order at once? I would like to point out that the floor joists should be on before starting to pour the cement as the ends will be embedded in the cement wall. Please advise if these have been ordered and if delivery is possible within the next 10 days or two weeks. The above lumber is available at present at the Beresford Lumber Company in Brandon.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe: School, Oak River Reserve, Griswold\n\nFurther to my letter of August 30th, I wish to state that Mr. Robertson, the contractor, called at my home yesterday to discuss the location and other matters relating to the building. We expect the excavating to be completed by September 6th and plan on building the cribwork the following week. Please advise me the following:\n\n1. Baling Wire for tying cribwork. May this be purchased locally?\n\n2. Reinforcement iron rods available at Ashdowns. May this be purchased?\n\n3. Coal chute must be built in with cribwork. Is this to be a local purchase?\n\n4. Is hot air plant or hot water plant to be used? Recommend hot water. The Department's decision concerning this matter is needed.\n\n5. May coal bin under kitchen be made into a cistern for soft water? The cistern is really essential and I would recommend that the abovementioned space be used for this purpose.\n\n6. Is basement window and frame a complete unit? If so, give size of opening required in the foundation to receive the above frame.\n\nThe above information is urgently needed because frames must be built in with the cribwork. Immediate reply by airmail with definite instructions will be greatly appreciated.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, September 4, 1947.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, the following is a reply to your questions:\n\n1. Purchase locally baling wire for tying cribwork. \u2713\n2. Purchase locally reinforcement iron rods. \u2713\n3. Purchase locally coal chute. \u2713\n4. Hot air heating plant to be used. \u2713\n5.

Gow\n\nRe:- Griswold Indian Reserve.\n\nOn August 28 last, I accompanied Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies at Winnipeg, to the Griswold Indian Reservation to decide upon a location for the proposed Indian School at that point.\n\nTwo locations were under consideration - one between the Church buildings and the Agency Office and the other on a flat knoll, somewhat to the rear or west of the existing buildings. In my opinion, the latter location is the more suitable of the two sites in view of good drainage for both building and playground. This site provides for a larger playground and is more isolated from existing buildings yet equally close to the water supply well as is the alternative location. Furthermore, the location decided on will permit the appearance of the building to be set to advantage.\n\nO. J. Storsater\n\nD. B.

I am anxious that the material will be on hand when the wall is completed otherwise I am afraid the carpenters will leave to do other work and it will be difficult to get them back on the job.\n\nI understand the Taylor Lumber Company at Virden have received several carloads of lumber and if the Department has not been successful in obtaining a satisfactory source of supply perhaps this company could be given consideration.

(RG 10, Volume 6241, file 529-5, part 2)\nto purchase. It is difficult to get and often only in small quantities but if Mr. Young is authorized to do so I think he could keep the carpenters going.\n\nI would prefer cedar shingles to asbestos shingles due to the fact they will be subject to strong winds and under the circumstances cedar shingles I am sure will prove best. I think Mr. Young could get these if authorized to do so.\n\nThe Department could purchase all the paint, building paper and hardware. To date we have only purchased - 1 keg 24 nail, 1 keg 2\" nails and 1 keg 3\u00bd\" nails along with the usual supplies. I would suggest that before work is also secure without delay, all the millwork, interior trimmings, windows and window frames also the siding for the outside. I doubt if siding is available. Taylor's at Virden have excellent clear spruce drop siding with a special 1/2\" ton and 1/2\" groove; if painted as soon as put on it should prove satisfactory.\n\nFlooring is practically impossible to get. I do not know whether it could be obtained. Would the Department consider Battleship linoleum? Fly board could be nailed every four inches each way on top of the rough flooring to which would be glued a felt covering and on top of this Battleship linoleum would be glued.\n\nI would also suggest that arrangements be made for the purchase of the furnace so that whoever secures the work will be available before the construction of the building is too far advanced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

I might say that for many years both the living and dining room were used for classroom purposes and, no doubt, both need decorating. The front hall has been in constant use all through the years and the floor is now in very poor condition. I think this request is justifiable and I recommend that either a grant be made in lieu of rent or that the repair work be carried out as requested.

You will note the largest item is for the repairs to the floors. These are in quite bad shape. They have had to be oiled in order to keep the dust down, and are badly worn from the desks. The man we had examine them thinks that this is the only way to make them fit for living quarters again.\n\nI would be grateful if you would recommend to the Indian Department that they should undertake this expenditure when the new school has been built, and perhaps you would point out to them that for over twenty-five years they have had the use of these rooms without rent, and we feel, therefore, that we are justified in requesting the Department to return them to us in a good state of repairs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nI.

We are now building a school on the Oak River Reserve and when completed it will not then be necessary to use part of the St. Luke's Mission House.

Matthews, M.P.,\nThe House of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Matthews:\n\nI was very sorry to have been off the Reserve when you called in the summer. I wanted to thank you personally for your help in building us a school here. You will be interested to know that Mr. Robertson is making good progress with the building, and that he is hoping to have it completed in the Spring. I think the Dept. have done well to get the services of such an able and hard working man.\n\nThe new school will be ideal for the use of visual educational methods as outlined in the Indian School Bulletins sent to us from time to time by the Dept. I personally am very interested on the use of visual aids, and I am sure the Dept. will be interested to know that I have the use of a projector and screen. Also I am able to have the use of some very good films for the small charge of 25 cents for one showing. This of course will not be any expense for them to meet. All this is not much use unless we have the Hydro or the use of power plant which is established in the Agency. The good news is that the Hydro is now right on the edge of the Reserve - to be accurate just a mile and a quarter to the Mission Compound. I have been in correspondence with the Power Commission in Winnipeg, and they inform me that they would be glad to make the Hydro available to us providing the Dept. of Indian Affairs will be included.\n\nI am wondering if you would be kind enough to show this letter or pass the contents of it to some of the officers in the Department with a request that they will give permission to have the Hydro installed in the school; we of course would be responsible for the Mission House, and other property. If the Department could not see their way clear to do this would they be kind enough\nto make available to us the power from the Agency in both school and house.\n\nIf we are to realize the ambition of the Department to make the Indian citizen proud of his origin and cultural heritage, education of every type must be utilized in both school and community. Visual aid offers us a splendid opportunity to teach every person on the Reserve the art of modern life, with all its complexities.\n\nWith kind regards, and all good wishes,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAlbert E. Kemp.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, December 15, 1947.\n\nMr. A.G.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOUR MOTTO\n\nJesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Hebrews 13:8\n\nNovember 1927\n\nDear Friends:\n\nDuring the past few weeks we have been giving a series of addresses on \"The Life of a Christian\" - its beginnings, resources and characteristics. We have noted that one of the outstanding characteristics of the loyal followers of Jesus Christ should be faithfulness - even unto death, if that should be the alternative of being disloyal to our Lord. How many of us who call ourselves Christians could be sure that our gratitude to God outweighs our fear, so that we are prepared to face not death, but to live devotedly in His service?\n\nSo often today the Christian fails to demonstrate his belief in God because he is too worried about his own peculiar problems. Alternatively, the present chaotic state of the world results in his being preoccupied rather than concentrating fully to train himself to work selfishly and pray unceasingly that Christ's Kingdom be established. How many of us would claim similarly that we try to live and order our lives to serve God fully in the fellowship of His Church?\n\nA loyal Christian today, as in the past, must take to heart the words of St. Paul, \"Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.\" 2 Timothy 2:3. We know we cannot endure hardness for Christ unless we ask God's help, and unless we are prepared to confirm that prayer by an invincible determination to serve the Son of God who loved us and gave Himself for us. The hour of destiny is at hand and only those who work devotedly and humbly and faithfully can hope to endure unto the end and be saved. May God grant us faith and strength for His service now and at all times in the future.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNOTES AND NEWS\n\nMonday Nov. 3rd at 8 p.m. in St. Matthews Pro-Cathedral, Brandon, a fellowship evening for all the laymen in our Deanery is being arranged.

The distance from the Agency buildings to the line is about one and a half miles. If power were made available it would likely be used -\n\n1. At the Agency\n2. New Day School\n3. Church of England House and Church\n4. Perhaps the Catholic Mission would also use it in their Church.\n\nI have no idea of the cost of service but, no doubt, the building of the line would cost in the neighborhood of $1000.00 per mile and to wire the Agency buildings would cost perhaps $150.00 each.\n\nThe Delco plant now in use at the Agency is too small and badly worn. Installing of the Hydro power would eliminate the purchase of a new lighting plant and batteries and over a period of years might prove less expensive than our present system. I would recommend the change to Hydro be given favourable consideration.\n\nPlease return the map when it has served your purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Hydro Power - Griswold Agency.\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 10th dealing with the above matter and the attached blue print, I would say that before the department can give this matter further consideration, it will be necessary for you to get in touch with the Hydro Electric Power Commission and ascertain definitely whether it would be necessary for the department to build the hydro electric power line from the road allowance along which the power line runs to our agency buildings or whether the Hydro Electric Power Company would be prepared to build the line themselves. If the former, you should ascertain the cost and all details as to the charges for power when connected up. Are there any other persons along the mile and half of road between the highway and the agency buildings who would be taking power and who might co-operate in the construction of the line? Please let me have a full report after which the matter will be given further consideration.\n\nAs requested I am returning to you the blue print.\n\nEnclosure\n\nDirector.\n\nW:McG\n| NO.
