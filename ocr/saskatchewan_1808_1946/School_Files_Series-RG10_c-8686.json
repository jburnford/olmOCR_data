High rate performance is made possible by the use of CRYSTALITE, a high speed, high capacity zeolite and an exclusive International Filter Co. product.\n\nMany improvements in the Type C Softener have been desired for years but haven't actually been attained before in zeolite water softeners. Only a general comparison of zeolites will be made here; for the purpose of this bulletin is to describe and illustrate Type C softeners so that their application to water supply conditions may be better understood.\n\n**Zeolite**\n\nZeolite is a term that has come to be applied to all base exchange silicates used in water softening. All such substances are not if the mineralogical definition is strictly applied.\n\nAmong the \"zeolites\" that have been used are those made from various natural clays and sands, as well as from artificial mixtures of known fused and precipitated ingredients. More recent advances in the art are concerned with a zeolite made from concentrated solutions. The proper mixture of the solution forms a gel which dries to a flint-like state, in which form the particles are sufficiently hard to scratch glass.\n\n**Control of Properties**\n\nOne of the most important in manufacturing the gel type of zeolite is the possibility of controlling the size, weight and capacity of the finished product. Size of zeolite particles, together with weight\u2014that is, its effective weight in water\u2014is most important for it is by these factors that the zeolite becomes practical in its appearance.\n\nCompared to greensand, the particles of which are very small, the grains of CRYSTALITE are giants. Were it not for the fact that usually several of the tiny greensand grains are held together as one by a foreign clay or cement-like binder, they could hardly be used. When separated by wear or use, the pores would be too small to be retained by any material except the binder.\n\nGreensand is used in making this comparison because no control of size can be brought to bear in its preparation. It is necessary to take it as it comes. The same that can be done to separate each out the single small nodules will save the larger usable grains. Whether these larger particles will hold together for any length of time is a question. Certainly they do not appear with us and this fact accounts for the increased pressure losses experienced by all users of greensand softeners.\n\nAs lower backwash rates become necessary in order that the fine material may be retained in the apparatus serious packing with consequent high pressure loss occurs. While the retained fine material continues to soften some water, it accomplishes this at a much increased cost. This packed condition which holds about unequal contact between hard water and greensand explains the reason for short capacity runs. The usual results of this condition are the necessity for more frequent regeneration, higher rates of wash water, greater waste of wash water and, of course, greater pumping costs to overcome the drop in pressure.\n\nThe average size of CRYSTALITE grains is much greater than that of greensand and the CRYSTALITE grain is not made up of many smaller granules which tend to separate with use. CRYSTALITE grains are sharp cornered and irregular in shape and this fact alone lessens the chance of CRYSTALITE to pack to such a great extent that the pressure loses through a bed of CRYSTALITE are only a fraction of those through a bed of greensand of the same volume and under similar conditions. It is obvious, therefore, that high softening rates are possible with CRYSTALITE while the rates for greensand must be greatly limited.\n\n---\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\nCRYSTALITE is a zeolite possessing those properties which enable it to meet the practical requirements of supplying zero hardness water with greater efficiency than has been attained heretofore. Its development is an interesting record, but telling the story is hardly possible outside the bounds of a purely technical treatise. For those who are interested in this phase of the subject a separate special treatise prepared by our technical staff will be sent upon request.\nWhy Greensand Came Into Use\n\nGreensand came into general use because of its then comparatively rapid softening activity and quick regeneration. While possessing these characteristics, it has at the same time proved to be limited in total capacity, requiring a greater amount of water per bed; several regenerations are required in order that the apparatus may be of reasonable size and cost.\n\nZeolites that preceded greensand were abandoned largely because of their much slower softening activity, not because they were inferior, as several of them were of much greater total capacity than greensand. Also, the flexibility of these early zeolites was beyond question, for there are notable cases of where they have operated successfully for periods of over ten years time.\n\nThe Type-C Solenizer is now in use frankly and with due regard for all points including VER-DITE, the superior greensand used for over five years by the International Filter Co. The main purpose is to make available the advantages in zeolite softeners, to have the superior performance of CRYSTALITE, and its greater total capacity, a decided advance. These points are dealt with in the following pages.\n\nAdvantages of Greater Capacity\n\nAlthough the depth of the zeolite bed in the apparatus may be varied somewhat, this dimension of the bed is not varied so much as the cross-sectional area. Usually the sectional area is circular because of the uniform softening action. Although many are operated in vertical position, some are placed in a horizontal position solely to obtain greater area in a single unit. In this position the shape of the cross-section is of course, more nearly rectangular.\n\nIt is the area that must vary in proportion to the flow required in gallons per hour. For example, a bed of 500 square feet area will require twice the area of one 250 gallons per hour, etc. The unit of area, therefore, as in filter practice, becomes the unit by which the size of a water softener is reckoned, and the size of area of the bed is fixed. A bed of greensand of standard depth and one square foot in area has a capacity of about 10,000 grains of hardness calculated as calcium carbonate. This means simply that it can soften 500 gallons of 20 grains hardness, or 250 gallons of 40 grains, each multiplied by the hardness in grains, will equal 10,000 grains\u2014total of softening work. Each time this amount of work is done, the bed must be regenerated\u2014a process requiring (1) a cleaning wash, (2) a contact with brine, and (3) a fresh water wash to expel the waste products of regeneration. Altogether, a square foot column of greensand consumes 50 to 60 gallons of water in each cycle of regeneration. The amount of water wasted is 10 to 12 percent of the capacity (500 gallons) with water of 20 grains hardness, and this percentage becomes higher as the hardness increases because the capacity of the bed reduces in the same proportion as the hardness increases and vice versa, while the amount of water required for regenerating is about constant. This item of waste water and regenerating costs the same amount of labor and is an important consideration especially with the harder waters.\n\nCRYSTALITE with its much greater total capacity reduces this item of cost fully 50% and the reason is obvious. The capacity of one square foot bed of CRYSTALITE of usual depth is twice that of greensand, or 20,000 grains, which is equal to 1000 gallons of water of 20 grains hardness.\n\nSince the bed of CRYSTALITE regenerates with substantially the same amount of waste water, namely 50 to 60 gallons, the waste is only 5 to 6 percent. Another thing, the frequency of attention for regeneration is reduced to half that necessary for greensand.\n\nWhen water itself is an item of cost, and it usually is even when pumped from a nearby free supply, the Type-C Solenizer cuts this cost item in half.\n\nThe Advantages of Greater Speed of Activity\n\nZeolites that preceded greensand were capable of handling water of 20 grains hardness at only slow rates of flow. The usual flow per square foot of area was about 85 gallons per hour. With greensand, this increased to about 160 gallons per hour and because of this quite radical increase one can readily reconcile the term \"rapid rate\" which came to be applied to greensand softeners.\nNow because of a similar increase, CRYSTALITE softeners are termed \"super-rapid,\" the rate per unit of area having been increased 100% over that of greensand to deliver tons per hour of 30 grain water.\n\nCRYSTALITE softeners offer some great greensand softeners; therefore, possess twice the capacity per regeneration and 100% greater flexibility. Or to make the more practical comparison, CRYSTALITE softeners of the same capacity per regeneration as greensand softeners use half the area and thus require less space for installation and are of equal flexibility in flow rate.\n\nAlso, because of the lesser area, the amount of water wasted per regeneration is 50% of that of the greensand softener.\n\nSalt Consumption and Economy\n\nThe usual rating given to CRYSTALITE is 1000 grams of exchange capacity for each half pound of salt consumed. By varying the amount of salt used for regeneration, the capacity total in gallons may be varied considerably at will. This variation can cover a range of nearly 200% with the salt rate varying from .4 to .7 of a pound per thousand gallons.\n\nThus it is possible to select a salt rate which will give a capacity fitting the soft water requirements of any shift or day. Also the selection of salt rate makes possible a constant supply of soft water regardless of the small changes in hardness of the raw water.\n\nEffective Size and Weight\n\nThe weight of a zeolite may be greatly misleading. To state that greensand weighs 90 pounds per cubic foot while CRYSTALITE weighs but 50 pounds per cubic foot sounds discouraging for the latter. The effective size of greensand, however, is another subject entirely. While greensand is actually heavier on the scales than an equal volume of CRYSTALITE, the importance of effective size and relative weight in water softening cannot be overlooked. The same is true of sands selected for filtration work\u2014many are rejected because the grains are too small to measure up to the effectiveness required.\n\nIt must be kept in mind that in a slowly rising column of water, very small particles of even a very heavy substance will tend to lift while larger particles of the same substance will tend to settle. This is because the very tiny particle has more surface for its bulk and weight than a larger particle of the same substance; the surface friction of the passing water on the green sand is the case of smaller particle, its tendency to move along becomes greater as the size of the particle diminishes.\n\nGreensand has an effective size of 0.25 millimeters, and when many of the grains break up into the minute particles of which they are composed, the effective size becomes so reduced that loss on back washing must occur; or if the wash rate is reduced to prevent this loss, then the bed becomes mud-like and almost impervious to the passage of water.\n\nCRYSTALITE has an effective size of 0.45 or nearly double that of greensand. And while this difference is partially offset by the lesser dry weight of CRYSTALITE, the result is an effective weight in water slightly greater for CRYSTALITE than for the greensand grains of proper size.\n\nThis means that at the same washing and cleaning rates, CRYSTALITE is less tendency to bleed CRYSTALITE with the same water than is the case with greensand. Further, it is possible to greatly reduce this danger by increasing the effective size of CRYSTALITE, a matter entirely beyond the control of man in the case of the natural greensand.\n\nEffect of Size on Resistance to Flow\n\nIt has been pointed out that the effective size of CRYSTALITE is nearly double that of greensand. A crude example will illustrate the effect of size upon the resistance to the passage of water. For instance, a tube of lead shot (shot being lead) inch in diameter will pass the same flow of water much more readily than the same tube filled with lead shot only one-sixteenth inch in diameter. The entire stream is more finely divided in the case of the\nThe following tabular comparison of Crystalite with Greensand on the fundamental basis of a unit sq. ft. of Zeolite beds summarizes the preceding statements concerning both\n\n**Crystalite (Normal Rating)**\n\n- Unit Content: 3.0 Cu.

In.\n\n---\n\n**The Smaller Sizes**\n\nVertical softeners of the C Type are built in two styles. The smaller sizes of this type are of our Style P design which applies to those having a diameter of 42 inches or less.\n\n**The Larger Sizes**\n\nAll larger sizes ranging in diameter from 48 inches to 108 inches are of our Style S design. Description of these two general styles is given in sufficient detail to serve as a specification.\n\n**The Style P**\n\nContainers for Style P International Softeners are built for working pressures of 100 pounds per square inch. While lighter metal would be used for these Style P sizes for lower working pressures it is not deemed good practice to use it. Deterioration of the containers is mostly from the outside in, and is due to the tendency to apply paint to the paint after the original shop or field coats have worn out. Condensation which forms on all cold metal surfaces subjected to a humid atmosphere together with the exposure to air works havoc with metal. Without proper paint protection, renewal when...\nnecessary, serious rusting of the outside takes place, thus weakening the metal. For this reason heavier metal than required for ordinary pressures is used and the standard of these International Softeners is for 100 pounds working pressure.\n\n**Style P Container Design**\n\nThe design of the Style P container takes into account the comparatively small inside space of these sizes, also the fact that assembly is often handled in the field without our supervision. To facilitate handling and setting them, no pipe underdrain is used, thus avoiding the usual concrete fill for the bottom and saving the time for the setting. Instead, these sizes are provided with heavy steel pipe underdrains containing No. 3 International Tobin Bronze Strainers, the same as used in International filter plants. Spacing of the strainers is six inches center to center and the throat size is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch diameter.\n\n**Style S Container Design**\n\nThe larger sizes of the Style S design are built for a working pressure of 67 pounds per square inch. To save head room, the lower connection of these containers is placed in the side of the shell and made up to the central header of the underdrain consisting of lateral pipe spaced six inches center to center. The laterals carry No. 3 International Tobin Bronze Strainers placed six inches center to center in both directions. After the underdrain is assembled in the shell, the remaining space is filled with concrete and the top cemented over to form a smooth floor for the softener bed. Only the strainers project through the cement from the underdrain to provide the necessary water passages to and from the softener bed.\n\nThe upper connection is in the center of the top container head which is provided with the necessary man-holes. Instead of the usual cast concrete immediately under the upper connection, a water stilling baffle is built into the container, requiring no assembly or attention during installation.\n\n**Supports**\n\nContainers of all Type C International Softeners are equipped with heavy cast iron supports at main level floor of proper thickness to carry the weight. Ball type flanges riveted securely to the bottom head prevent tipping and avoid the danger of injuring workmen engaged in setting containers when placed upon loose or jointed supports. The ball flanges rest upon heavy cast floor plate sockets extended sufficiently to give the necessary under clearance.\n\n**Type C Control**\n\nAll main operating valves for each Type C International Softener Unit are furnished together with the necessary fittings, arranged in an assembly ready to be mounted on the softener front. Six main operating valves are required for the three simple operations of regeneration. Only two valves are open at a time\u2014one to bring brine in, second\u2014to admit the regenerating salt brine, and third\u2014to wash out the waste products of regeneration.\n\nWhile the Softener Unit is in service, its two main valves, inlet and outlet, are open, all others being closed. It will be noted that all valves are within easy reach and logically arranged so that operation is readily understood.\nFlow Indicator\n\nThe control of each Type C Softener Unit is provided with a flow indicator gauge to guide the operator during the regeneration cycle. It is necessary to backwash the filter type softener immediately prior to the following salt brine regeneration. This is a process which is performed best and with most economical use of water, at a certain rate of flow. The Indicator Gauge permits the operator to tell the operator at a glance when the flow is exactly right. Adjustment in flow to the correct indicated wash rate may be made by slight increase or decrease in the wash valve opening.\n\nThe same Flow Indicator serves during the re-wash operation\u2014merely opening the rewash waste valve until the gauge registers proper flow for the operation is all that is necessary. The importance of performing this operation accurately alike each time is possible should not be left to the judgment of the operator. No man can look at a stream of water and state the quantity of flow with any degree of accuracy. The International Indicator Gauge completely eliminates the guess work; reduces the regeneration to routine operations which are always handled alike; and brings the resulting performance up to and maintains it at highest efficiency.\n\nInterconnected Loss of Head Gauge and Test Cocks\n\nEach Type C Softener Unit is provided with suitable pressure gauge interconnectors and pressure test cocks so that either inlet or outlet pressures may be observed. The use of one gauge for this double purpose is necessary on the International Softener because the usual difference in pressure between inlet and outlet is too little to be registered by separate gauges or a duplex gauge of ordinary accuracy.\n\nThe main purpose of the loss of head gauge is to provide the operator with means for keeping track of the softener bed condition, especially during times of peak loads or during times when the turbidity of the raw water may be higher than ordinarily should be supplied to the softener.\n\nThe manifold connections for the loss of head gauge are provided with cocks for drawing samples of raw or soft water for test purposes, and, in all, with the centralized valve system bring every means of control to the front of each softener unit.\n\nSoft Water Meter\n\nThe meter supplied with each Type C Softener Unit is a standard make with straight reading register in Imp. Gallons, rate indicator hand, and set-back contact arm and connections for electric signal bell. A differential float type meter is placed on the soft water outlet so that only clean soft water passes through same. This position of the meter avoids set back adjustments for regeneration water which would be necessary if the meter were placed on the inlet side.\n\nMeasure of water for backwashing and rewashing is provided for on the Type C Unit through the use of the Flow Indicator Gauge used to control these operations. It is possible, therefore, to keep a constant check at all times on the performance and cost of operating the International Type C Softener.\nSalt Storage Brine Tank\n\nThe storage tank is several regeneration tanks provided from the International Softener Tank. Although the standard brine tank is made 48 inches in height for convenience in recharging, tanks of any size or shape to better accommodate available space, and of greater storage for salt, can be furnished. For unusual conditions, designed self storage will be drawn up so that purchasers may build their own brine tanks or reservoirs.\n\nIn addition to being a storage for salt, the International brine tank is also equipped with a brine solution accumulator and measuring device. Each standard brine tank is fitted with an underdrain or draw-off system located at the entire bottom. This system is overlaid with a layer of 12 to 16 inches filter gravel which supports the bed of salt above. The advantage of this method of construction is in avoiding the use of wooden or concrete boxes which take up space and prevent uneven withdrawal of brine from the salt bed above. Also, more rapid withdrawal of brine is possible with assured obtaining saturated solution and therefore accurate measure of salt used each time.\n\nSalt Handling and Measure\n\nIt is not necessary to measure or weigh the salt piled in the brine tank. To assure saturated solution in the draw-off, a layer of salt at least 10 to 12 inches deep must lie upon the layer of gravel at all times. The full charge of salt may form a bed 24 to 30 inches in depth, but should be replaced when used down to the level of the removable cover placed above. Handling the salt for charging the brine tank is therefore a simple matter\u2014a chore to be performed once in a week or ten days depending upon size of equipment.\n\nThe normal measure of the salts is secured by drawing out of the tank a given amount of saturated solution for each regeneration. Since saturated solution of brine contains a fixed amount of salt per gallon or other unit of volume, measure of salt is secured volumetrically. This method of measure is not only extremely accurate, but is simple to handle.\n\nA depth gauge and indicator mounted in the brine tank shows the exact number of inches of brine drawn out each time.\n\nBrine Delivery\n\nDelivery of the required amount of brine to the Softener unit undergoing regeneration is usually by hydraulic pump or ejector. The suction of the ejector is connected through the side of the brine tank to the draw-off system. The discharge is connected through a control valve to the ejector inlet, and the discharge of diluted brine is piped from the ejector to the brine inlet valve of the softener control front. Ejectors of generous size are supplied with International equipment systems so that the quantity of brine required for a regeneration may be quickly handled to save time.\n\nWhen water pressures are too low to operate hydraulically, and the installation is sizeable, motor driven brine pumps may be used instead of ejectors. Such pumps may be started and stopped by remote control electrical devices when distant settings are required. When conditions are understood, we are pleased to submit drawings for most suitable arrangements of equipment required.\n\nQuality of the Soft Water and Test\n\nWhen the Type C Softener is installed and operated according to the operating instructions, it produces a full capacity of zero hardness water. By zero hardness water, we mean water containing no lime or magnesia that can be detected by the ordinary analytical methods employed in water examination.\n\nThe field soap test should not be confused with or considered the equal in accuracy of the analysis performed in the laboratory. It is merely a rough, handy, and quick means of checking end points of softening. The field soap test is arranged for use with the International Softener is arranged for making a quick, simple determination. The soap solution furnished for the test is made to such a standard that when two ounces are required to form a permanent suds in a given amount of water contains 1.0 grain per Imp. Gallon, or 17 parts per million of hardness as Calcium Carbonate.\nEach additional drop in securing a permanent result, after the first two have been used, counts as another grain of hardness.\n\nThe capacity soft water delivered by the International Softener requires but one drop of this soap solution for the test.\n\nZero-hardness Water Has Many Important Uses\n\nThe Zeolite or base-exchange water softener has a wide range of application in practically every water-consuming industry or institution. The benefits from use of zero-hardness water are of far-reaching and enduring nature. They are actually measured and credited fairly to the softener. These benefits range in value often to the extent of several times the cost, in a year's time. In certain cases, operation with zero-hardness water is so impractical that it becomes almost impossible.\n\nA generally important benefit derived from zero hardness water, is prevention of scale in boilers, heaters, feed pumps, feed pipes and hot water distributing lines. Clean boilers and heaters use less fuel and operate longer without shut-down.\n\nIn laundering, as is obvious, water of zero hardness saves large percentages of soaps, alkalies, and other washing supplies, which are factors in cleaning operations. More work and labor is also saved and what is equally important, the zero hardness water assists materially in improving and maintaining quality of work.\n\nFor many purposes zero hardness water is one of the prime essentials. Uniformity of quality, color and finish all revert back to the condition of the water used. Uniform water of zero hardness becomes an integral part of the conditions under which all work may have an even start. Although net water saves enormous quantities of supplies, much additional benefit is derived through saving of time and labor, rejects, reruns, and spoils.\n\nInstitutions, such as hotels and hospitals, which have many water-consuming departments and extensive plumbing systems, use zero hardness water with advantage all along the line. Hot water equipment and its maintenance are of no small importance, for service must be unfailing.\n\nThe laundering of the linens is of special importance. While there is saving of wash-room supplies with the zero hardness water, the life of linens is greatly increased and the cost of replacements reduced from a third to a half of the amount with hard water washing.\n\nSpecial Industrial Uses for Water of Zero-hardness\n\n1. Feed water for all types of boilers used in stationary steam power plants.\n2. Feed water for locomotives, locomotive boilers, crane boilers, steam shovels, boilers, and the like.\n3. For cooling steam or ammonia surface condensers.\n4. For cooling internal combustion engines, furnace doors and jackets, air and ammonia compressors, transformers, steam turbine bearings, etc.\n5. Absorption of ammonia gas for manufacture of aqua ammonia.\n6. For preparation of cutting oils.\n7. For soap making.\n8. For canning, especially peas and beans.\n9. For filter-char washing in sugar and syrup industries.\n10. For preparation of beverages and certain extracts.\n11. For tanning, especially scouring of hides.\n12. For wool scouring.\n13. For dyeing, bleaching and finishing of all textile fabrics.\n14. For automobile body washing.\n15. For automobile radiators.\n16. For preparing food products and many other purposes.\n\nSoft Water for Municipalities\n\nWith a zeolite which lends itself to more economical operation, the application to city water supplies becomes possible. The two principal operating costs are for the salt used to regenerate the zeolite, and for the water used in the regeneration process. The salt used for regeneration may be reduced to as low as one-third pound per 1,000 gallons of zero hardness water per hardness grain to the gallon.\n\nFor instance, a water containing 15 Grains per Imp. gallon of hardness CaCO\u2083 would require 1 pound of salt per 1,000 gallons softened to zero hardness. Bulk salt in car lots ranges in price from $5.00 to $10.00 per ton delivered, depending considerably upon the freight rates.\n\nThe softening cost with such water ranges therefore, from $12.50 to $25.00 per million gallons. Further reduction in salt cost may be accomplished by by-passing part of the treated, unsalted water into the soft water lines to increase the hardness from zero to about 3 grains per gallon. With water of 15 grains hardness, as much as one gallon may be by-passed to every five gallons that are softened, thus diluting the hardness of the raw water down to 15 grains in 5 gallons, or 3 grains to one gallon. Incidentally, this reduces the softening cost 20%, bringing the figures for salt per million gallons down to $10.00 to $20.00 depending upon the salt cost.\n\nWater cost for regeneration will vary greatly with the different types of zeolites. Since the pressure of water required per square foot of softener bed area is fairly well fixed, the pressure varies inversely with the total exchange capacity of the zeolite selected. It is this property of Crystalite\u2014namely high total capacity which by inverse ratio results in low regeneration water cost\u2014and the low salt cost that bring Crystalite to a practical possibility for municipal supplies.\n\nWhile softening plants for this purpose will all of the same general principles of operation, there are different arrangements of equipment possible. Either of two types of equipment, pressure or gravity, may be used, depending upon the nature of the water supply, methods of pumping, storage, etc., and the need for preliminary sedimentation and filtration.\n\nCrystalite may be used in open gravity basins. The softener bed of Crystalite three feet in depth may be operated at a rate of 100 to 150 gpm per minute per square foot of area with a maximum water head of only eleven and a half feet.

The ancients often went to considerable effort to obtain their water supply from sources of spring water, sometimes at a considerable distance from the town. Rome was supplied with three qualities of water\u2014purest for ceremonial purposes, the next best for the fountains and washing troughs and the very best exclusively for drinking purposes.\n\nWhere turbid waters were, or necessary, used for drinking water there is record that porous sand and porous earthenware filters were used by the ancient Egyptians and also by the Japanese. There is also record of clarification of turbid water by means of a porous vessel filled with a vessel to another by the capillary action of porous material, such as a skin of wool.\n\nSlow Sand Filters:\nThe practical application of filtration to ensure pure water supply dates from about 1800. Records show that in about 1800 slow sand filters were installed in Scotland and that in 1829 one of the London water companies installed slow sand filters at Stepney. The eventual adoption of this system for all of the London water supply, and for many other English cities, was due to the fact that the English system was its use spread throughout Europe.\n\nSlow sand filters are still used to a considerable extent in Europe and also in a number of localities in North America. These filters consist of a number of beds of sand varying in size from one-quarter to one acre, usually rectangular in shape and covered, if the ambient temperature is below thirty degrees. The fine filter bed is superimposed on three or more layers of graded gravel, under which is a simple form of underdrainage, usually with a concrete base provided with suitable piping to control the influent, effluent, etc.\n\nSome waters may be put onto slow sand filters without any preliminary treatment; but in the majority of cases preliminary sedimentation and sometimes sedimentation and coagulation are used to prepare the water for the filters.\n\nWith the slow sand filters an immense surface area becomes available to reach the desired results. The rate of filtration should be maintained at about three million gallons per acre per day. In some cases the rate is half and in others twice that figure. As the sand used is of rather small grain size and the filter bed is shallow, the sand itself acts as a strainer, taking out considerable suspended matter. However, with the slow sand filter the surface of the sand bed provides a place for great numbers of organisms to grow and develop. They form an adherent mat that absorbs and holds the finer organic substances in the water. This mat or film (sometimes referred to as the schmutzdecke) is the active part of the bed until it has been clogged. The efficiency of the filter is very low. To ripen the filter bed the slow sand filter is started at about one-third of its usual rate and then increased gradually so that not until three or four weeks is the filter operated at its normal capacity.\n\nDepending upon the diameter of the slow water tank whether it has been given preliminary treatment, the rate of filtration, the maximum loss of head allowable, etc., the slow sand filter will operate when carrying 30,000 to 400,000,000 gallons per acre of filter are before cleaning is necessary.\n\nThe slow sand filter is cleaned by scraping and removing from the filter an inch or two of sand from the surface of the bed and then backwashing and either pouring back into the bed immediately or put in the storage bins and replaced after the backwashing (cleaning).\n\nSlow sand filters are limited in use to handling waters of low turbidity and color and where sufficient ground area is available to provide for the immense filter beds and settling basins.\n\nRapid Sand Filters:\nThe first rapid sand or \"mechanical\" filters were built in the United States during the early 1800's. They were initially by the paper industry to solve the problem of clarifying large volumes of water and removing the finer particles of suspended matter that were spoiling their product.\n\nThese early filters consisted of cylindrical tanks provided with a simple draining underdrain system, a series of pipes and troughs with water troughs and operating piping. They were not capable of removing the finer or colloidal suspended matter, nor did they depend on removal of bacteria. However, they crudely served their purpose and represented an immense saving for the factory because of savings in first cost and space required.\n\nRapid sand filters differ from slow sand filters not only in the rate of flow of water through the sand bed\u2014but also in design, construction and operation. The smaller area of the filter bed, consequently less possibility of clogging, requires means for rapid and automatic cleaning. The rate of flow is high to quickly wash the sand gate to the early days of mechanical filters. The high rate of filtration (12,000 gallons per minute per dry yard or even more) necessitates the use of a coagulant and uniform filter sand\u2014as well as the formation of an adherent mat on the sand bed.\n\nWhen the introduction of chemical coagulants to gather together the finer suspended matter and to make this artificial mat gave the coagulant plants a big up and fed as a solution.\n\nPractically all waters are alkaline and this natural alkalinity, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonates, precipitate as alum with a resultant heavy white flocculent precipitate of aluminum hydrate. If the water is not naturally alkaline, the natural alkalinity has been neutralized by continuous dilution and refiltration as in swimming pool filter systems\u2014artificial alkalinity is added in the form of soda ash or sodium carbonate or of sal-soda if a preformed alkalinity feeder is used.\n\nThe action of the insoluble gelatinous sticky aluminum hydrate can be compared to that of the white egg in clearing coffee. It coalesces all the suspended matter, absorbs the color, and gathers the finer particles into floes that can be readily removed or which are caught on the filter sand being pressed down through the spaces between the grains. The coagulum forms a gelatinous mat on the surface of, and in the\nupper part of the filter sand, constituting the real filtering medium.\n\nDuring coagulation, the originally round or cloudy water undergoes a complete change in appearance; for in place of the murkiness the impurities become coarse grains and flocculent, with the result that they find their way to the bottom. It is then a comparatively simple matter to filter the water.\n\n**Underdrain Systems:**\n\nThe underdrain system of a rapid sand filter serves a two-fold purpose\u2014it must be uniformly distributed the water during washing and to collect the filtered water without loss of sand. The underdrain actually consists of the gravel layer and the distributing manifold system.\n\nAside from supporting the sand bed\u2014the gravel is the principal means of distributing the wash water and many cases of faulty filter operation can be traced to improperly graded, poor quality or not sufficient filter gravel.\n\nTo uniformly collect the filtered water\u2014but more important\u2014to supply wash water to the underside of the gravel\u2014is the purpose of the distributing manifold. The systems in common use are:\n\n- A pipe manifold system with bronze \"strainers\" or orifice nozzles screened into the tops of the holes between the laterals.\n- A pipe manifold system, the pipes perforated on the underside in either single or double rows.\n\nThe \"Wagner Bottom\"\u2014distributing pipes with large perforations interspaced by slotted precast concrete blocks.\n- Concrete \"sand valley\" with perforated bronze plate or perforated pipe in bottom of valley.\n- \"Wheeler Bottom\" with balls geometrically placed in pyramid hoppers.\n- \"Strainers\" or orifice nozzles in false metal or concrete bottoms.\n\n**Gravel Layers:**\n\nIn order to properly support the filter sand, the gravel must be small enough in the top layer, and to diffuse the wash water\u2014must be fairly large at the lowest layer around or on top of the distributing manifold. Each grading must be of fairly uniform size and practically free from flat pieces. The gradation must be such that the small pebbles from falling through lower layers.\n\nModern practice calls for as many as five and sometimes three gradations ranging in size from 2\u00bd inches at the bottom to \u00bc inch diameter at the top.\n\n**Filter Sand:**\n\nSilica sand, which was the first material used, is still the accepted standard material of today. Crushed stone, crushed marble, charcoal, etc., and screened anthracite coal have also been used\u2014but usually to take care of some special conditions. Porous filter materials are to be avoided as they cannot be washed clean and are breeding places for bacteria.\n\nWhereas action was formerly paid to the quality and uniformity of the filter sand, recent practice has proven that for proper results definite standards must be met and now this filtering medium must pass rigid tests and specifications.\n\nSand performs its function as a filtering medium through its ability to hold back the coagulated or floe containing the suspended and colloidal matter in the water. Practically speaking, the top surface of the sand performs this duty, and it is assumed in practice that none of the finer grades penetrate to a depth of six inches into the sand. It is customary to provide a depth of sand of from 18 to 36 inches in industrial filters, to as much as 10 inches in municipal filters, the latter extreme depth being required only when the filter is operated on behalf or the individual practice of some engineers.\n\nThe sand bed should not be so shallow as to be easily clogged or broken through during filtering and yet not deep as to offer needed resistance to the flow of water.\n\nSuitability of a sand as a filtering medium depends upon its mechanical character, freedom from clay, dirt, organic matter and other impurities, and its grading. Since the smaller uniform size the smaller grains will pack in the voids between the coarser grains causing undue resistance to the flow of water. Coarse uniform grains are considered preferable to sharp grains because the former do not pack so readily and clean much better.\n\nTwo measures are used to draw a fairly accurate picture of the size and grading of filter sand. These are the \"Effective Size\" and the \"Uniformity Coefficient.\"\n\nBy \"Effective Size\" is meant the size of the sand grains\u2014usually expressed in decimal fractions\u2014a percentage\u2014than which 10% by weight of the sand is finer and 90% coarser. Thus the \"Effective Size\" is the minimum size of the sand grains that will pass, but it does not indicate either the limits of coarseness or the degree of uniformity in the size of the particles added in the 90%.\n\nTherefore, in order to assure that the filtration is not impaired a test analysis of the sand is made. This is the size of sand grains than which 60% by weight of the sand in the sample will pass. This value divided by the \"Effective Size\" is called the \"Uniformity Coefficient.\"\n\nFor example, if a screen analysis showed that 10% of a sand was finer than 0.40 millimeter, and 60% was finer than 0.64 millimeter\u2014the Effective Size would be 0.40 millimeter, and the Uniformity Coefficient would be 0.64 divided by 0.40 or 1.6. Obviously, the more uniform the sand the closer the sizes will be the sizes of grains than which 10% is finer and than which 50% is finer\u2014or the closer will be the Uniformity Coefficient approach 1.0.\n\nThe most desirable \"Effective Size\" and \"Uniformity Coefficient\" depend upon the condition of filter sand and the quality of filtered water desired. Modern practice calls for at least two gradings of filter sand. Internationally, the range of variation of the \"Effective Size\" of from 0.35 to 0.55 m.m.\u2014as conditions warrant\u2014and Uniformity Coefficient of from 1.75 to 1.6.\n\nWhen a filter is washed, the entire sand bed rises and gradually moves down the pipes on top, grading down to the coarsest at the bottom\u2014so that such sand automatically produces the several size condition that is most desired.\n\n**Chemical Requirements:**\n\nThe filter bed must be insoluble in water and must not contain any filter aids. The gravel from clay, dirt, organic matter and other impurities, and its grading. Since the smaller uniform size the smaller grains will pack in the voids between the coarser grains causing undue resistance to the flow of water. Coarse uniform grains are considered preferable to sharp grains because the former do not pack so readily and clean much better.\nRates of Filtration:\n\nThe maximum rate of filtration depends upon the required quality of filtered water, the character and condition of the sand bed, and the character of the water to be filtered. Water can be forced through a pressure filter at enormous rates if sufficient pressure is applied\u2014but the water will be heated and at excessive rates the water will hardly be \"strained,\" the coagulant will be driven down into the sand and thus not be eliminated during the wash.\n\nFor efficient operation and proper quality of effluent, the rate of filtration should be carefully controlled and fluctuated. Standard practice has set a rate of from two to three gallons per minute per sq. ft. of filter area as being satisfactory. Rates higher than these may be required or allowable under special conditions.\n\nThe standard specifications for pressure water filters, as approved by the American Waterworks Association and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, give the following rates of filtration as standards:\n\nWhenever the water is to be used for domestic purposes, the rate of filtration shall be such that the capacity shall be based on a rate of filtration not to exceed 2 gallons per minute per sq. ft. of filtering area and a coagulant must be used.\n\nRates of filtration for various uses should conform to the following schedule:\n\n- 2 gals. per sq. ft. per minute for all supplies used for drinking, or for the preparation of food products.\n- 2 to 4 gals. per sq. ft. per minute when filtering a treated municipal supply of approved bacterial purity.\n- 2 to 5 gals. per sq. ft. per minute for swimming pools and for all industrial uses.\n- 2 to 5 gals. per sq. ft. per minute as conditions may warrant for domestic filtration, using sand and activated carbon, where reduction of color, odor, taste or certain forms of iron is desired. This method of filtration is not to be applied for bacterial purification.\n\nWashing:\n\nProvision for proper washing of the sand bed is equally as important as the filter itself. The filter must be cleaned regularly to remove what is removed from the water and will continue to work satisfactorily only so long as it is properly washed. A filter cannot be operated at its maximum allowable loss of head is reached\u2014or until the desired rate can no longer be maintained.\n\nThis can be regulated by shutting off the filter out of service, the waste valve opened and water\u2014preferably filtered water\u2014admitted to the unfiltered side of the filter. This will wash the sand or float the sand bed, to scrub or scour the sand and to flush out the accumulated impurities.\n\nFrom three to five minutes of wash time are required to clean the sand bed\u2014with six minutes as an average figure. From nine to ten percent of the water filter is the wash amount of wash water used\u2014with three per cent an average.\n\nThe rate of flow of wash water required for efficient cleaning depends upon the size of sand, the system of washing, and the efficiency of the wash water distributing system. The modern\u2014and simplest\u2014type of filter is called the \"high velocity\" wash where the velocity of the wash water alone thoroughly scours and cleans the sand.\n\nHigh velocity wash needs the most efficient form of distributing manifold system and proper grading grading to provide washout of the gravel layers and provide uniform distribution of wash water. The rate of flow of wash water required is 15 gals. per min. per sq. ft. of filter area (24 inches vertical rise per minute), although rates as low as 8 gals. per min. (13 inches vertical rise) have been found satisfactory.\n\nWhen wash water is not available for high velocity wash\u2014air or mechanical agitation may be used to loosen the filter bed. With such preliminary agitation, the wash water requires wash water at a velocity of 12 to 15 inches vertical rise per minute (8 to 10 gals. per sq. ft.). The use of mechanical agitation is obsolete but the air wash system\u2014if properly designed\u2014will satisfactorily solve the occasional problem of insufficient wash water.\n\nThe proper rate of flow of wash water is not important\u2014provided at low rates of wash for even long periods of wash water does not wash out the impurities during backwashing, the waste outlet, trough or pipe should be a definite distance above the surface of the sand bed. This distance is determined as the depth of the sand bed.\n\nFreeboard:\n\nTo prevent sand from being washed out with the impurities during backwashing, the waste outlet, trough or pipe should be a definite distance above the surface of the sand bed. This distance is determined as the depth of the sand bed.\n\nPressure Filters:\n\nThe use of pressure filters is as old as the practice of rapid sand filtration. The term \"pressure\" is used to designate any type of rapid sand filter in which the filter bed is placed in a closed container, through which the water passes under pressure. This does not mean that high pressure is required to pass water through the filter. To operate economically the pressure consumed is not more than two pounds at its maximum, and is usually measured about one pound directly after the filter is washed.\n\nIn comparison with gravity and open type rapid sand filters, the pressure filters have certain apparent advantages. Connection may be made up to the filter tank and there is no need for water distribution except that contained in the filter, as mentioned above. Repumping of the wash water is not necessary, and the filters may be quickly installed on simple foundations and usually fit into some available space. Therefore, the loss of water due to frequent backwashing may be eliminated. Less precision in operation is demanded. The first cost is lower.\nINTERNATIONAL PRESSURE FILTERS\n\nTypes and Sizes:\n\nInternational Pressure Filters such as are shown in this bulletin are of two general types\u2014vertical and horizontal. The vertical type International Filters range in size from 6 to 96 inches diameter. These sizes are used for homes, drinking water systems, hotels, apartment houses, etc., where space permits. They may be used singly, in pairs or in batteries of three or more. For greater capacity the International Pressure Filters are used. The horizontal type are built in two diameters\u20147 and 8 feet\u2014and range in length from 8 to 25 feet.\n\nInternational Filters of Other Types:\n\nInternational Filters of the gravity or open type are described in other bulletins. This type has the filter bed in open wood or concrete units and has important advantages in certain situations of operation but, of course, is not constructed to operate under pressure as the type shown herein.\n\nCoagulation:\n\nCoagulation and filtration are very intimately related in the field of water purification. The use of a coagulant in connection with the pressure filter is essential if it is desired to remove all suspended matter visible to the naked eye. The spaces between the granules of the filter bed are sufficiently large to allow the finer particles to pass through the filter. In order to retain all the suspended matter in the filter bed it is necessary that the impurities be brought together into comparatively large particles. This is accomplished by introducing a coagulant, alum, by means of the coagulant feeder. The small amount of alum fed into the water is entirely and immediately decomposed by the alkalinity originally present in the water or which may be added. The chemical reaction which takes place produces hydrate of alumina, a heavy, sticky compound of alumina. At the same time, the electrolytic force set free induces the finer particles to gather together in floes, each of which becomes enveloped in the sticky hydrate of alumina.\n\nSedimentation:\n\nWhile comparatively few waters require sedimentation in connection with International Pressure Filters, it can be used advantageously with very turbid waters. The purpose of preliminary sedimentation are to allow the suspended and coagulated matter to settle, to provide time for coagulating compounds to reach precipitation, to remove most of a large amount of work (at least 80 percent), thereby reducing the washing of filters to a minimum.\n\nThe time required for settling out suspended matter varies depending on the size and weight of the particles, amount of coagulant used, etc. Where coagulation is considered preliminary to passing the water through International Filters, a period of two to six hours holding time is generally allowed. This period determines the size of settling basin required.\n\nDouble Feeder with Proprietary Valve to supply artificial alkalinity as well as coagulant.\n\nInternational Gravity Coagulant Feeder:\n\nWhere the coagulant is fed into the pump suction line and mixed with the water entering the regulating and settling basin it is desirable and often preferable to use the International Gravity Coagulant Feeder. Two constant rate tanks are provided so that one batch can be made up while the other tank is in service. Minimum sulphate is placed in the saturated dissolving box and dissolved by the water from the spray down pipe. The solution of proper definite strength is fed to the constant level orifice box and from there piped to either a pump suction line or directly to the regulating basin.\n\nThe coagulant control may be either of the constant rate type with the International micro-control valve or the manually controlled variable rate type where proportioning equipment is furnished so that the amount of coagulant fed will be in exact proportion to the varying flow of water.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nInternational Filter Shell:\n\nInternational Pressure Filters are substantially constructed of the best materials available. The standard design is suitable for all ordinary purposes up to 150 pounds per square inch. Filters for higher pressures are furnished, an extra charge being made for the heavier materials used. The shells are of heavy cast iron, firmly riveted and well caulked. All heads are flanged and given standard maximum dish. Every shell is tested under static internal pressure fifty per cent greater than the maximum working pressure for which it is designed. Manholes and handholes for easy access to the interior are provided as needed.\n\nInternational Distributing Manifold System:\n\nThe only practical distributing manifold for use with pressure filters is the pipe manifold consisting of a header pipe with distributing lateral pipes spaced six inches center to center. The units and the steel tank construction does not readily permit the use of systems such as the Wagner type connecting head boxes.\n\nFalse bottoms of steel plate\u2014unless ridiculously remote\u2014will pulsate or \"breathe\" so that it is impossible for the orifice nozzles or \"strainers\" from working loose and blowing out during washing. If the plate is perforated in place of using gravel grading its action during washing will displace the gravel layers.\n\nTo provide perfect collection of filtered water and uniform distribution of wash water from all points directly under the surface of the filter bed the International manifold is of the pipe manifold type. The header pipe is oversize and the laterals are spaced not more than 6 inches center to center, and are of area larger than the total area of the perforations or orifice nozzles in each lateral. To meet certain conditions, the manifold system can be installed in the lateral type, where perforations, spaced 3 inches center to center, are set in the underside of the gravel pipe and the latter set close to the concrete floor of the filter. Jet action is overcome by the extreme steepness of the concrete floor and driving before changing direction and working downward through the gravel layers.\n\nThe standard manifold system on International general purpose pressure filters is of the pipe manifold type with International Umbrella Nozzles. Header and lateral pipes are oversize and the laterals are spaced six inches center to center. The orifice nozzles are of the umbrella type\u2014center center to center in both directions\u2014are screwed into the top side of the laterals. The concrete floor of the filter is brought up to inside of the lateral system and provide a smooth floor under the gravel.\n\nFilter Bed:\n\nThe required filter sand and gravel is furnished with International Filters, shipped separately ready to put in place when the filter is installed. The gravel is specially selected, washed clean, and of the proper size and number of gradings. The filter medium is carefully weighted to fit the size of the filter, size and uniformity in accordance with the standards of modern filter practice.\n\nInternational Tobin Bronze Distributing Nozzle:\n\nThe International Tobin Bronze Distributing Nozzle was developed to provide a \"strainer\" that would accomplish every required purpose\u2014to stand abuse and wear under all operating conditions\u2014and to eliminate the common faults of ordinary \"strainers.\"\n\nIt is made in but two pieces\u2014the body and the cap\u2014both parts of genuine Tobin bronze. The body is a forging, the cap and the rivets being an integral part of the body\u2014and of real riveting metal. The cap is of one piece, scientifically formed with a chamfered cone and umbrella edge\u2014both perfectly formed for efficient distribution. The river heads are spun and polished to assure a perfect seal between cap and body. The throat is accurately bored to proper diameter with chamfered edge to insure free inflow. The strainer is accurately graded \u00bd inch size by automatic dies. The hexagon shaped part of the body permits the use of a standard wrench for installations.\n\nThe term \"strainer\" to describe this part of the distributing system is now obsolete. Before it was learned that proper gravel and correct gravel grading should be depended on to keep the gravel bed clean, many other forms of actual sand strainers were used\u2014and many are still being offered today. With correct gravel grading and the distributing manifold system of efficient design and construction, there is virtually no possibility of burying the gravel or allowing sand to get to the bottom of the filter. The purpose of the \"strainer\" of today is to store and convey wash water and is that of an efficient distribution of wash water under the entire bottom of the gravel bed.\n\nA few of the advantages of the International New Tobin Umbrella Type Nozzle are:\n\n- It has but one interior orifice which will not clog because it is constructed with multiple orifices or slots inevitably clogging within a comparatively short time.\n\n- It prevents rapid diffusion by the cone umbrella cap, diverting the water downward in all directions with rapid \"get-away\" yet extremely low velocity. This prevents rapid diffusion throughout the entire underside of the gravel layers. Multiple orifice strainers produce a jet action which is undesirable and destructive to the gravel bed\u2014but in any case as a jet or number of jets\u2014which puts the responsibility of diffusion throughout of the gravel bed and uniform distribution is rarely accomplished.\n\n- Better constructed entirely of Tobin bronze it is far superior in its resistance to corrosion than strainers of brass or so called \"acid bronze.\"\n\n- The base\u2014with its rivets\u2014being a forging, it is more homogeneous and stronger than the more or less harsh of ordinary strainers and the rivets are much more uniform and ductile. The rivets, being an integral part of the forging, will never work loose.\nOperation:\n\nWater enters the International Filter through the top and is distributed evenly throughout the filter area by a baffle which prevents the incoming water from striking the sand bed and disturbing the surface film. The water passes downward through the filter bed and travels the clean filtered water uniformly collected from beneath the gravel by the manifold system, through which it flows to the outlet connection.\n\nTo remove the collected sediment or suspended matter, the filter is periodically cleaned by reversing the flow of water. The dirty water enters at the bottom, is first distributed by the manifold system, further distributed by the umbrella plates and finally washed out through the gravel layers. As the water rises the filter bed expands and is loosened; the sediment lifting and passing out to waste with the wash water.\n\nInternational Filter Control:\n\nAll immediate pipe, valve and fittings necessary for proper operation are furnished with each filter. Standard gate valves are used to assure perfect reliability and uniform efficiency\u2014as single control multi-port plug valves, although cheaper, will leak sooner or later and permit unfiltered water to pass the filter. Valves of inch and smaller sizes of the screwed pattern, flanged valves being used on larger sizes.\n\nInternational Filter Battery:\n\nWhere it is desirable to provide for continuous service, the use of a battery of filters water storage is obvious. But if storage is not desired over the brief washing periods cannot be provided conveniently, a battery of two or more International Filters should be used. Each filter of a battery is washed at a time and a complete shut-off of the filtered water supply is thereby prevented.\n\nAnother advantage of having filtered water storage is that the filter may be washed with filtered water, thus not only descaling and sometimes cleaning. The \"battery of three or more\" International Filters provides for washing with filtered water and for storage of the storage. Any one filter of a battery of three or more filters can be washed with filtered water from the others, by slightly increasing their normal rate of filtration during such washing period.\n\nRate of Flow Controller:\n\nAlthough not furnished as standard equipment, pressure filters of all types and makes should be provided with rate of flow controllers, especially if partial bacterial purification is expected or the water is to be used for domestic purposes\u2014and for the better general operation of the filter. It is generally a gravity filter installation that is made without rate of flow controller and under these conditions of a gravity filter so much more possible than here is even greater reason for automatic control.\n\nDepending upon the piping arrangement, the rate of flow controller is placed in either the inlet or outlet line of each filter. The International Rate of Flow Controller, of the Venturi type, the differential head automatically controlling the movement of the indicator device so that the filter cannot deliver a greater amount of water than that determined by the setting on the controller. With filters equipped with controllers each will handle its proper share of the load, whereas a clean filter of a battery of filters will always deliver water at a rate or through a rate of water until the other filters have been cleaned.\n\nMany modern filter plants are providing International Type P Rate of Flow Controllers to assure the proper amount of water during backwashing.\n\nThese controllers may be provided with International Rate of Flow Gauges, either indicating or recording. Both the controllers and gauges are the subject of a separate bulletin.\nInternational Pressure Filters are providing clean clear water wherever water is being used. The larger units, completely equipped are providing many industrial facilities with water meeting all sanitary and exhaust requirements. Industrial plants, especially those in the paper and textile trades where their entire supply must assure them of a constant pure product. Public institutions, hospitals, etc., find that filtration of the general supply results in many savings and much satisfaction. Office buildings, hotels, and apartment buildings require the best quality of filtered water to meet the modern demands of their tenants. Every household should have clear sparkling water available at all times for all purposes. Crystal clear water which will not discolor or soil the clothes is an essential to the laundry. Refineries, breweries, and food product plants find that International Pressure Filters are not only a necessity but a profitable asset as well as a decided advertisement.\n\nInternational Pressure Filters are supplying the needs within swimming pools as well as for swimming pools of the finest type. Whether the pool is a simple plunge or an extensive outdoor installation there is an International Filter Plant designed to meet every requirement.\n\nThe continuous circulation and refiltration method is to be recommended. A circulating pump draws water from the deep end of the pool, passes it through the International Filter and then after heating and sterilizing returns it to the surface of the pool.\n\nAlthough dependent upon the use of the pool\u2014the rate of circulation (and size of filter) should be sufficient to turn the full volume of the pool once in two or three hours. With such circulation and refiltration and the usual sterilization methods in the cold end made to comply with the most stringent sanitary requirements and at the same time crystal clear for water sports, the International Filter gives fresh water needed to make up losses from splashing, cleaning the pool and washing the filter.\n\nSeveral bulletins are available covering the special application of International Pressure Filter for swimming pools, care and operation of pools, etc.\n\nFilter is designed primarily for putting the \"finish touch\" on the filtration when water is already comparatively clean. From the esthetic standpoint it has been found advantageous to refilter the finished drinking water and remove every trace of suspended matter.\n\nWhen the water is to be used for fine manufacturing purposes\u2014such as by photographic booths, laboratories, and certain food and ice plants, etc.\u2014even traces of foreign matter affect the finished product, lowering the quality and making the combination of International Pressure and Disk Filter an economic advantage.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In design and construction all the best known principles of filtration are included. The filters may be used singly, in pairs or in batteries of three or more. Separate bulletins describe different sizes and types.\n\nWater Softening\n\nInternational Softeners have never followed old methods; they have had to be different to make possible the uniform results that have made their success. International Softeners are made in sizes and types to handle several million gallons of water a day or a few hundred gallons an hour. They are made to soften water cold, or warm or hot. The same accuracy of operation is built into all sizes and types.\n\nWater Purification\n\nWhether your problem is one of filtration, softening, color removal, iron removal, coagulation, sterilization, etc., there is a type of International Equipment designed for your requirements. A laboratory and an engineering department are maintained to investigate your problems and work out the arrangement and design of apparatus that will eliminate your difficulties. You are invited to make use of this service.\n\nRemember that water is a raw material in practically every industry. Our aim is to assist you in whatever process is necessary to make the water a finished product.\n\nSteam Purification\n\nThe International Steam Purifier, employing new methods, removes all moisture and dirt from steam\u2014eliminates clogging of steam lines, governors, safety devices, etc.\u2014assures 100 per cent clean, dry steam.\n\nBulletin 31\u2014International Disk Filter.\nBulletin 132\u2014International Gravity Filter.

Grant Lewis under date of June 28th, was a recommendation that this water be softened. On investigation we find this water contains 45 grains of hardness per Imperial gal. and it would require a 36\" diameter Softener with an extra large softening bed to take care of the extremely high hardness.\n\nThis Softener would have a capacity per regeneration of 2100 Imperial gal. After softening this quantity of water, it would have to be regenerated requiring 80# of salt, this being based on 3/4# per 1000 grains, and 840 U.S. gals. of water for back wash.\n\nIf this softener were installed, we believe it would be advisable to enlarge your storage capacity of filtered water to take care of the requirements of back washing the softener and filter. It is possible to back wash this filter with raw water, but in view of the fact that this water is to be used for sanitary purposes, we do not recommend this.\n\nThe prices on the equipment are as follows:\n\n1 only 60\" Style \"E\" International Pressure Filter, 67# working pressure having a capacity of 2355 U.S. gal. per hour at a 2 gal. per sq. ft. per mi. rate .................. $574.00\n\nAlternative\n\n2 only 42\" (in battery) Style \"E\" International Pressure Filters built for 67# working pressure and having a capacity of 2310 U.S. gal. per hour at a 2 gal. per sq. ft. per mi. rate ........ $721.00\n\n1 only International U.F.R. 36\" diameter Crystalite Water Softener having a capacity of 2100 Imperial gals. of water per regeneration as per analysis submitted by your chemist and requiring 80# of salt per regeneration, price complete with brine tank .................. $1242.00\n\nThe above prices are f.o.b.

Deputy and Secretary\n\nGentlemen:\n\nYour file No. 121-1-5\n\nUnder date of May 10th you wrote us regarding the Gordon's Indian Residential School at Punnichy, Sask.\n\nAfter going into the matter very carefully with your Mr. Orr and also Mr. Ferrier, we wish to submit the following proposition.\n\nWe understand that your pump has now a capacity of 33 Imperial gal. per minute and in order to keep the filter rate per sq. ft. of filter area within the 2 gal. per sq. ft. per minute rate, it will require a 60\" diameter Filter having an area of 19.65 and requiring 235 gal. per mi. for 6 minutes for back washing, or a total of 1415 gals.\n\nThe Filter will have to be back washed possibly once a week depending entirely on the condition of the water you are going to filter.\n\nIf you find that you are going to have sufficient reserve capacity to take care of these requirements, it might be better to instal two 42\" Filters which would give you almost the same area, that is 19.24 sq. ft. and you would then be able to back wash one Filter at a time at the rate of 116 gal. per mi. This is a matter which your engineers will have to decide, basing their decision on floor space available and reserve capacity of wash water.\nAugust 19, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant regarding a filter for the Gordon's Indian Residential School at Punnichy, Sask., I would ask you to ship, addressed to the Indian Agent, Mr. S. Moore, Punnichy, Sask.,\n\n1 only 60\" Style \"E\" International Pressure Filter, 67# working pressure having a capacity of 2355 U.S. gal. per hour at a 2 gal. per sq. ft. per mi. rate ........$574.00.\n\nat the price quoted of $574.00. The accounts for same should also be sent to the Indian Agent at Punnichy in order that he may certify for them when they will be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Hayes, Esq.,\nThe General Supply Co. of Canada,\n356 Sparks Street,\nOttawa.\nAugust 19, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that an order has today been placed with the General Supply Company of Canada for:\n\n1 only 60\" Style \"E\" International Pressure Filter, 67# working pressure having a capacity of 2355 U.S. gal per hour at a 2 gal. per sq. ft. per mi. rate ........$574.00\n\nfor the Gordon's Indian Residential School and they have been instructed to ship same addressed to the Indian Agent at Punnichy. I would ask you to get into communication with the Agent and make arrangements to have the filter properly installed on its arrival. In the operating of this filter there will be required once a week approximately 6 minutes of back washing which will use in the neighbourhood of 1500 gals. of water. When the plumber is sent to make the installation, arrangements should also be made for discharging outside of the building this water used for back washing, same should not be emptied into the school drains as it would necessarily flood the septic tank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

I requested the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. to send one of their experts to look over and report upon the engine as it was bought from them, and I have just received this.\n\nInformation from the company indicates that the cylinder is very badly scored and that to renew this and provide a new piston, a new cylinder head, complete with valves, etc., and completely overhaul the engine, would cost approximately $500.00. While this seems to me a large amount, the engine should be overhauled before the cold weather sets in. It has only been in use for the past six years and the expert can offer no reason as to why it should now require so much repairing. I am assured, however, that for the expenditure named, it can be placed in first class condition.\n\nThe Principal requested that it should be replaced by a 15 H.P. engine, but I am of the opinion that the lesser expenditure involved in repairing the old one would be more economical and should prolong its life for another four or five years. I shall be glad if the Department will advise me whether the work may be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W.

Not having heard from him I again wrote him and have received a reply today, stating that the installation cannot take place, as there are certain parts which have not yet been received. The Filter Shell is one which is apparently being supplied by the Keewanee Boiler Works, and while it is not yet on the ground it is expected daily. No word, however, has been received of other material which is being supplied by the International Filter Company, and every day's delay brings nearer the possibility of the ground being frozen before the installation can be made.\n\nI should be glad if you would communicate with the shippers and ask for an explanation as to the cause of the delay, and request them to do all in their power to expedite delivery of the various parts that are needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Punnichy, and, therefore, the freight charges, amounting to approximately $180.00, which the Indian Agent paid, should be deducted from the account. It is re-inclosed herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Department number 121-1-5 dated the 19th of August last I beg to advise you that when the filter for the Gordon's Indian Residential School arrived it was found that there was no space in which to install it, and after discussing the matter with Mr. William Swan, Architect in Punnichy, it was decided that the best arrangement that could be arrived at would be to erect a lean-to to the school and transfer the engine there and utilize the space vacated by the latter for the installation of the filter. These arrangements are being carried out under the supervision of Mr. Swan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina,\nSask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Filtration Plant and Engine Room, Gordons School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith three copies of B. Dunster's account for the work on above at Gordons School. This work has run into more time than was at first anticipated, but with so much changing of machinery which had to be kept running, it could not be avoided. Before the filtration plant could be installed the engine had to be changed from its original foundation onto a new one built in the new engine room. Before this was done the generator had to be moved, as it was in the spot required for the engine. The generator could not be placed on its new foundation until such time as the engine was also moved as the light had to be kept on for the school. This was arranged by temporarily installing the generator and then when all was ready making the change in one day; running a temporary line to the switch board from the generator.\n\nAs soon as engine and generator were on their new foundations it was necessary to arrange for the running of the laundry machinery. This we had expected to do by a twisted belt from the drive wheel to a pulley on overhead shaft, but this after several trials was found to be impracticable and we had to rearrange the laundry machinery, which now runs much better with a direct driven shaft.\n\nWhen we had the laundry machinery running, the old engine bed, a large concrete block, had to be broken up with cold chisel and hammer so that the filter tank could be installed; this tank in the meantime was in the new engine room.\n\nWith the engine bed demolished and the concrete in shape to receive the tank it was moved onto its proper position and the fitting and installing commenced. This involved running the water main under the concrete floor to the filter tank and then to the pressure tanks; also the running of a waste from filter tank to sewer to septic tank. When the actual connecting up of the filter was done the two large pressure tanks had to be emptied and the work done so that the water supply to the school was not interfered with. This was managed by working during the night hours.\n\nAfter we had the filter functioning O.K., the switchboard and batteries had to be moved into the new engine room which naturally involved a lot of work on the wiring from generator to switchboard.\n\n1.\nWith the present layout the school has an engine room that is safe to move around in and a compact filtration plant right alongside the main water supply tanks, and the laundry machinery is running with less loss of power.\n\nThe Fairbanks-Morse expert was up a few days ago and the engine now appears to be in good condition. The alum sulphate for the coagulant tank of the filter was obtained through the local druggist.\n\nIf there are any further details of the work done, I shall be pleased to furnish you with same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing to tell you some of my troubles in the hope that you may see your way to help me and am writing the letter \"personal.\"\n\nLast year the Department were unable to sanction the building of a house for the Farm Instructor or to enlarge the barn. Might ask you to grant this favour this year.\n\nDuring the month of March last year Commissioner Graham engaged a Farm Instructor for me and promised him a house\u2014perhaps I should say the man told me he promised it\u2014which house of course was not built.\n\nThe man was married and came from Ontario.\n\nIn the month of June he asked me if his wife and baby might come on a visit. They came and stayed for some time but the arrangement was far from being satisfactory and I had to ask him to leave. Mr. Graham did not say anything to me but I don't think he was pleased at my action.\nThe reason for asking him to look for other work was because his wife made trouble among the members of the staff and a change became absolutely necessary. I never told him the reason as I would not talk too much about his wife but I think he quite understood the conditions.\n\nI have an opportunity of securing a good married man now but would not think of doing so unless you sanction the building of a house. It is very desirable that we should not be continually changing our staff and a married man is more likely to settle down than a single man. Also this is no place for a woman who has no work to do as she is liable to make trouble.\n\nBarn\n\nWe have not sufficient room for our stock or feed. Our present are very over-crowded and it is very difficult to do our work properly.\n\nThe other matter I wished to put before you is the question of land.\n\nAs you know we have a half section on part of which stands the old school. There are only 60 acres bordering\nThis half and although we are clearing the land around the present school hoping to ultimately join it up to the south land \u2014 it is a very slow process. Last year we pulled 850 stumps on eight acres and then ploughed it. There is some open land just north of school and I would be very grateful if you would allow us to work it as we really cannot grow sufficient food on the small holding we have. Mr. Moore, Indian Agent at Punnichy, knows all the circumstances and knows also that I am trying to do all in my power to make the best of what I have but I do require some cleared land.\n\nApologizing for bothering you with such a long letter about my troubles but with the earnest hope that you may be able to assist me.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.K.

Irwin\nPrincipal.\nJanuary 23, 1928.\n\nDear Canon Irwin:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the desirability of providing a farmer's residence and enlarging the barn at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that there are items for these purposes in our Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year. Some time in April, Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham will receive authority to proceed with the building activity.\n\nWith reference to securing a parcel of land to the north of the school, I have directed that enquiries be made and you will be advised later in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

In this connection it is noted that the quantity of pipe and fittings required for the purpose will cost approximately $50. The Department notes your opinion that the fitting up of this dryer and placing it in working condition should be attended to by the school at their own expense and you may so inform the school authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

These could be changed, but the fire escape platform would not allow them to open wide. Fire drill has not been practised often since the Rev. Canon Irwin took charge. I pointed out that more frequent practices should be carried out, and advised the Indian Agent to also have fire drill on his occasional visits.\n\nThe Rev. Canon Irwin informed me he had resigned and would be leaving in the near future. I believe the Rev. Principal had this work at heart, and he certainly gave his whole time and attention to it.\n\nA.P. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report of an inspection of the various schools in the Touchwood Agency which was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton.\n\nI see nothing in this report that requires much attention, excepting the Inspector's remarks regarding the residence of the teacher on the Day Star reserve. This house is in bad condition, but as the people who are occupying it are of little or no account and they are about to leave I thought we could let this matter stand until such time as we get people in there who are capable of looking after things and then we could put the house in shape.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a Farming Instructor at the Gordon Indian Residential School, I do not know whether the newly appointed Principal has any knowledge of farming or not. If he has not this school is going to be in a bad way. Canon Irwin had no practical knowledge of farming and surrounded himself with the poorest class of men possible, and if the new Principal is not an improvement I am afraid we cannot look forward to any great change for the better. As regards the dryer in the laundry, the mechanic should be able to fix this and should do it without assistance. As regards the matter of a chicken house, this can be attended to when we are fixing up the stable this summer. You will note that the doors\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\non the fire escapes open inward. Nearly all our plans that come from Ottawa show the doors opening inward; this should be changed. I would ask for authority to replace the fire hose at this school.\n\nYou will notice that the laundry at the Muscowequan School is in very poor shape. This school is, I understand, one that the Church expects the Department to make an addition to. In that case the question of the laundry and other repairs could be gone into.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nGORDON'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe classroom work here is carried on in the senior room by Miss Atwater. She has been here for a number of years and is doing good work.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Mr. Sinclair, and I believe his work is quite satisfactory.\n\nIn both classrooms the children appeared well along in their grades, and the work examined was good. The children were clean, and I found the classrooms well aired and tidy.\n\nMrs. Collins was in charge of the kitchen, where I found the work being carried out with good discipline. The food was well prepared, and I think, in all respects, Mrs. Collins gives good service.\n\nThe sewing teacher, Miss Wilkins, is quite capable, but unfortunately was leaving the following week. Both the boys' matron and laundry matron had recently left, but Rev. Canon Irwin informed me he had already engaged new officers.\n\nMr. Dunster\nMr. Dunster is now engineer. He is an experienced man, and I feel sure can carry out any repair work required.\n\nSince the Farming Instructor, Mr. Headrick, left no one has received the appointment. A first class man is badly needed in this position. Canon Irwin informed me he had a man in view, but was unable to hire him as he has no accommodation at present for a married man.\n\nI found the school in good repair and clean throughout. The filter is giving splendid satisfaction, although it does not soften the water.\n\nThe dryer in the laundry is of little use. I believe this could be made to do good work, but would require about $50.00 worth of pipe and material. The engineer informed me he could do the work if the material were supplied.\n\nThe chicken house has not been in use since its erection. Only one ply of boards were used in this building and these have divided apart so that it is unfit for winter use. This should be put in shape so that poultry may be kept.\n\nI found the other building in good repair, and the work horses in much better condition than ever before. The cattle appeared to be receiving good care.\n\nVery little sickness has occurred at this school during the winter, and the children looked exceptionally well.

I beg to request authority to have this defect attended to and assure you that the cost will be kept at the lowest possible figure.\n\nThe boilers in this institution should also be covered with asbestos and I shall be glad to receive authority to proceed with this work at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

All costs should be kept down to the lowest possible figure.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the boilers in this institution covered with asbestos, and this work also should be performed as inexpensively as possible, having in view the completion of a satisfactory job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn the Touchwood Agency Estimates for 1928-29 I inserted an item of $1000.00 to provide a soft water reservoir and $120.00 for fencing, both of which are urgently needed at Gordon's School. The soft water reservoir was authorized at one time but the amount allowed was entirely inadequate and nothing was done to provide for the storage of soft water. This really is an urgent necessity and I shall be very glad if some means can be found to provide it.\n\nI am exercising the strictest economy, saving wherever possible on such items as have been allowed but this is a case where an ordinary, everyday facility should have been provided long ago and I trust the Department will be able to provide for an expenditure of $120.00 for the above mentioned items.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, June 30, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A C.R. of the 22nd instant, relative to the providing of a soft water reservoir and fencing for the Gordon's Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn view of your report that the installing of this reservoir is an urgent necessity, I have to inform you that you may arrange to have this work carried out. It is noted that you estimate the cost to be approximately $1,000.\n\nFurther, you may incur an expenditure of $120 for fencing.\n\nIn connection with this expenditure, please be guided by the general instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's l-l-5 of the 28th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nRecently the Reverend Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School wrote stating that the fire hose and extinguishers at the school are in bad condition. I requested the Indian Agent to let me have a report and he states that the hose appear to be leaking badly although not cut or cracked, and suggests using a dressing. This, I understand, should not be used with linen hose and it is possible that the hose is dry and that running water through will swell the weave and prevent the leakage. I am directing the Indian Agent to have this done and report again.\n\nIn regard to the extinguishers, he states that they need acid and two of them require new hose. These are matters which the Principal should have attended to and I am directing the Agent to tell the Principal to buy acid and new hose. He states that they need \"two more small extinguishers of the long thin cylinder type at $3.00 each\" for the engine room, and three additional 2\u00bd gallon extinguishers for the upper storey. Will the Department please arrange to have these supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nsir:-\n\nThere is some interior painting required at the Gordon's Indian Residential School and the Principal recently wrote asking to be supplied with material. His list was a long one and I asked the Agent to let me have a report as to requirements, and he informs me that the Principal's list comprised enough material to redecorate the whole interior of the school and he does not think this is immediately necessary. I do not think so either, but I think some repairing should be done, and, if the Department will allow $150.00, I will so advise the Principal and have the money expended to the best advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 9th, 1925.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease ship, addressed to Rev. Canon J. K.

There have been different men in charge of this plant during the past four years; some experienced no trouble whilst others had nothing but trouble, all depending upon their experience and common sense. The Agent goes on to say that while he was at the school with a local electrician the school engineer started to disconnect the batteries from the generator while the latter was running full speed, but he was stopped in time. On the way back to Punnichy the electrician who was sent out to fix the plant stated that it would be all right with a new generator if it was left in capable hands and not monkeyed with.\n\nI am writing this letter to impress upon the Department the absolute importance of seeing that the school authorities employ competent help to run these expensive machines. I am satisfied in my own mind that thousands of dollars are wasted annually through mismanagement of these plants, and I have been harping on this subject for some time hoping that a change would be made. It is hard to stand by seeing this destruction going on without making some comment on it. The plants are up-to-date and in no time there are large bills for unwarranted expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection, it is noted that certain of the work was not finished, and an amount of approximately $1,000 will be available in the Estimates for 1929-30 for its completion. You may apply for this advance when considered timely by you next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nConfirming my telegrams to you regarding the Gordon's school fire, at the time of writing, 1 o'clock Saturday, the only information I have had over the phone is that they have not as yet discovered the cause of the fire. Mr. Moore is out there now holding an investigation and when I receive his report it will be forwarded to you at once. In the meantime, I can assure you that everything possible is being done to take care of the children. I expect there will be around thirty going to Elkhorn. There is building accommodation there for that number. It might be a good idea to take some to the File Hills School later on.\n\nThe loss is a great one; it was really a splendid building and we were just getting things lined up - a new Principal and a first class Farming Instructor who was going to make changes there. The stock and other buildings, of course, will be looked after by the members of the staff. At the time of writing, I cannot tell you just what the Church authorities intend to do. They will likely want to carry on some of the work at the old stone building.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe. Gordons School.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions of Wednesday last I have made an inspection of the remains of the school and beg to report as follows:\nThe footings are of course perfectly good, and the basement walls up as far as the concrete and tile construction goes are O.K. This means that from the top of the footings there is 5'6\" of concrete and tile wall that is fit to build on. That is 1'6\" above the ground.\nThe asphalt mastic flooring of the basement is burnt but this has protected the sub-floor of concrete which will require no repairing.\nThe walls of the boiler room and tank room are in good condition, although the chapel above was completely destroyed. The water tanks and filtration plant appear to be generally O.K. except for the gauges and small pipe connections. The two low-pressure steam heating boilers appear to be little the worse except for gauges etc.\nThe hot water tank is O.K.\nMany of the cast iron radiators, I think, could be salvaged, although they are all mixed in the debris in the basement.\nThe two metal fire escapes can be reused.\nA large number of bricks could be salvaged and used for backing up and interior partition walls.\nThe large chimney to boiler room is O.K., but although the kitchen chimney is standing I am of the opinion that it should be taken down; it would be dangerous to work around it. All the laundry machinery is a complete loss. The engine and generator are also a loss, but the switch-board and storage batteries were saved from the fire. If the intentions are to rebuild I would like to suggest that the building be of fire-proof constructions. This could be of the lighter type such as used in many of our city schools; brick and tile walls with Massillon bar joist construction for floors, and partition walls of gypsum tile. Stairways of concrete or steel. I am of the opinion that such a structure, built from the same plans, with minor changes in layout, could be put up for less than the original cost of the school.\nIt must be considered that all excavating, footings, concrete floors, and part basement walls are already in place. The water supply is piped to the building, the septic tank is connected to the basement, and all underground plumbing is in. The rainwater tank is also in position.\n\nIf such work is contemplated it might be a good idea to have the Indians undertake to clear the debris away before they commenced their spring work on the land.\n\nIf there is anything further that I can do for you in this matter I shall be only too pleased to have your instructions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) Wm. Swan.\n\nP.S. I may say that during my inspection I had the opportunity to talk with Mr. Williams, who I believe was boys' supervisor, and he tells me that he was with the engineer when they both went to the boys' lavatory to put out the fire. They went in from the playroom but the smoke was too thick for them to stay in so they went out and around to break in the windows, and then got down to work on the burning partition with portable extinguishers. But as the fire was in behind the asbestos wainscoting on this wall they were unable to put it out and in a few minutes the upper part of the partition near the ceiling was flaming. He is of the opinion that no blow-torch was used that day; and if it was I see no reason for using it near that partition. Also, seeing that there was no wiring in the partition, the theory of a short circuit is out.\n\nW.S.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. 12th February, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a report that I received from Mr. Wm. Swan, of Punnichy, who, as you know, had charge of the construction work at the Gordon School. He is most reliable and the report contains a lot of valuable information for the Department. I am not in favour, however, of having Indians remove this debris unless there is a competent foreman in charge and perhaps two or three white men. The Indians can do a certain amount of the work but to leave them alone at it would only be a waste of money. It seems to me this is work that should be done without any delay.\n\nI doubt if we are going to be able to carry on the classroom work there at the present time. The building is not at all suitable and there is no accommodation for the teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nA letter has been received from Commissioner Graham enclosing a report from Mr. Swan, who acted as Inspector of Construction during the erection of the Onion Lake School recently destroyed by fire, in which it is stated that the footings, foundations, and concrete floors of the old building are in good condition. Many of the hot water radiators can be salvaged although at the present time they are mixed in the debris in the basement of the building. A large quantity of brick can also be salvaged.\n\nMr. Graham has recommended that the building be cleaned up without delay, and it would appear that it would be advisable that this be done, and arrange for the proper protection of the foundation and any materials that can be saved and stored so as to be available if a new building is erected.\nFebruary 26, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your SL2-11A C.M. of the 18th instant. I note that Reverend Mr. Stanford is remaining at the Gordon School and that arrangements are being made to carry on with the farming there. I have also noted that the church authorities would like to conduct a day class in the frame annex to the old school.\n\nThe Department approves of this arrangement and you may erect a small building at an estimated cost of $550 as a temporary teacher's residence. This building can be used, later, as a warehouse in the event of reconstruction of the school. You may purchase the desks, blackboards, etc., on the list which accompanied your letter. The books, however, which form the second part of the list, will be ordered from the King's Printer. The Department will allow salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month in the case of the two Misses Atwater. The expenses of looking after the farm and stock should be met by the church authorities, and, if deficits occur, the Department will give consideration to reimbursement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

You may also arrange to supply a quantity of flour and beef from time to time to meet the requirements in making soup.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a cook stove of a type suitable for the purpose for which it is required.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th. instant, with reference to the salvaging of material from the Gordon School. You ask me to give you some idea as to what it would cost to clean up the place and provide storage for the materials worth keeping, and in reply I would say that it is difficult to answer this question. In the first place, all these boilers are down in the bottom of the basement floor and they could not be removed, excepting at considerable cost, and if we were going to protect them from the weather it would mean we would have to go to work and build a temporary shed which would cost a lot of money. Then again, there is a lot of material around that would have to be taken apart. Altogether I believe it would cost $2000.00, if not more, to look after this material for the period of a year, and I think it would pay the Department to seriously consider re-building the school at once. The money that would be spent on housing this material could be applied on a new building. Of course, if the school is not to be rebuilt steps should be taken to remove the boilers, etc., to another part of the country.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

On Feb. 1st I received a quotation from the Punnichy Hardware Store, but owing to the school being burned that day, this matter was lost sight of in the confusion that followed. In fact, I did not know whether the school work was to be continued or not. The Principal did not again mention this matter till about ten days ago. As he said the fence was badly needed I order the wire and staples and trust the account will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina,\nSask.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Proposed Gordon School.\n\nIn going over the blueprints of the old school with the Rev. Archdeacon Knowles I find that he has very little to suggest in the way of minor changes that could be done without changing the exterior walls. He does think that the clothes room off the sewing room could be thrown into the sewing, thus doing away with a dark room and leaving the clothes cupboards to open in the sewing room.\n\nI would recommend that the interior walls be brick or hollow tile, using much of the old brick, that is still good, on basement walls. I have sketched in red on the blue prints the position of the engine room which was built after the filtration plant was installed. It would of course be necessary to include for this in a new building.\n\nThe other small items marked are merely changes which were made during construction of the old building, and which should be followed again.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant No. 121-1-5, informing me that if funds are provided by Parliament it is the intention to proceed with the rebuilding of the Gordon's School, enclosing copies of the floor plans of the school as it appeared before the fire, and asking me to interview the Church authorities and return the blue prints with any changes that might be desired. In reply I may say that I had Archdeacon Knowles, who represents the Church in this matter, and who is the practical man on the committee, go over the plans with Mr. Swan. He has only suggested one slight change and that is that the clothes room be thrown open into the sewing room, and this to me seems a practical suggestion as it will give more light and there is no reason why it should be partitioned off.\n\nThere is a slight extension to be made to the engine room. We had this extension framed in before, but we might as well have the concrete basement walls extended to include it.\n\nAside from the above there are no changes that I can suggest, and these changes are noted on the blue prints which are returned herewith.\n\nThe front entrance steps as shown by the red marks were constructed on these lines in the original building.\n\nWith regard-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith regard to the construction of this building, it seems to me that the Department would do well to employ Mr. Wm. Swan to supervise the work, for, as you know, in reconstructing a building where there has been a fire, very close scrutiny of the work is necessary, and in Wm. Swan we have one of the most competent men in the province of Saskatchewan. He did good work when the original building was erected here and I would strongly advise the Department to employ him again.\n\nThe work of clearing up and removing the debris should be proceeded with without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing a requisition from the Principal of the Gordon's School for provisions to be used for the non-resident children of the Reserve who are attending the day school.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a sufficient quantity of the following provisions for the purpose of serving a midday meal for the balance of the present school year, to June 30th, next, viz., beef, sugar, salt, beans and peas. Only the quantities of these supplies to last until the date mentioned are to be purchased at the present time. The Department is not prepared to authorize the supplying of prunes, raisins and apricots, as these provisions are not furnished for midday lunches at day schools. You may also purchase and have delivered 12 cakes of laundry soap. If this school reopens after the summer holidays, the Principal should renew his request for the supplies required for the midday meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D.

I would hate to see the children who belong to this school and who are attending the Elkhorn school temporarily, put in a winter at Elkhorn, and if there is much further delay this will be the only place we can keep them.

This letter was written on Tuesday, the 21st., and together with the plans was sent out to Mr. Hay for mailing on that date, but for some reason he did not send it out and it remained in his desk for fully three weeks before he discovered it. When he did come across it again he mailed it without making any mention to me of the fact that it had been delayed, nor did he mention it to the Clerks in the office until some time after the 13th. of July on which date I sent you a telegram asking if the Department had come to any decision regarding the building.

The powers of the Minister of Labour hereunder shall not be exercised as to any employee or employees where it is established to his satisfaction that an agreement written exists and is in effect between the contractor and the class of employees to which such employee or employees belong or the authorized representatives of such class of employees fixing rates of wages, overtime conditions and hours of labour.\n\n(2) The Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Fair Wages Clause or Schedule inscribed in his contract for the protection of the workmen employed, also any decision of the Minister of Labour under the preceding paragraph.\n\n(3) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and time worked by such workmen, and the books or documents containing such records shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wage Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attesting by statutory declaration, showing (1) the rate of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrear; (3) that the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; and (4) that the notice from the Minister of Labour in regard of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon School.\n\nAs suggested by you on your visit to Punnichy this week, I herewith offer a few suggestions which would in my opinion save the Dept. of Indian Affairs money in the building of the new school.\n\nIn the first place the removal of the large amount of debris from the basement will take some time after the contract is let, and as the weather cannot be relied upon for more than another two months; it would appear that things could be speeded up by having the Indians and other local labour start to clear this at once. This work could be done either by the day under a good foreman, or by the load of material moved.\n\nThreshing on the reserves and in the surrounding country is now finished and labour is therefore available at very reasonable rates. In doing this all materials that are fit to use could be checked and stacked, and a price allowed by the contractors doing the work. This would also give the inspector of the work a better chance to say what could or could not be reused. There are about twenty thousand brick that could be cleaned and reused in the interior walls of the basement, at least 75% of the angle iron lintels could be used again, and the two fire escapes have only been damaged by falling bricks, and can be easily put in usable condition by a blacksmith. The two pressure tanks with their supports are in good condition and only need refitting with gauges etc.\n\nThe filtration plant only needs new fittings to put it in working order. There is a considerable quantity of 12\" and 6\" tile which could be cleaned up and used.\n\nThere is also a quantity of material that can be salvaged and sold, which would not be used in the new building; such as the two old boilers, the hot water tank and heater, the cast iron columns, and all the old radiation and pipes. Much of the latter would be merely sold as junk, but is an item that might be considered.\n\nThe white glazed brick in the kitchen came through the fire in very good condition, except for a slight gray tinge the glaze appears to be perfectly good, and as the largest portion of these are still standing in the walls they could be salvaged.\nwith very little breakage.\n\nIf this work of cleaning up were done by the Department it would certainly result in them having a large quantity of material to sell which many of the contractors are now figuring on using without allowing very much for same. You can readily see that unless some definite check is made of this old material much of it will find its way into the new building, and the Department will not have credit for it; and what is worse the use of it may be very detrimental to the new structure.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Swan, who supervised the building of the first school, happened to be on the ground looking over the site, and in a conversation with him, he thought it would have been a wise plan had the Department removed all this material and salvaged anything that might be used in the new building. I asked Mr. Swan to write me a letter giving his view on the matter, which he has done, and I herewith enclose same.\n\nI might say that the Department would be very well advised to employ Mr. Swan as Building Inspector on the new school. He is very competent, and as it requires more than an ordinary man to look after this job and check up the work, especially in view of the fact that some of the old material will be used in the reconstruction, I would advise that Mr. Swan be given the job. I have already recommended this man for the position, but have heard nothing from the Department on the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of Oct. 22nd last, appointing me temporarily as inspector of construction for the rebuilding of the above school, I arranged to visit the site with Messrs. Shoquist Bros., the contractors. This we did on Oct. 27th.\n\nThe contractors had had a small gang of men on for several days previous to this, clearing out debris and building bunk houses etc.\n\nIn discussing matters with the contractors I found that they had the impression that they would have all material salvaged; as I did not read the specifications that way I consulted with the Commissioner, Mr. Graham, on the matter, and he advised that a careful check be made of materials with a view to having the Department credited with any that was of value.\n\nI also found that the Contractors did not expect to carry on all winter, but in view of the fact that I had not seen their contracts, the matter was left for further discussion with Mr. Gurney Orr.\n\nI continued to make a daily inspection of the work as the cleaning up proceeded, and found that the concrete floors over all of basement had suffered nothing from the fire; the walls to grade were in good condition except for the inner four inches of tile which was removed and concrete poured to give an eighteen inch solid concrete wall.\n\nMr. Gurney Orr was in Punnichy on the fourth and fifth of Nov., and all points in question were gone over and settled. Since Mr. Orr's visit the cleaning up has been completed; the old boiler room and laundry walls wrecked and new footings and foundation walls poured for rear additions.\n\nThe Contractors have the cement, crushed stone, and lime on the job; the lime and cement being properly housed in tight sheds.\n\nMr. Hooff the estimator and representative of Shoquist Bros.\n\n1.\nwas down to the job today in response to a telephone call from me regarding shipment of tile. This I found was being delayed because the twelve by twelve were not available for two weeks. Arrangements were made with another firm to ship four by twelve and eight by twelve immediately.\n\nThe steel plans from the Dominion Bridge Co., were checked and we are assured of quick action in the shipping of all steel.\n\nI expect to see the bricklayers on the job by Thursday next, as the mill have promised delivery of the basement window frames by Wednesday.\n\nFootings for the new columns have been excavated for, and these will be poured as soon as reinforcing steel is delivered. The plumbers have arranged to have a man on the job right away to check over the existing underground pipes, so that all breaking and patching of existing concrete floor may be done at one time.\n\nI have written the H.A. Lister Co., of Winnipeg for a layout of the electrical plant so that if necessary we may arrange for a larger generator room, but up to date I have not received this.\n\nWith the definite understanding between Mr. Gurney Orr and the Contractors that the work was to proceed during the winter months I am striving to have them deliver materials so that a large gang of men may be kept busy until we have any extremely cold weather. At the present time we are having a mild spell and the early fall of snow has practically disappeared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction,\n\nP.S. It would expedite the work of the Contractors in rushing the work of other trades if they could have another three set of plans. Can these be sent to them?\n\nW.S.\nNov. 27, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Swan,-\n\nAs requested I am sending you three blue print copies of the plans and specifications of the Gordon's School, which I would ask you to kindly hand to the contractors.\n\nYou will remember I promised the Principal a set of plans, and I am enclosing these with the other three sets.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Gordon's Indian Residential School. Report No.2.\n\nSince my last report on Nov.16th work on the above has gone on at only a fair rate; although delivery of material has been good. Delay in the delivery of reinforcing steel for column footings, and of the basement window frames, has held things up. On Nov.26th we had a mild day during which the column footings were poured, and covered in to protect from frost. On the 27th the basement frames were being set and three bricklayers were at work; there are now eight bricklayers at work and they are doing a good job.\n\nDuring the last two days the weather has turned quite cold, and I am holding up the pouring of any concrete. Brickwork is going on; the men using hollow metal mortar boards with a low flat lamp inside, and as the mortar is put on the boards hot from being mixed with hot water and hot sand, the work is alright. I have received a letter from R.A. Lister Co., in which they stated that the generator room as shown was quite large enough. The new pump has been connected up with the existing supply line and there is now a good supply of water on the job. The south wing of the building is now up eighteen courses of brick above the concrete foundation wall, and there are several courses up on the remainder. With anything like reasonable weather during the next two weeks we should be ready for the ground floor steel joists.\n\nI have made an appointment with the stone-cutter to come up from Regina on Tuesday next and go over the whole of the cut stone required, so that there may be no delay or errors in the shipments of stone as required. On Nov.28th I issued the first certificate for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nWilliam Swan, M.A.C.\nArchitect\nPunnichy, Sask.\nNovember 30th.\n1929.\n\nJ.D.

Report No. 3.\n\nSince my report of Nov. 30th last the above work has shown only fair progress. The weather in the West has been very cold for this time of year, and during several parts of days the bricklayers have not worked. I really do not consider it wise to have bricks laid up under the present conditions, and am notifying the Contractors that no more brick will be laid, after the walls are up to joist level, until more favourable weather. I feel that with the low temperatures now prevailing, it would be necessary to enclose the work in a temporary shell of boards and paper to secure a first class job of brickwork for bearing walls. I am writing Mr. Gurney Orr in detail on this subject.\n\nAt the present time only four of the steel columns have been set; none of the cast iron columns or steel beams have been delivered yet. One car load of Massillion steel joists is on the job. Practically all the frames from the mill are on the job, and most of the stone sills have been delivered. All the face brick are on the job, and the hollow tile is being delivered quickly.\n\nBy Tuesday the 17th I expect the bricklayers to be up to joist level when they will leave the work until milder weather after January. In the meantime the steel will be erected and the steel joists put in place.\n\nA certificate was issued and mailed to you yesterday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, December 21st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nRe Building of Gordon's Indian Residential School near Punnichy, Sask., according to plans and specifications 613 - Shoquist Brothers.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant, I beg to acknowledge Assignment in connection with the above school near Punnichy signed by Fred and John Shoquist trading as Shoquist Brothers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

As condensation collects, this cools the expansion cartridge and the trap opens, whereupon water is immediately ejected to the discharge. Steam, following again, heats the cartridge and closes the trap. No live steam ever passes but the lines are kept free of water at all times.\n\nThe use of the thermostatic principle is of great merit. The difference in temperature of steam and of the cooled condensation gives ample power to operate the trap. The action is at all times unfailing as the operating oil never tires and there are no friction losses.\n\nNo air binding is possible as air opens the trap in the same way as the water does.\n\nA simple adjustment enables the user to discharge condensation at various desired temperatures.\n\nThe elimination of wasteful storage space in the trap, toggle joints, levers, buckets or floats, means less cost and less wear. Thus, the use of the Sarco ensures lower first cost and lower maintenance with maximum efficiency.\n\nFor variable steam pressure, use Sarco Steam Trap No. 9. (List No. 22.)\n\nFor heating systems, use Sarco Radiator Traps Type E. (List No. 8.)\n\nFor heavy service, use Sarco Blast Traps Nos. 9-3 and 9-4.

It is most efficient for living room, bedroom and bath room radiation in apartments and hotels. For residence heating, it fills all radiation requirements under usual conditions.\n\nSarco Radiator Traps are designed to give maximum lift and temperature drop. This high lift, two or three times greater than in traps of the flat disc type, permits discharge of small scale and sediment found in heating systems and prevents dirt clogging the radiators. There is no loss of vapor or heat units and while freely and promptly discharging the condensation and air, Sarco Traps close positively, preventing the leakage of steam.\n\nBody and cap are of cast bronze, nickel finished with polished trimmings; union nut and tail piece are of heavy brass. The motor or motor element of Type H is fastened rigidly to the cap. Type H Radiator Traps use Sarco large diameter, heavy wall helical bellows ensuring even distribution of the movement and avoiding the crystallization of metal that occurs with expansion elements of either disc or annular ring bellows types.\n\nThe large diameter tubing and the sensitively proportioned operating fluid contained in the motor element ensure a positive closing pressure. The conical valve head gives line contact only, thus eliminating wear on valve seat. The ample number of corrugations in Sarco Trap elements guarantee longer life than that of any other thermostatic valve.\n\nSteam from radiator heats the motor element and vaporizes the sensitive expansive liquid it contains. The pressure of the vaporized liquid expands the motor element and closes outlet of trap. As condensation collects, the vapor in thermostatic element cools and returns to a liquid state, whereupon the trap immediately opens. The cycle is repeated and all condensation is discharged promptly but no steam can get by.\n\nSarco Type H Radiator Trap has standard dimensions and is supplied in the \u00bd\" angle style only.

By the use of the well-known Sarco helical tubing, it avoids the necessity for packing of any kind. As a result, we can furnish an Inlet Valve which is opened or closed by a three-quarter turn of the handle, the pressure on which is at all times even, smooth and regular.\n\nThe ordinary valve is usually hard to turn and leaks after a few months of service. The semi-packless types, relying on springs for packing effect, bind and are therefore jerky in their action.\n\nThe Sarco helical tubing, which takes the place of packing is not annularly corrugated but made in the form of a helix or spiral. The construction is unique and ensures a perfectly even distribution of the movement without the least danger of stressing the metal beyond its fatigue point. This feature ensures long life and reliability.\n\nIt is the only type of Packless Valve that should be used on a system which will operate below atmospheric pressures, as the most difficult leaks to detect and overcome, also the most disastrous to the vacuum, are those occurring through faulty packing glands in inlet valves.\n\nThe Sarco Inlet Valve has a heavy brass body, well nickeled and with pleasing lines. Each valve is fitted with a Jenkins long life composition disc.\n\nNote that the handle is made so that the maximum of strength is obtained. This is achieved by making in one piece the handle proper and the stem connecting with the lift screw. This is a feature found only in Sarco Inlet Valves.\n\nThe dial is distinctly marked and will, after years of service, be as readable as when new. It is a handsome, well-built valve and a fit companion for the remarkably successful Sarco Thermostatic Radiator Trap. It can be used on all vacuum and vapor heating systems.\n\nValves equipped with lever or moulded handles as desired.\n\n| SIZE | Roughing in Dimensions | Capacities Feet Direct Radiation | List Prices F.

MONADNOCK BLOCK\nBUFFALO PHILADELPHIA CLEVELAND CHICAGO\nREPRESENTATIVES IN ALL PRINCIPAL CITIES FACTORY, BETHLEHEM, PA.\nSarco Steam Trap No. 9\n\nThe new Sarco Self-Adjusting Steam Trap No. 9 is a development of the universally known Sarco Steam Trap for high and low pressure but is factory adjusted and works on widely varying pressures as well as on steady pressure.\n\nIt is operated thermostatically and is therefore small in size and low in price.\n\nIt has unusually great capacity as it has a large valve area and a quick high lift when discharging.\n\nIt closes instantaneously and allows no live steam to pass. It cannot air bind.\n\nIt has no toggle joints, levers, buckets, floats, or trouble making parts and as it is all bronze, it cannot rust or stick.\n\nThe new Sarco Steam Trap No. 9 is designed on the \"balanced pressure\" principle. The pressure within the thermostatic, or motor, element balances against the steam pressure and thus the trap is self-adjusting over the entire range from 0 to 100 lbs.\n\nIt uses the unique Sarco helical bellows made from a seamless bronze tube. The helical form is greatly superior to the annular type of bellows as the movement is distributed over the entire number of corrugations with the result that the life of the bellows is greatly increased. The motor element never tires as it is never unduly stressed.\n\nFor a thousand applications in the industrial field the Sarco No. 9 has no rival in size, ease of installation, capacity, efficiency and price. It is the one leading trap for steam jacketed cooking vessels, live drips, high pressure heating coils, pressing machines, laundry equipment, kitchen and hospital fixtures. Also as an automatic high pressure air vent its field is a very large one. It will be supplied freely on 30 days trial for a practical test.\n\nFor heavy condensation Types 9-3 and 9-4, using multiple bellows, are particularly recommended.\n\nLIST PRICES\n\n| Capacity in lbs. of water per hour | For pressures from 0 to 10 lbs. brass composition valve head and seat | For pressures from 0 to 100 lbs.

As condensation collects, this cools the expansion cartridge and the trap opens, whereupon water is immediately ejected to the discharge. Steam, following again, heats the cartridge and closes the trap. No live steam ever passes but the lines are kept free of water at all times.\n\nThe use of the thermostatic principle is of great merit. The difference in temperature of steam and of the cooled condensation gives ample power to operate the trap. The action is at all times unfailing as the operating oil never tires and there are no friction losses.\n\nNo airbinding is possible as air opens the trap in the same way as the water does.\n\nA simple adjustment enables the user to discharge condensation at various desired temperatures.\n\nThe elimination of wasteful storage space in the trap, toggle joints, levers, buckets or floats, means less cost and less wear. Thus, the use of the Sarco ensures lower first cost and lower maintenance with maximum efficiency.\n\nFor variable steam pressure, use Sarco Steam Trap No. 9.

Ft.\n\nSARCO RADIATOR TRAP, Type H, which is a companion to the standard Sarco Type E Radiator Trap, is particularly designed for small heating units up to 125 to 150 square feet of radiation surface used in vapor or vacuum heating systems. It is most efficient for living room, bedroom and bath room radiation in apartments and hotels. For residence heating, it fills all radiation requirements under usual conditions.\n\nSarco Radiator Traps are designed to give maximum lift with minimum temperature drop. This high lift, two or three times greater than in traps of the flat disc type, permits discharge of condensation and air immediately in heating systems and prevents dirt clogging the radiators. There is no loss of vapor or of heat units and while freely and promptly discharging the condensation and air, Sarco Traps close positively, preventing the leakage of steam.\n\nBody and cap are of cast bronze, nickel finished with polished trimmings; union nut and tail piece are of hard brass. The expansion or motor element of Type H is fastened rigidly to the cap. Type H Radiator Traps use Sarco large diameter, heavy wall helical bellows preventing even distribution of the movement and avoiding the crystallization of metal that occurs with expansion elements of either disc or annular ring bellows types.\n\nThe large diameter tubing and the sensitively proportioned operating fluid contained in the motor element ensure a positive closing pressure. The conical valve head gives line contact only, thus eliminating wear on valve seat. The ample number of corrugations in Sarco Trap elements guarantee longer life than that of any other thermostatic valve.\n\nSteam from radiator heats the motor element and vaporizes the sensitive expansion fluid in it. The pressure of the vaporized liquid expands the motor element and closes outlet of trap. As condensation collects, the vapor in thermostatic element cools and returns to a liquid state, whereupon the trap immediately opens. The cycle is repeated and all condensation is discharged promptly but no steam can get by.\n\nSarco Type H Radiator Trap has standard dimensions and is supplied in the 1/4\" angle size only. For other sizes, see for offset and straightway types, use List No. 12, describing Sarco Type E Radiator Traps.\nSARCO PACKLESS INLET VALVES\n\nModulating Quick-acting Type for Heating Systems\n\nSARCO COMPANY, INC.\n183 MADISON AVENUE NEW YORK CITY\nEllisott Square Drexel Building Fidelity Mortgage Bldg.

By the use of the well-known Sarco helical tubing, it avoids the necessity for packing of any kind. As a result, we can furnish an Inlet Valve which is opened or closed by a three-quarter turn of the handle, the pressure on which is at all times even, smooth and regular.\n\nThe ordinary valve is usually hard to turn and leaks after a few months of service. The semi-packless types, relying on springs for packing effect, bind and are therefore jerky in their action.\n\nThe Sarco helical tubing, which takes the place of packing is not annularly corrugated but made in the form of a helix or spiral. The construction is unique and ensures a perfectly even distribution of the movement without the least danger of stressing the metal beyond its fatigue point. This feature ensures long life and reliability.\n\nIt is the only type of Packless Valve that should be used on a system which will operate below atmospheric pressures, as the most difficult leaks to detect and overcome, also the most disastrous to the vacuum, are those occurring through faulty packing glands in inlet valves.\n\nThe Sarco Inlet Valve has a heavy brass body, well nickeled and with pleasing lines. Each valve is fitted with a Jenkins long life composition disc.\n\nNote that the handle is made so that the maximum of strength is obtained. This is achieved by making in one piece the handle proper and the stem connecting with the lift screw. This is a feature found only in Sarco Inlet Valves.\n\nThe dial is distinctly marked and will, after years of service, be as readable as when new. It is a handsome, well-built valve and a fit companion for the remarkably successful Sarco Thermostatic Radiator Trap. It can be used on all vacuum and vapor heating systems.\n\nValves equipped with lever or moulded handles as desired.\n\n| SIZE | Roughing in Dimensions | Capacities Feet Direct Radiation | List Prices F.

MONADNOCK BLOCK\nBUFFALO PHILADELPHIA CLEVELAND CHICAGO\nREPRESENTATIVES IN ALL PRINCIPAL CITIES FACTORY, BETHLEHEM, PA.\nSarco Steam Trap No. 9\n\nThe new Sarco Self-Adjusting Steam Trap No. 9 is a development of the universally known Sarco Steam Trap for high and low pressure but is factory adjusted and works on widely varying pressures as well as on steady pressure.\n\nIt is operated thermostatically and is therefore small in size and low in price.\n\nIt has unusually great capacity as it has a large valve area and a quick high lift when discharging.\n\nIt closes instantaneously and allows no live steam to pass. It cannot air bind.\n\nIt has no toggle joints, levers, buckets, floats, or trouble making parts and as it is all bronze, it cannot rust or stick.\n\nThe new Sarco Steam Trap No. 9 is designed on the \"balanced pressure\" principle. The pressure within the thermostatic, or motor, element balances against the steam pressure and thus the trap is self-adjusting over the entire range from 0 to 100 lbs.\n\nIt uses the unique Sarco helical bellows made from a seamless bronze tube. The helical form is greatly superior to the annular type of bellows as the movement is distributed over the entire number of corrugations with the result that the life of the bellows is greatly increased. The motor element never tires as it is never unduly stressed.\n\nFor a thousand applications in the industrial field the Sarco No. 9 has no rival in size, ease of installation, capacity, efficiency and price. It is the one leading trap for steam jacketed cooking vessels, live drips, high pressure heating coils, pressing machines, laundry equipment, kitchen and hospital fixtures. Also as an automatic high pressure air vent its field is a very large one. It will be supplied freely on 30 days trial for a practical test.\n\nFor heavy condensation Types 9-3 and 9-4, using multiple bellows, are particularly recommended.\n\nLIST PRICES\n\n| Capacity in lbs. of water per hour | For pressures from 0 to 30 lbs. brass composition valve head and seat | For pressures from 0 to 100 lbs.

They are designed for capacity and have unusually large discharge openings. The rated capacities given below are less than the actual test figures and can be greatly increased if a water leg is connected before the trap.\n\nThese traps are of the multiple unit type. A number of Sarco motor elements are attached to a screwed disc in the bottom of the trap. When heated by steam they expand and lift a plate to which the valve head is attached. This closes the trap which remains closed until condensation is ready to be discharged. The lower temperature results in contraction of the motor elements and the trap opens. The Sarco No. 9-3 and 9-4 Steam Traps operate on a differential between the pressures inside and outside the Sarco helical bellows of which the motor element is composed. This reduces the work of the trap to a minimum and provides unusually sensitive and reliable functioning.\n\nLIST PRICES F. O. B.

This is accomplished by means of a thermostatic by-pass incorporated in the trap body, above the maximum water level within the trap. This trap, due to its special design is easily installed. The 1\u00bc\" or \"FT-1\" size has two inlet and two discharge connections and these can be bushed to the required pipe size. The 2\" or \"FT-2\" trap is similar in construction and design with the exception that there is one inlet and one outlet connection.\n\nCare in design and manufacture is evidenced throughout the Sarco \"FT\" Float Traps. The body is of cast iron having a carefully machined top and top plate of large size for ease in inspecting the interior. A copper asbestos gasket is used so that the top joint may easily be broken and made up again, using the same gasket. The thermostatic air relief element is identical with those used in the well known Sarco Radiator Trap.\n\nAll parts of the valve mechanism are of brass or bronze with the exception of the steel bolts holding it to the body. These are provided with brass nuts so that the entire valve unit can easily be removed. A copper asbestos gasket is used between the base of the valve body and the trap body. The float is of copper substantially constructed of the highest quality. The valve lever is of the rocking bar type, avoiding pivots and parts that stick and bind. In both sizes the underslung valve head is used as in the Sarco No. 9-3 heavy service traps. This design insures large capacity and reduces wear.\n\nAs noted in the table, the Sarco \"FT\" Float Trap capacities are exceptionally large and at a differential of 1 lb. per square inch, the capacity of the \"FT-1\" is 1,400 lbs. of water per hour; the \"FT-2\", 10,000 lbs. of water per hour. Sarco Float and Thermostatic Traps are compactly built and can be easily installed in any pipe line.\n\nApplications: We recommend the \"FT\" Float Trap for use in dripping ends of steam mains, vento heater stacks, large unit heaters, hot water tanks, drip lines and any point in a steam system where the condensate is unusually heavy or comes in sudden rushes. Service details of applications showing diagrammatically the recommendations as made by us are available upon request.\n\nCAPACITIES IN LBS.

It is this which forms the motive power of the Sarco Temperature Regulator, operating the unique Sarco helical bellows.\n\nThe expansion and contraction of a sensitive liquid permits the design of apparatus far more positive in action than thermostats relying on the use of a volatile fluid, which becomes a gas. With liquid expansion the power is always there. It is certain, positive and reliable. For a given increase in temperature, there will be a given increase in volume. More power is developed by liquid expansion and there is a gentle controlled and graduated action of the valve which insures considerable economy in the use of the heating or cooling medium and prevents fluctuations in the controlled temperature of the product.\n\nSelf-contained and Self-operated\n\nSarco Temperature Regulators, as compared with other thermostatic devices on the market, are self-contained and more compact, requiring no exterior operating means, such as compressed air, water or electricity. This form of construction, being virtually a power plant in itself, accounts for the success of the Sarco, as it reduces the first cost of the apparatus, lessens installation expenses to the lowest possible point, and eliminates maintenance expenses, there being no parts in the thermostat to get out of order. It also avoids the use, in the thermostat itself, of rubber or leather diaphragms, which are of a perishable nature and of metal disc diaphragms, which change their form with considerable resultant inaccuracy. No packing or stuffing boxes are used.\n\nPositive Acting\n\nThe Sarco Regulators are very substantially constructed and a slight increase in the temperature of the surrounding liquid or atmosphere expands the operating fluid, producing a powerful hydraulic pressure tending to close the valve, while a decrease in the temperature produces immediately a responsive contraction of the fluid and a gradual opening of the valve. Thus, the action of the regulators is positive and so reliable as to make them suitable for even the most delicate manufacturing processes as well as for ordinary room temperature regulation.\n\nSteam, Water and Gas Valves\n\nThe Sarco Regulators operate steam, water or gas valves, and have been widely adopted. They can be supplied with reverse valves to open with rise of temperature.\nHow Sarco Regulators Operate\n\nIn its essentials the SARCO Temperature Regulator consists of a tube \"A\" (the thermostatic element) containing a readily expansible, heavy hydro-carbon oil, which, on being heated, generates a pressure that is transmitted through a capillary \"D\" to a tube \"G\" (the control element), where it moves a packless piston to operate the valve \"K.\"\n\nThermostat \"A\" and control \"G,\" in communication through \"D,\" a fine bore heavy-wall copper tube, form a closed system, hermetically sealed.\n\nThe corrugated tombac tube \"B\" in thermostat, the length of which is controlled by the adjusting screw \"C,\" serves solely to vary the temperature at which the regulator valve functions, this being accomplished by changing its length in the thermostat. It will be observed that if its length is increased, the oil has less space for expansion and consequently the valve will be actuated at a lower temperature. If it is contracted by turning the regulator head, the valve operates at a higher temperature.\n\nControl \"G\" contains corrugated tubing \"F,\" which is exposed to the expansive force of liquid in \"A\" transmitted through \"D,\" and thus acts through piston \"H\" to move valve stem \"I\" and open or close valve as may be desired.\n\nThe spring \"J\" is opposed to the direction of expansion and tends to keep the valve \"K\" open.\n\nInstallation Sketches\n\nThis illustrates a dry room equipped with SARCO Regulator, Type KR-14, for any industrial process.\n\nTypical installation of hot water service tank using SARCO Regulator, Type TR-21, controlling a closed coil storage heater.\n\nTypical illustration of SARCO Regulator, Type TR-22, with bulb wholly immersed and used to control temperature of a steam jacketed copper kettle.\n\nTypical installation of brine circulating system using SARCO Regulator, Type TR-25, for temperatures as low as 10\u00b0F.

The function of a regulator is to maintain temperature mechanically and it does not necessarily correct the faulty design of the apparatus controlled. Under favorable conditions, however, SARCO Regulators maintain temperatures accurately within one-half a degree Fahrenheit.\n\nImportant Information to be Given with All Orders\n\nIn order that regulators shall be adapted precisely to the conditions under which they are to operate, it is essential that we be given full information as to the requirements.\n\nFor what purpose is the installation required?\nSize of pipe in which the control valve is inserted, also whether a steam, hot water, cold water or gas valve is required.\nShall valve open or shall it close when temperature rises?\nSteam, water or gas pressure in supply line?\nWhether thermostat is exposed to corrosive gas or liquid? If so state metals not attacked.\nTemperature to be maintained, also maximum and minimum temperature permissible.\nDistance between control valve and point at which thermostat is to be inserted or installed.\n\nIt is very desirable to protect the regulator valves by installing strainers. These are furnished in all sizes with screwed and flanged connections. (See special list.) They are inexpensive and an excellent insurance against valve trouble.

Advice on this when requested will be gladly furnished on receipt of drawing or blueprint of Supply Lines and Apparatus.)\n\nIf a metal cylinder completely filled with oil were hermetically sealed and then heated, the oil would expand with such great force as to split the cylinder. This same pressure is utilized in the SARCO temperature regulator. Referring to the illustration below, the oil cylinder communicates through a pipe with another cylinder in which there is a piston, the entire system being completely oil filled. The piston in the piston cylinder actuates a valve. If the oil cylinder is immersed in a tank containing the fluid, temperature of which is to be regulated and that tank is heated, say by a gas flame, the supply of gas to which is regulated by the supply valve, the mode of operation is obvious. When the temperature of the tank rises, heating the oil in the oil cylinder, the expanded oil pushing the piston outward in its cylinder and closing down the supply valve, thus reducing the gas flame. If on the other hand the tank temperature falls, the oil in the cylinder cools and contracts, thus allowing the piston in the piston cylinder to go back under the influence of a spring (not shown) opening the supply valve and thus turning the gas flame higher.\n\nWere the piston in the piston cylinder of the conventional type, trouble would ensue because obviously successful operation requires that the oil system be absolutely tight; the escape of even a minute quantity of oil altering the whole setting. In other words, it is imperative that the piston sealing be leakproof, capable of withstanding the enormous pressures which are involved, and at the same time frictionless. Here the SARCO spirally corrugated tube comes into play, a section of the same being hermetically attached to the outer surface of the piston at one end, and to the inner skirt of the oil cylinder at the other end, as shown in the illustration below. The SARCO spirally corrugated tube will withstand pressures in excess of three thousand pounds per square inch.\n\nWhile the regulating system as so far described is complete and would be commercially operative, it is naturally desirable to add some means of adjusting the temperature setting. This is accomplished by having the connection tube issue from the side of the oil cylinder instead of from the top, and then inserting from above a piston which can be adjusted up or down by a regulator rod. When adjusted downward the temperature in the tank and evidently rise less before pressure is transmitted through the connection tube to close the supply valve, and if adjusted upward the temperature must rise higher before closing will take place. The construction is shown in the illustration below. It will be seen that SARCO spirally corrugated tubing is again brought into service to provide a pressure-proof packless flexible fit.\n\nThis describes all of the elements of the SARCO regulator with the exception of a relief element which will yield if the pressure after the control valve has been closed should for some special reason continue to rise and exceed even the high limit of strength of the SARCO tubing. That element is a special heavy spring interposed between the manually adjustable head of the rod in the oil cylinder and the piston which the rod pushes. The spring strength is such that it will yield when pressure is too high, restoring itself to normal length when normal conditions are resumed.\n\nThe complete system is as below.\n\nThe Sarco Temperature Regulator operates gas, steam or water valves and can be used for tank or atmospheric control.\n\nFor detailed sectional drawing and description see overleaf.\nHow Sarco Regulators Operate\n\n(Drawing shows regulator of the tank type T. R. 21, but kiln type K. R. 14 is identical in general construction and operating details)\n\nIn its essentials the Sarco Temperature Regulator consists of a tube \"A\" (the thermostatic element) containing a readily expansible, heavy-hydro carbon oil, which, on being heated, generates a pressure that is transmitted through a capillary \"D\" to a tube \"G\" (the control element), where it moves a packless piston to operate the valve \"K.\"\n\nThermostat \"A\" and control \"G\", in communication through \"D\", a fine bore heavy-wall copper tube, form a closed system, hermetically sealed.\n\n\"E\" is the operating oil connected thru D with oil in \"A\".\n\nThe corrugated tombac tube \"B\" in thermostat, the length of which is controlled by the adjusting screw \"C\", serves solely to vary the temperature at which the regulator valve functions, this being accomplished by changing its length in the thermostat. It will be observed that if its length is increased, the oil has less space for expansion and consequently the valve will be actuated at a lower temperature. If it is contracted by turning the regulator head, the valve operates at a higher temperature.\n\nControl \"G\" contains corrugated tubing \"F\", which is exposed to the expansive force of liquid in \"A\" transmitted through \"D\", and thus acts through piston \"H\" to move valve stem \"I\" and open or close valve as may be desired.\n\nThe spring \"J\" is opposed to the direction of expansion and tends to keep the valve \"K\" open.\nDecember 9, 1929\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe have received an order through our Winnipeg Agent, Mr. W.

He wishes to point out that if it is the intention of the Department to put up any such building with the school, he would much appreciate having it done so that he could put up ice in it during February.\n\nHis second matter was the possibility of having folding doors between the senior and junior girls' play rooms, so that these rooms could be thrown into one on occasions when the parents of the pupils attend the school in a body.\n\nThe third request is that the two windows over the altar might be gothic headed as they are to be glazed with leaded lights; memorial windows to Rt. Rev. Canon Atwater.\n\nAfter a few days of comparatively good weather we are again in the grip of a below zero spell.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please advise what the amount of the deposit cheque will be and we will forward this to you at once.\n\nThanking you we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nShannon Bros.\n\nPer.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr;\n\nMr. Stanford, the Rev. Principal of Gordon's School has asked me to mention the matter of the set of blueprints you promised to let him have; he would like to have them so that he can use them in making out his list of furniture. He also would like to know if they can have two more laundry tubs, and if there could be a small vestry arranged at the entrance to the Chapel; on the flat roof south of the passage.\n\nYou will recall discussing the matter of the charge for use of car in driving to and from the job, so I am enclosing a bill made out for $1.00 per day.\n\nMy bill for daily inspections has been handed to Mr. Waddy as requested in the letter received at the time of my appointment.\n\nI have some photographs taken of the job but they are not yet back from the finishers, so will send them on at a later date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gordon's School.\n\nYou will see from my report of Saturday that we are doing nothing more on the above until the middle of February, unless I have definite instructions from you, as the weather is too severe to permit anything like a decent job being done with the ordinary protective methods of heating materials etc.\n\nI enclose some photographs showing the position of the job on the 1st. Since then all the ground floor steel has been put in place ready for the metal lath.\n\nWe had one of the basement columns break in unloading; snapped clean in two when dropped a couple of feet onto the snow. It was a very cold day, about twenty-eight below, and cast iron was more like glass. I phoned Shoquist and they wired for a recast, which arrived last Saturday.\n\nI am enclosing my bill for use of car during December. Should this be given to the Indian Agent for O.K. with my other?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to the request that two windows over the altar have gothic heads I rather think that they would look out of place in the interior of the chapel as planned.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon's School, Punnichy. Report No.5.\n\nSince my report of Dec. 26th last nothing has been done on this job, although delivery of material is still going on. The cut stone is all on the site and most of the window sash. Sand is being delivered steadily. The weather in the West continues very severe and no building operations involving brick and concrete work are going on.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a third certificate for Messrs. Shoquist Bros., amounting to $17649.00, also copy of their third progress estimate. You will notice that this is dated Jan. 4th; the reason for the delay being that I was not satisfied that the money they were receiving was being used to pay for material on the job. I have been in touch with the Dominion Bridge Co., the Regina Sash & Door Factory, and the North American Lumber & Supply Co., and found that no steel, no millwork, and no brick and tile had been paid for. Of course I had checked up on wages and local cartage previously. I wrote Messrs. Shoquist Bros. that I would not issue further certificates until these accounts had been met; and I am now assured by the N.A.L. Co. who are supplying all brick and tile, cement, lime etc., that their accounts have been met. None of these supply people appear to be worrying about their account, but as the specifications call for regular payments I am insisting upon them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nR. Gurney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Orr;\n\nRe: Gordon's School.\n\nI have prepared a sketch of a nice house such as the Rev. Principal wants, and herewith enclose you a blueprint of same; together with copy of my bill of material taken off to get a figure from the local lumber yard on materials. With the lumber bill at $490.95 I have figured that the hardware, paint, and labor would run the total cost to $700.00. Shoquists would not care to send a man down from Saskatoon right away to do a small job like this, but one of their carpenters is a local man and I could no doubt get him to do it. If you approve of this going ahead will you wire me so it can be completed for the school to put up ice by the middle of February?\n\nThe Principal has been discussing the matter of extra class room accommodation with me. What do you think of carrying the two class rooms the full length of the end projections; cutting out the bath room and putting them on the inside in place of the store rooms. As they would be right on the vent shaft I think it would not be so bad; many of the hotels have bath rooms with only artificial light now; in fact the new C.P.R hotel in Regina is one of such. The large bedroom space is not needed and I think some arrangement could be worked out satisfactorily to give the extra class room length.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gordon's Indian Residential School,\n\nI enclose herewith fourth certificate on the above job amounting to $13770.00.\n\nI have been over the work with one of the contractors during the past few days, and have gone fully into the matter of payments for materials as delivered etc., and as money is received from the Department. We appear to have things down to a better understanding now, and expect that the work will move along without any misunderstandings or friction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Honourable Minister of Labour with regard to the Gordon's School I have to say that when the contract was let last fall it was understood that the work was to be proceeded with throughout the winter when weather conditions were favourable, and work proceeded up to the latter part of December when weather became so cold that it was impossible to lay the brick and be sure of a satisfactory job. The brick walls in this building are supporting walls and great care has therefore to be taken in building in order to avoid unnecessary settlement.\n\nWhen I was in Punnichy last fall in discussing this building with Mr. Swan, Inspector of Construction I emphasized that it was the Department's wish that as much work as possible be done during the winter months, but that of course he would have to use his judgment when the weather became severe. From the last report received from Mr. Swan he advises that the work will proceed just as soon as the weather moderates sufficiently to be sure of a good job with the brick work.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, February 4, 1930.\n\nMy dear Colleague,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 29th with enclosure from Mr. Charles H.

On March the first the foreman and one or two men started cleaning up; removing a large amount of snow from the basement etc., and continued with some steel work. On the 11th six bricklayers were put on, and now there are nine at work. The weather still continues frosty at night, but I am having materials heated, and if very bad during the day stop the brickwork. Material has been delivered all winter and with really good weather a large gang will be on the job and things rushed as much as possible consistent with good workmanship.\n\nI am enclosing herewith the accounts for materials used on the ice-house completed last month, and in accordance with your instructions have arranged with both the North American Lumber Co., and the Punnichy Hardware to leave these for payment until after March 31st. This means that in the case of the lumber bill the 10% cash discount may still be deducted.

On the Boys' side we could run the class room the full length and cut out one bedroom, and place the bath room in the corner nearest the Principal's Living Rm. On the Girls' side the two bedrooms are needed and it would be a case of having an inside bath room.\n\nAs things are now going along fast it will be necessary to know if this can be done.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe. Gordon's School, Punnichy.\n\nDuring the past two weeks work has gone on steadily except for a few hours on certain days when it was considered too cold to lay brick in the mornings until the weather had warmed up. The weather generally has been good during the day, but the nights are still cold. I am still having the sand and water heated before mortar is mixed, and slaked lime is being kept in a closed and heated shed.\n\nThe walls of the main portion of the building are up to the top of the ground floor level, and we have two floors of the steel joists on. No concrete floors are being run yet, and I intend to hold this off until the weather is safer. There is still snow on the ground and it is not practicable to do anything on the rough plumbing yet.\n\nThe changes to enlarge the classrooms, sanctioned in your telegram of last week, will be carried out, and I have given the contractors a sketch of the changed layout. Enclosed you will find two photographs showing condition of the building at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nApril 10, 1930\n\nMr. W. Graham,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nCity.\n\nRe - Gordon Indian School - Punnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs per conversation with you this afternoon with reference to the special burning equipment for Sask. Lignite coal, might say, that we have installed same in the following buildings during the past season:\n\nPat Burns & Company, Adanac Brewery, Bartleman Apts., Balfour Apts., Victoria Park Building, Broder Building, Champlain Hotel, Duncan Motors, Westman Chambers, Wood Vallance, Ltd., Queen City Cleaners, Davin School, Normal School, Haultain School, St. Augustine Separate School, Kitchener School, School Board Office, Bruce Apartments and several others.\n\nThe results obtained, in all cases, have been highly satisfactory, in no case have our savings shown under 20%, several of them between 25 and 30%, while at least four show as high as 40% reduction in fuel costs with less labour and higher efficiency.\n\nWe supply special non-sifting grates of the shaker type yet flexible, and allowing 40% air circulation, also forced draft equipment supplied by motor with fan attached and entered through the side of the ashpit wall under the grates and equipped with mercury steam pressure controls, so that the Engineer can regulate same as desired, for instance, if he desires three pound steam pressure he can set his control to cut off and set same to cut in again at any point under three pounds, making a narrow or wide range as desired.\n\nLignite coal burns with the long flame so that if the boilers have not been installed we would appreciate if possible a higher setting which can easily be arranged with the manufacturer. In the Davin Public School, Regina, we have a special setting with the boiler five feet off the grates and this sixteen room school was heated during our coldest January, 1930, at an average of $6.21 per day (and the system includes air-washers and vacuum ventilators) being a record for Western Canada in fuel costs and efficiency.\n\nThe Separate School Board advises me that our equipment in St. Augustine School has resulted in a saving of 40% reduction in costs with less labour.\nIf the higher set boiler can be arranged we would recommend at least thirty-six inches from grates to boiler, will assure us of good combustion, as the old theory of setting the boiler close to the grates has been exploded.\n\nFurthermore, when a plant is equipped for burning Lignite coal it will burn any grade of coal with much higher efficiency, while on the other hand a plant set up in the regular way will not burn Sask. Lignite satisfactorily.\n\nThe Hulson grate is an American grate built in Keokuk, Iowa, and sells at approximately $21.50 per square foot.\n\nThe Pyramid Grate is built by the Riley Engineering Company of Toronto and sells at approximately $17.50 per square foot. The blower and controls sell according to the square foot of grate area.\n\nIt is usually arranged with manufacturer when installing our equipment to have the boilers shipped less the grates, thereby saving cost of the regular grate.\n\nIf there is any further information which you require will be pleased to give same at your convenience.\n\nThanking you, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLIGNITE EQUIPMENT LIMITED\n\n(Sgd.) J.A. Erskine\nManager.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., April 15th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter that I received from the Manager of the Lignite Equipment, Limited, of this City.\n\nI may say that Mr. Erskine called on me with a view of discussing the matter of using Saskatchewan coal in our institutions. I made it clear to him, however, that this was a matter to be dealt with by the Department, and told him that if he would write me a letter on the subject I would bring it to your attention.\n\nThis Province is about to take over its Natural Resources, and a big campaign is on to make use of these resources, so I thought it just as well that I bring this matter to your attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPunnichy, Sask.\nApril 12th 1930.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe: Gordon's School Punnichy.\n\nReport No.7.\n\nSince March 31st, we have had very good weather and good progress has been made with the brickwork. In another week's time most of the sixteen bricklayers will be away. The only concrete that has been run up to the present is the roof over the laundry and generator room, but we now intend to work on this with a large gang, and with the nights getting free of frost there is now no danger of having concrete frozen. I enclose four photographs showing the state of the building on April 9th.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. Stanford, has asked me to say that he wants to build a trench silo for use at the school, and would like to have the concrete walls put in by the contractors; can he have your authority to do this as an extra?\n\nHe also stated, when I discussed the placing of the laundry machinery with him, that they needed a rinsing tank between the washer and the extractor. He states that a galvanised iron one costing about fifteen dollars would do, and is asking that this be included.\n\nI might mention that I have taken up the matter of running the laundry machinery with the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. and R.A. Lister Co. and have decided to run the machinery from a line shaft driven by an electric motor from the electric plant. The total power required if all machines are running is 2\u00bd H.P., and the Lister people state that their plant will take care of a 5 H.P.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon's School Punnichy, Sask. Report No.8.\n\nDuring the last two weeks good building weather has continued and good progress has been made. All concrete roof slabs have been run and also part of the second floor. The plumbers and steam fitters are now at work, and the electrician has been on the job for a week. Basement partitions have been built up, and the bricklayers have been at work on the glazed brick lining of the Kitchen and Pantry for two days. Of the outside brickwork only the two chimneys remain to be completed (see enclosed photos).\n\nThe Rev. Principal states that it will be necessary to have double doors between the boys entrance and the dining room so that children using the recreation rooms will not be able to run into the dining room. I have arranged to have this done and in view of the saving in doors on our new ground floor layout there will be no extra on this.\n\nI enclose herewith five photographs showing building on April 24th, two days ago. Of course no cleaning down has yet been done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMay 2, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 12th ultimo with reference to the Gordon's School at Punnichy, I beg to say that there are no funds available to build a trench silo and I would ask you to please advise the Reverend Principal.\n\nWith reference to the rinsing tank it is not customary to install these tanks. In fact I do not know of any school that is equipped with such a tank.\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 15th of March, in which you enclosed accounts for materials for the ice house. I am returning the accounts herewith and would ask you to please certify as to their correctness and return them to the Department when payment will be made.\n\nI have received your letter of the 26th ultimo and note that good progress is being made. Many thanks for the photographs enclosed with your letter and which have been received from time to time. These are very interesting and show clearly the progress of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nInspector of Construction,\nGordon's School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean Esq.,\nassistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordons School, Punnichy, Sask. Report No.9.\n\nSince April 26th there has been a good showing made on the interior work at the school. Most of the partitions are now up and practically all the strapping of exterior walls is in place. The back plastering is on in most of the rooms, and the plasterers are at work on walls and ceilings in the basement of the north wing. The plumbing is all roughed in and I will have a water test on the stacks on Monday. The steam lines have all been run and ceilings are being lathed.\n\nAll concrete is finished with the exception of the roof slab over the chapel and the basement floors.\n\nWe are now excavating for the tile drain from Laundry and rainwater tank overflow which will connect up beyond the septic tank.\n\nToday the roofers started on the tar and gravel roof, and with a week of good weather the building will have a tight roof on.\n\nWe have found good clean sand on the reserve which is first rate for plastering, and the contractors have arranged with the Indians to supply all of this.\n\nIn going over the matter of cupboards the Principal has pointed out that none have been arranged for in the upper dormitories, and he thinks that these are very necessary. Will you please let me have your opinion on these at an early date?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 100 sq ft Planer Flooring                       |          |            |             |\n| 30' x 12' Sp.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nRe. Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn going over the specifications with the painter he claims that he did not figure on any painting for the concrete floors. I feel sure that it is your intention to have these painted, say a battleship grey, is it not?\n\nHe also advises that one coat of varnish on the linoleum is required to preserve the original colour and the surface. Are you of the opinion that this should be done?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear sir;\n\nRe: Gordon's School, Punnichy, Sask. Report No.10.\n\nSince my last report most of the first and second costs of plaster have been put on although none has been done in the Chapel. The fire escapes and steel stairs are being erected and these should be in within a few days. Owing to several spells of rain and windy weather the roofer has not yet finished the tar and gravel roofs. Those of the north and south wings and the centre wing are finished, and a day or so with good weather will see these of the Chapel and Laundry finished.\n\nThe painters have started on the frames. In placing the grounds for blackboards in the class rooms it has come to our attention that the blackboard area is not quite up to the amount required by the Dept. of Education of the province of Saskatchewan. Could we arrange for about sixteen of the walls opposite the windows to have boards? I am arranging with the contractor to have an iron band and brace rod from the kitchen chimney to the chapel roof; this was put on the old chimney if you remember after we found that there was quite a sway to the chimney in a wind.\n\nI have had the plasterers run a large quantity of lime for the putty coat so that there will be no danger of it going into the walls too new. As the building is shaping up now I think it should be substantially finished by the first of July.\n\nI have not yet had your authority to place cupboards in the upper dormitories.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa, June 2, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the progress of the work on the new Gordon's School at Punnichy.\n\nYou may arrange to have the additional blackboards installed as requested.\n\nWith reference to the painting of the concrete floors this is not provided for in the specifications, but I would ask you to kindly obtain from the contractor and submit a price for the painting of these floors with a suitable paint of battleship grey. It will not be necessary to varnish the linoleum. Also kindly obtain and submit a price for the installation of the additional cupboards asked for in the upper dormitories.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing, Asst.

Lignite coal.\n\nOur total fuel cost from Sept. 7th, 1928 to April 30th, 1929 was $5297.20, while the total cost for the same period in the following year amounted to $3718.00 thereby effecting a saving of a total of $1579.20, or a daily saving of $.72, which in reality amounts to 30%. In other words, in addition to paying for our equipment installed by your Firm, the amount of which was $990.00 we saved $589.20, or a total of 6.4%.\n\nThese figures are very gratifying to the Writer as they prove conclusively that we can not only burn Sask. lignite coal economically, but at the same time maintain the highest degree of efficiency, in the operation of our heating plant.\n\nThese figures should not only be of interest to your Firm, but to all residents of our Province who are purchasing other than lignite coal mined in Saskatchewan.\n\nWe might add that the two heating boilers are #312 Keewanee type and the high pressure boiler is a #409 Pascol build.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHOTEL CHAMPLAIN,\n\n(Signed) W.W. Champ.\n\nWWC\nMIC\n\nCopy.\nRegina, Sask.\nMay 6th, 1930\n\nMr. J.A. Erskine,\nLignite Equipment Limited,\n1711 Scarth St.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Erskine:\n\nIt affords me great pleasure in testifying regarding the efficiency of your Equipment for burning Lignite Coal. I have just made a check up on our cost figures and the following results testify better than I can as to really how efficient your system is.\n\nThe School Board is convinced of the wisdom in using the Forced Draft System in burning lignite together with your Coal Gas Burner. The System was first installed in the Haultain School and there we have had it in use long enough to make a comparison. From July 1927 to June 30th, 1928, Haultain School cost us $1706.60, whereas, the next year, after we had installed the Lignite Equipment, the cost was reduced to $1027.81. Our new Davis School, which went into operation last September cost us from September 1st, 1929 to April 1st, 1930, only $768.37, whereas, the Strathcona School, which is a slightly smaller school, but which, is operating without the Equipment, cost us $1056.46 for the same period, and the Thomson School, which has an Oil Burning Equipment, ran up to approximately $2125.13.\n\nLast year we converted the Kitchener School, consisting of twenty rooms, to the System and also installed in our new Administrative Building.\n\nThis year we are building a large 20 roomed School on the North Side and a large addition to the Lakeview School. We are putting in new equipment in the Lakeview School for the entire building. Both these large buildings will have installed your Lignite Burning Equipment including the Forced Draft, Special Grates and Coal Gas Burners. We are also changing over the Albert Street School from Oil to Lignite Equipment this year. That will give us a total of six Schools and our office building equipped in the same manner.\n\nWe are delighted with the results, as shown above, and feel that it is only fair to the Ratepayers of the City of Regina that the School Board should take every advantage to save money for them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) E.O. Walker.\n\nEWO/LM.\n\nCopy\nMay 20, 1930.\n\nMr. F. Stanford, Principal,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nGordon Indian School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegret very much that it has been impossible for the writer to call on you before now with reference to your school, but might say that we have received boiler specifications from the Heating Firm and the cost of our equipment installed in Inglis Supreme boiler No. 16 will be:\n\n- Non-sifting grates $259.00\n- Blower and steam pressure control 335.00\n- Installation 35.00\n\nTotal $629.00\n\nSupervision would be $15.00 per day and expenses.\n\nIt will, of course, be necessary to have electric wiring and 24 hour service, which of course you no doubt have.\n\nThere is no doubt in the world but what we could make you a very substantial saving and we are enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from the Champlain Hotel as to results obtained by them during the past season.\n\nMr. Graham, Indian Agent, advises us that if the Principal approves of the system the Government will not hesitate to have same installed, and we are quite satisfied that you would get your money back in a short time.\n\nWe trust you will give the matter your early consideration and let us have your recommendations.\n\nThanking you, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLIGNITE EQUIPMENT LIMITED,\n\nManager.\n\nJAE/ME.\nMay 27, 1930.\n\nIndian Residential School,\nRev.

We supply new grates, Forced Draft Equipment and Steam Pressure Control, and we are enclosing herewith copy of letters from the Champlain Hotel and Public School boards, which speak for themselves.\n\nThe boilers installed in Punnichy and Brandon schools are very adaptable to the burning of Lignite coal, and while the investments in these cases are not very much, we have no hesitation in guaranteeing return of same in savings within a period of three years.\n\nWe will also enclose letters to the Principals of the two schools, where we gave them quotations of the expenditures required.\n\nWe trust this matter will have your favorable consideration, and will await your early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJAE/MR.\n\nLIGNITE EQUIPMENT COMPANY\n\nManager.\n\nencl.\nWilliam Swan,\nM.R.A.I.C.\nARCHITECT\n\nPUNNICHY, SASKATCHEWAN\nJune 1st, 1930.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nin account with\nWm.

Once or twice I have delayed their certificates on account of complaints from some of their supply people. Alex Young Ltd.of Regina who supplied the cut stone were not at all satisfied with the payments they were getting, and threatened to put a lien on the building. Of course I immediately got in touch with Shoquists and asked for instant settlement, and then wrote the other firms supplying material; stating the amounts I had certified to as far as they were concerned and asking if they were satisfied with their payments. This brought forth an indignant letter from Shoquists as they stated that the Department had held them up, but after I had pointed out otherwise they were more or less apologetic, and promised that things would be looked after better. Yesterday I get a wire from the North American Lumber & Supply Co.of Winnipeg, stating that they can get no satisfaction by mail or wire from Shoquists, and for me to protect their interest to the extent of $6000.00. Before I issue another certificate I shall ask the contractors to supply me with a letter from the various subcontractors and supply houses stating that each is satisfied with their payments to date.\n\nI intend to keep this matter checked up, but thought you might like to know this more or less confidentially, as I personally feel that they are a little out of their depth in running a job of this size. Should they be low on the Muskowequan I believe that the Department would do well to make a careful check-up before awarding the contract. As far as Gordons is concerned they have a pretty fair foreman on the job and I am keeping them checked up.\n\nThis is written to you personally unless you wish to impart the information to the Deputy Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These however are promised for Tuesday morning next and from then on all should be moving smoothly. The plasterers have the finish coat on all walls except the Chapel walls; and are now at work on the cement base. All of the cement floors except part of the basement have been run and the terrazzo floors are being put down in the lavatories.\n\nThere are still men at work on cleaning down the brickwork; this being rather a long job as I am insisting on it all being scrubbed.\n\nI have had to reject the hinges for all doors as they shipped plain hinges instead of ball bearing as specified; the only excuse being that Ashdown's stated that they had supplied hardware for several Indian schools and knew just what was wanted.\n\nThe lighting plant is now on the job and Lister's men are putting it in place.\n\nThe electrician is on the job pulling the wires; and the fixtures have all been selected by the Rev. Principal and myself.\n\nYesterday I received a price of 42\u00a2 per sq. yard for painting two coats on the concrete floors; and a price of $632.50 for four sections of dormitory cupboards 11' 6\" long. This latter I consider most exorbitant and shall get another figure.\n\n1.\nIn view of the fact that there were several complaints from supply firms as to payments from Shoquist Bros., with the excuse that payments to them were delayed by the Department I wired you for information on this point.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon's School, Punnichy, Sask. Report No. 13.\n\nSince June 21st only fair progress has been made; there being delay in shipping the doors from the mill, and delay on getting the machine for rubbing down the terrazzo floors. At present things are going along very well; most of the windows have been hung, also many of the doors, the plasterers are through except for the laundry ceiling, which we are holding up on account of machinery shifting brackets etc., and the usual patching up after other trades.\n\nThe laundry machinery is all in place but not connected up. The electrical plant has been installed and light on in some of the rooms. Yesterday the heating system was steamed up, and for the next three days it will be checked over with steam on. The pump and motor for the water system is not yet on the job; at present we are using a small one for supplying water on the job. The pressure tanks and the filtration plant are all ready to connect up. Many of the plumbing fixtures are now installed, and the plumbers are working right along. May I suggest that the Department insist upon a thoroughly competent engineer being placed in charge of all the machinery as soon as the building is ready to be handed over. My personal experience with Gordon's school in the past has been that the Church hire cheap men who know very little about such plants, with the consequent trouble and expense on the machinery. With the splendid layout that they have to start with it seems a pity that any Tom, Dick, or Harry should be allowed to gain experience by experimenting with it.\n\nThe exterior brickwork of building has now been cleaned down and cleaning up of materials around building is in progress. The contractors delivered \"Sterling\" slate for the blackboards but I have refused to allow this to go in. I have not yet received your acceptance of the price on the painting of concrete floors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nRA57 72 COLLECT NL STANDARD TIME\nREGINA SASK 14\nSECRETARY DEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS 826\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nWESTERN MANUFACTURING CO HERE HAVE CALLED ME UP TO FIND OUT IF\nSTANFORD HAS AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE FOR FURNISHINGS IN THE WAY OF\nTABLES BENCHES ETC FOR THE NEW SCHOOL ADVISED THEM I WOULD WIRE\nYOU AS I CANNOT BELIEVE DEPARTMENT WOULD PLACE MATTERS OF THIS KIND\nIN HANDS OF A MAN WHOM WE ARE HOPING TO DISMISS ON ACCOUNT\nINCOMPETENCY KINDLY WIRE AS I PROMISED THEM A REPLY TUESDAY\n\nMORNING\n\nW M GRAHAM.\n\nThis is a Collect message, and\nwill be charged to your account\nunless we are notified otherwise to\nthe contrary.\nREGINA SASK 14\nSECRETARY DEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS 826\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nWESTERN MANUFACTURING CO HERE HAVE CALLED ME UP TO FIND OUT IF STANFORD HAS AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE FOR FURNISHINGS IN THE WAY OF TABLES BENCHES ETC FOR THE NEW SCHOOL ADVISED THEM I WOULD WIRE YOU AS I CANNOT BELIEVE DEPARTMENT WOULD PLACE MATTERS OF THIS KIND IN HANDS OF A MAN WHOM WE ARE HOPING TO DISMISS ON ACCOUNT INCOMPETENCY KINDLY WIRE AS I PROMISED THEM A REPLY TUESDAY MORNING\n\nW M GRAHAM.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At present we have a temporary engine on the pump, but it is the intention to use an electric motor.\n\nThe ash hoist has not yet arrived on the job, but is on the way.

We shall need room for at least 3000 bushels this year as we have seeded 60 bushel acres to oats, 20 to barley. At present we have no granaries and have to store our feed in an old shed left behind by the workmen when the school was first built.\nThe above buildings should be either of metal or metal lined as this country is infested by rats which gnaw their way into any ordinary lumber building.\n\n1 Six ft fence to enclose the Girl's playground.\n\n1 Trench silo, to hold 200 tons of ensilage for the cattle feed in the winter.\n\n300 loads of Gravel to grade us around the new school when finished, to prevent mud from being brought into the school during wet weather.\n\nSome screen windows to cover the whole window for the school. The present specifications call for half screens on all windows except the casements. This must have been an oversight as with both top and bottom sashes opening or opening, it will be impossible to ventilate properly i.e. from the top, or if the windows are opened at the top, to keep flies etc. out.

Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School, and reply to say that it has always been my idea that we should have a suitable granary at this institution for the storing of seed and feed. We should also have a fence around the playground, but I would not, under any circumstances, allow Mr. Stanford to have anything to do with this. He is not qualified, and is absolutely incompetent. He has had no experience in schools, and his advice on matters of this kind should not be accepted.\n\nI notice also that he proposes having gravel put on top of the clay around the school. This would be a nice mess, and would tear the floors and linoleum all up in a short time. This is a matter that can be left until we have a Principal at this school who understands something about business.\n\n-I note-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI note that Mr. Stanford has submitted a list of furnishings for this school. I am surprised to know that his recommendation has been acted upon, while at the same time the Department advises me to take up with the church authorities the matter of dispensing with his services. I should think he would be somewhat confused when the time comes for him to be advised that his services are no longer required.\n\nShould not matters of this kind come through this office, to be passed on to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Commissioner.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6310)\n\nFile 654-5, part 3\nTouchwood Agency - Gordon Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1922 - 1927\n\nFile 654-5, part 4\nTouchwood Agency - Gordon Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts (plan). 1927 - 1930\n\nFile 654-5, part 5\nTouchwood Agency - Gordon Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts (plan). 1947 - 1949\n\nFile 654-5, part 6\nTouchwood Agency - Gordon Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1949 - 1950\n| Reference | From | To |\n|-----------|------|----|\n| E-1234    | 26240 | 7/6 |\n| E-1235    | 24658 | 11/6 |\n| E-1236    | 27222 | 25/6 |\n| E-1237    | 28513 | 29/6/49 |\n| E-1238    | 233   | 1/7 |\n| E-1239    | 45237 | 1/7 |\n| E-1240    | 665   | 1/7 |\n| E-1241    | 2443  | 1/7 |\n| E-1242    | 1073  | 1/7 |\n| E-1243    | 1204  | 1/7 |\n| E-1244    | 3778  | 1/7 |\n| E-1245    | 4781  | 1/7 |\n| E-1246    | 5653  | 1/7 |\n| E-1247    | 11027 | 1/7 |\n| E-1248    | 11405 | 1/7 |\n| E-1249    | 47520 | 1/7 |\n\n**DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE**\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nWe have your requisition for paint and other items in order to repair and paint the outside buildings at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the difficulties that have been encountered in securing water, it appears very unlikely that Gordon's School can be reopened on September 1st.\n\nUnder the circumstances we do not feel it advisable to expend funds at the present time for painting the out-buildings. We are already committed to a very heavy expenditure at this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MOD\nMemorandum: July 25th, 1947.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of June 20th, and enclosed copy of report from the International Water Supply Limited concerning the test drilling undertaken at the above School, we have now received a report from Mr. Mitchell dated attch. July 17th, 1947, duplicate copies of which are attached herewith.\n\nYou will note that apparently two wells were drilled at the Gordon School in 1921, one to a depth of 350' and the other to 540'. It is possible that the records of these two wells might be found in the closed files of the Water Power Bureau or Indian Affairs, but we understand they are not available in the present office of the Water Power Bureau.\n\nIt is apparent that the general topography and the information secured in regard to the two wells previously drilled convinced Mr. Mitchell that drilling a 400' well in the vicinity of the School would not produce a suitable water supply.\n\nThe source of water which is recommended for development is a spring situated about one mile and a quarter south east from the School and was reported on previously by Mr. Lyon. There seems to be some little doubt as to whether this spring will produce a constant supply of water sufficient for the entire consumption at the School as it appears to be influenced by rainfall to some degree.\n\nMr. Mitchell suggests testing the capacity of the spring recommended for development which, of course, should be done if it is desired to abandon the present water supply from the lake, but it would appear to us that even tests which might prove satisfactory over a period of two weeks would not guarantee sufficient water for any subsequent period, as the flow might be dependent, to a great extent, on climatic conditions.\n\nFor the present it would seem necessary to haul drinking water from the spring and if Indian Affairs consider the expenditure of $24,000.00, to connect the spring by a gravity line to the School, will be an advantage and an economy over hauling the water by team or truck, this gravity line could be installed.\n\nThe decision as to whether the new gravity line from the spring should be built will depend not only on the present cost of hauling drinking water, but also on whether the cycle of dry years is near its end and whether water in the lake\n\nJ.

If the gravity line is built, in twelve months it should be possible to determine whether there is any probability that the entire water demand of the School can be met from the spring, but until that period of time has elapsed there would appear to be no guarantee whatsoever.\n\nT.S.

Under separate cover we are also forwarding three blue-prints of the plan and profile of suggested gravity water supply line from the spring one and a quarter miles southeast of the school.\n\nIt will be noted that in the first paragraph on Page 5 of Mr. Mitchell's report he refers to the necessity of further tests of the supply from the spring area before any decision is made on the installation of a gravity pipeline. It is suggested that a continuous test be run for a period of from ten to fourteen days to prove the supply. According to the analysis obtained by Mr. Hainstock the quality of the water supply is suitable. However, further samples should be taken during the testing period to determine just what effect continuous pumping has on the quality of water.\n\nYou have already been supplied with the logs of the test wells and with a drilling report, direct from Mr. Hainstock.\n\nAs stated in copy of letter attached, we have been advised by Mr. O.H.

Walker, Esq.,\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon Indian School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nOn receipt of a wire from Mr. Hainstock of the International Water Supply Limited, Regina, dated May 21st, in which advice was given that he expected his drilling outfit to be at Punnichy and Gordon Indian School on May the 22nd, arrangements were made to leave Riding Mountain Park the following day.\n\nArriving at Punnichy May 22nd at 6 P.M. and after dinner, accompanied by Mr. Hainstock, the district manager of the International Water Supply, and Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent, an inspection of the present water facilities was made at Gordon's Indian School. Mr. Lyons' report of the test holes previously made during 1946 was read; the location of the holes inspected and discussed, from which Mr. Hainstock was of the opinion it would be useless to test the same ground, as the surface features did not indicate that the catchment area would produce any great quantities of water, in view that the gravel exposures were cut up by so many depressions which are primarily supported on a clay stratum. Mr. McKe, the principal of the school, informed us that he had been in conversation with Mr. W. Swan, Secretary of the Touchwood division, some days previously, during which Mr. Swan had informed him that during the building of the school the area in the vicinity of the school had also been drilled by an outfit from Regina in 1921. With this information it was decided by Mr. Hainstock and myself that we contact Mr. Swan the following day.\n\nMay 23rd, while the drilling outfit was being overhauled, Mr. Hainstock and I interviewed Mr. Swan, who informed us that he had been Clerk-of-Works during the building of the school, and although he had searched through his records for the log of the holes drilled, mentioned by Mr. Davis, he had been unable to locate them. However, he produced some letters from his files from the driller - Mr. Dempsey, who was doing the testing for the firm of McPherson and Thomas, Regina, and instructions from Mr. French of the Water Powers & Reclamation Branch. These letters indicated that during 1921 two holes had been drilled in the vicinity of the school, one to a depth of about 350 feet, and the other to a depth of 540 feet. The letter referring to the second hole did not say the test was at a depth of 540 feet, but mentioned that in drawing the pipe they had drawn 350 feet of pipe and had to leave 150 feet in the hole on account of saving. Mr. Swan informed us that both tests were unsatisfactory and as the work had been done under the Direction of the Water Powers and Reclamation Department the logs would be on record at Ottawa. In view that the tests were unsatisfactory Mr. Hainstock and I considered it would be useless to test the same ground.\n\nAccompanied by Mr. Hainstock we returned to the school and scouted the district within a radius of a mile of the school buildings and decided that a No.1 test hole on the main drainage water course from the Fort Lakes, which at one time drained through the water supply\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nlakes at the school, would be the most likely place to intercept any underground flowage or water-bearing gravel and, as the following day was a holiday, the drill was set up at this point on the 26th of May. Mr. Hainstock's report and log covers the result of this and other tests made during the following two weeks.\n\nDuring the 24th, 25th and 26th I reconnoitered the district around the school for a distance of about four miles, inspecting various surface wells, also water holes or wells in the vicinity of springs which appeared to have surfaced at one time, and which had been dug or opened up by the Indians who had farmed these areas for many years. All of the surface wells were not over sixteen feet deep, had about four feet of water and had either been deepened or redug at various times. Many of the Indians hauled water from their neighbour's well on account of their own drying up or the water unfit for use. In the area that lies to the southeast of the school one and a quarter to two and a half miles where the springs or seepages occur, the older Indians informed me that their water holes or wells dug in the vicinity of these seepages had never dried up during their lifetime and some of these Indians were over fifty years of age.\n\nOn the 27th Mr. Hainstock returned from Regina and checked up with his driller on test hole No.1. From the records of the drilling and from his experience of testing in terminal moraine deposits he was convinced that it would be useless to continue the test on No.1 much further as the bottom of the test hole was 37 feet below the bottom of the lake and no water-bearing gravel had been encountered. I detailed to him my reconnaissance of the previous three days and accompanied by Mr. Hainstock covered some of the ground reconnoitered, and inspected the well at the spring one and a quarter miles southeast of the school. The possibilities here appeared to be more promising than elsewhere, and it was decided to make a pump test and if favourable, test the depth of the water-bearing gravel that the seepage came from.\n\nOn the 28th a small thirty gallon a minute pump was set up at the spring well. The cribbing of the well is four feet square and the water level before pumping, 1.3 feet below ground level, and the depth of water about three feet. After the water had been lowered, the well cleaned out, and a pump made, the inflow showed a very strong stream coming from the high ground with seepage around the low side of the cribbing. After pumping for thirty minutes the water level in an old water hole about twenty feet south of the cribbed well was taken down about two inches. A rough flow test was made by cutting down the rating of the pump to about ten gallons per minute and after the inflow had about balanced the discharge, the flow into a forty-five gallon drum showed a discharge of about ten to twelve gallons per minute, and Mr. Hainstock and myself considered a test hole should be put down to find the depth of the water-bearing gravel above the ground that the strong stream appeared to come from and the drilling rig was moved to drill hole No.2 at the spring.\n\nOn May 29th the crew got the rig set up at No.2 hole and commenced drilling at 3:00 P.M. Progress was very slow, as the bit was encountering numerous boulders. By 4:30 P.M., the hole had been driven about six feet only and was still in boulder gravel. The work was suspended for the day and drilling resumed during the forenoon of May 30th, but progress was even slower than the previous afternoon, and after the drill bit had been bouncing around on the top of a hard granite boulder at about eight feet deep for about thirty minutes without making any headway, the driller decided that he would either have to set the rig up in another location or test the bottom of the well by deepening. As Mr. Hainstock had left for Yorkton to inspect .......\nYorkton to inspect other work, the Company was working on, I approved of the driller's suggestion to deepen the well and this work was proceeded with. After deepening about 1.5 feet, and before quitting time, I had the driller make a rough flow test for about ten minutes. The deepening of the well appeared to have improved the inflow to about twenty-five gallons per minute, which was nearly double of the test made on May 28th without any deepening. As the Drilling Company employees only work five days a week, work was suspended until Monday June 2nd.\n\nThe work which had been done so far at this spring seepage appeared worth while, so I decided to run a traverse line and gather sufficient data with respect to its location, elevation, etc. I arranged with Mr. Mayo, the school principal, to loan me some Indian boys and during the next three days a traverse line has been cut and chained from the school to the spring, and levels completed by June 4th. From the data collected I have prepared a sketch plan and profile which can be used to secure a cost of developing this spring as a gravity water supply for the Gordon Indian School. The level datum is assumed, and is that established by Mr. Lyons. The bearing of the traverse line is referred to the tie made on the 1/4 post found on the northern boundary of Section 5, Township 27, Range 17, West of the 9th Meridian.\n\nOn Monday June 2nd the drillers continued the deepening of the well and carried the cribbing down to ground level. The cribbing has a depth of 5-6 feet and the well was deepened or dished in the bottom about two feet below the crib walls. To do so, two pumps throwing about 75 G.P.M. had to be used to keep the water sufficiently low to work in. The excavation was still in boulder gravel when the work reached this depth, and further deepening could not be proceeded with as the capacity of the two pumps was insufficient to keep the water low enough to work in. With one pump throwing about 45 G.P.M. the water level gained very rapidly for about five minutes after the other pump was cut out, after which it was much slower. Pumping was stopped at 4:30 P.M. and the well allowed to recover over night. Mr. Hainstock arrived at Punichy at 9:00 P.M. and arranged with his driller to make a flow test the following day.\n\nOn June 3rd Mr. Hainstock and the driller made a flow test of the deepened well at the spring. Inspection of this recovery indicated that the water level had recovered to within .75 feet of normal during the sixteen hours the pump was off. After pumping commenced the two pumps were run to full capacity for two hours, the discharge being taken about fifty feet away from the well. During dead low a sample of the water coming in from the spring was taken, after which the pumps were cut out and the water allowed to return to within 24\" of normal. The smaller pump was adjusted to throw about 20 gals. per minute and continued pumping for five hours and fifteen minutes without showing more than a rise of 24\" above normal, with no variation. A Flow test was made at 3:00 P.M. and a 45 gallon drum was filled in two minutes ten seconds, indicating that the average inflow at 24\" below normal was approximately 21.4 Imperial gallons per minute. A sample of the water was taken and the pumps cut out at 3:15 P.M. Recovery after five minute duration, after pump was cut, was four-tenths and much slower until at two hours the well had recovered to within .75 tenths of normal. During the five hours and fifteen minutes of pumping that day, it is estimated that approximately 8,000 gals. had been pumped and as the tailwater from the pump was fifty feet away, a very small amount of the discharge had recirculated. It was also noted that during all the time the test was being made, the water hole twenty feet south of the well, was only drawn down fourteen inches.\n\nBefore Mr. Hainstock left for Regina he arranged for his driller to make test No.3 at Station 444 on the traverse line, in the hope that the water-bearing gravel of the spring might extend north towards the school. The result of this test is shown in the log of hole No.3 .......\nhole No.3. From my own observation of the terrain I am of the opinion that the water-bearing gravel of the spring does not extend further north than the ridge that the traverse line crosses at P.I. Station 54 + 21.9 and that the gravel lifts onto a clay boulder formation that has considerable depth and extends throughout the area. It is doubtful if a deep hole down to bedrock could intercept any significant amount that had been laid down intermittently with the glacial clay formation. If deeper gravel beds were intercepted below the zone of the glacial clay, the waters found would be more highly mineralized than the gravel formation at the spring, and would not be fit for domestic purposes.\n\nDuring the night of June 3rd a heavy thunder and rainstorm prevailed throughout the district for about three hours and when the site of the spring was inspected on the morning of June 4th the water layer in the well was 5 feet above normal, indicating that climatic conditions will affect the water level of the well. This, of course, is to be expected of any natural well. It is doubtful if the spring seepage contributed to any great extent the rise above normal water level recorded. For example, the surface well of Mr. Fisher's shown on the plan about 2000 feet west of the school, has a depth of about sixteen feet and has a depth of five feet of water generally throughout the season, but last fall, after the September rains, before freeze-up, the depth of the water was approximately nine feet. This was indicated by the rim of ice that still hung in the orifice when the well was inspected. No check was made on this well as to what effect the rainstorms of June 3rd had on the water level, but no doubt it was much higher than when inspected.\n\nOn June 5th the drillers got the rig set up at No.3 test hole by noon and had drilled thirty-one feet by 4:45 P.M. and were drilling in sandy clay with boulders. Water level at the spring well had gained .22 feet during the twenty-four hours and the water level, according to the datum, was 126.89 feet, approximately twelve feet above maintained water level in the storage tank at the school. Test drilling at No.3 hole was resumed on Friday June 6th, and by 4:30 P.M. had reached a depth of sixty-two feet. Drilling was much slower than the previous afternoon in view that some boulders were encountered and had to be drilled. At quitting time the bit was bounding on another large boulder and as there would be a layoff during Saturday and Sunday I left Punnichy for Regina at 7:00 P.M.\n\nOn June 7th at Regina I contacted Mr. Hainstock and discussed the drilling programme and advised him of the results of the test at No.3 up to closing time on the 6th. From his conversation he was doubtful that the test would be successful. However, I suggested that he continue the drilling and give the ground a thorough test and advise your office of the location of the hole drilled and the results. Mr. Hainstock conveyed to me the partial analyses he had got of the water samples taken at the spring, and these looked encouraging. Later I contacted Mr. Ostrander, Superintendent of Indian Affairs stationed at Regina and discussed the results of the present drilling test made at Gordon's Indian School and enquired about the records of the test made in 1921, but as his files on Punnichy only went as far back as 1926 he was unable to give me anything on these tests.\n\nDuring my ...................\nDuring my conversations with Mr. Ostrender in connection with the present and the future possibilities of securing a satisfactory water supply for the school, I outlined the unsatisfactory results that had been obtained so far from the drilling tests and informed him that if the department of Indian Affairs were prepared to expend about $20,000.00, a gravity pipeline could be laid from the spring 6600 feet to the school, providing that the analysis of the water samples taken was satisfactory and that if a daily pumping test of say two weeks indicated that a daily consumption of eight or ten thousand gallons per day would not deplete the storage of the water-bearing gravel from where the spring was drawing its supply. To this Mr. Ostrender was of the opinion that if the spring could not be developed and no usable supply could be found from drilling, with sufficient flow to meet the needs of the school, it would mean the closing of the school and the abandonment of a large investment by the government, or continuing the present costly and very unsatisfactory method of pumping, flushing water from the water supply lake and drawing on rain water from the roofs and supplying ice or hauling water from a surface well for drinking and domestic use.\n\nAfter reviewing Mr. Hainstock's report dated June 17th I agreed with him that, of the various sites investigated, the spring, one and a quarter (\u00bc) miles southeast of the school, offers the best possibility of obtaining a fairly good water supply, that would provide the estimated consumption of seven to ten thousand gallons per day required for the school, but I am not prepared to say that I would place the area as suspect, in view that the well did not fully recover before the heavy rainfall of the evening of June 3rd. From observations taken by me after the pumping of five and three hours during May 28th and 30th at a rate of about ten to fifteen gallons per minute, and before any deepening had been done, the recovery record of one-tenth below normal after a two day layoff would appear reasonable, and that after deepening on June 2nd and pumping for about seven hours at a rate of forty-sixty gallons per minute it is reasonable to say that static head would have lowered somewhat and that a full recovery to the original water level could not be expected, but the recovery after that day's pumping, and a night's layoff which was recorded as 7\u00bd tenths below normal, compares very favourably with the recovery of June 3rd pumping test of five hours at the rate of about twenty gallons per minute, when after the pumps had been cut out, and after a two hour layoff, the water level had again recovered to within 7\u00bd tenths below normal.\n\nThe facts as outlined here indicate that the spring at this well, if fully tested by a daily pumping test as previously suggested, has possibilities of a potential water supply that would meet the needs of the school. A summary estimate of cost of installing a three inch gravity pipeline, using G.I.P., is attached hereto. A four inch wood stave pipe could be used and would probably reduce the cost below $20,000.00.\n\nThe spring reported by Mr. Lyons and referred to in head office letter of June 20th is the water hole mentioned in this report, and is situated about twenty feet south of the cribbed well. At the time of Mr. Lyons' inspection the cribbed well was not dug. During the tests at this cribbed well we pumped this water hole out and the rough test of flow showed up considerably better than that mentioned by Mr. Lyons, but as the cribbed well was better for our tests the drillers did not concentrate in doing any work, or keeping any records of the actual flow, other than tab the drop in water level during the other tests.\n\nWith the twelve foot head available between water level at the spring, and the present maintained water level of the tank at the school, using a three inch pipeline there would be a hydraulic flow of 202 I.G.P.M., which is approximately three times the school's present sixteen hour daily consumption.\nconsumption. From the tests made at the spring on June the 2nd the test indicated an inflow of over twenty-one Imperial gallons per minute, in view of which - if the well stands up under further testing, the school's requirements can be met with a greater degree of assurance.\n\nDischarge to the tank could be got by placing a booster pump on the main about Station 2900 and using the hydraulic flow of about 460 Imperial gallons per minute, which is available under the thirty-five feet head at this point. Further, if it is desirable to construct a new tank at the school to receive the spring water, additional head could be got by placing the new tank at a lower level and maintain a lower water level. In this case it would probably be necessary to place the pressure tank pump lower also.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. H.

This decision has, of course, been expected as we have felt confident that the school would not be in fit condition for occupancy by September first. I wish to pay my personal tribute to the complete cooperation we have received from officials of the Branch and I know that everything possible is being done to deal with this very difficult situation.\n\nWe are, of course, faced with the problem of disposing of our staff and feel it wise at this time to divert the majority of them to other schools. Even so, we are faced with the necessity of retaining a sufficient number on our salary list to see that the building is kept in good order and that farming operations are carried on effectively. If this situation continues for any length of time we shall again be faced with a very heavy loss in operation as we were last year when our costs continued and there was no income with which to meet them. I feel confident that we shall receive consideration from the Department if this situation arises owing to causes beyond our control.\n\nThanking you and with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.

It will take Dr. Alderwood three weeks to one month to gather a staff and we must give him ample warning of the date upon which your work can be completed.\n\nWe have searched our files but can find no well reports as requested in paragraph two of your letter. Our files do indicate, however, that this work was carried out under the supervision of the Dominion Water & Power Bureau.\n\nApparently the original site selected was not satisfactory because Commissioner Graham wired on 22nd June, 1921, that they had not been able to find water.\n\nOur files indicate that the old school was located in NE\u00bc of Section 3 Tp 27 Rge 17 W 2nd Meridian. Please find attached township map which we wish returned after you have referred to it.\n\nThere are not sufficient funds in our estimates for this year to warrant the expenditure of $24,000. on a gravity line from the spring, as intimated in Mr. Mills' memorandum of July 25th.

Some time later, in conversation with an official of the Department of Public Works in Saskatoon, I was informed that the William George Plumbing Company, of Prince Albert, who have done considerable work in a satisfactory manner for the Department of Public Works, might be interested in the work. Following an interview with that firm Mr. C. Simonson, of the firm, visited the Gordon's School yesterday in the company of Mr. J. Ramage, of the Department of Public Works, and I met them at the school and went over the proposed work with them.\n\nMr. Simonson is to furnish me with an estimate of the work and I am also receiving a report from Mr. Ramage commenting upon changes which he suggests should be made in order to make a completely efficient heating plant.\n\nAs soon as this information is received it will be forwarded to our Branch for further consideration.\n\nI see little hope of re-opening the Gordon's School for some time because of the fact that there will be difficulty in purchasing a boiler. Mr. Simonson informed me that the remainder of the necessary equipment can probably be purchased fairly promptly but that if he gets the contract he would like the assistance of the Branch to speed the purchase of the boiler.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of your letter referred to, asking for three tenders, it would appear that we will be fortunate to get even one as plumbing contractors seem to have very little interest in work at country points at the present time.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nPost Office Building,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nRe: Heating Plant - Gordon Residential School - Touchwood, Sask.\n\nAs requested by you, I am forwarding report on the heating plant at the above noted building.\n\nI will refer you to your discussion with myself and Mr. Simonson, the heating Engineer, at the above noted school on Wednesday, September 3rd. Upon inspection of the existing plant I found it to be in a filthy condition and utterly inadequate to service the building in which it is located. I might further say that the entire plant has suffered from improper care and might I recommend that in the event of a new plant being installed that every reasonable effort be made to obtain the services of a competent engineer who could maintain and generally look after the plant in a manner so that you might hope for efficient heating.\n\nI found that the drawings which you gave me of the building were not correct as to detail. It, therefore, will be necessary to arrange the radiation differently than shown on the drawings and it was agreed between Mr. Simonson and myself that he, as the contractor, would furnish and re-arrange adequate radiation and guarantee the efficient operation of the same for a period of not less than one year. I might further point out that you were singularly fortunate in obtaining the services of Mr. Simonson as he is undoubtedly one of the outstanding heating engineers in this province and a very highly qualified man.\n\nReferring to the heating plant and hot water and steam supply, I would recommend that all the existing plants be discarded\u2014that is, the existing heating boiler, the existing water heater, and the existing vertical high pressure boiler. I might say that none of these are, in my considered opinion, serviceable and by re-using any portion of the equipment you would merely be giving yourself a source of continual grief. I would, therefore, recommend that new boilers...\nrecommend that new boilers as indicated on the plans and specifications be installed and that a high pressure boiler of the horizontal type of about 15 H.P., operating at 100 pounds pressure, be installed. In the matter of indirect water heating, I would recommend that the indirect type of below water in boiler heater be installed. This could be made to operate from either the low pressure or the high pressure boiler. The high pressure boiler would furnish you with adequate hot water for summer use and if desired the heater could be operated from the low pressure boiler during the heating season. The object of recommending this type of installation is that there are no reducing valves or valves which might give a source of trouble and this, in my opinion, is as nearly a fool-proof installation as it is possible to install. The building being some considerable distance from town, I feel that every effort should be made to so design and install the plant that the man in charge would be able to carry out his own running repairs.\n\nAfter having studied the building and become conversant with the problems and difficulties which have existed in the past, I would very strongly recommend the installation of a Dunham vacuum pump in the system. The boiler being located very much in one corner of the building, the entire plant will at all times tend to collect condensation and siltage and by use of the Dunham vacuum type pump you would be assured of ample heat in the most remote corner of the building. I might say that the Dunham type vacuum would entail a slightly greater cost, but I feel that such an expenditure would be justified in the interests of efficiency and simplicity. It would also tend to show a very decided reduction in fuel costs. Inspection of all the plumbing and heating pipe indicates that it is badly pitted and rusted, and I have reason to believe that this condition has been caused through the chemical action of the salts and minerals present in the water. The water is definitely of a very poor nature for boiler service. You indicated to me that a soft water tank was proposed. While soft water is a very good source of supply, at the same time it is not to be recommended unless handled by a highly skilled engineer. I would, therefore, recommend that a water softener be installed which would soften all hot water used in the building and at the same time soften the water used in the boilers. I would not recommend softening all water in the building as a very large amount is used for sanitary purposes and it would take an enormously large installation to handle the water which would be used.\n\nI further found a great many cracked radiators and the Principal of the School informed me that members of the staff opened the windows, turned off the radiators, and left them, thus causing through condensation the radiators to freeze up and split. To overcome this condition, I would recommend that...\nwould recommend that small vents be bored or cut in the valve faces so that these radiators can never be shut off tight, thus a limited supply of steam will pass through them, overcoming the frost hazard.\n\nThe water filter which is presently in the building is obsolete and worn out and definitely beyond repair and as you indicate a new water supply is being led into the building and I feel quite sure that with a softener your water troubles will be over.\n\nI found that all the main traps in the building were worn out, rusted and scaled. This condition unquestionably has arisen through use of very impure water in the boiler and possibly to a large extent caused through the improper handling of the heating at the boiler source. I further found that a great deal of sediment is present in many of the radiators. These will have to be removed, flushed and, in many cases, acid treated to make them clean.\n\nI find that the existing smoke stack is of sufficient capacity to handle the proposed new boiler installation.\n\nI am pleased to be able to inform you that Mr. Simonson has been successful in obtaining the services of Shannon Brothers, the general contractors, to carry out the necessary structural alterations. They are a highly reputable firm and you can rest assured that the work is in good and safe hands and will be well carried out. I propose visiting the school again in company with Mr. Shannon and going over the necessary structural alterations.\n\nMr. Simonson and myself prepared final details of the foregoing proposal before he left Saskatoon yesterday and as soon as possible I will forward to you sketch copies of the proposed new lay-out. As you will readily appreciate, it is going to take some considerable time to round up sources of material supply and prices, but I have been assured by Mr. Simonson that he will have a detailed price to you at the earliest possible moment.\n\nTrusting that the foregoing is sufficiently comprehensive in information and will prove of value to you and assure you of my willing assistance in any further manner that you desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJR:AR\n\nfor Norman L.

We have been maintaining a staff of workers at the school in anticipation of the early arrival of a group of workmen. The report I received on the ground was to the effect that the contractors are now beginning to search for material and that the date when the gang will reach the school is altogether uncertain. This places us in a very difficult position as we are paying salaries needlessly, without much hope of income, and if we dispense with the services of the present workers it may be hard to secure others when the need arises.\n\nMay I pass on also the serious warning uttered by our acting-principal, Mr. Mayo, in regard to the danger of damage by frost. The nights in the West are already cold and the building is now chilled through and really unfit for occupation. If nothing is done to maintain even a minimum amount of heat, any day there is serious risk that very costly damage will be done to the whole building when more severe frosts occur. Possibly the contractors have this danger in mind but they will need to move quickly in view of the date we have now reached.\n\nA letter from the Director sent to this office on August 13th spoke of the decision to delay the opening of the school for at least two months. My impression gained on the ground was that it will certainly be the beginning of 1948 before the school is ready for occupation and\nmay very well be much later than this. In these circumstances, I trust that consideration will be given to the matter of responsibility for the building as we plainly cannot be expected to maintain an acting-principal and other workers to protect the interests of the Department in this building.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nN.A. Alderwood\n\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, September 25, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nGordon's Indian Residential School -\n\nThe attached letter from Dr. Alderwood, of the Indian School Administration of the Church of England, is self-explanatory. It would be appreciated if we could be advised as to the progress being made by the contractors so that we can advise Dr. Alderwood concerning the responsibility for the maintenance of this building before and during the time the repairs to the heating plant are carried out.\n\nIt is also felt that the Principal's warning concerning the danger of damage by frost should be brought to the attention of the contractors, so that they can take the necessary steps to keep the building heated at least slightly during their time of occupancy.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDirector\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 7, 1947.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nFurther to our letter of October last, with reference to the above, you are advised that to date we have received no prices on the proposed alterations and revisions to the mechanical services at the above.\n\nIt would appear from a memorandum just received from Mr. Boey, to which was attached a letter from Dr. Alderwood, that the Doctor has been given the impression that the contractors are ready to start operations as soon as they have procured the necessary materials. Also, he and the Acting Principal, Mr. Mayo, are concerned about keeping the frost out of the building during the coming season.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this impression has been created as there is no basis for same. As you know, no work can be started until the prices submitted to you by firms you have requested to tender, have received our consideration and the approval of Indian Affairs. It is, therefore, your responsibility to take the necessary action to get these prices in at the earliest possible date so that a decision can be reached.\n\nWith regard to keeping frost out of the building it should hardly be necessary to suggest that the present heating system be started up and carefully nursed along until such time the new work is commenced; when other arrangements will have to be considered. We are not optimistic as to how long some items of the present equipment will function, but we see no reason why it should stand idle since it would appear that some members of your staff will be on duty for some time, and heat will have to be provided under the circumstances.\n\nYour co-operation with regard to obtaining speedy action from the bidders will be greatly appreciated.\n\nT.S.

He asked that Mr. J. Ramage, of the Department of Public Works, with whom he had had considerable dealings, accompany him for purposes of advice to him and to me. Mr. Simonson would not examine the plant unless Mr. Ramage accompanied him. I point this out as you seem to be under the impression that Mr. Ramage, who is a qualified engineer with the Department of Public Works, went beyond his duty in making certain recommendations. With regard to the third paragraph of your letter referred to, as to Mr. Ramage's comment that the building drawings are not correct as to detail, I may say that I was with Mr. Ramage and Mr. Simonson when they went over the building and they tried to follow your blueprint. It was impossible to do so as it very definitely is not correct as to detail in several respects. I am surprised that your engineer did not discover this when he visited the school.\n\nAs Mr. Simonson is the only plumber interested in the work at the present time, and as Mr. Simonson wishes to follow Mr. Ramage's recommendations with regard to the work, I would be glad if you would either consent to that arrangement or send your own engineer to discuss the matter with Mr. Simonson. I have not received Mr. Simonson's quotation yet but expect to receive it within a day or so. However, when it is received it will be based upon the layout as recommended by Mr. Ramage and approved by Mr. Simonson. I have no other quotation and do not expect to receive any other.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAIR MAIL\n\nChief Engineer, Surveys and Resources,\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 1580-4, regarding the Gordon's Mission in Saskatchewan, I do not know when the contractors are ready to start work on the necessary materials for the Gordon's Mission. Interested is the William George Plumbing Company. The firm is submitting a tender and I have received it. The delay in submitting the tender was due to the fact that some of the materials were taken off some of the materials. The William George Plumbing Company, has been engaged in the course of preparing his tender. He telephoned me what changes would be made in the cost and he said by the telephone last night that he will forward the tender a day or so when it will be immediately transferred.\n\nWith regard to that part of your letter which refers to the frost out of the building until the new heating plant can be installed, the old boiler is in poor condition and many of the radiators are not working properly. If it will be some months before the new boiler is completed, arrangements should be made to have the present boiler repaired and a man engaged to operate it in an effort to avoid damage to the building. However, I fear that to attempt to operate with the old boiler and the old radiators we will have bursted pipes and bursted radiators might do more damage in the building than would be done by cutting off heat entirely. The old boiler might be used to keep heat in the rooms which are fairly easy to heat and where there is little danger of bursted pipes and radiators by freezing.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Affairs,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nJPBO/ed\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAIR MAIL\n\nRegina, October 15th\n\nChief Engineer, Surveys and Engineering Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nPlans were made some months ago to install water at the Gordon's Indian Residential School from a spring 1600 ft. away from the school. I understand it was intended to install a reservoir in the spring and pipe the water below the frostline to the well. This will entail a great deal of excavation and concrete work. If it is not started very soon there is no hope of having it completed this winter.\n\nTo spend many thousand dollars to overhaul the heating plant at the school before there is an adequate water supply seems to me a waste of time and money as the school still cannot be opened until there is an adequate supply of safe water. Part of the plan suggested by Mr. J. Ramage, of the Department of Public Works, was the installation of a water softener in the school which would make the water from the spring suitable for use in the boilers. The water which has been used is from a stagnant slough near the school and is not fit for use in the boilers and certainly not safe for human consumption.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\n[Signature]\n\nVERY BEST COPY\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing three copies of letters addressed to the Surveys and Engineering Branch in connection with the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nI am of the opinion that the examination of the heating plant by Mr. Ramage, of the Department of Public Works, was more thorough than that of the engineer of the Surveys and Engineering Branch. I am also of the opinion that Mr. Ramage knows more about heating problems in the West than most heating experts with only eastern experience are likely to know.\n\nI should say quite frankly that I do not consider I have had very much assistance from our Surveys and Engineering Branch in any project which has been worrying me, and I have had a great deal of assistance from Mr. Ramage. I would therefore respectfully suggest that instead of quarrelling over small technical matters wherein Mr. Ramage does not agree with an engineer from our Surveys and Engineering Branch, the latter be asked to proceed on the basis of the plan decided upon between Mr. Ramage and Mr. Simonson, of the William George Plumbing Company, Prince Albert, who apparently have every confidence in each other and who will then both feel responsible to see that the installation is satisfactory in every respect.\n\nWith regard to the question of endeavouring to keep the building heated with the old installation until the new is completed, I do not know what arrangements have been made between our Branch and the Church Authorities but if Mr. Mayo is to continue for the winter, or until a new plant is installed, authority should be given to Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent, to get a plumber into the school to perform what work is necessary to avoid damage to plaster, radiators, pipes, etc. If the contract is given to the William George Plumbing Company, of Prince Albert, I believe that firm would be willing to send a man to look after this temporary work until material can be procured and the proper installation completed. Please instruct me in this connection at an early date.\n\nJ.P.B./ed\nEncl.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 29, 1947.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School - Punnichy, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of October 20th, 1947, and your remarks have been given careful consideration and it is noted that Mr. Ramage visited the school at the request of the Wm. George Co. We have reviewed Mr. Ramage's report on the present condition of the mechanical services at the school and have noted his comments and recommendations.\n\nRegarding errors you report as appearing in our drawings for this project, we are mailing, under separate cover, one set of floor plans. It is possible that our engineer could have overlooked some minor changes when carrying out his inspection as he was mainly concerned with gathering data relative to the condition of the mechanical equipment and the piping distribution, and it seems unlikely to us that major changes to the building structure would have escaped his notice.\n\nIf changes in the position of partitions or other features have been carried out since the building was erected, would you kindly mark them on the set of plans and return them to this office as soon as possible. Upon receipt of same we will make the necessary adjustments to our layout which will include changes to radiator sizes as may be required.\n\nYou have stated that the only price you expect to receive will be based on Mr. Ramage's layout with Mr. Simsonson's approval. This Service has given a great deal of thoughtful consideration to the requirements, and with the data and observations noted by our engineer on his inspection, the layout was devised which will provide a satisfactory job. Should this layout be affected by changes that you state exist, our design will be adjusted to suit same, and you will be required to assure this office that prices are based on the drawings and specifications prepared by this Service.\n\nUp to the present time, we can offer no comment on how a permanent source of water supply will be made available. As you are aware, drilling operations have been carried out during the past summer and the results showed little promise of an unfailing source of water.\n\nInsofar as that matter affects the heating and domestic water problem, you will no doubt recall that in May 10th of this year at a meeting held in Colonel Neary's office, you suggested the use of roof water for boiler feed purposes and that our design should be prepared accordingly. It was agreed that this was feasible and since there are two 10,000 gallon capacity concrete storage tanks adjacent to the building, there would appear to be no difficulty in utilizing one of them for the collection and storage of roof water.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostreander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nUntil we are assured beyond all doubt that a constant and unfailing source of well or spring water can be made available, we see no advantage in installing costly water softening equipment.\n\nWe appreciate and will fully consider any constructive comments offered and are prepared to act on them if after analysis they are considered advisable, but the Contractor will be required, when authorized, to follow the plans and specifications provided by this Service in carrying out the work with due consideration being given to any changes which may be required to overcome structural obstacles encountered during installation.\n\nYour prompt attention with regard to the above would be greatly appreciated.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, October 30, 1947.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe received your letter of the 20th instant enclosing copies of your letters of the same date to the Chief Engineer of the Surveys and Engineering Branch. We have also received a copy of the Chief Engineer's letter of October 29th replying to your communications.\n\nAuthority is given to Mr. Davis to have necessary minor repairs carried out to maintain the old heating plant at this school and thereby prevent damage to plaster, pipes, etc.\n\nIf these repairs amount to over $200.00 please wire the exact amount so that we can obtain the necessary Ministerial approval.\n\nBernard F.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, has forwarded to us copies of his letters of October 20th addressed to your Chief Engineer. We have also received a copy of your letter of October 29th replying to Mr. Ostrander.\n\nWe feel that the urgency for having the work done at the earliest possible date if at all feasible must be stressed. We believe that the only possible solution is to have one of the officers from your Ottawa office proceed immediately to the Gordon's school. In this way any changes necessary in the drawings could be made and the arrangements completed for the work to proceed.\n\nThere is a heavy expenditure involved and while I feel certain that Mr. Ostrander is anxious to co-operate in every possible way, he has many other duties to perform and lacks the technical knowledge of this particular class of work.\n\nI trust that you will find it possible to carry out this suggestion.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, November 6, 1947.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nWe are returning unpaid your voucher No. 905.\n\nThe Department has never assumed responsibility for payment of employees at an Indian residential school and consequently we cannot consider payment of Unemployment Insurance for school employees.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nNovember 3, 1947.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of October 30th, which bears your notation of November 1st, you are advised that our Mr. Hargreaves is leaving tonight for Regina to visit Inspector Ostrander in connection with the above.\n\nThe mechanical revisions and all their requirements will be thoroughly discussed with the Inspector and a representative of the firm of contractors, who are preparing an estimate, with the view of obtaining a clear understanding of all matters pertaining to this work.\n\nFollowing this discussion our officer will proceed to the school, and it is hoped that Mr. Ostrander and a representative of the Wm. George Plumbing Company will find it convenient to accompany him. It is expected that any misconceptions will be made clear, and if the contractor's estimate appears to be reasonable there would seem to be no difficulty in having this work started at an early date.\n\nWhen our officer returns you will be further advised.\n\nJ.M.

This school, which has a pupilage of 130, has been closed since the first of July, due to the fact that we were unable to interest a contractor in the repairs necessary to again open this institution, we have had much difficulty at this school, due to the lack of water and also due to the alkalinity of the water when it is available. These salts have corroded the entire heating system. Not only is the boiler completely useless, but the pipes and the radiators are rotted through to a dangerous extent.\n\nWhen delays occurred in interesting a contractor in this work it was hoped that we could use the old boiler sufficiently to at least keep a little heat in the building and thus prevent frost damage. When Mr. Ostrander, our Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, finally persuaded the William George Plumbing Company of Prince Albert to tender on this work, it was decided to send Mr. Hargreaves of the Surveys and Engineering Branch to Regina, in order to give him technical advice. Mr. Hargreaves has just wired his Branch, informing them that the old boiler is completely useless and that unless a new boiler is obtained at once serious frost damage will result to this valuable school. Mr. Ostrander and Mr. Hargreaves also long distanced our Superintendent of Education on Saturday, urging upon him the necessity of placing an order for a new boiler to be delivered.\nwithin three or four weeks. Pending your approval, they were told to have the William George Plumbing Company place an order for this new boiler.\n\nIt is hoped that this order in Council can be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible. Included in our supplementary estimates for 1947-48 is the sum of $35,200.00 which we were advised by our Surveys and Engineering Branch as being necessary for the completion of the work at this school.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

This school has been closed since the first of September due to the fact that we were unable to interest a contractor in the repairs necessary to again open this institution. We have had much difficulty at this school, due to the lack of water and also due to the alkalinity of the water when it is available. These salts have corroded the entire heating system. Not only is the boiler completely useless, but the pipes and the radiators are rotted through to a dangerous extent.\n\nWhen delays occurred in interesting a contractor in this work it was hoped that we could use the old boiler sufficiently to at least keep a little heat in the building and thus prevent frost damage.\n\nWhen Mr. Ostrander, our Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, finally persuaded the William George Plumbing Company of Prince Albert to tender on this work, it was decided to send Mr. Hargreaves of the Surveys and Engineering Branch to Regina, in order to give him technical advice.\n\nMr. Hargreaves has just wired his Branch, informing them that the old boiler is completely useless and that unless a new boiler is obtained at once serious frost damage will result to this valuable school. Mr. Ostrander and Mr. Hargreaves also long distanced our Superintendent of Education on Saturday, urging upon him the necessity of placing an order for a new boiler to be delivered within three or four weeks. Pending your approval, they were told to have the William George Plumbing Company place an order for this new boiler.\nIt is hoped that this order in Council can be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible. Included in our supplementary estimates for 1947-48 is the sum of $35,000.00 which we were advised by our Surveys and Engineering Branch as necessary for the completion of the work at this school.\n\nDirector.\nIt is hoped that this order in Council can be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible. Included in our supplementary estimates for 1947-48 is the sum of $35,000.00 which we were advised by our Surveys and Engineering Branch as necessary for the completion of the work at this school.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 26, 1947.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant, file G-7a, regarding the employment of Harold Straker at the Gordon's Residential School last winter.\n\nIf the stamps were placed in his Unemployment Insurance book, the Department will be responsible for half the cost. However, if the school did not keep his Unemployment Insurance book up to date it will be necessary to consult the nearest Unemployment Insurance office in order to ascertain what action should be taken.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNOV 20 1947\n\nNovember 18, 1947.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of October 30th, bearing Mr. Wardle's notation of November 1st, 1947, in connection with the above, you are advised that our Mr. Hargreaves was sent to Regina on November 3rd in accordance with Mr. Hoey's request.\n\nIn brief summary, it could be stated that the difficulties which arose in connection with getting an estimate from the contractor, along with some criticisms brought to our attention by Inspector Ostrander were successfully dealt with, and a complete understanding arrived at.\n\nEnlarging somewhat on the above, a meeting was held at which Mr. Thompson, Resident Architect Dominion Department of Public Works, Mr. Ramage, Heating Engineer from his staff, Mr. Simonson, Proprietor of the Wm. George Plumbing Co. of Prince Albert, Mr. Lunam, a General Contractor, Inspector Ostrander, Mr. Indian Agent Davis and our officer were present.\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion of the matter, which began immediately after our officer's arrival, it was decided to drive to Punnichy the following morning. Consequently Messrs. Simonson, Ramage, Ostrander, Davis and Hargreaves left Regina at 8:15 a.m. on the 6th instant and after arriving at the school, inspected the boiler room equipment and piping distribution system.\n\nRapid deterioration had taken place in the boiler, and it was found to be in a very bad state. It was agreed by everyone present that no further repairs could be successfully carried out. Ways and means were discussed at considerable length to determine the best and quickest method of providing temporary heat in order to protect the building from serious frost damage. It was agreed that the most practical solution would be to procure one new boiler immediately along with a new vacuum return line pump and to make essential piping changes, all of which it is felt will provide enough heat for the building to protect it from damage during this winter.\n\nAs a result of this discussion, Mr. Hargreaves wired this office requesting immediate authority to instruct Mr. Simonson to proceed along these lines. Mr. Ostrander telephoned Col. Neary, Saturday the 8th instant, and our officer also spoke with him.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nPlease let me know what further assistance we can render in this matter.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOur officer succeeded in obtaining a verbal estimate from Mr. Simonson on the basis of the layout designed and specifications prepared by this Service. Mr. Simonson stated that his firm estimated that the cost of this work would be in the neighbourhood of $35,500.00. He also stated that his firm would be prepared to carry it out on the basis of cost plus 15 per cent.\n\nThis is considered reasonable. Recent wage increases to plumbers and steam fitters in the province along with certain provincial regulations governing statutory holidays and annual holidays with pay, has increased the contractors' operating overhead expenses approximately 30 per cent.\n\nAs a result of this visit our officer reports that he has satisfied himself as to the ability of the Wm. George Plumbing Co. to carry out the renovations if awarded the contract. Inquiries showed that Mr. Simonson is highly thought of in the province and is considered to be very reliable. In view of the foregoing it is felt that no better arrangement could be made.\n\nIncidentally, Inspector Ostrander has been trying since June to get competent estimates but has not succeeded in interesting any other firm. If this work is awarded to the Wm. George Plumbing Co. at once, it is estimated that it will take from now to the beginning of April before all the equipment and piping can be purchased and delivered to the school. At such time the contractor has agreed, if awarded the work, to provide sufficient staff along with a competent foreman to complete the work in from eight to ten weeks, and that he will give the project his personal attention.\n\nIt was arranged with Mr. Mayo, the Acting Principal of the school, to provide board and lodgings for the contractor's workmen and amicable arrangements in connection with board and lodging was arrived at tentatively between Mr. Mayo and Mr. Simonson.\n\nIt is our recommendation, therefore, that the work be awarded to the Wm. George Plumbing Co. of Prince Albert on cost plus 15 per cent basis. It is further recommended that the contractor be informed as soon as possible that he is to be awarded this work in order that he may start gathering equipment and piping, as well as to make an immediate start on the very urgent repairs necessary to protect the building from frost damage.\n\nMr. Simonson stated that he would confirm his verbal estimate, by letter to this office, at the earliest possible moment.\n\nChief Engineer.\nWILLIAM GEORGE & COMPANY\n1018 First Ave. West\nPRINCE ALBERT\nSaskatchewan.\n\nNov. 12, 1947.\n\nMr. A.

I visited the office of this firm yesterday for the purpose of enquiring as to the reason for the delay. Mr. Simonson informs me that he has been daily expecting a shipment of pipe to arrive in Saskatoon for use at the Gordon's School, but that the pipe had not yet arrived. He does not wish to send a number of men to the school until there is sufficient pipe on the job to keep the men working as he has to pay the men from the time they leave Prince Albert until they return to Prince Albert, which is too costly to him if he has not the material to keep them working.\n\nJ.P.B.

I have this week two men here from the Banff Department who have come to pump out and test the spring from which they hope to get the water supply from. They are going to pump for a month to see if it holds out and if satisfactory the Engineer says they might be able to start work on it about April. That will take quite a while to do so.\n\nMr. Davis our Agent here has had an enquiry from Ottawa to know how far the work has gone. Well up to now no move has been made. However, he has been communicating with the contractor who he says is in Winnipeg getting material and was to have been here this week but has not arrived as yet. When they were here in Nov. last they said he would take about four months to complete the job. I cannot see any chance of the work being finished and ready to open school before the fall.\n\nIt has been very trying waiting and waiting and no move made all this time. We have not been able to keep the frost out of the extreme ends of the building and the rads and pipes are frozen there. I cannot be held responsible for that as I warned them what would happen with the present set up. It has been quite a trial to keep heat and sufficient water for the boiler and heat in the centre of building, and water for the stock, causing a lot of extra work.\"\n\n(over)\nI would like to draw your attention particularly to the information in the third paragraph about the freezing of the radiators and pipes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G.

The spring is holding up. Goes down about 2 ft 3\" in this time and recovers within ten minutes.\n\nAn average of around 4000 gals is used a day when the school is in operation, and would be drawn from the well in the 24 hours whereas it is now being taken out in seven hours. They intend to keep up the pumping for at least a month.\n\nIt is regrettable that this source of water supply was not considered before. I pointed out to them when we first started to have trouble with the water, over three years ago, that I considered this spring would be the solution to our troubles. However, not being an engineer, they would not listen to me. If they had we would have saved a considerable amount of money.\n\nR.S.

Mr. Simonson felt that he would be able to procure the necessary equipment to carry out this phase of the work.\n\nConsequently, he was authorized to order the boiler and pump at once and to make such repairs to the piping as appeared to be absolutely essential, in order that some heat may be distributed throughout the building to prevent frost damage.\n\nAt the same time, the Contractor pointed out that it would take all winter to assemble supplies necessary to carry out the complete work, and that he intended to devote his energies to this end, and felt reasonably sure that such supplies would be on hand by the end of March, at which time he would put a full staff of workmen on the job and carry it through to completion without delay.\n\nWe have written to the Contractor several times for a statement of his progress, and his last letter to us, which was dated February 16th, outlined that the supply situation had been most difficult and that he had been keeping in touch with the school through Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent.\n\nThe Contractor also stated in his letter that the centre section of the building has been kept heated, and gave assurance that the building had suffered no damage. He concluded by stating that the work would be under full swing on Monday, February 23rd, and that it would continue without delay until completion. While he has made no direct statement to the effect that any work has been done at the school, we have had, up to now, no reason to doubt that the temporary repairs referred to in paragraph three (3) and four (4) have not been executed.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Ostander's letter of February 7th and Mr. Cook's letter of February 11th, both addressed to Col. Neary, state that no work of any kind has been done to date. Mr. Cook also states that radiators and pipes have frozen in the extreme ends of the building.\n\nWe are writing to the Contractor again and submitting point blank questions in an effort to get a clear understanding as to what has actually taken place. We have a great deal of confidence in the ability and judgment of this Contractor, and feel that he will be able to give assurance that nothing has been neglected in connection with the work.\n\nUpon receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nIndian Agent Davis reports that Mr. Mitchell has been carrying out a pumping test at the spring for three (3) days, and that 8,000 gallons of water is being discharged in seven (7) hours. Also that the water level in the spring goes down about 2'-3\" and recovers its level within 10 minutes after the pump has stopped.\n\nIt is stated that the average daily consumption of water by the school is about 4,000 gallons, which seems to us to be rather conservative.\n\nNevertheless, if the present rate of discharge and recovery can be maintained for a period of one (1) month it would appear reasonable to assume that the spring can supply the school with the required amount of water.\n\nWhen Mr. Mitchell's report is received at the conclusion of his month's test, further comment will be submitted regarding this source of water supply.\n\nChief Engineer.\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nR.S.

Equipment and piping have been in very short supply, particularly in the West, and it is only through the contractors wide business connection that he has been able to finally assemble enough material to make a start.\n\nTo date, one of the new heating boilers has been installed along with the new vacuum pump; and some radiators have been connected up temporarily. Part of the staff started work on February 23rd when enough materials had been delivered to the school to make it worth while. The contractor put a night fireman on duty to ensure that there would be no further interruption in the supply of heat.\n\nWhile it is true that some radiators and pipes have been frozen, the contractor states that Mr. Mayo the Principal of the school, informed him that fewer freeze-ups took place this winter than the previous ones. This is due in part to the fact that it has been possible to keep all interior doors open, as the school children are not present. Also, under the contractors direction, the old boiler was carefully nursed along by the school staff, and the contractor gives full credit to them for their co-operation. He also states definitely that no damage to the plaster has occurred.\n\nThere is still a critical shortage of pipe required for the job, but promise of delivery has been expected and if fulfilled the contractor expects that the work can be completed by the end of May, provided also that the high pressure boiler is delivered on the date promised.\n\nIt is no surprise to this Division that some radiators and pipes have frozen, as our inspection revealed them to be badly clogged, particularly at the ends of the building. The original system was not installed in such a manner as to provide good drainage, and with the scaling of the pipes caused in part by hard water and mediocre maintenance efforts by previously employed boiler room staff, such a state of affairs was bound to develop.\n\nWe would like once more to reiterate our confidence in the William George Plumbing Company. We have every reason to feel that they have left no stone unturned in making every effort to get ahead with this work. As additional supplies are received they will put more men on the job in order to hasten the date of completion.\n\nIt is felt that the contents of this memorandum should reassure Mr. Hoey that everything possible is being done in the interest of the job, and should enable him to deal with the criticism as received from Mr. Cook, Superintendent, M.S.C.C.\n\nR.A.

He strongly recommends getting a stoker for one boiler. These boilers are wood burning boilers and will only take a short length of wood, bare tree feet, further more he says considerable damage might be done to boilers in throwing in heavy wood.\n\nThe north west floor in girls playroom is in a very poor condition having been broken up in places to get at sewer pipes and then not finished off again and the rest of the floor is worn very rough and impossible to keep clean, so many cracks to fill with dirt. Now we have the men and machinery around here will it be possible to have this done. Would minimize the cost if done now.\n\nWill you please take this up with The Dept. and see if they will sanction these extra items and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Fred A. Mayo\n\nMr. R. S.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nGeneral Repairs and Maintenance\nGordon's Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nAttached are copies of requisitions for work required in 1948 which our Principal at Punnichy reports he gave to Mr. Davis, your Agent, early last fall. He says that he did this at Mr. Davis' suggestion.\n\nWill you please let me know what provision, if any, has been made for the above in your 1948-49 Estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of March 23rd you are advised that our Mr. Hargreaves has returned from a visit to the above school, and it is felt advisable to submit a complete report outlining the situation there.\n\nAs you are aware, Mr. Christian Simonson, the sole owner of the William George Plumbing Company of Prince Albert, with whom the Department had a Contract Agreement, died suddenly at the school on March 21st. Previous to his death he had requested the Chief Engineer to send Mr. Hargreaves to Punnichy to inspect the work already carried out and to consult with him in connection with the shortage of materials which he felt was delaying the work.\n\nIn the interests of the Department, our Officer was instructed to obtain all information relative to any arrangements which may have been made by the William George Plumbing Company to carry on with the work, and to advise the Department if such arrangements appeared to be satisfactory. As a result of his visit, the following summary of affairs as he found them is outlined below.\n\nThe late Mr. Simonson had drawn up a will leaving all to his wife and appointing her as executrix with a provision added, appointing his close friend, Mr. Nelson Grosser of Prince Albert as executor in the event of Mrs. Simonson's demise.\n\nWithin a short time after Mr. Simonson's death Mr. Grosser offered his full support to enable Mrs. Simonson to complete any and all outstanding commitments made by the William George Plumbing Company.\n\nShe expressed a desire to carry on with the work at the Gordon School, subject of course to the approval of the Department and immediately called Mr. Grosser into consultation to obtain his advice.\n\nMr. Grosser immediately consulted with the Bank of Nova Scotia of Prince Albert who had been given Power of Attorney by the late Contractor, and he at once deposited the sum of $15,000.00 to cover any outstanding accounts against the William George Plumbing Company. At the request of Mrs. Simonson he assumed active management of the Company and upon learning of our Officer's visit to the job immediately sent a foreman to the school to take charge of further operations, and came down himself for a full discussion.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOur Officer reports that he is satisfied with the work carried out to date and estimates that it is approximately one-third complete. The new Foreman has been continuously employed by the William George Company for over 16 years and in our Officer's opinion is fully qualified and competent. This opinion was arrived at following a full two days discussion between the Foreman and our Representative.\n\nOur Officer requested Mr. Grosser to have a document drawn up and legally attested to the effect that he was assuming all financial responsibility and direction of the William George Plumbing Company's affairs. This he promised to do as soon as he returned to Prince Albert and it is expected that this document will be forwarded to the Department shortly.\n\nAfter thoroughly considering and reviewing the entire project on the job, it is recommended that the William George Plumbing Company should be allowed to carry out the balance of the work at the school. The Foreman and Mechanics now on the job were carefully sized up and examined by our Officer who states they are all men of wide experience in the class of work now being executed. It is also felt that Mr. Grosser is in a very favourable position with regard to obtaining the balance of supplies necessary, as he is well known and has a wide connection in the West.\n\nMessrs Salter and Frith, Barristers and Solicitors, have provided us with a copy of the late Mr. Simonson's will and have advised that we can obtain full information regarding Mr. Grosser's financial standing and business ability from the legal branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia.\n\nIn conclusion we estimate that the job will be completed about the end of June or early in July, at which time it is contemplated sending our Heating Engineer to make an inspection before the final certificates are paid. It is also felt that the Indian Affairs Branch should be apprised of the contents of this memorandum.\n\nChief Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of March 23rd with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur heating engineer on his recent visit to the school, investigated the possibility of using stokers in connection with the new boilers now being installed.\n\nIt was learned that lignite coal could be procured without difficulty for the heating plant, but owing to the fact that the present electric generating equipment is overloaded, it would not be advisable to install the stokers at the present time, as there would be approximately an additional two to three horsepower electrical capacity required to operate the stokers.\n\nHowever, if the electric generating plant is brought up to date, stokers could be added later, as the type of boilers now being installed have been arranged to receive underfeed stokers without disturbing the present layout.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Water Supply - Gordon's I.R. School Saskatchewan.\n\nReferring to the instructions received from Mr. Wardle under date of October 16th, 1947, we have now received a report from Mr. Cornish dated April 9th with final report by Mr. Robinson dated March 22nd giving the results of a pumping test made of the spring situated 1\u00bd miles south-east of the Gordon Indian School.\n\nAttached herewith you will find duplicate copies of the report from Mr. Cornish and the final report from Mr. Robinson with attached blueprints showing recovery of water level and the elevation of water table in connection with this pumping test. You will note that Mr. Cornish gives us a favourable report but we should remember that the test only took place between February 4th and March 17th and we have no definite indication as to what the results might have been had we been able to test the spring over a period of three months during the winter.\n\nOn March 14th the weather changed and there was indication that very soon the snow would melt and that water would then find its way into the spring from the surface of the ground, thereby interfering with any further accurate test of the capacity of the spring.\n\nThe results of the test are certainly more favourable than we anticipated but we still think that the attached reports are just a trifle optimistic. We have written to Mr. Cornish to secure a final recommendation for this job with an up-to-date estimate of cost in connection with the proposal to pipe the water from the spring into the school.\n\nAlso attached herewith in duplicate is a water analysis of a sample taken at the end of the pumping test when the water table was at a low point. You will note that the water is hard and the total solids are high although perhaps not too high, and iron is present in the proportion of 3.5 parts per million. There is also a remark on the analysis to the effect that the water has a decided odour due to sulphur gas.\n\nEnclos.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nBanff, Alberta.\nApril 9th, 1948.\n\nDear Sir,- Re: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nI have reviewed Mr. Robinson's weekly reports on the pumping tests made at the spring well one and a quarter miles southeast of the Gordon's Indian School, and I am of the opinion that if a reservoir of say 10,000 gallon capacity were constructed at the site of the spring, an intermittent discharge of approximately 10,000 gals per day would be available from this source during the winter months for a drawdown of one (1) foot below depressed water table that would be established after the pipeline was installed and the spring had assumed its level of equilibrium from the heavy drain of pumping that would be necessary during the excavation of the spring reservoir. The opinion is based, primarily, on the pump test made from the 1st of March to the 17th, when operations were closed down.\n\nFor convenience and study of the result of the pumping test I have prepared a chart of the drawdown and water table readings reduced to the assumed elevation established by Mr. Lyons, and used by me in making the preliminary surveys last June. From this Chart, blue-prints of which are attached, it will be noted that during the first twenty-eight days of the test, while pumping at rates of 20, 15, 12 and 10 gals per minute, for a period of approximately seven (7) hours each day, recovery steadily declined, and water table was lowered from elevation 125.21 to elevation 123.16, a lowering of the water table 2.05 feet. Continued pumping during the next fifteen days, at 10 g.p.m., recovery was maintained at this elevation, which would indicate that the spring had reached a point of equilibrium for a discharge of approximately 4200 gals for seven (7) hours pumping for a depressed drawdown of approximately one (1) foot.\n\nOn the recovery chart, blue-print of which is attached, it will be noted that after the pump was cut out on February 8th the recovery was 7/10ths of one foot during the first hour; February 12th was .67 tenths of one foot; February 16th to March 3rd the recovery was slightly over 1/6 tenths of one foot and that, during the last fourteen days of the test was consistent .68 tenths of one foot in one hour. The recovery during the first five minutes after the pump was cut, during the early stages of the test averaged about .275 tenths of a foot, whereas after the discharge was cut to 10 g.p.m. the recovery during the first five minutes was .30 tenths of a foot. This compares very favourably with the test made in June 1947 when recovery was .40 tenths during the first five minutes. The exact time of full recovery was not clocked. However, the extension of the curve shown for March 4th to March 17th would indicate that total recovery to water table elevation 123.16 would probably be reached in six to seven hours after the pump was cut.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIf we assume .......\nIf we assume that static water table was attained during the last fifteen days of the test for a discharge of 10 gals. per minute and a draw down of approximately one foot, it would appear that the spring could be pumped intermittently two times per twenty-four hours at least for a discharge of approximately 7200 gals., and it is possible to install a three or four inch gravity pipeline and a 10,000 gal. storage at the springs from which the school's present daily requirements of 6,000 gals can be drawn, this volume of water could be discharged at the school tank at the rate of 16 or 35 gal. per minute, depending on size of pipe installed, and if the drawdown reached the elevation 122.21 established during the present test, which is slightly over 8 feet above the water level to be maintained at the school tanks.\n\nIf we use a pipeline of 3\" diameter, the 6,000 gals. could be delivered at the school tank in six hours and fifteen minutes, whereas by using a 4\" line this amount of water could be delivered in approximately three hours. The longer periods between the discharge of 6,000 gals at the school would permit of the unused 1200 gals that the area is capable of producing to build up and gradually raise the water table, thus producing a larger storage in the gravel, thereby increasing the inflow to probably 10,000 gals per day during the winter months. Generally most springs are affected by surface precipitation during the summer months and as this was evidenced from last summer's test, it would appear that the spring is capable of supplying the school's present requirement of at least 6,000 gals per day for a drawdown that will not impair the head necessary to transport the water by gravity to the school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nC.

A. KELSO\"\nProv. Analyst.\nTest Procedure: The general procedure was as follows:\n\nA tent and stove were placed at the well, and a 1\u00bd\" London Centrifugal Pump was set up over the well connected to about seven feet of two inch suction pipe and 175 feet of \u00be\" discharge pipe. All the piping was arranged so that it was possible to drain the entire assembly at the end of each day's pumping.\n\nThe water level in the well was recorded before the test began, and this was used as a datum at assumed elevation 135.21. The pump was then operated at from ten (10) to twenty (20) gallons per minute, five to seven hours per day for the test period of six weeks. Detailed figures of each day's discharge have been given in the various weekly reports. Readings were taken of water level each morning, average draw-down, discharge; and recovery of water level for periods up to one hour after the pump was stopped.\n\nDischarge was checked periodically by noting the time taken to fill a forty-five (45) gallon drum; and a graph showing typical rates of recovery is attached.\n\nTemperature and weather readings were also included in the weekly reports.\n\nConclusions:\n\n1. During the test period approximately 235,000 gallons were pumped from the spring, and the static water level was lowered 2.05 feet below datum. This would appear to be sufficient water to serve the school for about two months.\n\n2. In spite of the erratic conditions of pumping at 10 g.p.m., it is felt that a continued flow of at least 10 g.p.m. is available. There was no evidence of recirculation, and as the ground was frozen solidly, all the water pumped must have come from storage in the gravel bed.\n\n3. These tests appear to show that sufficient water is available in the spring to supply from four thousand to six thousand (4,000 to 6,000) gallons per day during the winter season, and hence that the school's present water requirements could be filled from it.\n\nW.

Personally I would recommend the placement of a 4\" main and as a wood stave pipe would be less costly than using either galvanized iron pipe or cast iron pipe, would reduce this cost considerably, and if carefully installed and maintained, would meet the requirements of the proposed low pressure main satisfactorily. Cast iron fittings can be supplied to connect all gate valves, tees and fittings to the wood stave pipe.\n\nI attach a revised estimate of cost and a material list to cover the proposed installation. Excavation quantities have been reduced as advantage of lower ground can be taken to reduce cuts than that on which the traverse line was surveyed. Further if the trenching and grading is done by machine and bulldozer, considerable saving might be effected.\n\nIn view that the water level at the spring reservoir is close to the surface I have indicated on the blue-print attached that the top of the cribbing be covered by flooring and insulated, also that the walls and roof of the housing be insulated, and it is probable that during the winter months provision may be necessary to keep the interior above freezing point. At the commencement of the tests made in February and March it was necessary to cut a hole through 6\" to 8\" of ice before the test could be started and after the close of each day's test about 2\" of ice formed over night. The insulation provided will prevent this to some extent, but in extremely cold weather it may be necessary to assist the insulation provided by using artificial heat to ward off the extreme temperatures.\n\nI attach copies of recent quotations on wood stave pipe, received from the Canadian Wood Pipe and Tank Limited, Vancouver. Also quotations on Galvanized Iron Pipe and B.I.P., also Cast Iron Pipe from Crane Limited, Calgary. These quotations would indicate that 4\" wood stave pipe can be laid down at Punnichy for about $88.00 per 100 ft. with delivery in about four months, and C.I.P., Bell and Spigot at $130.00 per 100 ft. with delivery in six to eight months; 4\" galvanized and black iron pipe would be cheaper than the cast iron, and slightly dearer than the wood stave. However, delivery is indefinite on steel pipe and cast iron would not be available until next fall, in view of which it would appear that necessity leaves us with only one choice, that is - wood stave pipe.\n\nCost installed of wood stave pipe would run $1.10 to $1.20 per foot, whereas cast iron would be about $2.00. Excavation and back-filling has been provided for in the estimate attached hereto. In ordering valves, etcetera provide for type of pipe used.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Division\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJ. H. Mitchell\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFurther to our memorandum of April 26th and in reply to your notation on copy of a memorandum from Indian Affairs, dated April 30th, 1948, we are in receipt of a report from Mr. Mitchell, dated April 27th, duplicate copies of which are attached herewith.\n\nYou will note the recommendation is for the installation of a 4 inch diameter wood stave pipe from the spring to the school. As the water from the spring is mineralized and alkaline, metal pipe would no doubt after installation deteriorate in carrying capacity due to incrustation, so that the effective life of metal pipe might not exceed that of wood stave pipe. Minerals and chemicals in the water should not affect the carrying capacity of the wood stave pipe to any noticeable extent, and as wood stave pipe is cheaper and delivery more definite, its use is recommended. However, it should be borne in mind that any type of pipe will need maintenance to keep it in good condition, and where the available head and quantity of water is so small, leaks which are allowed to develop might interfere seriously with the delivery of water to the school.\n\nIt is quite possible that at the end of a winter, the consumption of water at the school might have to be controlled and rationed so as not to exceed the winter delivery from the spring and this will be especially necessary if leaks develop along the pipe line which are not properly repaired.\n\nYou will note the cost of putting the water into the school is estimated at $24,000.00. This cost does not include any expense necessary for softening the water for the laundry if used for that purpose, nor for chlorination which will be needed.\n\nIt is presumed that present equipment and arrangements for distributing the water within the school, will be continued as heretofore, and the estimate does not include any changes in this equipment that might later be found necessary.\n\nWhether this new source of water will prove satisfactory for the requirements of the school, can only be determined after the system has been installed. Water obtained within a few feet of the surface of the ground is always liable to fluctuations in quantity due to precipitation and lack of precipitation in the immediate vicinity and might also be subject to reduction of flow, if the underground reservoir should be tapped by other users.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nThis latter contingency could perhaps be guarded against on the reserve and prevented.\n\nIf Indian Affairs consider that the cost of this work is justified in order to be able to operate the school, then $30,000.00 should be provided. The cost of the work will depend on the amount of the bid received from the contractor and on the manner in which it is proposed to handle the contract, that is whether on unit cost or cost plus fixed fee basis. There will be some delay before work can start and as prices are advancing it seems wise to figure on an additional cost of $6,000.00 over and above the estimate of Mr. Mitchell.\n\nRecent press reports indicate that very heavy precipitation has taken place on the Prairies this Spring, and it might be that the Water Supply Lake has returned, or has partially returned, to its former level and might now contain sufficient water of a satisfactory quality for domestic purposes at the school.\n\nT.S.

Diesel Electric Plant, as advised you in our letter, we felt it necessary to take this up with the factory. We knew that they would be able to give a complete record on the engine and plant involved.\n\nWe would like to mention at this point that Witte Engine Works is a division of the Oil Well Supply Co., which is a subsidiary of the United States Steel Corp., and is a very highly responsible manufacturing concern. Witte engines are known the world over for their sturdy construction, superior engineering details, and uniformity of excellence in their products.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith copy of a letter just received from Mr. Walter M. Petty, Sales Engineer for Witte Engine Works, which we feel is self-explanatory. The points raised by Mr. Petty are well worth your careful consideration. We feel very much upset over the manner in which the engine is now performing, or rather not performing, and we believe it will be necessary for all of us to insist upon a very careful check-up by competent engineers. Mr. Petty has made a suggestion regarding the foreman of Larson & Richmond and the check-up which he should make. You will also note his comments on the long idle period before starting to which this engine was subject.\nIt should very definitely have been carefully gone over from every angle before being run after such a long lay-up period. Undoubtedly the scoring of the cylinder or the piston rings, if such has occurred was caused by the lack of attention to the lubricating system before starting the engine.\n\nWe particularly note Larson & Richmond foreman's report dated March 30th to Mr. Mayo, the second paragraph, where he said \"upon examination I found the crank case dry of oil and the babbitt on connecting rod entirely burned out\".

You may rest assured that everything will be done to make the entire situation satisfactory to the Department, but we must proceed along certain lines in view of the above statements.\n\nWe can assure you that the Witte engine has such a high reputation that we feel there is something underlying this particular job which requires straightening out. It may be at the factory and it may not. We will communicate with you the moment we have a reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMAINGUYS LIMITED\n\nPresident\nJune 18, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Mayo:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of May 26th regarding the engine for the lighting plant at the Gordon's School I communicated with the firm from whom the engine was purchased.

Ostrander:\n\n\"I wish to remind the Department that nothing has been done about the water at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.

Simonson, of the William George Plumbing Company, asked me to call and see her as she was quite concerned about instructions which she had received from Mr. T.S. Mills, Chief Engineer, Engineering and Construction Division, Department of Mines and Resources, Lands and Development Branch, to the effect that a vertical high pressure boiler will have to be installed at the Gordon's Indian Residential School instead of the horizontal boiler which has been ordered and delivered at the school.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter which Mrs. Simonson has given me dated June 19th, 1948; copy of a letter from Mr. H.O. Grosser, on behalf of the William George Plumbing Company addressed to Mr. A.H. Hargreaves, 393 Nelson Street, Apartment 8, Ottawa; copy of a letter addressed to Mr. Grosser from Mr. T.S. Mills dated June 5th, 1948; and copy of a letter from Mr. Grosser addressed to Mr. Mills dated June 14th, 1948, on the subject of the boiler.\n\nFrom Mrs. Simonson's letter it will be seen that she is in a very difficult position. I do not know whether the letter which Mr. Grosser addressed to Mr. Hargreaves received the attention of Mr. Hargreaves but I am inclined to think that it did not. I am of the opinion that the boiler which was ordered by the late Mr. Simonson and delivered at the school was ordered on specifications given to Mr. Simonson by Mr. Hargreaves as Mr. Simonson was working on a cost plus basis with regard to the equipment, and there seems no reason why he should not have ordered the boiler exactly as specified by Mr. Hargreaves. However, the fact remains that the William George Plumbing Company will be out of business at the end of this month as the licenses expire, and employees of the firm have sought and obtained employment elsewhere, expecting that the Gordon's School contract would be completed by that time. If Mrs. Simonson has to dispose of the boiler which has now been delivered, order a vertical boiler, await its delivery in perhaps six months' time, and endeavour to re-engage men for its installation, it will be very difficult for her.\n\nThe measurements of the boiler room at the school are in the hands of Mr. Mills and I feel sure that it is possible to install the horizontal boiler either as suggested by Mr. Grosser or to the right of the two low pressure boilers and parallel thereto in such a way that the high pressure boiler will be satisfactory if it is found later necessary to use a stoker. I would strongly recommend that Mrs. Simonson be given instructions to immediately install the horizontal boiler in either one of these two places. In this manner the contract would be completed by the time her licenses expire and while she still has the men to do the work. Also the heating and plumbing will be completed by the 1st of September.\n\nIf it is decided to carry out my recommendation Mrs. Simonson should be so instructed by telegram. If the Engineering Branch insist upon the installation of the vertical boiler it will be some months before the contract can be completed and even then, with some difficulty.\nI may say that Mrs. Simonson gave me access to all of her records in this connection and I find that the high pressure boiler was not mentioned in the original contract and there is nothing on the files in the office of the William George Company to show when or how the horizontal boiler was ordered by Mr. Simonson. However, there is information supplied by Mr. McKeel, Manager of Western Supplies, Saskatoon, to the effect that Mr. Simonson called on him personally and placed the order for the boiler from particulars which he had in a small notebook and that Mr. Simonson was very specific in placing the order. The notebook in question cannot be found amongst Mr. Simonson's personal effects.\n\n(Sgd) J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nJune 18, 1948.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from the William George Plumbing Company with reference to a high-pressure boiler for the above.\n\nThis unit was not included in the specifications, but following a further inspection by our officer and the late Mr. Simonson it was felt that the existing boiler should be replaced at the time the missions and mechanical services were being carried out. Consequently Mr. Simonson was requested to submit a proposal to this Division for approval before the installation was made. Unfortunately, his death occurred before this could be done.\n\nMrs. Simonson, as his successor, has undertaken to complete commitments made by her husband, but intends to dispose of the business before the time required for delivery or the boiler elapses, and has accordingly asked to have that item omitted.\n\nIt is felt that by purchasing a boiler through the Department, delivery can be made sooner than the four to six months mentioned by the William George Company in their letter, as already discussed with Col. Neary.\n\nAccordingly it is recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch purchase a high-pressure boiler and have same shipped to the School. As such, it could be arranged to have another Contractor do the job and connect this unit to the piping system which is now being installed under the terms of the specification and drawings governing the work. The estimated cost of this installation is approximately $1,200.00 which can be met from funds already transferred to us for the work.\n\nThe boiler required should meet the following specification:\n\n\"One thirteen Horse Power vertical high-pressure boiler built for 100 lbs. per square inch working pressure, complete with fire and ash doors, grates and grate-bearers, and smoke bonnet.

Delivery has been made of a horizontal unit to install which would alter the lay-out of the furnace room. A vertical boiler, however, ruined, it is claimed, not be obtainable for several months. Meanwhile Mrs. Simonsen has arranged to allow her business licence to expire at the end of June, and the present crew of workers are said to have entered into engagements with other employers.\n\nThe area ABCD is about 4 ft below the area DCEF. It seems that a vertical boiler would have stood at point X. The Principal says that a horizontal boiler could be installed at point Y by cutting away not more than ten feet of the concrete platform on which the pressure tanks and pump rest. These need not be disturbed. It would still be possible to have almost nine feet...\nof clear space between the furnace doors and the boiler in this position. It does, of course, lengthen the pipes connecting with the laundry.\n\nNew Water System:\n\nWork has not started and there is over a mile of ditching and piping to be done.\n\nLater (on train Touchwood to Edmonton)\n\nAfter seeing the furnace room at nearby Muscowekwan School, I see more to commend the change at Gordon's. The horizontal unit at Y would permit a side-mounted, augerless stoker to be installed (as at Muscowekwan) at the right side of the right-hand furnace (i.e., at point X) convenient to the fuel supply.\n\nThe Principal and Sister Superior at Muscowekwan say that their vertical boiler is not now big enough and that the tubes on this type of boiler deteriorate fast at the fire-box end.\n\nLayout at Muscowekwan.\n\nC.A.F.C.\nJune 24, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Mayo:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of May 26th, we wrote the firm from whom the engine for the lighting plant was purchased.

On the other hand, I believe that no work has been done on laying a pipe line to the school from an established source over a mile distant from the school. I am given to understand that delays in installation of this pipe line are due to inability to obtain an assured supply of the necessary pipe.\n\nUntil this pipe line is installed, it is useless to even think of reopening this school as there is no supply near the school of water fit for human consumption. The early completion of the pipeline is therefore of great importance from the standpoint of the education of some 120 Indian children.\n\nI would urge, therefore, that strong representations be made to the Minister of Trade and Commerce to give very high priority to the supply of the pipe necessary to complete this project.

Mayo, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, in connection with the engine supplied to that school, and which has given unsatisfactory service, I have to say that I was at the school when this engine was examined by Mr. Grosser, of Prince Albert.\n\nI note that in the letter of Mr. Walter M. Petty, Sales Engineer of the Witte Engine Works, addressed to Mainguy's Limited, Montreal, he is under the misapprehension that Mr. Grosser is not competent to criticise this installation. I consider Mr. Grosser very competent. He is the head of the firm of Grosser and Sons, of Prince Albert, who are in the business of rebuilding and re-boring engines, and building and repairing machinery of all types. Mr. Grosser is a man of perhaps fifty-five years of age, with a lifetime of training and experience in such matters, and there are few in this province better qualified to pass judgment on an internal combustion engine.\n\nI have had a further discussion with Mr. Grosser and he emphasized the following points:\n\n1. The engine is too small for the work it is expected to do. It is a 12 h.p. and should be 16 h.p., preferably 20 h.p.\n\n2. Being a Diesel type it is too complicated for satisfactory operation by inexperienced staff such as there has always been at the Gordon's School. It is very difficult to start and at times Mr. Mayo has found it almost impossible to start it. Consequently he has fallen back on the old Lister engine to supply power, and it was intended that the Lister engine should be an auxiliary engine and not have to do most of the work, as it has been doing.\n\nIt does not require an expert to know that the lubricating system of the Witte engine has not been satisfactory. Why it is not satisfactory I do not know, but certainly it has given a great deal of trouble. Possibly the excuse made by Mr. Petty that part of the trouble of faulty lubrication may be caused by the engine standing idle for long periods is true. However, when it has been standing idle, this, also, was the fault of the engine as Mr. Mayo had been unable to start it.\n\nAt the time the engine was purchased it was quite difficult to get engines of any kind but they should not be very difficult to get now, and I believe the Department should insist that the company who furnished it assume responsibility for immediately putting it in shape to operate if we are to keep it. However, I would much prefer that it be returned to the company and that company, or some other, be requested to supply a less complicated engine, and of at least 16 h.p.\n\nIf something is not done very soon about the engine the school will be re-opened with only the old Lister fit to use, and that, too, will break down.\n\nJ.P.B.

It\nis evident that your letter was written before the William George Plumbing\nCompany received ours of the 18th instant. A copy of our letter is enclosed\nherewith for your information.\n\nAfter having read the enclosed copy, you should fully realize\nthat the William George Plumbing Company is being fairly dealt with, and\nthat no action taken or contemplated is intended in any way to embarrass or\npenalize them, or to interfere with their arrangements for winding up their\nbusiness affairs.\n\nIt may be added that this Division has endeavoured to carry\nout the necessary extensive mechanical revisions at the Gordon's School in\na manner which is considered to be in the best interest of the institution,\nand that we have received full and satisfactory co-operation from the contractor\nduring the progress of the work.\n\nWhen the William George Plumbing Company have completed their\nwork, it is our intention to have a final inspection carried out by an officer from\nthis Division. You will be notified when this inspection is to be made.\n\nSgd. T.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nPost Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter from Mr. T.S. Mills, Chief Engineer, Lands and Development Services Branch, dated June 28th, 1948, his file I.A. 1580-4, in connection with the horizontal boiler referred to in my letter No. 1149-312-11 AGE, dated June 21st, 1948.\n\nSince writing the letter referred to I have received a letter from Mrs. Simonson on behalf of William George and Company, which reads as follows:\n\n\"In connection with the high-pressure boiler for the above project, I am enclosing a letter received from Mr. Mills. Now the question is what to do with the high-pressure boiler delivered to Punnichy? Waiting your kind attention, we are...\"\n\nThe contract of the William George Plumbing Company is almost completed at the Gordon's School but, of course, a high pressure boiler will not have been installed, and the horizontal boiler in dispute is standing at the school awaiting disposal. When the contract is completed I assume that Mr. Hargreaves will be sent to the Gordon's School for the final inspection. In a conversation with Mr. Grosser, who is Mrs. Simonson's advisor, and who assumed financial responsibility to have the contract completed following the sudden death of Mr. Charles Simonson, he assured me that he had sufficient faith in Mr. Hargreaves' good judgment that he feels Mr. Hargreaves will decide that the horizontal high pressure boiler could be, and should be, installed. Mr. Grosser is firmly of the opinion that there is sufficient room for its installation without interfering with the rest of the plant, and, in his opinion, the horizontal type will be much more satisfactory than will the vertical type boiler which it is contemplated installing some time later. Mr. Grosser gives as his reason for this the fact that the Gordon's School has never had a very satisfactory engineer, and may not have in the future. Mr. Grosser states that the tubes are always covered with rust on the horizontal type boiler, and not with the vertical type boiler; the tubes will give much less trouble and need replacing less often with the horizontal type. He also states replacement of the tubes of the horizontal type boiler will be less difficult than with the vertical type boiler.\n\nI would recommend that the horizontal boiler be left at the school until after Mr. Hargreaves' final inspection and recommendation, and if Mr. Hargreaves recommends installation of the horizontal type boiler it be installed as soon as possible after his inspection, as a high pressure boiler will certainly be needed.\n\nJ.P.E.

One of these is on the Gordon's Reserve at Punichy, Sask.\n\nUnfortunately, the water supply failed at that school a while ago and it now is necessary to lay a 4-inch pipe line between the buildings and a new source of supply somewhat over a mile distant from the school.\n\nSome difficulty is being experienced in locating a contractor who would be prepared to take on the job of laying this pipe in the near future. The situation is of considerable urgency because the school is due to reopen at the beginning of September, but we cannot possibly bring the staff and children back until we have an adequate supply of water for them.\n\nIf you could give me the names and addresses of reliable contractors in Saskatoon who might be interested in this project, it would be much appreciated.\n\nKind regards to yourself and to any other old friends of mine in your office.\n\nSincerely,\n\nG.

You will recall that on June 23rd we submitted to the Departmental Purchasing Agent a requisition covering the purchase of this boiler. In our requisition we quoted exactly from Mr. Mills' memorandum of June 18th which described the specifications of the boiler and also listed the firms from which it could be obtained.\n\nI have just learned that the purchase order was issued on August 10th and that the order has been placed with the Port Arthur Shipping Company. The anticipated delivery date is four to six weeks.\n\nDo you want to wire them yourself or do you think that we should wire them to ascertain if this delivery date can be advanced? I will expect to hear further from you concerning this matter and rest assured that we will do everything possible to help out.\n\nI hope that all goes well with your trip and that things at Elkhorn will permit us to keep the school operating for at least one more year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE: ALLOTMENT: ALLOCATION SYMBOLS:\n\nSHIP TO:\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n|          |            |       |\n\n-2-\n\nDevelopment Services Branch. We would appreciate it if you would give this requisition your immediate attention.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\n\nAPPROVED\n\nNOTE: 1.

Furnish suitable tube brush and rod for cleaning purposes.\n\nSupply the following mountings: steam gauge and siphon, water glass, try cocks, safety valves, blow-off valves and nipple, feed and check valves, injector and piping. The above unit shall be built in accordance with Canadian Interprovincial regulations and a certificate of inspection shall be furnished with the boiler.\n\nNote: The Lands and Development Services who are supervising the repairs and improvements at this school have recommended that the above boiler be secured. The specifications mentioned above were prepared by them and they also suggest that prices and delivery dates be secured from the following firms:\n\nChristie Engineering & Supplies, 147 Hinton Ave., Ottawa\nVulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg, Man.\nPort Arthur Shipbuilding Co., Port Arthur, Ont.\n\nThey further advise that Christie Engineering & Supplies who are representatives of E. Leonard and Sons, state that they are in a position to ship a boiler of the type required within six to eight weeks. The estimated cost of the boiler is $1,200, and this will be paid from funds that we have already transferred to the Lands and\nLands and Development Services Branch\nOttawa, August 12, 1948.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School,\nPlumbing and Heating Repairs.\nWilliam George and Company - Contractors.\n\nWe advised our Director, Mr. R.A. Gibson, by memorandum dated April 24th that we would require $25,000.00 for the fiscal year 1948-49 to complete the above project. In our letter of July 9th we ask for an additional seven to eight thousand dollars, and $7,000.00 was transferred to this Division.\n\nWe now find that $17,500.00 only has been received of the original $25,000.00 allotment, and we would therefore ask that you transfer the $7,500.00 balance to this Division. We summarize as follows for your convenience:\n\n| Original Allotment | 25,000.00 |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| Additional Allotment | 7,000.00 |\n| Funds received to date | 24,500.00 |\n| Balance required | 7,500.00 |\n\n$32,000.00\n\nA detailed report will be furnished as soon as we have the Contractor's final accounts. The cost will exceed the original $33,500.00 estimate by a considerable amount, and we cannot promise that the $32,000.00 allotted for the present fiscal year, plus the $12,539.73 spent during 1947-48, will complete the job.\n\nPresent indications are that the total cost will be a minimum of $45,000.00 to a maximum of $50,000.00, the more likely figure being $47,000.00. P.O. 4781 places the estimated cost at between $33,000.00 and $40,000.00. Section 3, clause (a) of the contract reads as follows:\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\n165 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\"To pay to the Contractor the cost of the work, as defined in schedule \"A\" hereto attached which cost as so defined is herein after referred to as the \"cost of the work\" but unless authorized by the Minister not to exceed the sum of $33,500.00, which sum is herein after referred to as the estimated cost of the work.\"\n\nIt is evident that approval must be secured before we can exceed the $33,500.00 figure. We cannot give exact figures at this time, but \"the cost of the work\" as defined above, apart from the Contractor's fee, will be from $39,000.00 to $43,500.00 maximum. We are presently holding accounts in excess of the contract estimate of $33,500.00 which cannot be released for payment until we have approval covering the increased cost.\n\nIn explanation for the increased cost, we would point to the fact that a repair job cannot be accurately estimated in advance. Necessary replacements often do not become evident until the work gets underway. Heavy expenses, mostly unexpected, were encountered on the project by way of structural changes made which necessitated knocking down concrete partitions, re-bricking etc. This work alone cost $14,470.00, not including the 15% fee. The cost of materials has been on the increase ever since the original estimates were given, and it is not surprising that costs have increased accordingly.\n\nOur Mr. Hargreaves is leaving the end of the week for the West on an inspection tour, and we will give you a detailed report later.\n\nT.S.

Neary,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nI think it would be advisable for you to wire the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. and insist on the earliest possible delivery of the vertical high pressure boiler.\n\nFor your own information we can afford to wait for about a month as the School can not be opened very well before the new water supply system is installed.\n\nI was informed by our Mr. Shaw, before leaving Ottawa, that arrangements were being made to have this work installed as soon as possible. I would imagine that it will take at least a month to complete this phase of the work.\n\nMr. Mayo, the Principal, informs me that the hard frost can be expected before the middle of October and for that reason every effort should be made to accelerate this work. May I suggest that you telephone Mr. Shaw and point out the importance of having the water line installed as quickly as possible.\n\nI arrived here yesterday afternoon and am starting my inspection today. The boiler room looks very good and we have a plant that should prove to be satisfactory and efficient.\n\nThe work at Brandon and Elkhorn has been carried out excellently by the contractor and I have no hesitation in recommending that final payment be made. I expect to spend several days here as there is a lot of checking up to do before I can be sure that all items of the Contract have been carried out.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nArthur Hargreaves.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The painter has estimated that this work can be done\nfor $420.65 which includes material and labour. The work has already been\nstarted before I arrived and the purpose of this letter is to advise you that\nthe sum of $420.65 was not included in the William George Plumbing Company's\ncontract.\n\nAfter discussing the matter with Mr. Mayo we are wondering if this could\nbe charged to ordinary maintenance and repairs.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA.H.

If you concur will you please initial it and\nforward the recommendation to the Deputy Minister for\nconsideration.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nSeptember 16, 1948.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT in the 1947-48 estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, funds were provided for carrying out major repairs and replacements to the plumbing and heating system in the Gordon's Indian Residential School, in the Touchwood Agency, Province of Saskatchewan;\n\nTHAT drawings and specifications were prepared by the Department, and calls for tender were issued, as a result of which only one tender, that of the firm of William George & Company, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, was submitted on the basis of cost plus fifteen percent (15%) for materials and labour. It was recognized that due to the nature of the work, the total cost would not be definitely known until the work got under way;\n\nTHAT Order in Council P.C.4761 dated November 21, 1947, authorized that this work be undertaken at once and carried to completion;\n\nTHAT upon investigation, it was considered to be in the best public interest to accept the tender submitted by William George and Company of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, whose approximate estimate of the cost of the work was Thirty Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($33,500.00) plus a 15% fee;\n\nTHAT as the work progressed, additional essential repair items became necessary which together with increases in the cost of labour and materials, and including the Contractor's fee of fifteen percent (15%), have increased the total cost of the repairs to approximately Fifty Four Thousand Dollars ($54,000.00), which, after making provision for supervision, will involve a total estimated expenditure to the Department of Fifty Five Thousand Dollars ($55,000.00);\n\nTHAT the work is nearing completion at this date and the Department's supervising officer has reported that the work is satisfactory.\nTHE undersigned therefore has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for the payment of the additional cost of said repairs\u2014the total estimated expenditure for the said repairs, including that previously authorized, not to exceed Fifty-Five Thousand ($55,000.00) Dollars, the said additional expenditure to be met from the appropriate vote of the Indian Affairs Branch 1948-49 Estimates (Vote 772, Indian Education), Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nAfter a recent inspection trip through the West, our heating engineer submitted a report on the above, and the following is a summary based on the results of his survey:\n\nFrom a detailed inspection lasting several days, it can be stated that the contractor has carried out the work generally in accordance with the plans and specifications in a competent and satisfactory manner, except that as expected, certain relatively minor items remained to be completed at the time of our officer's visit.\n\nThe work in the boiler room deserves special mention, and in spite of many delays caused by shortages of materials and labour difficulties, no effort was spared to carry out the intent of the plans and specifications.\n\nThe contractors' men had left the job before our officer arrived, but had stated their intention of returning to complete the work following the inspection.\n\nDuring the course of the inspection, the late contractors' wife, Mrs. Alice Simonson and her business advisor Mr. Nelson Grosser, visited the school and conferred with our officer who provided them with a list of items of work which had not been carried out, but which it was agreed were part of the contract. It was clearly established after a careful check-up, that the work which remained to be carried out, had not been charged for. Specifically, the items in question included: the installation of wall, floor and ceiling plates throughout the building; the brazing of the radiators in certain rooms; the painting of equipment piping in the boiler room; the installation of a pressure relief valve on a cold water line to the domestic hot water tank and several additional minor items.\n\nMrs. Simonson agreed to have this work carried out as soon as possible. When this work is completed, it is felt that Indian Superintendent Simpson who was familiarized with the situation, can carry out the final formal inspection and recommend acceptance of the work.\n\nIt has been recommended to the Indian Affairs Branch in a previous memorandum, that the 15 horsepower horizontal high pressure boiler ordered in error by the late contractor, be purchased and used at the Cowessess Indian Residential School. This boiler with its accessories including boiler front, grates etc., is at present on the school property and is not being paid for by the contractor. Col. Neary has advised that a purchase order will be issued and the boiler in question will be moved and set up at the Cowessess Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are also advised by Col. Neary, that a purchase order has been issued to the Fort Arthur Ship Building Company for a new vertical 10 horsepower high pressure boiler to be set up at the Gordon's School. At his request, our officer made tentative arrangements to have another contractor connect this boiler when it arrives at the School. This work will not be carried out by the William George Plumbing Company.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOct Ist 1948.\n\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt; of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI was talking to Mr. Macintosh of Banff over the phone in regard to the laying in of our water supply. They are starting the work next week. He says there is no provision or mention made of putting the water into the barns or farmers cottages which will be passed by the main line. I particularly stressed when the survey was being made that provisions be made to take that into account.\n\nWe cannot handle stock successfully with no water in barns. It means providing a man and tank to haul and then ice cold water which is not good for stock.\n\nThe water line runs between the barns and cottage. The water could be run back in the same ditch from compassion tanks, very little extra digging about 200 ft west to barns and 50 ft east to cottage. I have taken measurements for this and it would take about 1000 ft of piping and I have on hand here that could be used for that purpose 700 ft. It would be a great saving to the Department to do this while the job was in hand than to be doing it later on when the whole distance would have to be again dug for a water supply. I would be very grateful if you would do what you can to ensure us getting the water now.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Simpson, of the Touchwood Agency, also requisition and tender from the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company for a walk-in refrigerator for the Gordon's Indian Residential School, at a cost of $1079.00.\n\nIt is my opinion that the need of a water supply for the Gordon's School is much more urgent than the provision of a walk-in refrigerator. It is quite true that a walk-in refrigerator will be needed when the school is opened. The cost of heating and plumbing at the school has been more than anticipated and we must add to this the cost of installing the water, which is also a large figure.\n\nThis school has operated for many years without a walk-in refrigerator, and with many other inconveniences much more important. These inconveniences will soon be corrected. I would recommend that no action be taken at the present time with regard to the refrigerator, but that provision be made in the Estimates to supply it in the fiscal year 1949-50 if the school has proved, in the meantime, that it is satisfactory in every other way.\n\nJ.P.B Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOctober 14, 1948.\n\nMr. J.B.P.

This work was not to be included in the William George Company contract.\n\nAs a result, a price of $462.18 has been submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch by Messrs Neale Stothard and Chapman, of Brandon, and after due consideration, it is considered that the figure is fair and reasonable for the work involved.\n\nIt is therefore, recommended, that the work be awarded to Messrs Neale Stothard and Chapman.

The laundry stove here is broken and not safe to use for heating flatirons and those of which are here are done for. There is as you know such a lot of laundering to get through in our schools. A flat ironing machine such as I have submitted to you in the list would be a great help to us in cutting down the labour for the laundry matron and girls. If you could obtain approval to purchase one of these I could have it installed at the time they are putting in the high pressure boiler.\n\nYours faithfully:\n\nFred. A. Murray.\nTouchwood Indian Agency,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOctober 19th, 1948\n\nJ.P.B.Ostrander Esq. Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina.\n\nAttached hereto is a letter from Mr. F.A.

Simpson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 5)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter from Superintendent S.H. Simpson, of the Touchwood Agency, copy of a letter which he has received from Mr. Mayo, Acting Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School, and requisition for a 48\" flat work ironer at a cost of $528.00 F.O.B, Winnipeg.\n\nThere is no doubt that an ironing machine is needed at the Gordon's School, or the machine will be needed if they ever complete the installation of the water supply. Mr. Mayo asks that the ironing machine be delivered to the school to be on hand for installation at the same time that the high pressure boiler is installed. Of course this would be advisable, but I must say that at this time I am greatly in doubt that the Gordon's School will be open this winter. I have not seen the dragline which was to arrive at the school last week to commence excavating for the installation of the pipe line. However, I do not think it will be suitable for the excavation in view of the fact that many rocks and boulders of all sizes will no doubt be found in the excavation, and I am afraid that quite a number of the boulders will be too large to handle with the dragline scoop. Winter is nearly upon us, when we will have frozen ground to contend with, as well as the boulders.\n\nAs I understand the Appropriation for school purposes is not too generous, I see no advantage in spending $528.00 on an ironing machine to stand at the school until next summer before it is used. I would recommend that in the event approval is given to the installation of the ironer requested by Mr. Mayo, no order be placed for one until there is a certainty that the school is about to be re-opened.\n\nJ.P.B.

The well is dug and they are building the house to shelter same. They have been at the job three weeks now but there is snow on the ground and a little frost and the engineer here says if it is frozen hard before they are ready to cover pipe he does not think they will risk covering same with frost in the filling. We are in a terrible mess with the snow and dirt around. It is most annoying to think of all the time and good weather we have had and this had to be left so late in making a start. I had thought if they had completed or about completed the work by the end of this month we could arrange to open school by Jan. 1st but it just depends on the next two or three weeks. I will write you again as soon as ever I can see the end in sight.\n\nI have just had word that the men are coming to install the high pressure boiler next week.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nOctober 22, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account amounting to $270.63 covering emergency repairs to the diesel engine at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

Ostrander, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina.\n\nWith reference to my letter 636-G11 of November 10th, pertaining to the construction of the water pipe line at the Gordon Indian Residential School. Mr. Cornish of Banff arrived at the school on Saturday night, and left for Saskatoon on the early morning train today. I was only able to interview him by telephone. He advises that there is a very good chance of completing this work this year, and stated that it all depends on whether or not we have very cold weather. When questioned as to how long it will take to complete the job under favourable conditions, he advised that it was possible to do so in two weeks.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nSHS/ces.\nPunnichy, Sask. November 10th, 1948.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina.\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of this morning, I visited the site of the water pipe line now under construction at the Gordon Indian Residential School. The pipe line is dug and water pipes laid to within 2600 feet of the well which is now dug at the spring, and the well house is under construction. One of the workmen informed me that it is anticipated that water will have to be contended with in carrying the trench to the main water supply. Recent snow and rain and heavy frost has frozen the bottom and sides of the trench, and the loose earth to back fill the trench is now about 3\" under snow.\n\nI contacted Mr. Petefield, Engineer in charge, he is of the opinion that this work cannot be completed until next spring, due to conditions, I have already mentioned, and to having to test the pipe line for 48 hours prior to back filling the trench. He has written to Mr. C.R. Cornish, Inspecting Engineer at Banff, regarding this matter, and has promised to let me have a copy of his reply, which I will submit a copy thereof to you.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nRegina, November 22nd, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIt would appear that there is little hope that the Gordon's Indian Residential School will be ready for use during the present school term.\n\nEnclosed are copies of two letters from Superintendent S.H. Simpson, of the Touchwood Agency, in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nNovember 19, 1948.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Water Supply Extension to Farm Cottage and Barns\n\nReferring to the memorandum from Indian Affairs dated October 7th, 1948, and our memorandum to you of October 15th, we have received a report from Mr. Cornish which indicates that the suggestion of the school Principal to install an extension to the Farm Cottage and Barns from the pressure tank in the school is not possible at the present time due to a lack of sufficient pipe.\n\nHowever, Mr. Cornish recommends an alternative scheme to supply the Farm Cottage and Barns by connecting direct to the new wood pipe and using pipe, pump and other equipment at present on hand at the school. This proposal might involve an outlay of about $1,000.00 including $400.00 for excavation, laying pipe and backfilling the trench by the Contractor at present on the ground at a contract rate for 400 lineal feet or $1.00 per foot.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with Mr. Phelan of Indian Affairs, we understand that the total amount of $1,000.00 for this work is available and it is desirable that the work be done. As the School Principal has agreed to handle all the work necessary beyond the excavation, laying pipe and backfilling of trench for the 400 feet necessary, Mr. Phelan asked that we should arrange with the Contractor for this trench work and submit the bill to Indian Affairs for payment. The rest of the work would also be paid for by Indian Affairs direct and no funds would need to be transferred to this Service.\n\nWill you please advise this Office if we have approval to accept the bid of the Contractor, R.B. McLeod and Company Limited, to excavate, lay pipe and backfill for four hundred feet at a cost of $1.00 per lineal foot.\n\nIt is now getting late in the season and dangerous to open up further trenches for water pipe, but if Indian Affairs desire the work done we recommend this scheme as the only one which could be attempted at this time; payment for all the work to be made direct by Indian Affairs so as not to conflict with the present contract.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

The latter advised that the contractor should be instructed by wire to continue with this work. Will you please let me have a confirmation of these instructions.\n\nWe might say, that we wired the contractor on the 25th instant to retain his equipment on the job and to continue the work.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDirector, Indian Affairs\nFor your attention please.\n\n17/1/49.\nJanuary 18, 1949.\n\nRe: Water Supply-Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn reply to the memorandum from Indian Affairs dated January 6th, 1949, asking for a report on the completion of the water supply system to the above school, the following is submitted.\n\nThe waterline from the spring to the school has been installed and we understand is now in operation. The extension from the main 4\" pipeline to the Farm Cottage and Barns has been installed so far as the work outside the building is concerned, and Extra Account No. 1, in the amount of $443.75, has been forwarded to you for transmission to Indian Affairs for payment. The school principal will handle the remaining inside work in connection with this extension, as arranged and referred to in our memorandum to you of November 19th.\n\nThe main contract with R. B. McLeod and Company, Limited, for the installation of the intake and 4\" wood pipeline to the school has not been completely finished, as due to weather conditions the burning of the brush along the pipe right-of-way was not finished and tidying and cleaning up of the job was not completed. As the completion of the project in these respects cannot be done until Spring, money will be needed in the next fiscal year to make final payment to the Contractor. We understand he is likely to make an additional claim over and above the amount due under the contract for the work already done, which if allowed or partially allowed might have to be met from next year's funds. It is of course possible that some of the additional money needed might be available out of current Indian Affairs funds but it seems very likely that the amount transferred to this Service will be exceeded.\n\nWe are thus not in a position to say definitely at the present time how much money will be needed in the next fiscal year to complete payment to the Contractor, but we will advise you as soon as full information is available.\n\nAs part of the main wood pipeline to the school and the extension to the Farm Cottage and Barns were both installed in severe wintry weather, there is a danger that frost might penetrate to the pipe in sections during the present winter. To guard against leakage to the system Mr. Mayo, the school principal, has been advised by our engineer Mr. Pestfield, to regulate the flow of water by the gate valve outside the cistern at the school and keep water flowing through the main pipe continuously during the winter. If this flow threatens to fill the cistern, a bleeder could be opened on the pressure system while the school is closed and only a small amount of water is being consumed.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nThe caretaker should be advised to continue these arrangements and he should also endeavour to see that water is not allowed to remain motionless for long periods in the extension to the Farm Cottage during the present winter. These precautions should not be necessary after the present winter as the fill material in the pipe trenches will consolidate next summer and afford better protection for the pipes. The sections of pipeline where fill material has been piled up above the old ground level should be checked each year in the Fall, and any erosion should be repaired to ensure proper cover for the pipe during each winter.\n\nThe precautions to be taken this winter to keep water running in the pipelines should not be relaxed until there is no doubt that all frost has emerged from the pipeline.\n\nThe work on the water and heating systems inside the school has been completed. Sufficient heat should be maintained during the winter to protect the radiators and water system within the school.\n\nChief Engineer.\nRegina, January 31st, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Colonel Neary\n\nYou will recall that a horizontal boiler which was ordered by the late Mr. Chris Simonson for use at the Gordon's Indian School was not used as it was recommended by the Department of Public Works Engineer that a vertical boiler would be more suitable because of a lack of space in which to install the boiler.\n\nI received a telephone call today from a Mr. McKee, of Western Supplies, Saskatoon, asking me whether or not our Department have actually taken over this boiler for use at some other point. I have not been personally advised as to the decision of the Department, and had to so inform Mr. McKee. It would appear that Mr. McKee's interest now is in the fact that the lawyers who are endeavouring to settle the estate of the late Mr. Simonson have been informed by Mrs. Simonson that the amount of $932.86 is still owing by our Department on the boiler, and she wished to assign her interest therein to Western Supplies in settling her account with them.\n\nThere has been some considerable correspondence between this office and the Department in connection with the boiler, but, so far as I am aware, no definite decision has been made. I do not know of any place at the present time where the boiler could be used. However, there is no doubt that it might be used at some time in the future at one of our residential schools.\n\nJ.P.B.

McLeod & Company Ltd. for a water supply system in connection with Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan, at an estimated cost of $16,555.65 based on firm unit prices, quantities estimated. Materials purchased as government issued total $7,233.01 to date, and quantities exceed original estimates by a considerable margin, making it necessary to ask for an additional $1500.00 in the current fiscal year. The allotment is now $26,781.38, made up as follows:\n\n| Description                        | Amount   |\n|------------------------------------|----------|\n| Original allotment                 | $25,000.00 |\n| Transferred from Plumbing job      | $1,781.38 |\n| Estimated requirements to March 31, 1949 | $28,281.38 |\n| Additional amount required for 1948-49 season | $1,500.00 |\n\nTo explain the transfer from plumbing job, an amount of $38,000.00 was allotted to the plumbing and heating job under contract to William George & Company. The contract was completed at a cost of $36,218.62 (total cost, 1947-48 expenditures included, was $50,704.74). The two projects, (1) plumbing and heating, (2) water supply, were allotted funds in the same vote-primary-establishment, and in view of the fact that the surplus of $1,781.38 for the plumbing job was needed for the water supply system, we transferred the funds from job to job without affecting the vote-primary-establishment total allotment of $63,000.00. (Plumbing $38,000.00, water supply $25,000.00).\n\nThe water supply system will not be completed by March 31, 1949, and additional funds will be needed in the 1949-50 fiscal season. We will have an estimate of 1949-50 requirements very soon, and you will be kept informed.\n\nT.S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nD.M.

We were hoping that the work would have been completed by the end of March, as we have not included in our 1949-50 appropriation any specific amount for completing the water system.\n\nHowever, if the work cannot be finished before 31st March, 1949, we will have to secure the funds in some manner in order to have the work completed. If you have any comments regarding this report, we would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nPP/ST\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMemorandum\n\nRe Installation of Domestic Water Supply,\nR.B. McLeod and Company Contract,\nGordon's Indian Residential School, Sask.\n\nUnder date of October 18th, 1948, a contract was executed between the Department and R.B. McLeod and Company of Saskatoon, for the installation of a domestic water supply to the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nAuthority for the execution of the contract was obtained under Order in Council P.C. 4221 dated September 22nd, 1948.\n\nAlthough bids were invited from six firms, only one tender was received and this was submitted by R.B. McLeod and Company on the basis of a lump sum price for the intake timber structure and unit prices for the excavation and other items.\n\nThe specifications for Excavation and Backfilling of the Pipe Trench provided that payment would be based on cubic yards of material but the pay quantities would be figured for a trench only two feet wide irrespective of the width actually excavated. This provision was considered necessary as it was impossible to know beforehand what width of trench would be excavated by the particular machine available to the successful bidder and generally at least a two-foot width of trench was considered necessary. R.B. McLeod and Company bid on the work under these conditions and their bid was accepted.\n\nDuring the course of the work, it was discovered that much hardpan and many boulders were excavated in the trench which were not expected by the engineer, and a trenching machine excavating a trench three feet wide was necessary and was used by the Contractor.\n\nA demand for special consideration has been made by the Contractor and our Resident Engineer, Mr. Pestfield, has recommended, with the support of Mr. Comish, that the Contractor be allowed yardage for his trenchwork, based on a three-foot wide trench which was actually excavated and to ignore the specifications which limited the figuring of the trench quantities to a width of two feet.\n\nDue to the fact that the work was more difficult than expected and also due to the fact that it was necessary to work under adverse conditions, this recommendation is concurred in. The Contractor made a genuine effort to do this job as we require it to be done under a unit price contract, and was the only contractor who would accept such a contract.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe cost of the three-foot wide trench will be $10,677.60 (6,673.5 cu.yds. at $1.60), as compared with $7,118.40 (4,449.0 cu.yds. at $1.60) figured on the basis of a two-foot wide trench. Allowing the Contractor payment on the basis of a three-foot wide trench (actually excavated) will thus increase the cost by $3,559.20.\n\nWe understand from Col. Neary of Indian Affairs that this extra payment could be made for this fiscal year from present Indian Affairs funds, but would require a Treasury Board transfer.\n\nAs the burning of brush along the pipeline right-of-way and the tidying up of the excavation was not completed by the Contractor, due to difficulties caused by the adverse weather, it will be necessary to have back $100.00 from the Contractor this fiscal year, and this sum will have to be provided in the Supplementary Estimates of Indian Affairs for 1949-50, plus $100.00 for other expenses, or a total of $1100.00 to ensure that the work will be completed.\n\nKindly advise if we have approval to disregard the specifications for the trench excavation and to pay for the material actually excavated, which will result in an additional payment to the Contractor of $3,559.20. As a Treasury Board transfer is involved and a further Order in Council will probably be required, we should be pleased to receive this approval as soon as possible so that the extra payment can be made from current funds.\n\nChief Engineer.\n1.

I have been trying this past two years to get the Department to take action about our lighting plant at Gordon's School. The Witte Engine is of no use as it is broken down and when I have had it fixed it only runs a little while before something goes again, and if alright it will not carry the load we have.\n\nThe \"sister engine also is too light to carry our load and has given me a lot of trouble does not run long before something goes and then there is the trouble delay and expense of getting repairs. There was quite a sum spent on it a month or two ago and we have had several minor expenses and now it is gone again and I have to get more repairs and expense besides being without light and power while these repairs are in hand.\n\nI shall be going back to Gordon's next month and am anxious to get the school in shape for taking the children again. Thanking you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFred A. May\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMarch 24, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. T.

B. McLeod and Company Limited of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, was accepted for the installation of a Domestic Water Supply System for the Gordon's Indian Residential School near Punnichy, Saskatchewan, in the amount of $19,153.99, and a contract on the basis of unit prices and a lump sum was executed;\n\nThat due to the nature of the material encountered, it was necessary to excavate a three foot wide trench, which increased the estimated excavation;\n\nThat the total cost of carrying out the above work including contingencies and engineering supervision will now approximate Twenty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($27,500).\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to pay the additional cost of the work amounting to approximately $3,346.01, chargeable to Vote 772, Education, Indian Affairs Branch, in the Supplementary Estimates for 1948-49.\n\nSgd. N. A. Robertson,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School,\nFunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn reply to your marginal notation of the 5th instant appearing on Major MacKay's memorandum to you of April 2nd in connection with the lighting plant at the above school, we make the following comments:\n\nIn 1946 the Indian Affairs Branch purchased a new Witte Lighting Plant which it is reported, has been giving considerable trouble. Considerable repairs have been made on the engine since its installation, and it is further reported that even when the prime mover is operating satisfactorily, the unit is not of sufficient electrical capacity to handle the loads imposed on it.\n\nThis Division was verbally requested by Colonel Neary to express an opinion on this unit before the purchase was made, and he was advised that an investigation of the electrical situation would be necessary before we could make any comments. We discussed the question of capacity by telephone with Mr. Ferrie, an officer of the M.O.C., whom we were informed, was well acquainted with the requirements at the school, and he assured us that the proposed unit was sufficiently large to handle the electrical loads at the school. We were not requested to investigate the electrical situation at the school and did not, therefore, take any further action in this matter.\n\nWe do not have any information on our file regarding the electrical situation at the school with the exception of copies of correspondence between the Indian Affairs Branch, the Saskatchewan Regional Supervisor of the Indian Agencies, and the Suppliers of the Witte generating unit purchased.\n\nBefore we can make any recommendations, it will be necessary to have complete data on the electrical requirements, and to this end we have requested Mr. W.W. Ferrie, who left Ottawa for the West on April 11th, to make an inspection and submit a report. Mr. Ferrie advised that he expects to be able to carry out his work in the very near future, and upon receipt of his report, Indian Affairs Branch will be further advised.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 6)\nOttawa, April 19, 1949.\n\nThe Deputy Minister\n\nInstallation of Domestic Water Supply,\nR.B. McLeod and Company, Contractor,\nRe - Gordon's Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nUnder date of April 13th Mr. Jackson addressed\na query to Major MacKay as to the necessity for the increased\ncost in connection with the above contract. I am quoting\nfrom a report from our Engineer as follows -\n\n\"Although bids were invited from six firms,\nonly one tender was received and this was submitted by R.B.\nMcLeod and Company on the basis of a lump sum price for the\nintake timber structure and unit prices for the excavation\nand other items.\n\n\"The specifications for Excavation and Back-\nfilling of the Pipe Trench provided that payment would be\nbased on cubic yards of material but the pay quantities would\nbe figured for a trench only two feet wide irrespective of the\nwidth actually excavated. This provision was considered\nnecessary as it was impossible to know beforehand what width of\ntrench would be excavated by the particular machine available\nto the successful bidder and generally at least, a two-foot\nwidth of trench was considered necessary. R.B. McLeod and\nCompany bid on the work under these conditions and their bid\nwas accepted.\n\n\"During the course of the work, it was discover-\ned that much hardpan and many boulders were excavated in the\ntrench which were not expected by the engineer, and a trenching\nmachine excavating a trench three feet wide was necessary and\nwas used by the Contractor.\"\nDue to the fact that the work was more difficult than expected and also due to the fact that it was necessary to work under adverse conditions, this recommendation is concurred in. The Contractor made a genuine effort to do this job as we require it to be done under a unit price contract, and was the only contractor who would accept such a contract.\n\nThis will, I think, cover the information desired.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\nApril 25, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Mayo:\n\nLighting Plant.\n\nYou will recall previous correspondence concerning the lighting plant at your school. As you are aware, this plant was purchased at the request of Mr. Forward of the M.S.C.C., and it was presumed at that time that it would be sufficiently large to handle the lighting of the school.\n\nThe Lands and Development Services Branch have today advised that Mr. W.W. Perrie, one of their engineers will visit this school in the near future and submit a report as to electrical requirements there. When this has been done, we can prepare a requisition for the new Diesel engine required.\n\nThe white machine will be available as a spare replacement for other residential schools in Saskatchewan. Mr. Ostrander will, no doubt, write to you directly as to what he wishes done with it.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. F.A.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Gordon's School\n\nThe following letter was received today from Mr. Mayo of Gordon's:\n\n\"In reply to your letter of April 6th re coal for next winter. While in Winnipeg I was talking to Mr. Davis Regional Inspector. He said if Elkhorn was closed this summer there was a stoker there that would be pulled out and would do for Gordon's. Could you discuss this with The Indian Affairs branch and see if they would sanction that or if they intend to install the stokers as was talked about last year. I would need to have this information before ordering our fuel supply.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if the stoker and necessary equipment could be transferred and set up at Gordon's as Mr. Mayo suggests.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) Henry C.

We would also like to have an estimate of the cost of installing the stoker at Gordon's in the event of it being shipped to that school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Perrie will be here shortly to advise on what we need. As I have to be away at times for half a day and sometime a whole day, would it be possible for you to ask Mr Perrie to drop me word when he would be likely be here I would not like to be away when he comes.

He reports that, to date, the contractor has not returned to fill in the ditches properly. You know they were only partially refilled last autumn because of the snows. Children are moving into the School first of July and it will be dangerous to leave these ditches in their present condition.\n\nMr. Mayo also reports that the water is of fine quality but quite hard and mineral. If the taps are unused for a day rust colored water backs up in the pipes and takes quite a time to run off. If water is left standing in dishes or pans a scum of rust forms at the waterline and stains. Mr. Ostrander has requested Mr. Mayo to get an estimate on a water softener and the information has now been given into Mr. Ostrander's hands.\n\nIt would be appreciated if some action could be taken in relation to the two above-mentioned matters.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G.

In our talks yesterday you figured that the equipment at Gordon's was in fair shape and that therefore the equipment here would not needed there. It now appears that it would be wise to have the laundry equipment taken from Elkhorn to Gordon's. With an expected pupilage of 150 pupils we do not want to run the risk of having a break-down in the laundry department as Colonel Neary told me before leaving Ottawa that any equipment at Elkhorn which we needed in one of our schools could be moved. I ask that this be done. We are quite prepared to use the School truck for the moving job but wish your OK before taking the equipment out.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook.\nColonel B. F.

Children are moving into the school first of July and it will be dangerous to leave these ditches in their present condition.\n\nMr. Mayo also reports that the water is of fine quality but quite hard and mineral. If the taps are unused for a day rust coloured water backs up in the pipes and takes quite a time to run off. If water is left standing in dishes or pans a scum of rust forms at the waterline and stains. Mr. Ostrander has requested Mr. Mayo to get an estimate on a water softener and the information has now been given into Mr. Ostrander's hands.\n\nIt would be appreciated if some action could be taken in relation to the two above-mentioned matters.\"\n\n......2\nYou will note that it is important to have the ditches properly filled in as soon as possible as children will be moving into the school on July 1st.\n\nIf you consider that it will be necessary to install a water softener, we would appreciate it if you would let us have details regarding the type of softener required, so that purchase can be made through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Domestic Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School\n\nReferring to your notation on copy of a memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs dated June 10th, 1949, we note that the water at the school is quite hard and contains iron.

There was a $1000.00 holdback on the R.B. McLeod and Company Limited Claim No. 3 dated March 31, 1949, to ensure that the brush would be burned and the excavation tidied up during the early summer months. You no doubt had the $1100.00 in your supplementary estimates, and since supplementary estimates were not presented we presume a transfer of funds will be necessary.\n\nPresent indications are that $1500.00, instead of $1100.00, will be required as follows:\n\n1 - Holdback $1000.00\n2 - Engineering Expenses 100.00\n3 - Contingencies 400.00\n\nTotal $1500.00.\n\nThe item for contingencies, $400.00, should be the maximum. The exact amount will not be known until we have Mr. W.W. Perrie's report, and if the transfer of funds to the Engineering and Construction Division does not entail a submission to Treasury Board, we suggest that an encumbrance for $1100.00 only be forwarded, to be followed later on by transfer of whatever additional amount, up to $400.00, may be required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

(RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nInspection of the electrical system at the above school was made on June 9, 1946, and the following is submitted for your information and consideration:\n\nThe population of the school, including pupils and staff is normally about 160, accommodated in the School Building, Principal's Residence and Foreman's Residence. The buildings, together with the Barn, Cow Barn, Piggery, Machine Shop, Chicken House and Inns are lighted and serviced from a generating plant located in the School Building.\n\nThe generator room is at present equipped with the following engines and dynamos:\n1 - Witte Diesel Electric Plant, Generator and Switch,\n1 - Lister Engine Dynamo, semi-diesel,\n1 - Wisconsin Gas Engine and Motor (for laundry power).\n\nThe Witte Dieselelectric Plant details are as follows:\n\nEngine - No. Gaddis, Model WD, 12 H.P., Speed 720,\nBore 5\", Stroke 6\".\nGenerator - No. 79282A, K.H., Amps 73, D.C., Volts 115,\nR.F.A.M. 1800, Type 1213, No. D.C.\nSwitch - Serial No. 54-8385, Model No. 612, Size\n8000 W., Volts 110, Type D.C.\n\nThe Witte Plant was installed in 1946, but it has been out of commission for some time. The pistons in the engine are reported to be scored and the whole unit requires a general overhaul.\n\nThe Lister Plant, which is generating the power at the present time, is very much overloaded. The details relative to this plant are as follows:\n\nLister Engine Semi-Diesel\nPlant No. 3007 L.H., R.F.A.M. 75,\nDynamo No. 100 54150 R.F.A.M. 600, Volts 110,\nAmps 66.5, 14 H.P.\n\nLister Engine\nNo. 200 5a 150, Volts 110, Amps 66.5 R.F.A.M. 600.\n\nThis unit was installed about 1939 and is reported to have been overhauled about two years ago. The engine head is said to be warped and the engine is now leaking oil badly. A general overhaul is apparently required. The performance of the unit has been unsatisfactory for some time, due to the overload being carried, and the overhaul will have to be complete.\n\nThe above unit is connected with 54 batteries, each battery of 2 volts. Originally there were 56 batteries but two were broken (blow up). All batteries have a small amount of sediment in the bottom of each jar; the terminal posts are in bad shape and should be fitted with new nuts and the spacers are warped in about half the jars.\n\nThe engine runs about 10 hours per day in the winter months.\n\n... to page 2 please ...\nThe fuel supply system consists of two 20 gallon tanks outside the building, but these tanks have not been in use for some time. Fuel is carried into the generating room in small drums and supplied to the engines from small hand containers.\n\nThe Wisconsin Engine and Motor, is a 3 H.P., unit, air-cooled, type A.F.M., size 350H, No. 141956, run by gasoline.\n\nThe unit was used some time ago for power in the laundry room, the laundry room equipment being operated from a line shaft which extended into the generating room. This system of operation has now been discontinued and the laundry room equipment is operated by small meters (electric) which are connected to the various appliances. These meters are as follows:\n\n1 - 3 H.P. on line shaft\n1 - 1/2 H.P. for ironer\n1 - 1/8 H.P. for pump\n\nThe Wisconsin Engine and Motor is now only used as a stand-by and can be used for that purpose.\n\nAdditional meters are in use, or required as follows:\n\nMotors in Boiler Room:\nPatriot Pumping Pump, 2 H.P., 16.8 Amps, Speed 1750 R.P.M., 115 volts, Serial No. 132156. This unit pumps from the gravity supply tank, 10'x10'x10', outside of the building, to two 500 gallon tanks located in the boiler room.\n\nLeland Dega Motor for pumping from heating system return.\nFrame No. 54, 1100 V, 1.5 H.P., 115 Volts, 1250 R.P.M., 6.8 Amps.\n\nBurton Vacuum Pump, Size VNS, Serial No. 025683, Float Control.\n\nRequired:\n1 - 1 H.P. Motor for use with Cream Separator\n1 - 1/2 H.P. Motor and pump for use in Foreman's Residence.\n\nIt is also proposed to install a walk-in refrigerator room in the school basement and the necessary power will have to be provided for this purpose.\n\nThe lighting arrangements, wiring and location of lighting panels are generally as shown on the wiring plans. Lighting cabinets or panels are located in the School Building as follows: One in basement containing six switches; two on ground floor with five and three switches respectively; two on first floor each with five switches. All switches are in good condition, with the exception of those in panel No. 2 on the first floor, where the push buttons are loose and should be repaired.\n\nThe wiring in the School Building and Principal's Residence is, as near as can be determined, all in good condition, but that in the barns and other out buildings will have to be replaced either wholly or in part.\n\n... to page 3 please ...\nThe total light demands are as follows:\n\n| Location                  | Watts |\n|---------------------------|-------|\n| School Building, basement | 3520  |\n| School Building, ground floor | 4820 |\n| School Building, first floor | 2960 |\n| School Building, second floor | 960  |\n| Principal's Residence     | 160   |\n| Foreman's Residence       | 160   |\n| Horse Barn                | 200   |\n| Cow Barn                  | 80    |\n| Pigery                    | 200   |\n| **Total**                 | **13160** |\n\nIn addition to the above the principal requests that alarm bells and lights be installed at each fire escape exit. Lights are also needed in the Chicken House and Brooder \u2014 2 40-watt and 1 60-watt respectively.\n\nWith appliances that might be used, the total lighting requirements if all lights were in operation at the same time may be estimated at 14,000 watts and the various meters require a total of 8 H.P.\n\nIt is evident from the above that neither the 6 K.W. \"Mitter\" unit or the 7.5 K.W. \"Lister\" unit has the capacity to meet the needs of the school, although one of them might serve as a stand-by unit when properly overhauled. It is impossible to furnish an estimate covering the cost of overhauling either unit at present as each would have to be torn down before any satisfactory estimate could be obtained.\n\nWhen dealing with the supply of electrical energy at this school consideration may be given to each of the following:\n\n(1) The replacement of one of the present D.C. units with a new one of larger capacity, and the use of the other as a stand-by unit. I have been unable to obtain any definite figures as to the cost of such a new unit together with batteries etc., but no doubt your electrical expert will have at his disposal the information necessary to compile such an estimate. The cost would no doubt be at least equal to that mentioned in (3) below.\n\n(2) The construction of a transmission line to connect the school with the transmission line of the Saskatchewan Power Commission at Pumicito, a distance of 6.5 miles and the purchase of power from the Commission. Arrangements to this end could doubtless be made, but as the school would be the only user of the line to be constructed, the Power Commission would not be too keen about the project. The cost of constructing the necessary transmission line is estimated at $3200.00 to $3400.00 per mile, with an additional $400.00 to $600.00 expenditure for transformers, etc., at the outlet end. This would require an expenditure of approximately $9,000.00 to bring the power to the school, with no provision for stand-by service in the event of a breakdown at the plant of the Power Commission. As suggested under (1) one of the present units (preferably the \"Lister\") could be repaired and used for emergencies.\n\n... to page 4 please ...\nThe installation of an alternating current plant, a 3 phase, 60 cycle, 10 kw continuous, 110/220 volt diesel electric plant would take care of the requirements of the school for some years to come and can currently be obtained at a cost of $8,572.00 f.o.b., Regina, Sask. The necessary synchronizing cabinet for use with such a plant is currently priced at $1,040.00 f.o.b., Regina, with an additional $60.00 for the switch between the generator and distribution system. The cost of rewiring the present meters for alternating current would amount to approximately $250.00. The cost of replacing the present generating plant with the 10 kw, diesel-electric transportation and installation charges, should therefore not exceed $9,862.00. The \"labor\" plant could be used as a stand-by with the motor reversed or changed to AC current.\n\nRegardless of which of the above alternatives is decided upon there will have to be provision for an expenditure of approximately $600.00 to cover the replacement of poles in the lines from school to out buildings, new wiring on sections of the lines and inside the buildings and the provision of the new meters required.\n\nK. R. Purdy,\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 6)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nMr. W.W. Perrie, Supervising Engineer, Engineering and Construction Division, visited the Gordon's Indian Residential School recently to report on the electrical system. As his report went direct to Mr. Charles H. Buck, I am enclosing a copy of it herewith for the information of our Branch.\n\nI am also enclosing a requisition covering suggestion No. 3 in Mr. Perrie's report, being a 1 phase, 60 cycle, 18 K.W. continuous 110/120 volt diesel electric plant and other incidentals in connection with the installation of the same.\n\nAs the time is near for re-opening of the Gordon's School, and the electrical system cannot be operated without the immediate supply of either the motor suggested and shown in the requisition, or connection with the power line, I would recommend that immediate action be taken toward the purchase of the motor.\n\nWhile connection with the power line, at a cost of probably $9,000.00 would ultimately be much more convenient, we would still have to have an auxiliary unit because of power failures from time to time. If we eventually decide to connect with the power line, the power unit now being requested would serve as an auxiliary unit.\n\nJ.P.B.

Another major reason for delaying purchase is the uncertainty of the electrical power at Gordon's, which at the present time is 110 Volts, D.C., but Mr. Perrie of the Survey and Engineering Branch has recommended a 60 cycle, A.C. plant be installed.

Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOTTAWA, July 29th, 1949.\n\nRe: Water Supply and Drainage - Gordon's Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have received a report from Mr. Perrie in which he states that the work remaining to be done in connection with the water supply consists of a small amount of back-filling and the cleaning up of debris around the project. He states that this work can be done at any time, and there is no real danger to the children of the school while the trench is in its present condition.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a further report from Mr. Perrie, in regard to drainage in the vicinity of the Piggery and the Cow Barn as follows:\n\n\"When making an inspection at this school recently Mr. Fred Mayo, Acting Principal, advised me that on the occasion of any heavy rains water ran freely over the floors in the Piggery and Cow Barn. From inspection of the elevations shown on the enclosed plan you will note that the area South of these two buildings slopes rapidly to the North and it is therefore natural that the drainage from this area will flood the floors in these two buildings.\n\nIt would be a simple matter to remedy this situation by grading the driveway around the buildings as indicated on the plan, as the ditch on the south side of the driveway would intercept the water and cause same to drain to the West away from the buildings.\n\nThe cost of this work would be very little if there was any equipment such as a Blade Grader in the vicinity of the school, but it would cost a good deal to bring in a grader to do this little job. Mr. R.B. McLeod, Saskatoon, who still has some work to do in connection with the water supply at this school, has discussed the possibility of proceeding with this work within the next week or ten days and it is quite likely that the equipment that he will be using to complete his contract will be a small bulldozer. This unit would not be the ideal type of equipment to use for grading the driveway but it would serve the purpose and it is therefore recommended that...\n\nR.A.

Mr. Mayo points out that fences have to be replaced and the yards levelled before the incoming of children to School.\n\nIt would be appreciated if some action could be taken regarding the above mentioned items as both are vitally important to the reopening of the School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nElb for me steam ironer\ncheck on size etc.\n\nL & D\nfilling in 1\ndetah\nMr J P B Ostrander  \nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies  \n304 Post Office Building  \nREGINA Saskatchewan  \n\nRE INGERS GORDON RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL NON ORDERING ENGINE FOR LIGHTING PLANT BASED ON SPECIFICATIONS PREPARED BY ENGINEER -STEP- PRESSURE CAN ORDER STEAM ENGINE REQUESTED MR MAYO AND PROVIDING DETAILS ELECTRICITY UPON SPECIFICATIONS ENGINEERS -\n\nBernard F Henry  \nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n\nCONFIRMATION\n\nPhoned to: ......\nPhoned by: ......\nTime: .....\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nDEGREE OF PRIORITY\n\nTIME OF ORIGIN\n\nSIGNED\n\nCOPY 3\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOTTAWA August 11, 1949.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School, Funnichy, Sask.\n\nIn reply to your marginal notation of the 27th ultimo appearing on Mr. T.R. MacInnes' memorandum to you dated July 22nd last in connection with the above you are advised as follows:\n\nWe have studied Mr. Perrie's report of the electrical installation and are of the opinion, in view of the existing power situation, that a storage battery type of installation is most suited to the needs of the school.\n\nWe prepared a specification for a new generating unit and forwarded same by hand to Col. Neary on August 5th to expedite the receipt of tenders. Copy of our specification is attached hereto.\n\nThe type of equipment specified is such that the storage battery supplies only a small percentage of the total plant capacity and during heavy load periods the generating set automatically starts and supplies the load demand directly, when the load drops below this predetermined level, at which the engine cuts-in, the unit shuts down automatically and the battery handles the load independent of the generator until such time as the load demand exceeds this set value. The present battery apparently is capable of further use with repairs carried out as suggested by Mr. Perrie, particularly with the type of generating unit specified.\n\nIn addition to a new generating unit, Mr. Perrie outlined electrical work necessary in several outbuildings and to the distribution system. It is considered advisable to provide a fuel oil storage tank to replace the present system whereby fuel is provided to the diesel engine in small hand containers.\n\nWe have written Mr. Perrie requesting him to obtain prices for providing a storage tank and fittings and for having the necessary electrical work done at the school.\n\nThis information should be available in the near future and upon receipt, the Indian Affairs Branch will be further advised.\n\nChas.

The engine shall have a capacity of approximately 35 H.P. at 900 R.P.M. and shall be water cooled using pump and radiator with pusher type fan. It shall be mounted on a common cast iron base with and connected to an 18 KW. 115 Volt direct current generator. The unit will be operated in parallel with a 110 Volt bank of storage batteries and shall be so arranged that the generating set will automatically start when the load demand equals 15% of the plant capacity and shall automatically stop when the load drops below this value. The battery will then handle the light load demands, receiving charge during plant operation.\n\nProvide separately mounted control panel containing battery and line ammeters, voltmeter, field rheostat and necessary relays and control apparatus. Provide automatic shutdown devices to stop the plant on low oil pressure, high water temperature and continued cranking on failure to start.\n\nThe unit shall be shielded to prevent radio interference. Provide 20 feet of exhaust pipe, muffler and all necessary fittings.\n\nSupply detailed instructions covering the operation and maintenance of the equipment. The supplier shall provide supervision for the installation of the equipment which shall be fully tested and left in first class operating condition.\nRE SIGNAL AUGUST SIXTEENTH IRONER FOR OORDONS SCHOOL STOP\nRECOMMEND PURCHASE OF STEAM IRONER AS SOON AS SPECIFICATIONS\nOF ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT ARE KNOWN SO ELECTRIC MOTOR ON\nIRONER WILL OPERATE SATISFATORILY=\nJ P B OSTRANDER..\nAugust 18, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

We were advised by the Purchasing Agent this afternoon that his recommendation has been placed before the Minister, and as soon as his approval is obtained, the order will be wired to the firm.\n\nThey promise three weeks delivery. Probably this means that the machine will reach the school by the end of September.\n\nWe have informed Canon Cook of the M.S.C.C. along the same lines as we are advising you, and I am under the impression that Canon Cook has notified the Principal of the Gordon's School that the school should not be re-opened until early in October.\n\nBernard F.

and\n(b) either such chief engineer or a shift engineer who holds a certificate entitling him to operate such boiler or steam plant as shift engineer is in immediate charge thereof and the chief engineer, shift engineer or some other person acting under the direct supervision of the chief engineer or shift engineer is in personal attendance on the boiler at all times, whether or not any such boiler is equipped with automatic control.\n\n(2) Subject to subsection (3), no owner shall cause or permit any low pressure boiler or steam plant having a capacity of twenty horse power or more to be operated unless a person who holds a certificate entitling him to operate such boiler or steam plant is responsible for the operation thereof and in personal attendance thereon at all times.\n\n(3) A low pressure boiler having a capacity of not more than seventy-five horse power which is equipped with an automatic low-water cut-out device approved by an inspector and designed to shut off the fuel fire in the event of low water, may be left unattended and in operation for a period not exceeding ten consecutive hours if:\n(a) the safety valve is set to relieve at not more than fifteen pounds to the square inch;\n(b) the safety valve and automatic low-water cut-out device are tested daily to ensure their efficient operation;\n(c) the automatic low-water cut-out device is installed in such manner that it cannot be rendered inoperative by the manipulation of any manual control or regulating apparatus and the water column, water glass and the float chamber of the cut-out device may be thoroughly blown out each day.\n\nSection 27 Every owner of a boiler, pressure vessel or plant shall provide and keep at all times in a readily accessible location an adequately equipped first aid kit for the treatment of minor injuries and shall produce such first aid kit upon demand of an inspector.\n\nOur inspectors report that in some instances owners are employing persons to operate boilers who do not hold certificates issued under the Act and we sincerely hope that after receipt of this notice such violations will be corrected making further action unnecessary.\n\nYour full co-operation in respect to all the requirements of the Act is solicited in the interests of public safety and will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCHIEF INSPECTOR\nPROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOUR - STEAM BOILERS, ELEVATORS & FACTORIES BRANCH\n\nNormal School Building\n\nRegina, September 12, 1949\n\nRE: Inspection of Two - 2 Pass Boilers Record Nos. 19588 and 19589\n\n1 Vertical Boiler Record No. 19590\n\nLocated in the Gordon Indian School - Punnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nOwned by Gordon Indian School - Punnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nInspected September 9, 1949 by Inspector J.

Punnichy, Sask., Delivery approximately 3 weeks..................$5,083.00\n\n(b) Medland Machinery Ltd., Winnipeg, Manitoba, F.O.B. Punnichy, Sask., Delivery 4 to 6 months..........................$4,554.00\n\n(c) Eastern Canada Engines Ltd., Montreal, Quebec, F.O.B.

Punnichy, Sask., Delivery 5% to 70 days............................$7,311.00\n\n(e) Russel-Hipwell Engines Ltd., Owen Sound, Ontario, F.O.B. Owen Sound with freight prepaid to Punnichy, Sask., Delivery 3 weeks.................................$4,430.00\n\nThe lowest tender received was that of Russel-Hipwell Engines Ltd, whose quotation was in the amount of $4,430.00 F.O.B. Owen Sound with freight prepaid to Punnichy Saskatchewan. In our opinion, the tender submitted by this firm is the most favourable of the five bids received, and we recommend that the order be awarded to Russel-Hipwell Ltd. Our recommendation was made verbally to the Indian Affairs Branch on September 2nd in an endeavour to expedite delivery of the equipment which is apparently urgently needed.\n\nThis firm stated in their tender that very little in the way of installation would be necessary at the site, but that if it thought necessary, a representative of the firm can be made available for this service and they anticipate that a man from Saskatchewan could be sent for this purpose.\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThis arrangement can be made on the basis of $25.00 per man day plus living and travelling expenses. We are of the opinion that the Indian Affairs Branch should arrange for such a representative to be on hand to supervise the installation, test and leave the unit in perfect operating condition.\n\nIt is our intention to have Mr. W.W. Perrie make arrangements for placing of the equipment in a suitable location and also to provide for fuel oil storage, reference our memorandum of August 11th. We will contact Russel-Ripwell Engines Ltd., and obtain necessary shop drawings and foundation details of the unit so that Mr. Perrie can proceed with this work. In the event that new foundations are required which might delay the final installation and testing, we would ask that the Indian Affairs Branch contact the above firm as soon as possible, if they concur in having a representative of the firm supervise the installation, and advise us who this representative will be, so that Mr. Perrie can contact him and make final arrangements for the installation.\n\nWe are returning by messenger, the tenders received from the Purchasing Agent as requested.\n\nV.G.

I understand that the man appointed would be from Saskatchewan, and that charge for his services would be on the basis of $25.00 per man day plus living and travelling expenses.\n\nWe are not certain yet if it will be necessary to avail of this offer, but we would like to know the name and address of the man whom you would send in the event of our requiring him, so that we can notify our representative in Saskatchewan to get in touch with your representative if the latter's services are still necessary.

Unfortunately, I cannot give you his address at the present time, but I will be able to send this along to you shortly.\n\nWith regard to the actual installation of the unit, I can perhaps outline roughly to you what is involved. You have already received an installation drawing of the unit, our drawing number CD-2911. The usual practice is to install these units on a block of concrete, and for this particular unit we would recommend a block approximately two feet deep, five feet long, and three feet wide. This block should be made of reinforced concrete, and at least 18\" of the block should be below the normal ground level. In some instances, these units have been installed on heavy timbers which are firmly embedded in the ground, but this practice is not to be recommended if a concrete block can be used. The generating set is complete in itself insofar as the engine and generator are concerned, and it is only necessary to connect the engine starting batteries and the fuel oil supply line in order to start the unit.\n\nA fuel supply system will be required, and in this case the usual practice is\nto have an underground storage tank for the main fuel supply and a day tank installed in the engine room. A pipe line is connected between the day tank and main storage tank, and a transfer pump, usually hand operated, is installed in this line. The day tank should have sufficient capacity for about at least two days continuous operation, and the engine attendant should pump this day tank full every morning. This day tank is connected to the fuel inlet on the engine. Depending upon the length of oil lines, they can be made of either copper tubing or 3/8\" black iron pipe. If necessary, a plumber, with ordinary plumber's tools, can install the fuel tanks and fuel lines. The day tank should be installed above the level of the fuel inlet into the engine so that there is always a gravity feed of fuel to the engine.\n\nA plumber could also install the exhaust silencer and exhaust piping. The main thing to watch here is to avoid any possible bends in the exhaust line, and to keep it as straight as possible.\n\nWith regard to the actual location of the engine installation, it should be located in a well ventilated room with sufficient clearance all around the unit to permit access to it for servicing and repairs. A clear area in front of the radiator should be allowed to permit free circulation of the cooling air through the radiator.\n\nThe generator control panel is being supplied for wall mounting. It will be complete, including all meters, internal wiring, and generator field rheostat, and will also include the automatic remote starting panel, and the reverse current relay. It will be necessary to supply the main leads between the generator and the panel, and the panel and batteries, together with the smaller leads from the automatic engine control panel to the actuating relay and the engine. Wiring diagrams will be furnished, showing all these connections, and I believe that provincial regulations usually require that this type of work be done by a licensed electrician. There is nothing particularly complicated about it, and a competent electrician could take care of it quite readily.\n\nI trust that the above outline will give you some idea as to what to expect, and if there is any particular detail on which you would like further information, please let me know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRUSSEL-HIPWELL ENGINES LIMITED,\n\nBGMacLeod/laf\n\nAssistant Engineering Manager.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 3rd, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

However, the school has been extensively renovated and will begin to receive pupils on September 1st, and we feel that an ironer should be supplied.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only. The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nDirector\n\n(1) Group requisitions for equipment, supplies, and material according to commodity, i.e. books, stationary, printing, electrical goods, hardware, machinery, provisions, transportation equipment, etc.\n(2) Avoid issuing requisitions for one item only, except in cases of emergent necessity.\n(3) Furnish exact details of product required.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Nixon, Acting Superintendent, Touchwood Agency, in connection with these three items:\n\n(e) The Principal's residence was vacant all winter two years ago which resulted in considerable damage to the plaster. When Luthi's were doing some work there this fall, they estimated approximately a thousand dollars to repair and re-decorate the walls.\n\nThe children's playground was damaged considerably last fall because the pipe-line that brought water from the spring to the school was laid right across this playground. A trench nine feet deep was dug to bury this pipe and when filled in left the ground very rough and will need considerable levelling. Five hundred dollars was included in Mr. Mayo's Estimates for this work and item (h) graveling driveway and front drive. This may be more than needed as there is already some gravel on the driveway, but more will be needed.\"\n\nI would recommend approval of items (e) and (g) as they are necessary. Regarding item (h), in my opinion very little is needed to improve the driveway to the school. As stated by Mr. Nixon there is already some gravel on this driveway, but it would be improved somewhat by adding a small additional amount of gravel. I do not see why the school should not be expected to take care of this from school funds.\n\nJ.P.B.

We would advise that we expect to be able to make shipment of this generating set on Thursday, October 20th. This unit will go forward via Canadian National Freight prepaid.\n\nIn connection with having a serviceman available to check the installation and initially start this unit, we would advise that we would be able to supply a man from our Fort Arthur branch to inspect and start this unit. As outlined previously, the charge for his services would be $25.00 per day plus living and travelling expenses. If his services are required we would ask that you please let us know some days in advance of the time that you require him to be in Punnichy. This will enable us to arrange to have a man available, and to allow sufficient time for him to travel to Punnichy. We would suggest that if you require this man, you advise us in Owen Sound and we will in turn get in touch with our Port Arthur branch and see that a man is sent.\n\nWe trust that this will be satisfactory, but if there are any further details or information which we could supply please feel free to call on us. In connection with the installation of this unit, if it is possible, it might save you somewhat in the actual service charge if this unit is completely installed with all fuel lines etc., hooked up, ready to start, so that it will only be necessary for the serviceman to inspect the installation and start the engine.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRUSSEL-HIPWELL ENGINES LIMITED,\n\nSales Department.\n\nRAKiff/1af\n\nENGINEERING AND SERVICE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT EASTERN CANADA\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 20th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

Gibson, Esq., Director.\n\nRe: Water Supply - Gordon's Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe following has been received from Mr. Perrie under date of December 6th, and is forwarded for the information of Indian Affairs:\n\n\"I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 25th with attached letter from W.J. Westaway Company Limited relative to the water supply at the above school, and I have to advise that I am quite in accord with your suggestion that it might be wise to withhold action on the proposal to soften water at the school until after the school is in operation with a full complement of pupils and staff and a steady water consumption is being maintained.\n\nIt is true that, although the analysis covering the various samples of water taken at this school during the past two years show quite a variation in the nature of the water, all seem to indicate that it requires some treatment to make it entirely satisfactory for use in the school heating plant and for laundry purposes, and were it not for the high sulphate value of the water it would seem that the ordinary type of water softener would be all that is required at the school. To remove the sulphates would, as indicated in a letter from W.J. Westaway Company Limited, be too expensive an operation for this particular application and it is a question whether ordinary softening would take care of the problem.\n\nThe water level in the well has, since the well was cleaned out, never risen to anything like the level of last spring, and possibly, as you suggest in your letter, the spring thaws and rain, which will no doubt again raise the level of water in the well, will have an effect on the quality of the water and an analysis next spring may indicate somewhat different properties than would those taken previously. Some immediate steps should, however, be taken to have a hypochlorinator installed and the water treated at the present time.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6310, file 654-5, part 6)\nWith reference to the purchase of a hypochlorinator we have received quotations and are now considering which particular type we shall recommend for purchase.\n\nWe are taking the necessary steps to close out the contract for this water supply and as soon as we know definitely the additional money needed to make the final payment to the contractor and purchase the hypochlorinator we shall advise you so that a transfer of funds can be arranged.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief.\n18431\n\nREGINA DEC. 13\n\nP.

This invoice covers the purchase by your Department of a diesel generator set, which was shipped to a school in Saskatchewan.\n\nWe also notice that the price charged by us includes both duty and Sales Tax.\n\nFrom our experience in such matters, we believe that this unit (which has been ruled of a class or kind not made in Canada under Customs file 4043-3 dated February 13, 1940) can be correctly entered free of Customs duties under Tariff item 696. This tariff classification if allowed, would also exempt the unit from Sales Tax.\n\nThere may be some ruling with which we are not familiar which may suspend these exemptions between Government Departments, but in view of the very substantial saving possible, and which would be passed on to your Department, we suggest you take this matter up with the Customs Department.\n\nIf they rule that Tariff item 696 is applicable, please send us a copy of the ruling, and we will issue a credit note to refund the duty and sales tax immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRUSSEL-HIPWELL ENGINES LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nLRCornett/laf\ncc: Col.

Vincent,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen checking our records we have examined our Sales Invoice No. 8402 dated October 21, 1949. This invoice covers the purchase by your Department of a diesel generator set, which was shipped to a school in Saskatchewan.\n\nWe also notice that the price charged by us includes both duty and Sales Tax.\n\nFrom our experience in such matters, we believe that this unit (which has been ruled of a class or kind not made in Canada under Custom file 4043-3 dated February 13, 1940) can be correctly entered free of Customs duties under Tariff item 696. This tariff classification if allowed, would also exempt the unit from Sales Tax.\n\nThere may be some ruling with which we are not familiar which may suspend these exemptions between Government Departments, but in view of the very substantial saving possible, and which would be passed on to your Department, we suggest you take this matter up with the Customs Department.\n\nIf they rule that Tariff item 696 is applicable, please send us a copy of the ruling, and we will issue a credit note to refund the duty and sales tax immediately.\n\nYours very truly\n\nRUSSEL-HIPWELL ENGINES LIMITED,\n\n(sgd) L.R.

The linoleum is not yet here, and the water supply system has not been completed. The ash hoist has not yet arrived on the job. I have called Shoquist several times on the phone and have received assurances that this stuff is on the way etc., etc., but nothing has arrived yet. I am about ready to give them so many days to have this material on the job or consider that we will have it supplied through other sources.\n\nI must admit that from a financial point of view I have never had to deal with a more unsatisfactory firm of contractors. I have repeated letters, wires, and phone calls from various supply houses asking that I protect them and see that they get their money. I have notified Shoquist that before any further money is certified in their favour they must supply me with a clearance from all sub-contractors and supply houses connected with this job.\n\nGenerally the work is in much the same condition as at my last report; except that the painters have gone ahead and are now waiting to make the final touches. The slate blackboards have not arrived.\n\nWe had some two hundred panes of glass broken during a severe hail storm a week ago; see enclosed photographs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\n[Handwritten note: Poor.

Except for the laying of the linoleum which has been going on for the last week, practically nothing has been done for over a month. At the present moment there is no ash hoist on the job; this could easily have been in place two months ago. There is no sign of the slate blackboards; there is no jacket heater in the boiler room; and no effort appears to be going on to get the pump and motor on the job for the water supply. The pulleys for the laundry machinery are not on, and the water tanks and filtration plant have not been left in a good condition. Pulley and push plates have not been put on the kalsomein iron doors to stair well, and thresholds to doors are not down. The plastering left the arch in front hall in such shape that the wood columns cannot be put up square. This is all apart from the dozen and one little things such as white washing the boiler room, fixing broken plaster, touching up painting etc., etc., that are to be done. The electrician has not yet finished.\n\nThe Department expected that this school would be ready to open the first of this month, and cannot understand the delay. I must point out to you now that if this work is not done within the next week it will be necessary to have it done by others and charged to your final payment.\n\nI would like to point out at this time that I must have a clearance from your sub-contractors and supply people before a final certificate can be issued to you, also a statement from the Workmen's Compensation Board that you are clear with them on this job. I do not hesitate to say that your methods of financing on this job have been far from satisfactory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy.\nAug. 16th, 1930.\n\nJ.D.

Report No. 17.\n\nThis job is now ready to hand over, but for the water pump and motor, and the ash hoist. There seems to have been some mistake on the latter in taking measurements and I am informed that it may be two weeks yet before installation is completed. The pump has been giving some trouble and in view of the fact that they took a dead mouse and one or two other things from the supply pipe I gave orders to clean out the supply well at the lake edge. The lake is very low this year and the filtration of water to the well is not very rapid. We may find it necessary to dig down and carry the original rough gravel filter out further to the water.\n\nThe machinery is now in running order, and the final cleaning up by plasterer and painter has been done, but I am not taking over on behalf of the Department until the ash hoist and pump are properly installed, although the Rev. Mr. Stanford has arranged with the contractors to use one of the classrooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOttawa,\nSept. 6, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Wage Claims - Indian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI spoke to you today by telephone regarding a telegram that we have received from our Western Fair Wages Officer relative to complaints that carpenters employed on the Indian School in Punnichy, Sask., have not received the rate of wages to which they are entitled under the terms of contract. Our officer has not had an opportunity of investigating these claims as yet but suggests that in the meantime payment should be withheld of the final estimate to the Contractors until such time as the matter can be looked into.

This would be dug into a hill and lined with boards, and would have a pole roof covered with brush, straw and earth, and of course the necessary ventilators, etc. I find that I can build a place of this nature for from $225.00 to $250.00, and no doubt it would last at least four or five years.\n\nI should be glad to have the Department's authority immediately to go on with this work, as it is absolutely essential, and I do not suppose the Church authorities have any money to build it themselves.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe. Gordon's Indian School. Report No. 18.\n\nAs intimated in my last report we have run into some trouble on the water supply to the school. After cleaning out the well at the lake shore it was found that the water did not rise very quickly, and would not rise to the level of the lake surface. Upon investigation we found that the water level of the lake was down some four feet from its level of a year or so ago, and down below where the water could get into the gravel and stone around the well. It was necessary to immediately dig a trench to continue the original trench from the well to the lake. This I ordered done, and have had it filled with boulders and gravel, and have also had the forty foot culvert cleaned out and replaced in this trench out into the lake.\n\nIn order that you may have a better idea of this I enclose three photographs showing the work in progress.\n\nNow that the water is again running to well there will be about eight feet of water in same. The last two years have been very dry up here and all bodies of water are at a very low point.\n\nI have had the foreman keep careful time of the this work, and have checked up carefully myself.\n\nThe school is now completed except for the ash hoist, and the electric motor for the water pump, this latter being run temporarily by a gas engine.

Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy. Report No.\n\nOn Wednesday I took over the school from the contractors although the ash hoist is yet to be put in. This it is expected will be on the job in a week or ten days. While testing out the fixtures and drains we found that the septic tank was not functioning, so I had cleaned and put in good condition. We now have everything in running order and the contractors away. The Rev. Principal is using the school as much as he possible can without furnishings, and he has a man putting steam on and generally looking after the machinery.\n\nI have gone over the numerous items of extras and deductions and under separate cover I am sending final certificate, with the request that the sum of $300.00 be withheld until the ash hoist is on the job.\n\nWith the final certificate I am sending the guarantee from the contractor, and a signed clearance from all sub-contractors and supply people who were connected with the job. I have done this because of the large amount of trouble I have had over the financing of the work by Shoquist Bros.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nShoquist Bros.\nGeneral Contractors & Builders\nOFFICE PHONE 4675\n\nDUCHESS STREET\nSASKATOON, SASK.\n\nSeptember 29, 1930.\n\nWm.

This I have done because so many of these firms have written phoned or wired me during the progress of the work stating that they were dissatisfied with the amounts they were being paid by the general contractors.\n\nThe guarantee of the Contractors as called for is also enclosed.\n\nThe school is now in use as far as it can be with the limited amount of furniture they have, but there is one item i.e., the ash hoist which is not yet installed owing to delay in shipping the right one. This is expected on the job at any time, and as soon as it is there the contractors will send a man to install it. In the meantime I thought that an amount of say $300.00 might be withheld or the cheque for the final payment might be sent to Shoquist Bros. care of me; to be held until hoist is actually in the building.\n\nDocuments enclosed:\n\nTwo copies of final certificate.\n\" \" \" Extras & Deductions.\nContractors' Guarantee.\nClearance from Dominion Bridge Co.,\n\" \" \" Dominion Bronze & Iron Ltd.,\n\" \" \" Manitoba Bridge & Iron Wks.,\n\" \" \" North American Lmbr. & Supply,\n\" \" \" W.J.

The matter was a stoppage in the 4\" drain from the toilets in basement of the south wing and has now been cleared. The main house drain was not stopped and the other toilets and baths in the building were in constant use. I am of the opinion that the school should be provided with a steel cleaning cable for such cases as this. With a competent man in charge of the machinery and plant a few minutes as soon as a thing like this occurs would put the matter right.\n\nI am glad to report that the ash hoist is now in, and the motor for the pump is being installed in place of the engine.\n\nI have had the Lister people send a man up and go over the lighting plant with me, and am now satisfied that it is in good running order.

Mr. Waddy tells me that there is not a house on the reserve that is in such a filthy condition as is this one. The walls are black, and boards have been nailed across the plaster with the result that it is badly broken. The floors are so thick with dirt that it can be scraped off with a hoe. The paint is off the windows and the varnish off the woodwork, and as I say, the place is not in a fit condition for anyone to occupy.\n\nI would ask for your authority to spend between $250.00 and $300.00 to put this residence in shape. In the meantime the new Principal and his family are occupying three rooms in the school building that cannot conveniently be spared.\n\nI am of the opinion that with a lay Principal in charge we may expect a great change in the management of this institution. The man who is going in seems to be clean-cut and aggressive. There is a great deal to be done at the Gordon School to straighten matters out after four years of incompetent management.\n\nI should like to have your authority for this expenditure by wire and I can send a man out from here to do the work, as I do not think we can get a local man. I have given the Principal's wife permission to select the paper that will be used on the walls.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

The place was in bad shape and it was necessary that these repairs be done, nothing but necessary work was carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ninstructed by you, and have asked the four companies designated by you to submit tenders.

The septic tank is complete except for the stripping of the inside forming, and this we intend to have done by Thursday next. In order to take advantage of the good weather I had the contractors put the men on to the pit for pump over the new well as soon as they had the septic tank completed, with the result that this pit is now excavated and the concrete floor in, and the trench for pipe from pit to pump house has been dug. The forming for walls is in and concrete will be poured next week.\n\nThe Lister men have the plant assembled and in place, and yesterday had it running for a time. As soon as the electrician can get the main line run and the bulbs in the fixtures, which I expect will be by Thursday next, a test will be made under full load.\n\nThe Kelvinator engineer has installed the cold storage plant and will be back on the job for a test just as soon as we can give him power.\n\nThe plumbing fixtures are all installed and can be in operation as soon as the water system is in. This I understand will be a couple or three weeks yet, as I had word from the Dominion Bridge Co. last Tuesday that they had just got the plans of the pressure tank approved by the Sask. Boiler Inspector.\n\nI have not heard from the Dominion Water Power Dept., as to what make of pump and motor they intend to have installed and when the machinery is to be here. I am assuming that in the matter of the placing of pressure tank and connecting up etc., you wish me to have the contractors do this as soon as possible.\n\nDuring the past few days the painter has been able to work outside, and I am hoping that another two weeks will see him through, and the original contract complete with the exception of outside grading, which cannot be done until Spring.\n\nUp to the present I have had no instructions from you as to the laundry machinery you intend to install, or how you wish to have the work done. I have arranged for the contractors to install a metal clad door in wall of old building where we connect up with the passage.\n\nI have prepared details of the interior fixtures as instructed.\n\n1.\n| DATE | ARTICLES                                      | Follo | Quantity | Amount |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|-------|----------|--------|\n|      | 27 43 pieces Mariner glass                   |       |          | 73 10  |\n|      | 27 1 brads 3/4\" Brad                        |       |          | 35     |\n|      | 29 3 caps partly 45' 2 1/2\" partly 20        |       |          | 65     |\n|      | 29 5 lbs putty 30 dark stain 35\u00b0             |       |          | 4 70   |\n|      | Sand paper                                   |       |          | 25     |\n|      | Jan 2 Varnish stain returned                 |       |          | 1 90   |\n|      | 2 4 sheets glass DD 12x4 x 21 1/4            |       |          | 5 60   |\n|      | 5' 2 DD                                      |       |          | 2 80   |\n|      | 5' 10 lbs putty                              |       |          | 1 00   |\n|      | 8' 1/8 B8 Sheets 4x4 1/2 screws              |       |          | 1 35   |\n|      | 10 screws 10 3\" nails                       |       |          | 2 00   |\n|      | 9 Varnish stain                             |       |          | 65     |\n|      | 19 1 door set                                |       |          | 1 75   |\n|      | 21 Safaglue                                  |       |          | 65     |\n|      | 20 Liquid Veneer 30 Glue 65                  |       |          | 95     |\n|      | 20 3\" nails 50 2 1/2 nails 50 2 nails         |       |          | 2 00   |\n|      | 27 Cupboard catch                            |       |          | 25     |\n|      | 29 Dark Stain 65 nails 20                     |       |          | 85     |\n|      | Feb 1 hickory 20 hinges                      |       |          | 60     |\n\nTotal: $97 70\nHEAD OFFICE 720 ROYAL BANK BLDG.\nWINNIPEG - MANITOBA\n\nNORTH AMERICAN LUMBER & SUPPLY CO., LTD.\nOPERATING RETAIL LUMBER YARDS\n\nSOLD TO Indian Agency\nFor Gordon School\n\nJan. 5\n4.

It will only be a short time before the power line will pass this institution, in fact it is being constructed now, and when this is done the lighting and power system that we have installed can be abandoned and used elsewhere. There were about 68 children in attendance, and the Principal says he is going to get 100. This remains to be seen however.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK. Feb. 7th, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Scott:-\n\nI beg to inform you that I have just returned from making a visit to the Touchwood Agency, and the two residential schools, Gordon's and Muscowequan. My visit was of short duration, but I was able to go into a number of matters.\n\nAt the Gordon School I found the work almost completed, although there are still some things to be done. The workmanship on the building seems to be first-class. The school is now under the management of Mr. Frayling and he is receiving a great deal of co-operation from Mr. Waddy. At the time of my visit there were 97 children in the school, and in a few weeks time this number will be increased to 120 if not more, according to reports I have received.\n\nThere are one or two matters in connection with the Gordon School which I think should receive your attention. I would point out that the drainage from the school to the sewage disposal is in very bad shape and the sewage is backing up over the basement floors. When I was there a quarter of the room was covered with back water and fetid matter, and the stench was unbearable. I am told that it was the duty of the contractor to put this drainage system in first-class shape. I later met Mr. Swan and told him what I had found. As Mr. Swan has been handling the business of the Department I thought he was the proper officer to speak to regarding matters of this kind.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have secured for this institution a high class Engineer, which is something we should have in all our schools, a man capable of making repairs and keeping the machinery the way it should be kept. The school is paying a good salary to this man and no doubt will get good results. Since Mr. Frayling, the new Principal, who is a layman, has taken charge he has not had much chance to show what he can do, as he has been handicapped by not having the right kind of a staff. At the time of my visit he was short a Matron, a cook, and a couple more female members of staff. Whether he will be fortunate in securing the right type of people to fill these positions in the near future I do not know. He has advertised for them.\n\nMr. Frayling drew my attention to the oven, which has been the subject of considerable correspondence, pointing out that the requirements of the school were from 100 to 125 loaves of bread per day, and with an oven of the size which he is to receive it would be necessary to bake every day, including Sundays, and sometimes twice a day. I think he is correct in this, as I checked the matter up closely with the adjoining school, Muscowequan, where there are 65 pupils, and possibly a total of 85 including the staff. At this school they had an oven which is practically of the same capacity as you propose sending to the Gordon school, where they will have from 135 to 140 to feed when the school is filled. This oven was discarded at Muscowequan because it was not sufficiently large to take care of the requirements of this school where they have a pupilage of 65. I have since had installed at this school, as you know, an oven which can provide for the baking of two sacks of flour at a time, and in discussing this matter with the baker at the school she informed me that she bakes from seven to eight sacks of flour a week. This seems a large amount but she assured me it was the quantity used. Every child in the school gets rid of a pound loaf a day, this being the case you will see at once the situation at Gordon's. As the oven you propose sending there has only a capacity of 72 loaves it is quite unsuitable and should not be installed. It seems to me that this is a matter that could well have been left to officers in the field who are doing the actual work and understand exactly what is required. If the Department insist on supplying this type of oven we might as well have installed the one which was discarded at the Muscowequan School.\nAnother matter which was brought to my attention was the fact that the large outdoor cistern that we built in connection with the school that was burned down is intact, but there is no way of getting the water out of the cistern and through the house. This should have been attended to when the contractors were on the ground. I should be glad if you would have it attended to.\n\nI am sorry to report that some of the furniture which was bought for the school is absolutely unsuitable. There is an extension table in the dining room, which was bought from the T. Eaton Company. This table is very light and already has a sag in the middle, and they have it braced up with a wooden beam. However, I found that there was a dining room table in the basement, which had been made; this can be used and there was no necessity for buying the light extension table from Eaton's.\n\nMy attention was also drawn to the fact that a lot of the cupboards which were made and delivered are not necessary. I do not know what was ordered, but I saw six cupboards which had been built for books scattered here and there throughout the building and they are trying to use them for clothes cupboards. I asked why these were not being used for the purpose for which they were built and was told they were not required. I also found two other cupboards which were of no use. One had been set up and the other was going to be taken out to the storehouse. These cupboards had all been made on the recommendation of Mr. Stanford, Before we even started to furnish the school I wrote and asked the Department not to act on Mr. Stanford's recommendations. Had this been adhered to we would have saved hundreds of dollars.\n\nMight I suggest that when orders for drugs are received they be very carefully scrutinized. I found the new drug room at the Gordon School filled up with drugs, some in sufficient quantity to last for ten years, a most disorderly mass of stuff unpacked and scattered around, as it could not all be packed on the shelves. I have a copy of the drug invoice before me, -and I note-\nand I note that the following quantities of drugs were supplied:\n\n10 lbs. Carbolized Vaseline\n5 lbs. Zinc Ointment\n5 lbs. Mercury Ointment\n10 lbs. Petroleum Vaseline\n50 lbs. Absorbent Cotton\n500 yards Gauze\n10 lbs. Sulphate Magnesie\n2 gross Ointment Tins\n1 dozen hot water bottles\n500 Pill Boxes\n\nand many other articles where I think the quantities could have been cut in half. A few years ago at nearly every Agency I visited there were stacks of drugs piled up, because the quantities asked for were too large, and the result was that many of them were valueless. At a school of this kind where I understand we are expected to economize in every way it would have been advisable I think to have reduced this drug order by one half.

Will you kindly examine this drainage system and submit to the Department a report with your recommendations. I would also ask you for a report as to the advisability of providing a means of obtaining water from the outside cistern which was built in connection with the school that was burned.\n\nIt has also been reported that a lot of the cupboards which were made and delivered to this school are not required. If this is the case kindly submit a list of the cupboards, etc., that are not being used in order that arrangements can be made to have them shipped to the Sascoquain School, and the items deducted from the list of equipment there before the order is placed.\n\nI will be glad to have this information at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The positive wire that runs from the panel to the front chapel lights are grounded to the conduit of the same run, causing a short circuit. Loom service used for entrance to barns and outlying buildings. Wires run down the side walls of the barns without any protection from hay or straw that might be piled against them. Building has not got a separate distribution panel for each floor.\n\nThe following changes are required to meet the approval of the Saskatchewan Power Commission:\n\nInstall branch cut-outs in \"E\" box where wires change in size. Run two new wires from panel to front Chapel lights. Install conduit service to outlying buildings and ground conduits of same. Board in wires on walls of barns so that wires are protected from hay, straw, and mechanical injury.\n\nMr. Swan informs me that the cost of the above work will be $90.00 and I shall be glad to receive authority to have it done while the electricians are there as it will cost a great deal more to send them back again. The above changes will make the installation safe and efficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nFeb. 17, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the additional work required in connection with the electric lighting system at the Gordon's School in order to conform to the requirements of the Canadian Electrical Code, I beg to say that you may arrange to have this work done.\n\nIn the specifications for this building, Paragraph 2, Page 52, it was provided that the work was to be done in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Canadian Fire Underwriters Association and the Rules and Regulations covering such work in the Province of Saskatchewan. It would therefore appear that the cost of making the changes mentioned in your letter should be paid for by the contractor.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\n\nW. M.

MacKenzie Esq.,\nsecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe. Gordon Indian School.\n\nI am at a loss to know where you could have had a report that a lot of the cupboards made for the above school have not been used. There is one set of book shelves 10' x 7' with adjustable shelves which was for the principal's living room, but which has not been put in place as the new principal, Mr. Frayling, has nothing like the number of books that the Rev. Stanford had; and therefore did not want to have the shelves put up. They are at present in K.D. form at the school. There were a number of changes made in placing some of the fixtures as naturally the new Principal did not have exactly the same ideas as the old Principal.\n\nThe matter of the connection to the rainwater tank was one of several things that the late Principal had agreed to have done. Nothing was specified for it, and in view of the fact that Mr. Stanford had asked for quite a number of extras in other ways he agreed to take care of this item. The tank is underground right outside of the laundry wall and it will merely be a matter of using a small hand pump in the laundry, with the pipe running down through the floor and into the tank.\n\nMight I be permitted to say that a rather difficult situation arises when a new principal is appointed just as a new school has been handed over to the old principal; so many of the little things which were made to conform to his ideas do not meet with the approval of the new man, who knowing nothing of the specifications wants to know why this or that is not provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian School.\n\nIn replying to yours of the 12th inst., received this morning, I beg to say that the matter of the drains has had my attention, and I would like to quote from my last letter to the contractors at Saskatoon a few days ago: \"It must be clearly understood that the Department do not consider the drains in good condition if it is necessary to be pushing cleaning rods through them every other day to keep them in action. This has occurred so often since the school was taken over that I am convinced part of the drain is not up to standard. Should this trouble occur again I must ask you to see that some definite action is taken to remedy the condition.\" This backing up takes place on the run of 4\" pipe from the lavatories in the Girls' Recreation Room.\n\nOwing to the fact that the ruins of the old school stood for a year before building operations were commenced I was very particular about the use of the existing drains, and cautioned the plumbing foreman, who was a first rate plumber, to see that everything was in good condition; pointing out that his firm had to guarantee the finished job, and anything neglected at that time could be the source of much trouble afterwards. It is possible that there is a partial stoppage in the line which causes material to accumulate every so often. I can only suggest that if the trouble occurs again the drain be taken up and relaid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have today been reading a report from the Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School, in which he states that since the last report the cottage has been painted, and though not finished in a very workmanlike manner it is clean and habitable.\n\nIn your telegram to me dated December 15th, you informed me that Dunn and Ward, of Semans, Sask., were to be employed to supply materials and perform labor on the repairs to the Principal's residence at the Gordon School. I was given no option in this matter, and did not have the opportunity of ascertaining whether these men were good workmen or not. In the first place there is only Mr. Ward, Mr. Dunn having left the firm. They do not carry materials, so they would have to go and buy them at probably a greater cost than I would have to pay for them, and it turns out that they are not even good workmen. It seems unfair to spend money without ascertaining whether the men employed are competent or not. As I have pointed out before, I think when we start our building program we should have something to say about who should be employed. I have no doubt that representations were made to the Department that Messrs. Dunn & Ward were capable of handling this work, judging from your telegram to me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to Department No. 121-1-15 of the 17th instant and my letter of the 13th idem, in connection with the wiring system at Gordon's School, I see that I did not quite properly set out the situation there. The requirements of the Saskatchewan Power Commission are now being complied with by the contractor without expense to the Department, but there are certain safeguards to be adopted in connection with the old wiring in the barns and it is to these that my letter should have applied. The contractor, when on the ground, making the necessary changes in the school itself, will also fulfil the requirements of the Commission in regard to the wiring in the barns, and it is this latter item which will entail an expenditure of approximately $90.00. I have instructed Mr. Swan to see that the regulations of the Power Commission are properly and carefully followed, and in due course, the covering vouchers for the additional work will be forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nKindly inform me if cheque has been issued in payment of Touchwood Agency voucher No. 515 in favor of Messrs Ward & Dunn, Semans, Sask. for work done at the Gordon's School. I had a telephone call from Mr. Ward this morning stating that the cheque had not been received.\n\nThe voucher was forwarded to Ottawa on January 22.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nRe Voucher No. 515 in favour of Ward & Dunn\n\nIn reply to your inquiry regarding payment of your account, I beg to say that owing to the condition of unemployment throughout the country and other causes, the Appropriations placed at the disposal of the Department for relief, hospitals and medical attendance are exhausted, and until a further supply is obtained no further payments can be made.\n\nI beg to assure you that all proper claims against the Department will be settled at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA,\nSask.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nFeb. 24th 1931.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nFurther to my letter of Feb. 26th, re the drains at Gordon School, I have now a letter from the contractors enclosing a report from Messrs. Beaton & Brady Ltd., the plumbers who installed the drainage, and who recently had a man on the job. In view of the fact that I have told these people that should the trouble recur again I shall ask them to take up that section of drain, I am here quoting their report in full:\n\n\"Shoquist Bros.,\nSaskatoon.\n\nDear Sirs; Acting on your complaint of Feb. 6th, re letter of Mr. Swan's of the 24th inst., we sent a man down to the School at Punnichy to investigate. We found the following; That the drain to Girl's Toilet was plugged. Said stoppage being caused by huge wads of toilet paper, which is being used as towels, was rolled up in balls four inches or more in diameter and thrown in to the bowl. The system was further handicapped by having the level of the water in flush tank cut down so that there was not sufficient water to carry away the ordinary amount of toilet paper.\n\nWe cleared out this stoppage and raised the water level in tank, and left the system in perfect order on the evening of Feb. 11th, 1931.\n\nWe might state that no system of drainage will function under such treatment. We also wish to emphasize the fact that on two former occasions when requested to attend to complaints, we found the sewer full of water caused by complete stoppage of septic tank and distribution system, which was outside our contract. This last stoppage would not have occurred if ordinary intelligence had been used in the use of the facilities provided.\n\nYours truly, Beaton & Brady Ltd.\"\n\nMy reply to the remark about the septic tank is that if a stoppage occurs there there will be a backing up of all drains, which will show in the boiler room and kitchen first.\n\nWith regard to the complaint about misuse of toilets, I am sending the Principal a copy of the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 7)\nMarch 5, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the recent trouble experienced in the drainage system inside the building at the Gordon's School, I would ask you that in future the pupils are not allowed to deposit large quantities of toilet paper in the closets as this blocks the system and causes the flooding of the basement. I would also ask you to see that the floats in the flushing tanks are not tampered with so as to cut down the amount of water required for flushing. It is expected that the school will be operated under the present management in a more efficient manner than in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\n\nRe W. Prayling, Esq.,\nPrincipal, Gordon's Indian School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nMarch 9th.\n\nMr. W. Swan,\nPunnichy,\nSask:\n\nRe Drainage on North or Girls Playrooms.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014 Replying to the copy of Beaton and Brady's Ltd report.\n\nMr. Angel our Engineer and his assistant kept with the man sent by them from Saskatoon the whole of the time he worked on the drains, and they only found one small wad of paper (not huge wads as stated), so small that after he had drawn Mr. Angel's attention to it, he threw it back into the clean-out with some iron sealing which came down as the drain was being flushed; this sealing Mr. Angel thinks the cause of holding the water back, possibly partly because in the drainage.\n\nIn November the plumber said that the stoppage on the south side or boys playroom was due to the septic tank backing up; this could not be the case, because our boiler room drainage is 37\u00bd\" lower than the boys playroom, if it were so the boiler room would be completely flooded; Mr. W. Swan, Government Inspector of this building will substantiate this.\n\nBeaton and Brady's report is not the fact our Engineer thinks says and thinks it must have been written up by the office and not dictated by the man sent down to investigate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEngineer's signature.\n\nHNB/PTW.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have been used and therefore cannot be taken back by the Northern Electric Company. The bulbs were altogether too large for our requirements and should never have been bought. I was just thinking perhaps it would be possible to find some place in the Department at some other point for these bulbs. You might advise me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nVenerable Archdeacon Knowles has just returned from making a visit to the Gordon Indian Residential School, and has made a request to have certain articles supplied, and some slight additions made to the interior of the poultry house, which was not completed last Fall.\n\nA bread mixer is badly needed here. It is impossible for them to carry on and do the baking by hand for the large number of children that are in the school, to say nothing of the staff. I would therefore strongly recommend that a bread mixer be supplied, with a capacity of about one barrel. There is no mangle in the laundry, and it is very necessary that one should be supplied, also a stove for heating the irons.\n\nI think the requests made by the Archdeacon are most reasonable, and the cost involved will not be great. I would therefore be glad to have your authority to make the necessary purchases.\n\nI am not sure that the Department make it a practise to supply playground equipment but this school has never made demands on the Department for articles of this kind, and if it would be possible to make a small grant\u2014\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\ngrant of, say $50.00, for the purpose of buying equipment I am sure it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe information I have at the present time is that it will not be long before the pupilage at this school will be 135 or 140. The report of the Archdeacon to me is that the new Principal, Mr. Frayling, is enthusiastic, and that he appears to be carrying on his work in a satisfactory manner. He states that the premises and the interior of the building are immaculate, and that the Church authorities are insisting on a competent staff being appointed. They intend to employ a high-class Farming Instructor as soon as one can be found. They have asked me to assist in locating such a man.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:-\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. J. W. Waddy, submitting a request by the Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School to be supplied with the following equipment for the engine room at this institution:\n\n1 - 10\" split wood pulley 4\" face 1\u00bc\" bore\n10 feet 2\" leather belting\n12 - 15 amp plug fuses\n12 - 25 \" \"\n6-25 \" cartridges\n1 box assorted stove bolts\n1 \" \" machine \"\n1 carpenters plane\n\nI think it would be as well to furnish the school with this, as the plant and so forth is new, and I shall be glad if the Department will give the necessary authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nM.

We have not yet been advised as to whether or not these amounts have been allowed. I would point out that this should be allowed, as the Gordon School has had very little allowed it in connection with fencing or other work since it was taken over from the contractor.\n\nThere is another matter which I particularly wish to draw to your attention, and would ask you to reconsider, namely the supplying of paint to give the outbuildings at least one coat of paint, otherwise the walls will all crack, and it seems an absolute waste of money to put up buildings and not protect them. If the Department could see its way clear to grant $150.00 for the paint I would see that the buildings were painted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

It would be a big job to lower the pipe, and if this were done, the tank would also have to be lowered to provide storage capacity, quite a costly proposition.\n\nI understand that Messrs. McPherson & Thom have looked into the matter, and they suggest that we use a small engine and pump for the job. A sketch showing the exact situation is attached. This sketch was prepared by the engineer. The water is quite deep yet, I understand, and if a pump were supplied, it could be installed.

Anderson vs. You\n\nMr. Anderson, who worked for you as a Painter on the Indian School, near Punichy, in 1930, has asked me to collect from you the sum of $99.00 being the balance due to him according to the fair-wage clause in the contract covering the above work. It appears from the specifications that Painters should be paid 80\u00a2 per hour, while you in fact paid Mr. Anderson off at 65\u00a2 per hour, which at 660 hours makes the balance for which he claims.\n\nMr. Anderson has asked me to take the matter up with the Department of Public Works at Ottawa, but I suggested that the matter be referred to you first, and only in case you refused to adjust the difference, should he report the matter.\n\nI shall be glad to know what you intend to do about it. It appears that the General Contractors may be involved, but that would be a matter between you and them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHARRY H. WALBERG\nby HHW.\nHARRY H. WALBERG  \nNOTARY PUBLIC  \nJUSTICE OF THE PEACE  \nFARM LANDS AND LOANS  \nCOLLECTIONS, CONVEYANCING  \nSASKATOON, SASK.\n\nSeptember 3rd, 1931\n\nDepartment of Public Works,  \nIndian Affairs,  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sirs: - Re: A. Anderson vs. John M. Cruse, and  \nIndian School, Punichy, Sask.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of two letters,  \none written by myself and the other written by John M. Cruse  \nin reply to mine, and which letters will be sufficient in  \nthemselves to explain Mr. Anderson's claim.\n\nThe Court referred to by Mr. Cruse, was, I am  \ninformed, a case before Mr. D. D. Campbell, J.P.\n\nMr. Anderson further explains that he signed  \nfor the wages he received, but is not aware that he signed  \nanything more. He only learned subsequently to being paid  \noff that he had been paid less than provided for by  \nthe specifications governing the construction of the Indian  \nSchool at Punichy, Sask., and for which Schoquist Brothers,  \nSaskatoon, Sask., was the general contractors.\n\nI have been asked by Mr. Anderson to report  \nthe matter to you and to ask that he receives the wages  \nwhich your department intended should be paid in the first  \nplace. I would be obliged to learn your attitude in the  \nmatter. If the contractors were paid by your department in  \naccordance with the schedules of wages forming part of the  \nspecifications and contract, there should be no question of  \nthis man recovering the balance apparently due to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHARRY H. WALBERG  \nby\n\nHHW/W.\n| Ck. | Quantity Ordered | Quantity Shipped | DESCRIPTION                                      | Dis. | List | Extension |\n|-----|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------|------|-----------|\n| 1   |                  |                  | #1521 Dempster Working Head                      |      |      |           |\n| 1   |                  |                  | All Brass Cylinder, 4 x 36, with 4 leather ball valve |      |      |           |\n| 1   |                  |                  | 5 H.P.

The lake has gone down below the level of the tank, which is situated on the bank of the lake, and therefore the water will not run into the tank by gravity. A new tank will have to be constructed near the school buildings and a new pump house erected at the lake shore. A ditch will have to be sunk from the pump house out to where the deep water is and a pipe put in below frost level. The cost of this will be in the neighborhood of from $1500.00 to $1700.00, and I will be glad to have your instructions in the matter. The present system cannot be made to work. I have had an expert go out and examine it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir-\n\nWith reference to the water supply system at Gordon's Indian Boarding School which was inspected by our Mr. Miller a couple of days ago, we beg to report as follows:-\n\nThere is two ways that the water pipe can be installed in the lake, first by building a cofferdam and then dig a trench deep enough so that the pipe would be below the frost line and secondly by laying the pipe on the bottom of the lake and then cover this pipe with earth and stones of sufficient depth to protect it from frost.\n\nThe cofferdam proposition would be considerably more expensive than laying the pipe on the bottom of the lake, so we are recommending the second scheme, that is to lay the pipe on the bottom of the lake and cover with sufficient earth and stones to protect from the frost.\n\nWe recommend that a pump be installed close to the lake, as the level of the lake is so low that the pump in the School will not lift the water at present, the pump to be installed in a well insulated building on the shore of the lake above high water level.\n\nWe also recommend that the water be pumped from the Pump at the lake to a tank of sufficient capacity, placed under ground at the most suitable location near the school, as it is not practicable to have a pressure pump so far away from the pressure tank in the School. The tank is required for purifying purposes and would also be a fine reserve supply in case of fire.\n\nWe are attaching a sketch showing the pipes as we propose to install them and will be pleased to have your instructions to proceed with the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPOTTS & MILLER LTD.\n\nPer (Sgd) Boyd Miller\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 312-114CE\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., October 15, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nRegarding the water situation at Gordon's school I am enclosing copy of sketch and report just handed to me by Messrs Fotts and Miller.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

For the first 20 feet we will have to cover the pipe with earth which will be scraped up and filled in on top to a depth of four or five feet. This will be done as soon as the pipe is in place. We have received the shipping bills, and it should arrive from Winnipeg today or tomorrow.\n\nWith regard to the tank at the school, the excavation is about completed, and I expect by Wednesday morning to have some person who is qualified in the work of laying concrete,[as this must be done by an experienced person] sent out from here to complete the same.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nWe will not be called upon to buy any additional pump as the one on hand will be quite satisfactory.\n\nI am glad that the Department have decided to approve of the system outlined in my letter, as it will provide for an ample supply of water for these Indians in the event of fire.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have just returned from a visit to the Gordon's Residential School in the Touchwood Agency, and I noted when there that the concrete floors in the children's dining room, the corridor, and the boys' and girls' play-rooms which are in the basement of the building, were hard to keep clean, and when swept they created a great deal of dust.\n\nThis cannot be good for the health of the children, and it further makes the building hard to keep clean. I would therefore strongly recommend that these floors be painted. The Principal and his staff would do the work if the material were found for them. The material, I estimate, would cost about $75.00.\n\nI would be glad if the Department would see fit to have this work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A., C.E. of the 3rd instant, regarding the condition of the concrete floors in the children's dining-room, corridor and boys' and girls' playrooms in the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to supply the paint required in having these floors painted, and the cost should not exceed your estimate of approximately $75. It is noted that the Principal and staff will perform the labour in carrying out the painting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith an invoice received from General Steel Wares Limited, of Winnipeg, covering freight on the dough mixer purchased by the Department for the Gordon's School, from Regina to Punnichy, amounting to $6.35. The goods covered by this debit note were shipped from Toronto direct to Punnichy and the goods were sold at a price F.O.B. Regina. The freight charged from Toronto to Regina was absorbed by the General Steel Wares and this debit is apparently for local freight from Regina to Punnichy. It occurs to me that, if the dough mixer was shipped from Toronto to Punnichy direct, the freight charge would be approximately equivalent to the charge from Toronto to Regina. However, I am forwarding the invoice for the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, 7th October, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo, with enclosures on behalf of Mr. A. Anderson who was engaged by John M. Cruse who had a contract for painting the Indian school at Punnichy, and note the facts as set forth in your letter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the fair wage schedule is posted on the premises at the time of the contract. If Mr. Anderson had made any complaint to the Department of Labour or to this Department during the time of his employment that he was not receiving proper wages his claim would have been considered and payment in respect of the contract would have been withheld pending an adjustment of his claim. It is now however too late to be taken into consideration and there is nothing the Department can do in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHarry H.

SCOTT\n\nDecember 15, 1930\n\nThis is simply to confirm my telephone conversation of this morning with regard to painting and paper hanging required at the Principal's residence, Gordon's Indian School, at Punnichy. This work may be placed with Messrs. Dunn and Ward of Semans, Sask.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nDec. 18, 1930.\n\nMemorandum: Dr. Scott.\n\nThe Gordon's Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire on the 1st day of February, 1929, and at that time it was decided to provide an item in the estimates for the next year for the reconstruction of the building. Later on however an item was placed in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nWhen the building was destroyed the only portion left that could be used in the reconstruction of the new school was the foundation. In order to have all the information necessary available for the preparation of the plans a blue print copy of the floor plans of the Old Gordon's School was sent to Commissioner Graham on May 13th, and he was asked to interview the Church authorities and return the blue prints with any changes desired indicated. As no reply was received on June 19th a further request was made to the Commissioner asking that the plans be returned as soon as possible in order that the plans for the new school could be prepared at once. The plans were received here on the 21st of June.\n\nPlans and specifications were then prepared for the new building and on Sept. 5th tenders were invited. They were received on the 30th and on October 17th an Order in Council was passed awarding the contract to Shoquist Bros. of Saskatoon, the lowest tenderer. The work was commenced immediately and the contract completed on the 27th of September of this year.\n\nDuring the winter months it was necessary to practically suspend operations, but as much work as possible was done when the temperature would permit, in order to assist the unemployment in that district.\n\nMr. William Swan, Architect of Punnichy, was appointed by the Civil Service Commission as Inspector of Construction. Mr. Swan had acted as Inspector when the old Gordon's School was erected and\nhis services were satisfactory. The Indian Commissioner also recommended that he be employed for this work stating that he considered that he was one of the most competent men in the Province of Saskatchewan and strongly advised that he be employed.\n\nThe new Gordon's Indian Residential School is entirely of fireproof construction.\n\nIn the furnishing of the Indian Residential Schools it has been the practice in the past to allow the Principal, after consulting with his staff, to submit to the Department a list of the furnishings required. When this list is received here it is carefully checked in order that the equipment will conform to that furnished other schools. It is necessary to disallow some of the items asked for, and in some cases to make additions. This list is then sub-divided and forms of tender prepared and submitted to the different firms for prices. The names of the firms who are asked to quote are obtained from the Minister's office.\n\nIn the case of the Gordon's School the Reverend Principal submitted a list which was carefully checked in accordance with the above procedure. On August 14th an analysis of the tenders received was submitted to you, with the recommendation that the order be placed with the firms quoting the lowest price. On the following day you submitted these prices to the Minister's office for consideration. On Sept. 6th you advised the Minister's Secretary that the Minister had instructed that new prices be invited, and on Sept. 16th the Minister's office submitted a list of names from whom prices were to be invited. The following day the firms were sent out to these firms and the prices were receivable on Sept. 30th to Oct. 6th. On October 13th an analysis of the prices received was submitted to the Acting Deputy which was approved, and on Oct. 14th the orders were placed.\n\nWhen preparing the tenders forms to be submitted to the various firms it has always been found that there are certain items which it is more satisfactory to purchase by personal selection, such as curtains, rugs, and a few small items, these the Principal was authorized to purchase and was advised of the names of firms from whom to make the purchase.\n\nThere are certain articles of equipment which it is necessary\nto build as they cannot be purchased ready made, such as clothes cupboards, lockers, benches, tables, etc. Mr. Swan, the Inspector, was instructed on Nov. 20th to make the purchase, the names of firms from whom prices were to be obtained being supplied from the Minister's office.\n\nThe orders for all the equipment required were placed with the Western branches of the various firms. The type and quantity of equipment, however, is not carried in stock by the branch offices and the orders were therefore forwarded to the head office and the shipment made direct to the School from the factories. Most of these factories are located in the East.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nto build as they cannot be purchased ready made, such as clothes cupboards, lockers, benches, tables, etc. Mr. Swan, the Inspector, was instructed on Nov. 20th to make the purchase, the names of firms from whom prices were to be obtained being supplied from the Minister's office.\n\nThe orders for all the equipment required were placed with the Western branches of the various firms.

Most of these factories are located in the East.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nDecember 22, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy\n\nI have given careful attention to the letter of the 6th December from Mr. P. H. Gordon, K.C., of Regina, and also the letter from Mr. Graham, the Indian Commissioner, dated the 3rd December. These letters refer to the alleged delays in the completion of the new residential school building on the George Gordon's Reserve, near Punichy, Sask., and delays in furnishing the school.\n\nThis school is conducted by the Anglican Diocese of Qu'Appelle, and has for some years suffered from mismanagement which culminated in the destruction by fire of the fine school building. They seemingly have found it impossible to engage a competent person in Holy Orders to conduct this school. I suggested to Bishop Harding and Archdeacon Knowles when they were last in my office, in the autumn, that they ought to select a competent layman. They have selected a layman, and time will show whether he is competent or not.\n\nThe Building\n\nThe school was destroyed by fire on February 1, 1929. The Main Estimates had been prepared, and as we had obtained our full requirements, the Minister decided not to provide for the school in the Estimates of 1929-30, but to make it a leading item in the Estimates for 1930-31. However, owing to pressure from the ecclesiastical authorities he decided to place an amount in the Supplementary Estimates, and accordingly $90,000.00 was provided. Our Supplementary Estimates went to the Finance Department on the 6th May, 1929, and as soon as they had been approved, on the 13th May, blue print copies of the floor plans of the old school were sent to Mr. Graham and he was asked to interview the Church.\nauthorities and to make suggestions as to the changes in the plans. No reply was received from Mr. Graham, and on June 19th I wrote asking him to return the plans as soon as possible. My letter crossed one from him dated May 21st. I could not understand this and asked him for an explanation, and it appears that the letter was prepared on the 21st May but not mailed, and that the delay of nearly three weeks was entirely owing to negligence in his office. The plans and specifications were prepared, and tenders were asked for on September 5th. They were received on September 30th, and on October 17th the Order in Council was passed awarding the contract to Shoukist Bros., of Saskatoon, the lowest tenderer, $133,895.00. The Department was not hurried in the awarding of this contract advisedly and for the simple reason that we knew $90,000.00 would not build the school and that the construction of the school and payment of the contractor would have to run into the next fiscal year. Mr. William Swan, an Architect of Punnichy, was appointed by the Civil Service Commission as Inspector of Construction. Mr. Graham recommended that he be employed, stating that he considered that he was one of the most competent men in the Province of Saskatchewan. During the winter months it was necessary to almost suspend operations, but much work was done when the temperature would permit in order to assist unemployment in that district. Altogether $51,388.00 was charged to the Vote for 1929-30. Construction went on and the building was completed on September 27, 1930. The amount of $86,224.21 was charged to the Vote for 1930-31. The difference between the total amount paid, namely, $137,612.21 and the contract price was for certain extras allowed by the Superintendent of Construction. Considering the winter interval I think the school was constructed with reasonable despatch.\n\nThe Furnishings.\n\nAs for the general method employed in furnishing these residential schools, I may say that it has been the practice in the past to allow the Principal, after consulting with his staff, to submit to the Department a list of the furnishings required. When this list is received here it is carefully checked in order that the equipment will conform to that furnished other schools. It is necessary to disallow some of the items asked for, and in some cases to make additions. This list is then subdivided and forms of tender prepared and submitted to the different firms for prices. The names of the firms who are asked to quote are obtained from the Minister's Office. We have furnished all our schools under this system.\nand it has been found to work well.\n\nWhen the Gordon's school building was approaching completion the Principal was asked to submit a list which was carefully checked in accordance with the above procedure, and on July 10th the firms named by the then Superintendent General were asked to tender. On August 15th an analysis of the tenders received was submitted to you. After discussion you directed me to obtain new prices, and on September 6th I advised Mr. Buskard to that effect. On September 16th your office gave me a list of names from whom prices were to be invited, and on the following day prices were asked from these firms. The prices were receivable from September 30th to October 6th. On October 13th an analysis of the prices was submitted to you, and on October 14th the orders were placed. In this instance the change of Government was responsible for this delay.\n\nI do not think I should take up your time by controverting some of the statements in Mr. Gordon's letter and by pointing out the characteristic attitude assumed by the Indian Commissioner. I should be pleased to go into the matter further if it is clear to you that I have not dealt with any important point in these letters.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He was instructed to obtain prices from these firms and place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nThe ordering of this portion of the equipment was entrusted to Mr. Swan as he was considered the most competent person to supervise this portion of the work. All of this equipment required to be built in the mills and Mr. Swan, being an Architect, was familiar with the various details of construction.\n\nA. S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n2nd January, 1931.\n\nMemo.\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nWith reference to your enquiry this morning in connection with the Gordon Indian Residential School as to whether Principal Stanford had been asked by the Department to designate the furnishings required for this school after it had become known that his services as principal were unsatisfactory, I have to say, that apparently is the case.\n\nAs pointed out, however, in Dr. Scott's memorandum to the Minister dated the 22nd ultimo it has been the practice to allow the Principal after consulting with his staff to submit to the Department a list of the furnishings required. The fact that Principal Stanford's services generally were not satisfactory would not indicate that he was altogether incompetent to designate what furnishings might properly be required for the building. He was still Principal of the school. When such lists of furnishings are designated by principals they are, of course, checked at the Department to see that they are in keeping with the furnishings generally provided for schools. Some items are invariably disallowed and others added, and that was done in Principal Stanford's case so that it does not appear that any irregularity occurred in connection with the Gordon School furnishings.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When the mistake was discovered here the General Steel Wares were instructed to ship the No 2 Old Homestead oven as originally called for in the order sent them.\n\nThe Gordon's School will accommodate 100 pupils and a staff of approximately 12. It averages about half a loaf of bread per day per pupil, which would mean that it would be necessary to bake every three days filling the oven twice at each baking. It takes approximately 1 hour for each baking. The No 2 Old Homestead oven ordered has a capacity of 72 loaves and weighs 3450 pounds. The next size is a No 4, with a capacity of 160 loaves and weighing 5500 pounds.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMarch 2nd, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nI am attaching hereto a letter from Mr. Graham with reference to the engagement of Dunn and Ward, of Semans, Sask., to do some work at the Punnichy school.

Gordon's Indian School, Punnichy.\n\nI wish to point out to you that before your final cheque was handed over to the contractors, Messrs. Shoquist Bros. of Saskatoon, Sask., I secured a letter from them acknowledging that I was not satisfied with the painting of the concrete floors in the basement, and that they would supply enough paint to repaint the whole of the basement floors this last summer. I have written them about this matter as well as several minor ones, but they have done nothing, but write and say that they had written the subcontractor. I would advise that your department notify them that legal action will be taken against them unless the terms of their contract are fulfilled.\n\nI enclose the letter from Shoquist Bros. for your own files.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nIt has occurred to me that there may now be a sum of $200.00 available for painting at Gordon's School. In July last I asked for and obtained a sum of $150.00 and this was all spent on paint, the labour being furnished by the school. This was sufficient to give most of the buildings one coat, but another coat of paint is necessary to make a satisfactory job, and if the material could be supplied now, the painting could be done in the spring by the school. I think they should be encouraged when they are willing to do the work.\n\nWill the Department please advise me if the paint may be bought?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 17, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A. C.

On my last visit to this school I found that the two large doors leading off the main floor had torn loose.

At present they have a total of 63 head, including pigs and mature stock.\n\nThe two barns have additions which have never been painted and the new drive shed also will need paint.\n\nThe cattle are in good condition. The milk supply is low at present, but a number of cows will freshen early in the new year.\n\nThe ice house is not on a cement foundation and, as the ice is piled all at one end, the building has settled. The whole building should be jacked up and placed on a proper foundation before being refilled with ice.\n\nMr. Frayling, the Principal, is a hard worker. He has accomplished a great amount of work during the past summer and has made some splendid improvements.\nGordon Indian Residential School\n\nThe class room work is arranged as follows.\n\nThe senior room has 28 pupils on the roll and the following grades:\n\n- Grade 3 - 6\n- \" 4 - 13\n- \" 5 - 5\n- \" 6 - 4\n\nThe intermediate room has 45 pupils enrolled.\n\n- 27 in Grade 1\n- 27 in \" 2\n\nThe primary department has 20 on the roll.\n\nThe class work in both the intermediate and senior rooms is good and progress is being made. The work - books were -\nbooks were tidy and all work neatly set down.\n\nThe children were well clothed, clean, and neat in appearance.\n\nThe primary work is carried on in the girls' play-room. At one end of this room a partition has been erected. This partition does not reach the ceiling and allows free circulation of air. No girls are in the play-room during class hours, so that there is no dust or interruption.\n\nThe various departments were all in operation and the matrons in charge appeared capable. The girls are taught cooking, bread making, and butter making. Some sewing is taught, but the Principal informed me this line of work would be enlarged upon during the coming year. It is the intention to instruct each girl, so that she can make all her own clothes and do other plain sewing. This fall the girls had no instruction in milking, but this work will be carried on during the new year.\n\nThe fire escapes are in good condition, also all other fire equipment. Fire drill is observed several times during each month, and the children are able to get out in from two to two and one half minutes. The fire escape doors are unlocked after the children retire. At present the bells connected with these doors are not working, but these are being repaired. The bells will prevent anyone entering or leaving unless the alarm is sounded.\n\nThe water system has been changed, and the system now installed should give excellent service and in case of fire will be of added protection. The changing of this system entailed a lot of work, but I would judge this has been well done.\n\nThe building throughout I found to be tidy and clean. The dormitories were all well aired and the beds neatly made. The children are provided with night dresses and pyjamas - in which to -\nin which to sleep.\n\nThe dining room was clean and the meals appeared to be well prepared. The following is a general menu.\n\n**Breakfast** - Oatmeal or cream of wheat - cornflakes on Sunday with milk and brown sugar, bread and butter or jam - tea or cocoa.\n\n**Dinner** - Meat, vegetables - fish on Friday pudding, pie once a week, bread, water to drink\n\n**Supper** - Potatoes fried, soup, pancakes, egg dishes or beans, fruit and cake on Sunday bread and butter or jam Tea for senior pupils, cocoa for junior.\n\nMilk or cocoa is served at first recess to any children needing special nourishment.\n\nThe children are weighed each month and a record kept of their weights. The chart indicates in most cases a fair gain for each pupil.\n\nThe grounds have been greatly improved since my last visit, and present a good appearance. A proper road three quarters of a mile long leading to the school has been built and gravelled. This road has been well fenced along with all the play-grounds. These improvements represent a lot of hard work and expense and have transformed the surroundings.\n\nA new drive shed has just been completed, made almost entirely from material gathered from some old dilapidated sheds. The hog pen has been enlarged to almost twice its original size. The addition is on cement and all floors are cemented. The building is completed except for the siding, which the Principal is unable to get due to lack of finances. The building is all occupied and I found the walls of the new part covered with frost and the shiplap slightly bulged from the moisture. If it were possible for the Department to provide - the 2,000 feet -\nthe 2,000 feet of siding necessary, it would greatly improve conditions and do away to a large extent with the dampness which might mean his success or failure with pigs; as hogs do not thrive in damp places, but usually become crippled by rheumatism. At present they have a total of 63 head, including pigs and mature stock.\n\nThe two barns have additions which have never been painted and the new drive shed also will need paint.\n\nThe cattle are in good condition. The milk supply is low at present, but a number of cows will freshen early in the new year.\n\nThe ice house is not on a cement foundation and, as the ice is piled all at one end, the building has settled. The whole building should be jacked up and placed on a proper foundation before being refilled with ice.\n\nMr. Frayling, the Principal, is a hard worker. He has accomplished a great amount of work during the past summer and has made some splendid improvements.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report received from Mr. Inspector Hamilton on the various schools in the Touchwood Agency.\n\nGordon's Residential School\n\nYou will note that up to the time of the Inspector's visit, no instruction in milking cows had been given the girls, but it is the intention to do so during the coming year. I am drawing the Principal's attention to this matter, asking him to see that it is attended to.\n\nThe menu furnished these pupils appears to be fairly evenly balanced, and should be sufficient.\n\nOn Pages 4 & 5 reference is made to the pig pen which was enlarged by using scrap material found around the school. The Principal is unable to complete the building, owing to lack of funds. All he requires is 2,000 ft. of siding. I asked for authority to purchase the necessary material some time ago, but it was refused. The Department may now feel that they have sufficient funds to make the expenditure. The cost would probably be around $100.00.\n\nI would draw your attention to the fact that the fire escape doors at this school are not kept locked all the time. The matter of looking after the children here is just as difficult as at any other point, but still the Principal is able to carry out the idea of keeping the doors leading to the fire escapes unlocked.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nMuscowequan Residential School\n\nThe work here seems to be carried on in a satisfactory manner. They are no doubt handicapped by not having a properly equipped laundry.\n\nYou will note that the doors leading to the fire escapes here are never locked.\n\nI understand that the Principal of this school, Father Poulet, has been transferred. This is unfortunate as, from reports I have received, the new Principal who has been appointed, Father Bousquet, is not in the same class as Father Poulet.\n\nThe two day schools appear to be carrying on in the usual way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nOn the 16th December last I forwarded for payment Touchwood Agency Voucher No. 458 in favor of Mr. W. G. Wright, 1456 Montague Street, Regina, covering his account for superintending the work on the water works system at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I have received a letter from him today enquiring as to non-payment. Will you please look into the matter, as the voucher may have been overlooked.\n\nI may add that I am also informed by Messrs. Potts and Miller Limited that their account for $965.95, forwarded from here on the 22nd December last, has not been paid either.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to report that at the Gordon Indian Residential School there are over fifty benches in the dining room and recreation rooms which require to be repaired. They were not build strongly enough and are falling apart.\n\nI have had a carpenter examine these seats and he states that they require to have 1x4 strips attached to the legs, close up under the seat tops, and have small braces attached also. He states that cost of this including labor and material would be 80\u00a2 per seat. It is necessary that something be done to put this furniture in repair.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 30, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, relative to the condition of the benches in the dining-room and recreation rooms in the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that if the material required to have strips attached to the legs of the benches, in order to strengthen them, was supplied, the school carpenter, with the assistance of the boys, should be able to carry out the work required. You may arrange to purchase the material required to place the benches in a satisfactory condition, and you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa, February 2, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your 312-11 of the 4th ultimo, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on the various schools in the Touchwood Agency. I regret that the acknowledgment of this letter has been inadvertently overlooked.\n\nWith reference to the report on the Gordon's Residential School, I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $100 in the purchase of the siding required to complete the pigpen. It is noted from the Inspector's report that it would require 2000 feet.\n\nRegarding the painting of the two barns and new drive shed, I have to say that this has been noted for our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nIt is noted that the general conditions at this school are satisfactory and that the Principal has carried out a number of improvements during the past season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. J. W. Maddy, Indian Agent at Punnichy, pointing out that the ice house in use at the Gordons Indian Residential school needs to be set on a cement foundation so that the body of ice at one end of the building may not disturb its equilibrium. Part of the building was built to be used as a refrigerator, but it was found that the ice is so well insulated sufficient cold air cannot be introduced into the store room. A change therefore is desirable. The Principal states that, if he is allowed the sum of $50.00 with which to purchase the material, he will undertake to have the necessary work done.\n\nI shall be glad therefore if the Department will let me have authority to direct him to buy the necessary material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A C.E. of the 27th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the foundation of the ice house at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding approximately the sum of $50 to purchase the materials required in having a cement foundation installed and any other repairs required in placing the building in good condition. You may purchase the necessary materials. It is noted that the school authorities will perform the labour without expense to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I wish to report that the entire interior of the school has been kalsomined again this spring; this is twice in the past year this has been done, both times at the expense of the school. New fencing has been erected all around the premises, a big extension put on the pig house body of the barns painted one coat, a road built and graveled into the school from the highway to 350 pounds of seed planted alongside the new road. In fact the place has so changed in the past year that it is entirely altered. All the above, with the exception of some paint supplied from Regina, has been done at the expense of the school. The Principal tells me it has cost him about $1,000.00 for the new improvements.\n\nHe asks that the Department give him some assistance to complete the work, and the following is list of requirements:\n\n- 1500' hog wire.\n- 50 gal roof stain.\n- 50 gal red paint.\n- 50 gal white paint.\n- 50 spools fence wire.\n- 3 kegs staples.\n\nCost of above would be approximately $600.00.\n\nMr. Frayling also asks that the Department consider the question of a grant to the school of $1,000.00 for the work outlined above. Of course I did not authorize any of it. I think Mr. Graham told him he would try to get the Department to help out on the cost of the painting, fencing and road work done last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your #11 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Gordon Indian Residential School. Certain funds are available, and you may purchase the following, at an approximate cost of $600:-\n\n- 1500 ft. hog wire,\n- 50 gal. roof stain,\n- 50 \" red paint,\n- 20 \" white paint,\n- 50 spools fence wire,\n- 3 kegs staples.\n\nYou should secure competitive prices from those on the list to receive consideration. It is understood that the school management will be responsible for all labour costs.

A.F. MACKENZIE\n\nWe have your letter of Oct. 27th, to hand in connection with an outstanding item in your account of last June of 76\u00a2 representing freight on a heater forwarded to Gordon's Residential School.\n\nWe regret very much if there has been any misunderstanding between the Indian School and your office in respect to this particular item. We have all along rendered statements showing this item to be outstanding, and we have at different occasions sent duplicates of this charge. Under the circumstances, if the amount was not included in your approbations for the years 1931 and 1932 it was no fault of ours, and there is no reason why we should have to absorb even this small amount.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we must ask that you again go into this matter and arrange to let us have your cheque in settlement of this long outstanding item.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGENERAL STEEL WARES LIMITED\n\nFWB/MM\n\nCREDIT MANAGER\nOttawa, November 5th, 1932.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn June, 1931, the Department supplied the Gordon's Indian Residential School with a laundry heater, which was purchased from the General Steel Wares Limited. We are in receipt of a letter from this firm in which they request payment of seventy-six cents (76\u00a2), which is a balance due for freight on the heater. They state that they have been rendering accounts for this amount to you but have not yet received payment.\n\nOur Appropriation for the fiscal year 1931-32 has lapsed and it is regretted that we cannot, therefore, make payment of the item of seventy-six cents (76\u00a2). It would be appreciated if you would pay this from school funds and close the matter with the General Steel Wares Limited, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

FRAYLING\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th inst., to hand in which you make reference to an outstanding balance in your account of 75\u00a2 and which was contracted for in August last year.\n\nWhile we stated to the Department at Ottawa that we had several times taken this matter up with you we have been unable to locate a letter, although, we do find that our Accounting Dept. had been sending forward a statement of the account each month, and we feel that if there was any question about payment of the item that you would have written to this office regarding same. It was only when your Ottawa office suggested that we write the amount off that we advised them that we could not handle the item in this way, and evidently they have since taken the matter up with you.\n\nHowever, as the amount is only small and is now somewhat overdue it should be cleaned up without further delay, and we would appreciate very much if you would arrange to let us have your remittance to cover at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGENERAL STEEL WARES LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nCREDIT MANAGER\n\nFWB/MM\nGordon's Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nPrincipal\nR.W.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRe General Steel Wares.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter No. 121-1-5, I wrote the Company for a date on which application or statement had been rendered to Gordon's School, their reply I enclose with a copy of my letter with remittance for 76\u00a2.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Mr. R.W. Frayling)\nPrincipal.\n\nRWF/PTW.\nDear Sir;\u2014\n\nI have the honor to report that the batteries in use at the Gordon Indian Residential School electric plant are used up and require a complete set of replacements as follows.\n\n56 U7 positive groups\n56 U7 negative groups\n336 wood separators\n5 lb sealing compound\n3 bridge rests\nsulphuric acid for 56 containers.\n\nAll above for Globe Light Batteries.\n\nThe Electric Equipment Limited, of Regina and Saskatoon have given me prices on the above, with exception of the acid which was not described in the letter I got from the engineer of the school, but from the information I have it would appear that the cost of the above would be in the neighborhood of $300.00. It is necessary that these batteries be put in shape at once as the plant has to be run continually now since the batteries became useless. The Principal of the school has no funds to pay for this work.\n\nI would be obliged if the Department would authorise the supply of above equipment as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the batteries in connection with the electric lighting equipment at the Gordon Indian Residential School. It is noted that these batteries are now used up and that a complete set of replacements is required.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that, unless extra attachments were used in connection with the lighting equipment, the batteries should have lasted a longer period. Our funds this year are so limited, that it is difficult to obtain the amount required in the purchase of new batteries. However, as it is necessary that the lighting plant be in good condition, the Department will approve of you obtaining prices, from only those firms on the list to receive consideration, for the supplying of the number of replacement groups as mentioned in your letter and for the quantity of sealing compound, bridge rests and sulphuric acid required.\n\nIt is noted that, in other schools where the Globe batteries have been in use, they have not given a lengthy period of service. It is not necessary that this type of battery be supplied in making the replacement at the Gordon School at the present time, and, in obtaining quotations, you should consider other well known and serviceable batteries.\n\nIt is noted, further, that you estimate the cost of the new batteries, installed, will be approximately $500. If possible, this amount should not be exceeded. You should place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price, and, after delivery has been made to your satisfaction, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nPlease inform the Principal of the School definitely that the electric light equipment is to be used for lighting purposes only and that no attachments, such as electric irons, stoves, or pumping equipment are to be used.\n\nThe purchase and delivery of the new batteries should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

[illegible], amounting to $186.1 in favour of Electric Equipment Co., Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nfor freight on empty carboys reshipped to Winnipeg\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 121/1/5 dated Dec. 27/32.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report that on my visit to the Gordon Indian Residential School today, I found everything in very fair shape, with the exceptions noted below. The whole of the inside of the school has again been kiln-dried and painted this spring at the expense of the school authorities and is very clean. The grounds are kept in good shape, about thirty acres of garden and 120 acres of crop are in, and growing well. The pupils are all well, not one being sick at the present time, they are well dressed and tidy.\n\nThe principal asks me if I will enquire from the Department if he is to receive any compensation for the money he has expended on new buildings, roads, fences etc., that he has put in since he came here; he says he has spent about $7,500.00 and is under the impression he is to get part of this refunded.\n\nRegards the repairs required here this year I would be obliged if the Department would advise me what money is allowed. What is required principally is a granary; the cost would be about $100.00. The root cellar has fallen in and requires to be dug out and the roof rebuilt; the cost of this would be close to $200.00. When this place was being built the money allowed only provided for a roof made of poles, these not cut in about three years.\n\nThe back entry to the school is in bad shape, the stone lintel and the bricks are all coming away from the building, and the door frame is loose; this should be repaired by a competent builder; the cost would be about $50.00 to make a good job and a lot of brick would have to be replaced. In the boys play rooms the plaster above the wainscot for a fact or so is all loose; this should have a strip of board inserted and the plaster repaired, about $25.00 for material and labor.\n\nThere is a pen made of poles here for the bull, this is rotten and should be replaced or the animal may get out and damage some of the pupils; a few years ago one did break out and he killed the farmer's horse. The principal asks for construction of an iron fence pen; this might seem too expensive, but something should be done here.\n\nKindly let me know what the Department can allow for the above repairs etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 7)\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to ask the Department if they received my report of June 3rd last on the Gordon Indian Residential School, containing certain requests for expenditure.\n\nNo answer has been received and the principal has been asking me what is being done about certain requests he made which I noted in my letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letters of June 3rd, last, and of the third instant, regarding repairs, the erection of a new granary and compensation to the church authorities for money expended on new buildings, roads, fences, etc., at the Gordon's School.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the back entrance of the school and to the plaster above the wainscot in the boys' playrooms, I have to say that the Department will approve an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $75.00 in having these work carried out. It is noted that the stone lintel end the bricks are coming away from the building and that the door frame is loose, the cost of these repairs being estimated at $50.00. In the boys' playroom, the repairs required to the plaster above the wainscot should be performed, at a cost not exceeding your estimate of $25.00. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure for the purpose. When the work has been completed you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of material and labour. Please state on each copy of the account that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 766.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to provide a granary or repair the root cellar or for the erection of a pen for the bull.\n\nRegarding reimbursement to the school authorities for the expenditure incurred in constructing the road to the school, I have to say that the Department is not yet aware what funds there may be available for this purpose. There has been a recent demand for a further cut in our appropriation, and therefore it may not be possible to provide a grant toward reimbursing the school management for their expenditure in the construction of the road. The question of providing a grant for this purpose will have to stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. W.

The cottage is very small and the lean-to 16x24 has a flat roof; This roof is so flat that the rain continually leaks in and destroys kitchen equipment, plaster and floor, it is a miserable place.\n\nThis principal has spent thousands since he came here in building roads, fences, pig-pens etc but spent nothing on his own place, and he has paid so far for all the improvements out of his grant.\n\nHe asks that the Department allow him $125.00 to put this cottage in repair, and if there are any funds available I beg to recommend that it be granted.\n\nI do not know if the new form #217 is for this purpose but I enclose one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCertificate of Inspection of Steam Heating Boilers\n\nBoiler No.: 12160\nHorse Power: 43\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have this day inspected, under the provisions of Subsection 6 of Section 12 of The Steam Boilers Act, the steam heating boiler and connections located in Gordon Indian School of Punichy and belonging to Dept. of Indian Affairs, and that I have found the said boiler and connections to be in Good condition, and have locked and sealed the pop safety valve so as to admit of no greater steam pressure than 15 pounds to the square inch, as provided by the foregoing Section of the Act.\n\nRepairs ordered\n\nDated this 6th day of Sept., 1933.\n\nInspector of Steam Boilers\n\nThis certificate is good until the boiler for which it has been issued is re-inspected.

This boiler was retubed in 1932 as per your letter 121-1-5 of Sept 17th 1932. The boiler is a pressure boiler 80 lbs., made by Leonard of London, Ont., 36-2\" tubes 36 in long.\n\nThe inspector states that we cannot expect more than two years use from this type of boiler when using the water at Gordon, that it is very similar to Regina water where the boilers have to be retubed about every eighteen months.\n\nThe principal of the school states he would take the boiler into Regina and return same to the school by truck if the Department would authorise the expense of the work there. I understand that the North West Iron Works Co of Regina would do the work if the Department approves of employing them. I could not quote you a price until I hear who is to do the work, in any case it appears that the work will have to be done as the boiler is out of commission until then.\n\nIf possible please wire me instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 16, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nThe boiler at the Gordon Indian Residential School has been condemned and it will be necessary to have it repaired as soon as possible. Mr. Agent Waddy states that the Principal is prepared to take the boiler in to Regina and return same to the school, by truck, if the Department authorizes the expenses of the necessary work. Mr. Waddy states, further, that the work could be done by the North West Iron Works Company, of Regina. The cost would be approximately $75. The name of this firm does not appear on the approved list, and I would appreciate your advising if it will be in order to have them do this work.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have been requested by our clients, Messrs. Sho-\nquiet Brothers, of this City, to write you regarding certain\nwork done on the residence of Gordon's Indian Residential School\nat Punichy. This work was done, we believe, about the month of\nDecember, 1930, and consisted of electrical wiring etc., on the\nhouse of the resident agent. Our clients sent a man especially\nfrom Saskatoon to do this work, and a very reasonable charge of\n$70.46 was made. This had nothing to do with any contract for\nthe construction of buildings and was entirely a separate item\nof work. Our understanding is that the agent was transferred\nshortly after the work was done and through some misunderstanding\nthe account has never been paid.\n\nWe would ask you to kindly look this up and let us\nhear from you at your early convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nKYLE & FERGUSON,\nper\n\nDCK/IMR.\nJune 25, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to a claim for work done on the residence at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, by Messrs.

This is the second girl to have her fingers off in this mixer.\n\nThe Principal is having a top made for the machine but this will not stop the damage as the girls will still take off the top to look into the machine. This time the girl had her back to the machine and let her hand feel the dough while she was talking to another girl.\n\nWill the Department please advise what is done at other institutions, it looks to me as if the machine should be thrown out and the girls made to mix the dough by hand, or that no one but a staff member be allowed to handle the machine, it is not right that Indian pupils should be exposed to such damage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 19, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nA report has been received regarding the serious accident sustained by Elsie Lapierre, pupil of the Gordon Indian Residential School, whose hand was caught in the bread mixer, necessitating the amputation of two of her fingers. The Department understands that this is the second girl to receive serious injury in the operation of the bread mixer.\n\nThe Department does not understand why there should be accidents occasioned in the operation of this machine. Bread mixers of the same type as at the Gordon School have been supplied to a large number of residential schools, and we have not been informed of any accident, such as suffered by Elsie Lapierre, having occurred at any of the other schools. It is considered that, when the mixer is in operation, it should be under the direct charge of a responsible member of the staff; we should have the services of the girls working in the bakery. It is not considered necessary that the pupils take any active part when the mixer is in operation. The only alternative would be to dispense with the use of the mixer and have the girls mix the dough by hand. No one but a staff member should be allowed to handle the mixer.\n\nI should be pleased to have a report from you, regarding the accident to Elsie Lapierre and what definite action is being taken to prevent a re-occurrence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. W. Freyling, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nGordon Indian Res.

For your information, I am enclosing copy of a communication, addressed to the Principal, regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nJ. W.

Waddy Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTouchwood Agency,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nRe: Elsie La Pierre.\n\nOn January 31st about 7 P.M. the above was again on Bread Making duty, in which she was an excellent bread-maker. For some reason she says she stood on the opposite side of the machine to her usual custom, and on turning her head to speak to another girl, caught her hand in the Mixer, crushing the two middle fingers on her right hand.\n\nI immediately called up the Doctor, informing him of the accident, and drove with Miss Atwater and the child to town, when it was found necessary to amputate the two fingers at the second joint.\n\nOrdinary care being taken as in other matters, accidents would not happen, but I purpose having a cover made that would prevent such occurrence.\n\nI think it is a Hospital case and it is more than likely a further portion of the fingers may have to be removed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your inquiry regarding accident to the above, attached is a copy of my report to Mr. Indian Agent, J. W. Waddy.\n\nGirls also make bread by hand, this being a part of the School instruction.\n\nWhilst a girl has always helped with the Bread Mixer, it has been under Staff Supervision. During a short absence of the Supervisor this accident happened.\n\nThe girls have always been told NOT to touch the dough whilst the Mixer is in motion.\n\nThey are not now allowed in the mixing room during the running of the machine.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\nCOPY.\n\nMr. R. W. Frayling,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Indian Residential School.\nPunnichy, Sask..\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nEnclosed herewith please find blue-print showing profile of the ground line on which a dam is proposed to be constructed for the purpose of preventing water at the north end of Lake contaminating the water being used for domestic purposes by the school.\n\nI have proposed a fill 16 feet wide on top and protected by stone on the sides. To make this fill would take about 550 cubic yards of earth and about 60 cubic yards of stone. To have this work done by contract labor would cost from 25 to 30 cents per yard for earth and the placing of stone along the sides of fill, about $1.00 per yard, varying in proportion to the distance the stone would have to be hauled. Some of the stone may be obtained when excavating for the fill. Concrete culverts might be obtained from the local Municipality at comparatively low cost plus cost of hauling from the vicinity of Humby's Lake, where they are made. Altogether the total cost would be about $200.00, this cost might be reduced if done by local labor.\n\nThe profile of ground as shown on the blue-print is marked at each end by a blazed tree.\n\nI shall be glad to give you any further information on this matter that you may require.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SIGNED.) Sidney Harding.\nI have recently had the levels taken at the Dividing point by Mr. S. Harding, A.M.E.I.C., Surveyor, which his Blue - Print clearly shows, and that the work could be completed for about $200.00.\n\nApart from cutting off this undesirable half, the proposed Dam would give us a greater volume of Water to draw from, in place of running over the entire Lake as at present, giving depth as well as more and better water.\n\nShould this project be approved by the Department, I would suggest an early start, as the little water that may have been there, is now frozen and the work could be completed before the Spring thaw sets in.\n\nThe earth could mostly be taken from near by points, and all work could be done by the local Indians, with one Supervisor.\n\nThe question was also raised by Mr. Murison to Dr. McGill when visiting the School and was also mentioned to Dr. Stone.\n\nI would impress upon you the necessity for prompt action, and point out that we are certain to get some added water, and the small cost involved would go a very little way in digging wells, apart from the cost of finding a location.\n\nThe Blue - Print with a copy of Mr. Harding's letter is attached.\n\nI will thank you to forward this suggestion to the Department or Mr. Mumison.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal,\nGordon's School.\nMr. J. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nTouchwood Agency,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nRe: SCHOOL WATER SUPPLY.\n\nSerious consideration should be given the above. At the rate the water has receded the last few years, every possible means for conserving should be used.\n\nThe Lake (or slough) from which we obtain water is practically divided in half, an elevation, or Island in the centre, with shallow channels on either side. At the present time there is no water connection with the South and North portions. This latter portion (the North) is little better than a Cess Pool; Indians camp around there, drive in their Horses and Cattle and sometimes Bathe.\n\nThe Sask. Gov't. Laboratory findings have shown for the last 4 years viz; Organic Matter - Quantity; Bacteria per C.C. - Too numerous to count; E Coli - present.\n\nR. H. Murray, C.E. Director of Division of Sanitation recommended that the Reservoir be chlorinated as it was unsafe for drinking purposes. This was done, at the given proportions. Sample after sample was again sent, each time the report was add more lime. And at last, until it can be tasted. This is and has been the practice since, and the proof of its effectiveness is shown by the good health at the School.\n\nI firmly believe that the majority of the contamination has been from the northern end of the lake and should be separated.\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn reference to water supply at the Gordon Indian Residential School, I beg to advise the Department that the Principal has asked that certain work be done regarding same, letters from himself and a surveyor are enclosed.\n\nIn explanation I may say that the water for the school comes from a large slough which is in two parts, the Principal wants to shut off one part by building a dam. He states that the part he wishes to shut off is that used by Indian cattle and horses when watering. He also explains that if this part were shut off the balance of the area would receive all the water which flows into it at present and thus make the contents higher, all the water coming down a small valley first gets into the area nearest the school.\n\nMr. Frayling asks for an appropriation of $200.00 which would be spent on Indian labor hauling earth and stone to the proposed dam.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School and also a communication from the Surveyor, with blue print of a proposed dam, to divide the lake from which the water supply for the school is obtained. It is noted that, if a dam was built between the two parts of the lake, it would greatly deepen the part from which the water is obtained and, to a great extent, would prevent contamination to the school supply.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have funds for this purpose after the Appropriation for the coming fiscal year is available - which will likely be early in April. The Department will approve of the Principal, under your direction, arranging for Indian labour in the hauling of the earth and stone required to erect the dam, which should be constructed to the grade line and between the points as shown on the blue print which you forwarded. It is considered that the work could be done under the supervision of the Principal and that it would not be necessary to obtain the services of a foreman to oversee the work. It is understood that the lake is a school property and that the erection of the dam would not conflict with any provincial regulations regarding raising of water levels.\n\nThe Principal may begin the work as soon as convenient and weather conditions permit. He should keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, of the labour engaged, which should show the days or hours each man was employed and the rate paid, and these returns should be handed to you. Each Indian employed, when paid, should sign the pay-list. However, no payment can be made until the appropriation is available. No doubt, you have forms on hand for keeping record of the labour employed.\n\nIt is noted the entire cost of the work will not exceed the sum of, approximately, $200.00, and it will be expected that a satisfactory job can be completed within the estimate.\n\nAn advance to pay the labour will be forwarded, upon request, early in April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Batteries need re-newing which are 56 - 105 Ampere Hours.  \n\nThe engines are Lister 6\u00bd and 12 horse respectively. These engines have been in use since the building of the School, with little or no cost and supply the School with light and water. The condition now is such that a complete overhaul is needed by a Lister mechanic.  \n\nPrompt attention would possibly save a considerable outlay later.  \n\nYours truly,  \n\n[Signature]  \nPrincipal  \nGordon's School.  \n\n[Handwritten note: \"W.A.C.E.\"]  \n\n[Stamp: Touchwood Agency APR 3 1935 PUNNICHY, SASK.]\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose application from the principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School for a set of 56 batteries for the lister lighting plant there, and for an overhaul of the plant by a mechanic.\n\nTwo years ago the batteries were refilled and remade but the principal says they are going out of business again, they are Globalite batteries.\n\nRegards the plant, the small engine cannot handle the load now, and the large one is not in good order either, I think that if the Lister people had a traveller in this vicinity he could advise as to what is needed. I really do not think that the school mechanic is just the right man on the job, but it is hard to get an allround good man who will take school work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Agent Waddy has forwarded a request from the Principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School to be supplied with a set of 56 batteries for the Lister lighting plant and also for the overhauling of the plant by a mechanic.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, in January, 1933, the Department incurred an expenditure of $275 in supplying batteries. If proper care was taken with this equipment, the expenditure does not condemn the need for renewing the batteries. We are doubtful as to the qualifications of the engineer at the school who is in charge of the operation of the equipment. Further, it may be that extra attachments are being used in connection with the lighting equipment, thus running down the batteries.\n\nI would request that you ascertain the requirements and also what work would be necessary in overhauling the Lister G-8 and 12 h.p. engines. We understand that Globe batteries are in use in connection with the lighting plant. These batteries have not given a lengthy period of service at other schools.\n\nPlease forward full information regarding the batteries required to place the lighting system in a good, serviceable condition, the approximate cost and also the cost of overhauling the two engines mentioned above. When this information is received, consideration will be given to authorizing the expenditure.\n\nI would suggest that you consult Mr. Agent Waddy regarding the above. He is being informed that the matter is being placed in your hands. The Department will be pleased if you will state your opinion concerning the services of the engineer or mechanic who is in charge of the equipment at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R.

School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAttention Mr. Frayling\n\nAs per the writer's conversation with you you will find embodied in this report the recommendations which I made for the operation of your 3 and 6 K.W. Lister fully Automatic Lighting Plants.\n\nItem No. 1 - That the entire cooling system, that is, all piping be renewed as the present piping has become so badly corroded that the cooling efficiency of the plant is reduced to approximately one-third of normal. This is very detrimental to the plant as it causes excessive heating on the head which increases cylinder wear as well as higher oil consumption than the engine, under normal conditions, would use.\n\nItem No. 2 - That you change from the grade of oil you are using at present, which is No. 10 to No. 30 or No. 40, preferably No. 40, during the warm season of the year.\n\nItem No. 3 - That the main clapper switches on your switchboard be properly cleaned once a week at least. If the carbons on the clapper switches as well as the brass contacts are not kept properly cleaned, it will eventually burn out the main coils on the clapper switch.\n\nItem No. 4 - That cylinders on both plants be treated at once with a proper scaling compound to remove all scale from the water jacket.\n\nItem No. 5 - That the oil in these plants be renewed every three weeks and their crankcases properly cleaned out.\n\nItem No. 6 - In checking the present batteries of your lighting plants over I found that in their present state they are now practically useless other than for working the automatic features and the period of time which they will last and continue to operate the automatic features is very questionable. I feel that the question of replacing these batteries should be dealt with at the earliest possible date as I found when checking them over that the positive plates were in such a state that they are quite apt to explode from short circuiting which is caused from the sediment forming in the bottom of the jars and coming high enough up to touch the lower parts of the positive and negative plate causing a short circuit to across them.\n\n- When replacing -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWhen replacing these batteries I would recommend strongly that you replace your present set with a 240 ampere hour rather than a 108 ampere hour which you have been using up to date, in that the plants are sufficiently big enough to take care of a larger size battery and by having a larger size battery you will get more efficiency out of the plant when charging the batteries. Also, the heavier battery will stand the discharge as well as charge the battery than a smaller battery.\n\nAs an example of which I refer to: You have in your smaller Generating unit a supply of 30 amperes when running at a maximum output. The present battery you have can only be charged at from eight to ten amperes. Therefore, you run your small plant at only one-third of its capacity to charge your present battery, but if you had a 240 ampere hour battery on it would be possible to run your plant closer to its maximum output and would charge the larger battery in the same period of time as it would the smaller battery, thus giving you in the larger battery, double the storage amperage. You will, no doubt, see from the above example that it is more profitable in this instance to install a larger battery even if the initial cost of installation is considerably higher.\n\nWe believe that if these instructions are carefully followed, you will eliminate considerable wear on your engines and cut your operating cost down considerably.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED.\n\n\"W.

Medland.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 121-1-5, dated April 9th last, with regard to the condition of the batteries and the Lister 6\u00bd and 12 H.P. engines at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, Touchwood Agency.\n\nThe roads were very bad during the early part of April and I was not able to make the trip until the end of the month when I visited the school, taking with me the Shop Foreman of the Magneto Service Station of this City. In the meantime the Principal had had Mr. W. J. Montgomery, a mechanical expert of Mumford, Medland Limited, of Winnipeg, who handle the Lister electric lighting units, visit the school and examine the equipment. Mr. Montgomery submitted a detailed statement of the repairs required for the engine, but did not give an estimate of the labour. I wrote him requesting this information and his report came to hand during my absence this week at the Pelly Agency. I am enclosing his report, dated the 23rd May, giving the price of different sizes of batteries which he recommends be operated with this unit. I am also submitting a detailed report, dated April 16th, in connection with this plant.\n\nIt would appear to be the opinion of both Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Fanning that the batteries supplied in January, 1933, were too small to carry the load in connection with this unit. There are no extra attachments being used in connection with the batteries. The report of Mumford, Medland Limited submitted by their Agent Mr. Montgomery gives very full information regarding the condition of the plant and it is unnecessary for me to repeat what he says. I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to have this firm do the work. I have not been able to find any mechanics.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nfind any mechanics in this City who are familiar with the Lister Automatic unit.\n\nWith reference to your enquiry regarding the qualifications of the engineer in charge, I may say that I was not favorably impressed with him. I have made considerable enquiry in a quiet way. Before taking up the work at this school, this man was engaged for three years with the Regina Steam Laundry and from what I could gather he is quite a good steam engineer, but he has not shown and no one can tell me his experience in connection with electric lighting plants; and from the condition of his plant I would say that he is not qualified and inclined to be a careless operator. It is my opinion that he should be replaced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Murison's letter hereunder regarding the lighting plant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, I would recommend that a new battery with capacity of 240 ampere hours be provided, also that the Mamford, Medland Ltd., who are Agents, I understand, for the Lister Company, be authorized to make the necessary repairs to the plant. I note Mr. Murison's remarks with reference to the man in charge of this equipment at the school, and unless he is competent to operate this equipment it would certainly be a source of expense to the Department.\n\nArchitect.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, Regina, has furnished a report regarding the condition of the lighting plant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School (Gordon Reserve, No. 86 - Electoral District of Last Mountain). An expert of Mumford Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, who handle the Lister electric lighting units in use at the school, examined the equipment and submitted a detailed statement of the repairs required for the engine and in regard to the batteries. He states the present batteries are now practically useless and that they will require to be renewed.\n\nMr. Orr, Architect of this Department, recommends that a new battery, with a capacity of 240 ampere hours, be supplied, and also that Mumford Medland, Limited, who are agents for the Lister Company, be authorized to make the necessary repairs to the plant.\n\nThe cost of supplying the batteries will be approximately $750 and the repairs to the engine and dynamo, $265 - a total of, approximately, $1015. Funds can be provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education. I would request your authority for the expenditure and that Mumford Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, agents for the Lister Company, who supplied the present equipment, be authorized to make the necessary repairs to the plant. I shall be pleased to be advised, also, if the order for supplying the batteries, of the type mentioned above, may be placed with this firm or what other firms should be asked to quote.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir;\n\nI have the honor to enclose report on visit made to the Gordon Indian Residential School. I am at this place frequently but do not report each visit, but I keep in touch with conditions there all the time. The Inspector is handling the water and electric light plant situations so I am merely mentioning them to show I know what is needed as I see it.\n\nThe water plant is giving quite a lot of trouble and it seems that the pump is not able to do the work. The Principal went to a lot of expense on this job before he located what the trouble really was.\n\nThe electric light plant requires a lot of repairs and a new set of batteries. Mr. Morrison is getting all these I understand.\n\nThe water filter is giving trouble but the principal knows what is wrong and no doubt will attend to it.\n\nThe principal has kalsomined and painted the interior of the building from cellar to roof and is paying for material and labor. He asks the Department to allow him a grant of $125.00 to help pay for the material, he will pay all labor. The work would have cost much more than this and I told the principal he should have asked for the allotment before. However, if there are any funds on hand for this work I recommend he be compensated.\n\nMr. Frayling asks for linoleum covering for the sewing room, it is cement floor, the finish keeps wearing away and is dusty and uneven at present. The area is about 700 sq feet. He also requests that he be given a granary as there is none here, he asks for allotment of $250.00. He also asks for consideration of an amount of $50.00 to get material to make a flour warehouse inside the old hostel building here. All these items are necessary if funds are available.\n\nThe school has in a good garden and farm this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, reporting on a visit made to the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the Principal's request, that a granary be erected, at a cost of $250, I beg to refer you to your letter of April 14, 1934, enclosing a letter from the Principal, in which he requested that a galvanized bin, of medium size, be supplied. You also furnished a diagram of a portable corrugated granary, at a price of $116.00, f. o. b. Winnipeg. In view of this letter, the Department included, in the Estimates for the current fiscal year, the sum of $150, to purchase a granary of the type mentioned. You might advise if a portable corrugated granary would not be satisfactory for the needs of this school, or, if not, what other type of granary you would recommend.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure, to an amount not exceeding $50.00, in the purchase of material to make a flour ware-house inside the old hostel building. It is understood the school authorities will perform the labour. Purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list and you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison has submitted a report regarding the condition of the lighting plant and the need of new batteries, at a total estimated cost of $1,175. The supplying of the batteries and the repairs to the engine and dynamos are receiving attention. In view of the fact that this is an unforeseen expenditure, no funds were specially provided for the purpose. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to reimburse the Principal for the cost of the kalsomine and paint used in the redecorating of the interior of the school building. The only way this could be done would be to utilize the funds provided for the supplying of a granary. If the Principal would rather have the accounts paid for the cost of the kalsomine and paint than the providing of the granary, you may forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly receipted, attached to vouchers, in favour of the Principal - when payment will be made.\n\nWith reference to the linoleum requested, please have the Principal state the type and quality and, if possible, the approximate cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, Regina, has furnished a report regarding the condition of the lighting plant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School (Gordon Reserve, No. 86 - Electoral District of Last Mountain). An expert of Mumford-Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, who handle the Lister electric lighting units in use at the school, examined the equipment and submitted a detailed statement of the repairs required for the engine and in regard to the batteries. He states the present batteries are now practically useless and that they will require to be renewed.\n\nMr. Orr, Architect of this Department, recommends that a new battery, with a capacity of 240 ampere hours, be supplied, and also that Mumford Medland, Limited, who are agents for the Lister Company, be authorized to make the necessary repairs to the plant.\n\nThe cost of supplying the batteries will be approximately $750 and the repairs to the engine and dynamo, $265 - a total of, approximately, $1015. Funds can be provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education. I would request your authority for the expenditure and that Mumford Medland, Limited, Winnipeg, agents for the Lister Company, who supplied the present equipment, be authorized to make the necessary repairs to the plant. I shall be pleased to be advised, also, if the order for supplying the batteries, of the type mentioned above, may be placed with this firm or what other firms should be asked to quote.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 28th, 1935.\n\nMr. McGill:\n\nThe Minister approves of Mumford-Medland Limited being engaged to make the necessary repairs to the plant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nPrices on new batteries are to be obtained from the Lorne Electric Company, the Magneto Service Station, and Hall and Cameron Electric Company, all of Regina; and Gillis & Warren, Northern Engineering & Development Co., Ltd., D. Ackland & Son, and the Mumford-Medland Company, all of Winnipeg.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, July 4, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A C.E. of the first instant, regarding the condition of the batteries and engines of the lighting plant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School and enclosing quotations which you received for the supplying of new batteries and the overhauling of the engines.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Minister has directed that Mumford-Medland, Limited, of Winnipeg, be engaged to overhaul the engines; make the necessary repairs and place the plant in a good, serviceable condition.\n\nWith reference to the supplying of new batteries, the Minister directs that prices be obtained for the supplying of a new battery, with a capacity of 240 ampere hours, from the following:\u2014\n\nLorne Electric Company, Regina, Sask.\nMagneto Service Station,\nHall & Cameron Electric Co., \" \nGillies & Warren, Winnipeg,\nNorthern Engineering & Development Co., Winnipeg,\nD. Ackland & Son, Winnipeg,\nMumford-Medland Company, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nYou may place the order with the firm considered by you to quote the lowest price for the supplying of the type of batteries which you believe most serviceable. If possible, an allowance should be obtained on the present old batteries. After the batteries have been installed, the engines overhauled and the lighting plant placed in good condition, you should be served accordingly on triplicate properly certified, covering the cost. The Department will leave this matter in your hands, to obtain the above equipment, have the engines and plant overhauled and all the work completed at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter #121-1-5 of June 29th last regards certain matters required for the Gordon Indian Residential School I beg to say I have taken these matters up with the principal.\n\nMr. Frayling would like to get the refund on the money spent for renovating the school, but he also wants the granary. I have been trying for quite a time to get a granary for this school and beg to recommend that the sum mentioned in your letter $150.00 be allotted and I will see that we get a granary, and if we cannot complete it with this sum at least the outside will be made weather proof, what I have in mind is something like we have on the reserves for farming instructors use.\n\nRegards the linoleum. I took this matter up with the T.Eaton Co in Regina who handle work of this sort for institutions, they quote me as follows for the 67 yards required.\n\n| Item                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 67 sq yds medium grade battleship linoleum |          | $2.10 per yard | $140.70 |\n| 6 gallon linoleum cement      |          | $1.25      | $7.50   |\n| Labor of experienced man      |          |            | $20.10  |\n| all f.o.b.

Should the cost exceed this amount, the school will have to be responsible for all costs in excess of the $150 provided.\n\nI am enclosing an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure in the erection of the granary and also covering the amount authorized in official letter of June 29th, last, in the purchase of materials to make a flour ware-house inside the old hostel building. After the work has been completed, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials and for any outside labour that it may be necessary to employ. It is hoped, however, that the school authorities will be able to provide the greater part of the labour. When forwarding the vouchers for payment of the labour, you should state definitely the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid. Please state, on each copy of the voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3519.\n\nWith reference to the supplying of the quantity of Battleship linoleum required, I regret that the Department will have no funds this year to pay for the cost of this material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If the lighting plant and the other mechanical equipment in a residential school are not in charge of a very competent person, trouble is caused the management and considerable expense is entailed both for the Department and the school.\n\nTaking the above into consideration, I consider that it would be in the best interests of the Gordon's School to secure, at the earliest possible date, a new engineer who is capable of properly handling all the mechanical equipment in the school. I trust that you will cooperate with the Department in this regard.\n\nMr. Inspector Murison is being directed to visit the Gordon's School about the end of September with a view to interviewing the new engineer and reporting to the Department whether or not he is fully qualified for the very important work that is required of him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Warner, engineer, is now on holiday. I have had occasion to speak of his seeming indifference to his work and in June gave him a month to apply himself more thoroughly or tender his resignation, since which time there has been a great improvement.\n\nI procured this man through the Saskatchewan Government department Steam Boilers and Industrial Inspection, and he holds First Class papers for Boiler and Electrical work. On his return to the school I will forward you his credentials that you might know it was on the face of apparent ability I engaged him. I might add that there is a great difficulty in obtaining an all-round, or what I term an institutional, engineer. I will obtain the best possible for the position, but apparently this can only be proven after actual work, not by written Provincial examinations.\n\nI might add that but for one set of batteries there has been no expense to the Lister Engines and plant since installed until latterly,\nand they have been in daily use since 1930. Taking this fact into consideration the cost now entailed is what might be expected, and that the present and previous batteries were not of the right capacity.\n\nMr. Warner commenced his duties here on July 12th, 1935. Mr. G.F. Angel, our previous engineer, suffered a stroke and left for England with the assurance that when recovered he would be reinstated. I regret to say this will not happen.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nGordon's Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nPrincipal\nR. W.

(Warner assisted Montgomery with the installation and the overhauling of the Lister Engines.) Adding that having become accustomed to the duties here, knowing the machinery etc., and my having given him a good talk as to the cleanliness etc. etc., it might be well to give him further trial. Also that men are not easily obtained for the all round work called for in institutions such as this.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Warner's certificates for your inspection and will ask for the return of same with careful mailing.\n\nI have gone into the matter thoroughly again with Mr. Warner and he rightly claims that were he not absolutely efficient he would not be granted the Diplomas issued by the Provincial Government, and has never had complaint from the Provincial Boiler Inspector who visits plants at least once every year, and he shows 19 years experience and that number of inspections.

The Batteries Company made a mistake and did not make this shipment prepaid. Consequently we wrote to Mr. Murison and asked that the freight be paid on arrival and charged back to us. Later, through the original shippers we were able to have the freight charges reversed and sent to us at Winnipeg and it was only upon receipt of the expense bill for $44.50 that we discovered our original error in the weight and you were billed with this amount without any reference to the original invoice.\n\nWe are, therefore, enclosing our cheque for $11.00 and trust you will find this in order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.M./JW\nenc1.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report that quite a lot of equipment at Gordon Indian Residential School requires attention; the main trouble is caused by the water containing minerals which have eaten out the various parts of the plant, as well as filling others with hard sediment.\n\n1. Some sections of the radiators are eaten out and leaking badly; this matter can be left over at present as they will last out the winter.\n\n2. The water distribution system requires the following:\n   - 3 doz pair nickel compression taps for basins.\n   - 1 doz nickel compression taps for baths\u2014hot & cold combined.\n   - 2 doz 5 inch copper toilet floats.\n   - 2 doz brass toilet float rods 12\".\n\n3. Boiler requires one 1 inch straight away valve on bottom of water column and one 1\u00bd inch blow down valve for back of low pressure boiler.\n\n4. Kitchen ranges require two complete tops for McClary Army Ranges; they are burnt out. (General Steel Wares).\n\n5. Pipes for cooling Lister plant are filled up with sediment which cannot be removed and this fills up the tops of water jackets in the plant and causes a lot of expense each year. New pipes should be supplied for this part of the plant. (Midland Mumford, Winnipeg, Man.).\n\n6. The filter here is made by International Filter Co of Chicago. The sand inside the filter requires changing; I understand it is quite a costly matter, however, you have probably the same plant elsewhere and may know more about it. In any case the refill should be supplied. The engineer says it is a job for an expert or the agent of the company to make this change.\n\n7. The back of fire box on low pressure boiler is burnt out; the engineer says he could fix this if he is supplied with 300 lbs of fire proof cement called Plibrico; if you consider this correct it should be supplied. I never used it myself; the engineer is quite competent and says this is the right material. He says it might cost about $25.00. If this is not supplied you would have to get fire brick to make fire wall in Leonard low pressure boiler.\n\n8. The upright boiler used for laundry etc requires retubing again; it will have to be taken to Regina when roads open up. This is another job that only lasts a year and a half with the water we have here. It is being plugged up in various spots now and is dangerous.\n\n9. The jacket heater which was supplied a couple of years ago has corroded up again; this boiler supplies the hot water used throughout the whole building. It is now\u2014\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 8)\nIt is now plugged up from the outside with an iron plate held on with pressure clamp and will not last much longer; the pressure to supply the water throughout the place must be about 50 lbs. This jacket heater does not appear to be suitable. I enclose circular from the Leonard people of what they think should be used. Something will have to be supplied in immediate future and you might consider using the sort described. If so the measurements given on the plan would be required.\n\nI beg to recommend that all the above be given consideration as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nEX'D.\n\nFebruary 29, 1936.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Pratt,\n\nIt will be necessary to carry out some urgent repairs to the plumbing and heating systems at the Gordon's Indian Residential School at Punnichy, Sask.\n\nWill you please give me the name of a competent plumber and steamfitter, who may be employed for this work?\n\nPunnichy is in the electoral district of Yorkton.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFebruary 29, 1936.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Pratt.\n\nIt will be necessary to carry out some urgent repairs to the plumbing and heating systems at the Gordons Indian Residential School at Punnichy, Sask.\n\nWill you please give me the name of a competent plumber and steamfitter, who may be employed for this work?\n\nPunnichy is in the electoral district of Yorkton.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nEX'D.\n\nMarch 3, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, with regard to the repairs required to the plumbing and heating systems at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, I would ask you to kindly arrange with E.

In this connection you should state if you consider the Engineer at the school is competent to handle this equipment. The frequent requests for repairs lead the Department to question whether the whole trouble in connection with this equipment is due to the water or if it is being properly attended to by the Engineer.\n\n7. You may arrange for the purchase of 300 lbs. fireproof cement to repair the back of the firebox on the low pressure boiler. It is noted the cost will be approximately $25.00.\n\n8. With reference to re-tubing the upright boiler used for laundry purposes, I would request that you will advise the approximate cost in having it taken to Regina and re-tubed.\n\nIf possible to have any of the above authorized supplies purchased and accounts, covering the cost, dated previous to the end of the present month, properly certified by you and forwarded to reach the Department by the middle of April, next, payment could be made from the current year's Appropriation. However, if this is not possible, the funds will have to be provided from the coming year's Appropriation.

H. Carter Plumbing and Heating Company, Yorkton, supply and install new jacket heater, Gordon's School, price quoted, your telegram.

It is hoped that you will be able to arrange to have this work completed by the date mentioned.\n\nRegarding the other equipment required, as mentioned in your letter above referred to, I would state as follows:\n\n1. Please advise, later, regarding renewing the sections of the boilers eaten out and leaking. It is noted that these will have to be renewed before next winter. You should furnish an estimate of the cost.\n\n2. You may arrange for the purchase of the following equipment\n\nJ.W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nre File No. 121--1--5F.

File No. 121--1--5F.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the request of Mr. J. W. Waddy, Agent of Indian Affairs at Punnichy, I went over to the Gordon Indian Residential School and looked over the various plumbing and heating requirements. The list of these requirements is as follows,\u2014\n\nNo. 1. Jacket Heater.\n\nSince being at the school the jacket heater has gone out of commission entirely, so have wired you as follows,\u2014\n(Jacket heater out of commission. No hot water. Price of new unit complete same as old one. Installed $175.00. Other estimates following by mail. This is urgent. Please wire instructions to E.H. Carter, Yorkton.)\n\nIn reference to the steel tubeless heater as mentioned in No. 1. I may say this is not readily obtainable, and owing to the urgency of the situation, I quoted you as above, for the same size and make of heater.\n\nI received a quotation on a horizontal five-tube boiler which has given good service at different points. The cost of this boiler installed at Gordon School would be $305.00. This boiler has a 35% greater heating capacity than the B.32 heater now in use.\n\nIn dealing further with the hot water supply system, I would like to point out that the storage capacity of 250 gallons is on the small side for a population of approximately 140 persons. However, I am just pointing this out for your information, which may be dealt with at some future date.\n\nNo. 2. Retubing vertical boiler.\n\nI propose retubing this at the School and the job complete will be $82.50 (Eighty Two Dollars and fifty cents).\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, March 30, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to certain replacements which you consider should be made at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nThrough the office of Mr. Agent Waddy an order has already been placed with you to install a new jacket heater.\n\nYou should submit quotations for the other repairs to Mr. Waddy, and he will report to the Department. For your information, I may say that our regular procedure is to deal through the office of the local Indian Agent. When his reply is received, we will decide whether or not funds can be made available for additional repairs. You will understand that only a limited amount is available for repairs at each of our residential schools, and, consequently, it is not always possible to authorize all the repairs that might be considered advisable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Waddy Esq.\nIndian Agent\nTouchwood Agency\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy,\n\nThe enclosed bill from the North American Lumber Co. is for goods required for finishing the Dam at the Lake.\n\nThe Lake dropped considerably last year and in the Fall, weather prevented the completion. There is every indication of a quantity of water this spring and I will guarantee a completed satisfactory job; though it will cost well above the estimate given, viz: $200.00 by Mr. Harding, Surveyor.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\n\nP. S. This account was charged to the School in error.\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 597, amounting to $99.25 in favour of North American Lumber Co. Ltd., Punnichy, Sask., for material supplied to Gordon's School in connection with construction of dam.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 121-1-5 dated March 7th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nForm No. 518\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to part of your letter 121-1-5 of March 21st last regarding repairs at Gordon Indian Residential School I beg to report as follows.\n\nThe cost of replacing the pipes etc on cooling system of Lister Plant will be $35.00 if done by E.H.Carter.\n\nThe cost of taking the boiler to Regina to be retubed would be about $70.00 for the work, last time it cost this sum. The cost of truck service or freight would be about $20.00 for return trip, extra to above. E.H.Carter has offered to send a man here to do this job for $82.50.\n\nRegards the firewall in the heating boiler the plumber says that $25.00 would be useless, that it would cost $115.50 for job done with best material, and if fire brick alone was used it would cost $89.50.\n\nYour remarks to note #6 about the trouble perhaps being due to the engineer are noted; however, when even the taps all corrode up you cannot blame the engineer. I have plenty of samples of the sediment. It would appear that a water softener of some sort should be installed here, if it is not put in all the pipes in the walls of the building will soon be plugged and the cost of installing new pipes throughout the building will run into thousands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to certain repairs required at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. You might arrange for the following:\n\nReplacing the pipes on the cooling system of the Lister plant - $35.00\nRepairing boiler - $2.50\nRepairing firewall and heating boiler - $15.50\n\nThe above items, amounting to $233.00, practically exhaust the amount available in the current year's Estimates for improvements and repairs at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. The small balance that we have appropriated for this purpose at that school will be retained, in the event of any emergency occurring between now and March 31st, next.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter, the Department will have no funds for the purchase of a water softener this year.\n\nMr. E. H. Carter, Yorkton, Sask., should be engaged to do the repairs authorized in this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. W.

The roof keeps falling and has had to be shored up at different times all winter, until it's becoming difficult and dangerous to work in.\n\nThe proper and lasting building should be Cement Walls, Roof etc. and would cost about $350.00 but we could go about 6 feet further into the hill and by using cement and lumber at a cost of about $200.00.\n\nThis is an absolute necessity and should be commenced in the very near future as an accident might happen at any time.\n\nTrusting this will be put in hand without further delay,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have the honor to request that the Department authorise funds for following works at Gordon Indian Residential School if funds are available.\n\nRenovating dwelling of the principal $150.00\nConstructing root cellar at school 350.00\n\nLetters from the principal are enclosed regarding these items.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDear Sir;\n\nI have the honor to report that on Sunday, the 6th inst., a fire occurred at the Gordon Indian Residential School and destroyed a garage there, the property of the Department.\n\nThe garage was a lumber shed, about 14x30 eight foot walls, valued about $350.00 I judge.\n\nThe contents were two cars, cutter, jumper, scales and four driving robes property of school and employees.\n\nFire is presumed to have started from a coal stove, it was discovered about 10.30 A.M. Other buildings alongside the garage were saved by use of the hose and water system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 12, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the destruction by fire of the garage at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt appears from your letter that the coal stove was used for heating the garage, and it is considered that care should have been taken to avoid fire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

If so, what would be the cost F.O.B. Punnichy? Could the school staff install these or would it be necessary for you to send a man to install them and what would be the cost of installation? If they do not form part of Lister equipment, where do we obtain them?\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, and shall be glad if you will reply direct to the Secretary, forwarding me a copy of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

These twin tanks have shown slight leakage for some time, and cement and etc. has been used to stop it. Now the leakage has started in several places and makes the replacement imperative, with as little delay as possible. If leakage became rapid it would seriously impair the Lister Engines and put our Light and Power entirely out of commission.\n\nYour kind and prompt attention will be esteemed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal,\nGordon's School.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT\nTouchwood Agency\nPunnichy, Sask.\nJan 5th 1937.\n\nIIA.

This is for a Building 10 feet shorter than the old one.\n\n6,000 shingles 2,000 feet Ship Lap\n1,200 feet Siding 5 rolls Tar Paper\n15 Bags Cement Nails and Hardware $15.00\n110 2 x 4's 12'\n\nThis would cost around $350.00 I would think. Labor Gravel, extras etc. about $100.00. This could be built by ourselves with Indian labor for a sum not exceeding this amount I think, may be a little less or more.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal,\nGordon's School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose four letters from the principal at the Gordon Indian Residential School asking for the following appropriations.\n\n1. Garage for use of school car ---------------- $450.00.\nLast fall a fire took place at this school and burnt up our garage and two school cars. The principal says he requires more storage room at the school, he used part of the other garage for storage. He says he will build a store house from school funds if the Department will authorize the $450.00 he wants for a garage. As the fire took place after the estimates went in for this year no funds were asked for this purpose. It was no fault of construction or of anyone but the school staff that the fire occurred, they put a coal stove in the garage and next time they visited the place the stove had got in its work first. They were looking for trouble in my opinion. I am not recommending this expenditure but can say the school needs a garage.\n\n2. Renovation of principal's cottage ------------ $100.00.\nWhen I get funds for renovating houses of the employees here we are quite satisfied if we get $50.00, we usually get $10.00 each annually, but as this place has not got the annual treatment I would be obliged if you would consider giving authority to spend up to $50.00. If so would it be suitable to get wall paper and other material from T.Eaton Co., Regina.\n\n3. Battleship linoleum for sewing room floor. The cement here is all gone dusty from poor material in construction, it should be covered. See my letter LIA.C.E. July 10 1935 on this subject. The cost would be about $170.00. I got my figures at that time from T.Eaton Co., Regina who handle a lot of this sort of work. I recommend that it be supplied for sake of health of the pupils.\n\n4. When I visited the school yesterday I checked up on this request which is for renovation of the outside of the school. Five places require a lot of brick replacement, at doors and windows. All outside window casings need paint.\n\nover.\nIt is hard to figure cost of the work until I know how extensive a job the brick work is, we have to dig in and find out. I would think that the labor and mortar etc would amount to about $20.00. The painting of casings etc would amount to $100.00. The principal mentions inside decorations. Every year he has kilnformed the inside of the place from top to bottom out of material he bought from school funds. I think he should be allowed $100.00 of material, this is the first time in six years he has asked for anything in this line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 21, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to requests received from the Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department is not prepared to consider authorizing the expenditure that would be required for the erection of a new garage.\n\nWith reference to supplying linoleum for the sewing room floor, would it not be possible to paint the floor with cement floor paint? You might let me have an estimate of the cost of improving the floors in this manner.\n\nThe other requests mentioned in your letter are receiving consideration and you will be advised later regarding our decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.

A new cement floor would cost more than the linoleum and probably would last longer, I favor the linoleum myself but will put in anything you suggest, however, something has to be done or else shut up the room and use it for storage, the dust there now makes it unhealthy for the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, also your letter of the 14th ultimo, the Department approves the following expenditures at the Gordon's Indian Residential School:\n\n(1) $50.00 for renovation of Principal's residence.\n(2) $20.00 for repairing brickwork at the school.\n(3) $100.00 for painting window casings.\n(4) $170.00 in purchase of linoleum for sewing room floor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

He recommends replacing this boiler with an all steel one as manufactured by The Leonard people and states that in addition to being all steel it has a clean out.\n\nIn view of these facts and the fact that the engineer at the school is quite competent to install the heater, I would recommend that an all steel heater be supplied, that it be bought wholesale and that the school engineer instal it.\n\nIn support of this I might point out that the present heater is similar to Trumpet Mogul No. H.32 in J.H.Ashdown's catalogue price $95.00, whereas the Department paid the local plumber some $175.00 for boiler and installation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

On account of the varying conditions surrounding their installation, we do not guarantee our Boilers otherwise.\n\nBoth on account of increased efficiency and greater economy we recommend that all Boilers be thoroughly protected by a substantial covering of asbestos.\n\nINFORMATION REQUIRED FOR ORDERING BOILERS AND BOILER REPAIRS\n\nState plainly the catalogue, name, number and rated capacity of Boiler required; also number of square feet of Direct and if any, Direct-Indirect or Hot Blast Radiation, that Boiler is to take care of.\n\nWhen ordering repair parts for any of the Boilers listed in this catalogue, or for that matter for any other boiler, first give the size, number and catalogue name, or name on front of the Boiler. Next give the factory or serial number. This is usually found on the little brass plate on one of the front doors. It is well to mention all letters or numbers in order in which they appear on part required. In case it is impossible to give any of the above requirements, send a sketch having dimensions marked on it, and a detailed description of part wanted. It will also be well to mention year number where same appears on front of Boiler, and if possible, the year in which the Boiler was installed, or better still, the date and number of the invoice pertaining to it. Especially mention whether the boiler is Round or Square. Where Round, if it is a grate bar that is required, mention which one, numbering from the front, and whether it has a lug or hook on it. If it is a door or door-frame, especially mention which one.\n\nWhere section is required for a Sectional Boiler, mention which one, numbering from the front, and whether same has any tapped openings, and the size of the tapping, and whether the tapping is required or not. Where it is a grate bar, mention which one, numbering from the front, and whether it shakes on the left-hand side or the right-hand side.\n\nWhere a Boiler has no serial number on the little brass plate, please mention the fact that it has no serial number.\n\nWith these particulars we will be able to ship repairs promptly.\n\nGive full shipping instructions.\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nIn answer to your letter 121-1-5 of the 14th inst regards jacket heater for the Gordon Indian Residential School, enclosing circular of the Leonard people.\n\nThe circular is returned herewith, also a cut of the old jacket heater which type is useless here but gives an idea of the size in use.\n\nAs far as I can determine the size required is what is quoted as a 5 horse power heater. I cannot give you quotation as to price as this is not available, it will have to be supplied you by the Leonard people an Ontario firm.\n\nThe following information should be submitted to the boiler people before they ship the boiler:\n\nInlet should be constructed to accommodate a two inch pipe, as shown on the circular, inlet is near bottom of jacket heater.\n\nOutlet should also be for a 2\" pipe.\n\nIf impossible to supply outlets of this size we will have to change the pipe system to the storage tank etc., I think the company can put in outlets as required if it is brought to their notice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nSupt of welfare & training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nOn February 29th, 1936, I forwarded a memorandum to Mr. Pratt requesting the name of a competent plumber and steamfitter for some urgent repairs to the plumbing and heating systems at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.

I tried to get in touch with Dr. Robertson Regina, as you were away, on three occasions, he also was away from the city, so the only alternative was to get help myself.\n\nMcPhearson and Thorn of Regina who installed the pump seemed to be the right source for information. Mr. McPhearson came down Thursday with a man to put things in shape but was unable to do so, they returned to Regina for materials. I suggested that Mr. McPhearson should see Dr. Robertson to report the trouble, he spoke to me later on the phone that Dr. Robertson was still out of the city, I told him to carry on as we must have water. Whilst knowing I have not the authority to order and payment to be made by the Department, I hope that you will explain the predicament and urgent need for immediate action so that grant may be made for this work. You will remember my having spoken to you recently when here at the school, that the water supply should be given serious thought, the Lake having gone down considerably again this summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICE\n\nBox 459, Prince Albert, Sask.,\n18th September, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Water Situation, Gordon's Residential School.\n\nIn accordance with the instructions contained in your wire of the 4th inst., I visited the above school on September 11th.\n\nThe general scheme of the water system for the school is as follows:- Water is pumped from a small lake (really a slough) by a small rotary pump, capacity approximately 2000 gallons per hour driven by a gasoline unit, to a storage tank at the school. The water is treated in this tank and is pumped from there to pressure tanks in the school by a small typhoon self-oiling displacement pump electrically driven, capacity 1000 gallons per hour.\n\nThe difficulty encountered is in the suction line of the small rotary pump. The lake has lowered approximately eighteen feet in the last six years and this present summer the level has dropped approximately four and one-half feet. The 3\" suction hose had been carried out approximately forty feet into the lake, below frost action, and thence along the lake bottom. This line plugged up and is possibly broken. A temporary suction line has been installed at the edge of the lake but will not do during the winter.\n\nIn my opinion the actual suction line should not be continued out into the lake below frost action because of the difficulty encountered in repairing the valves and line.\n\nI would recommend that a well with timber lining be constructed near the shore connected by a pipe to the lake (approximately eighty feet long laid below frost action) as the subsoil is yellow clay, which would not permit sufficient filtration even for the small demand required. The suction line of the pump would then be located in the well and accessible at all times. The well would have to be covered and protected from frost action as much as possible.\n\nThe Chief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIt is essential that the pipe leading from the well to the lake be in at least eight feet of water so that in the event of another dry season or two the pipe will not have to be lowered. In the event of two more seasons as dry as the present one, I doubt if there will be enough water left to supply the school demand, which is approximately 5000 gallons per day.\n\nI believe that the recommendation made above is the most satisfactory rather than to go to the expense of locating a deep well. This may be necessary in the event of continued drought but, should average rainfall occur in the next seasons, there will be sufficient water in the small lake to supply the needs of the school.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost of construction of the proposed well and pipe into the lake:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Pipe & Fittings       | $125.00|\n| Lumber, etc.          | $130.00|\n| Labour                | $175.00|\n| Rental Equipment      | $30.00 |\n\nTotal: $460.00\n\nThe fact that the intake will have to be carried below frost line, necessitating cofferdamming, accounts for the relatively high cost of such a small job. It may be found that certain of the present intake pipe may be salvaged without incurring too much expense.\n\nThe other alternative of laying a new intake below frost action could be considered. However the difficulty encountered in reaching the intake in case of trouble does not warrant the slight saving that might be made.\n\nAs I have mentioned, the only other alternative would be to consider the drilling of a deep well as I understand there are no shallow wells in that vicinity. Should this be considered it would be necessary to have a geologist's report of that particular section. The well would have to be located reasonably close to the school and possibly the location of the pump house and discharge lines would have to be relocated. I understand from Mr. Waddy that the school location is almost on the line of Sections 10 and 11, Township 27, Range 17, West of the 2nd Meridian.\nIn regard to the estimate of the cost, the estimate for labour may be high should conditions prove better than anticipated. This particular type of work really requires a pile driver for the sheet piling but the job is too small to warrant such expense as there is no equipment of that kind in the vicinity.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

For instance the Iron Pipe for further extension to the Intake Pipe was so long in coming that I had a length taken from another place and attached, as mud was being brought up. This makes unnecessary extra work as we now have to replace with the new pipe since received. The intake at present is in 3 feet of water, the pipe exposed some 40 feet. If frost sets in the pipe will be frozen resulting in no water at the School.\n\nI have again gone to the expense of having the depth of water taken at Fort Lake about 3 miles directly East of the School resulting in the following; from shore to centre varying from 4' to 16'. It has an expanse of water twice or three times larger than the one we draw from now.

On the first heavy frost our supply is cut off. The intake now is in about 2 feet of water - the pipe lying in some 25 feet of water varying in depth from the bank of the lake to the intake valve.\n\nIs it not possible to have something done to assure the School having this remedied at once?\nDr. Robertson,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nI have had the depth of water taken at Fort Lake which is about 2\u00bd to 3 miles East of here and it varies from 4 feet to 16 feet of water.

At an elevation of three feet above the bottom of the well sixty-five feet of 3\" pipe let into the lake to a screened inlet. The end of the pipe is 2\u00bd feet from the lake bottom and is subjected to a head of 4.5 feet of water. It was necessary to cofferdam approximately 45 feet in order to make the excavation and considerable difficulty was experienced in driving the sheet piling (made up of three pieces of 1\" x 8\" plank with 1\u00bc\" tongue and groove) as it had to be driven by hand and the lake bottom was exceptionally rocky, resulting in numerous leaks in the cofferdam. In order not to have to cofferdam the full 65 feet to lay the pipe two 45\u00b0 elbows were used to allow the last length of pipe to be lowered after the back filling was completed. The pipe is back filled to a depth of eight feet, with a layer of hay near the pipe for added protection. The pipe from the lake to the well may be regulated by a 3\" gate valve. The original idea was to have the pump take the water right from the well. However Mr. Field had considerable trouble with black muck seeping into the well and eventually had to connect the suction of the pump to the pipe leading into the lake. What really should have been done when the excavation revealed black muck was to make the lining of a construction similar to the sheet piling only with a 3\" tongue and groove. However the system is operating satisfactorily and, if found necessary, the well...\"\ncould be concrete lined at some future date. When it was found necessary to connect the suction clear through to the lake, the last length of pipe was swung up by means of the elbows and a float valve connected.\n\nOwing to the severe frost conditions it was necessary to protect the temporary intake from freezing. This was not anticipated when my original estimate was prepared, also the amount of trouble experienced with the cofferdamming was not expected, hence the necessity of additional funds.\n\nThe well section itself has been adequately protected from frost.\n\nThe expenditure, with the exception of the pipe and fittings, is as follows:\n\nLabour........ $327.04\nLumber........ 138.18\nNails, etc.... 5.38\n\n$470.60\n\nThe question of how long the new intake will prove satisfactory depends on whether or not the drought season continues as there is no inlet or outlet to the lake.\n\nThere is a sizeable lake approximately three and a quarter miles away, from which water could be drained into the lake at the school and I had Field run a set of levels over and gather certain information, which I will forward in the near future in case the question of feasibility of locating a deep well or filling the lake by draining from this other lake comes up.*\n\nFrom this report, it will be noted that considerable trouble was experienced in the work carried out. The system is now operating satisfactorily but owing to the size of the lake from which water is taken, Mr. Dempster seems to be doubtful as to whether the water supply question has been finally settled for this school. He has had certain surveys run with regard to the supplementing of water in the small lake from a larger lake 3\u00bd miles away. When Mr. Dempster's report is received regarding the findings of these surveys, you will be advised.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd.) T. S. Mills.\nDecember 15, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Water supply, Gordon's Residential School, Punnichy.\n\nI am forwarding herewith, for your information, copy of our Engineer's report on the work done to provide a water supply for the above School. You will note that adequate protection against frost has been given to the well and to the pipeline leading to the lake. However, as the lake at the intake is not of any great depth, some trouble might be experienced there if the lake level lowers to any great extent throughout the winter months. You will note that our Engineer is not entirely satisfied with the supply and that he has been making some investigations of a water supply from a lake some 3\u00bd miles away.\n\nDirector.\n27th December, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Gordon's Residential School, Punnichy.\n\nThe Chief Engineer advises that the total expenses incurred for work in connection with the water supply for the above school totalled $666.82.

W. Waddy, Touchwood Agency, in which he states the need of extensive repairs to the water system at the Gordon Indian Residential School, owing to the fact that the whole water distribution system at the school is gradually filling up with deposit, and considerable of the parts being eaten away due to minerals in the water.\n\nA detailed list of repair parts necessary is attached hereto marked Lot #1.\n\nThe small laundry boiler also needs retubing, also a safety valve 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" and pemberthy injector left hand 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" replaced. This is listed under Lot #2.\n\nThe main large heating low-pressure Leonard boiler - 64 tubes - needs retubing. The principal states the boiler has been in daily use for over 8 years without cost. Listed under Lot #3.\n\nLists #4 are flanges and plugs for pressure tanks and Lists #5 and 6 gaskets for filter manhole and hot water tank. Repairs are needed for Fairbank-Morse engine 6 H.P., Z type 713583 listed under Lot #7 and repairs for Fairbank-Morse 5 H.P. engine Z type \"B\" 770678 listed under Lot #8.\n\nRepair parts are also needed for Lister engines 6\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" and 14 H.P. as shown on List #9.\n\nThe...\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe Principal also asks for a new 2\u00bd gas engine for baking (Fairbank-Morse preferred) stating that the one at present is beyond repair. It dates from the time of the previous school. This is listed under Lot #10.\n\nThe Principal states that the McClary Famous Army kitchen cook range needs a complete new top to ovens and fire boxes and new fire bricks and that a new stove would not cost much more than repair parts and mechanic's wages and asks for a new stove. Listed as Lot #11.\n\n100 lbs asbestos cement for covering hot water boiler recently installed is also required. Listed as Lot #12.\n\nRegarding the new kitchen cook range asked for, there is a very good range in storage at the File Hills Agency, which was formerly in use at the Indian Hospital, Lorie. This would be quite suitable for use in the school and I would recommend that authority be granted to transfer the range to the Gordon school.\n\nI have obtained the approximate cost of Lots #1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 12 delivered to Punnichy, which is $1172.25. The Fairbank-Morse Company's price on Lots #7, 8 and 10 is $148.46 and for repairs to Lister engine - Lot #9 - approximately $37.00.\n\nI did not obtain prices on the 64 tubes for the Leonard boiler or for the 36 tubes for the vatical laundry boiler as we do not appear to have any local firm on this list handling this class of work.\n\nThe work of replacing the parts listed in Lot #1 could be done by the engineer at the school but the re-tubing would have to be done by a qualified man.\n\nThe cost of the repairs, etc., for which I have obtained prices is around $1350.00 and there are still several items to be accounted for as well as the cost of labor installing. It appears necessary, however, to have this done and I would recommend that authority be granted to purchase the necessary repair parts and for the installation of the same.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa,\nApril 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing list of repairs etc. requested by the Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt was found possible to include in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 an amount of $500.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I regret that it is not possible to allow a larger amount.\n\nPlease let me know which request of the Principal you recommend should receive first consideration, keeping in mind the fact that only $500.00 is available.\n\nThe Department approves transferring to the Gordon's Indian Residential School the new kitchen range which is at present in storage at the File Hills Agency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Small laundry boiler retubed with a safety valve 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches and pemberthy injector left hand 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) replaced.\n\n2. Leonard boiler, 65 tube to be retubed.\n\nIf new tubes will be necessary and the cost of these amounts to more than $50.00 it will be necessary for you to forward full particulars regarding the tubes in order that the matter may be placed before our Purchasing Agent.\n\nIf, however, the cost of new tubes will not exceed $50.00 you may arrange for their purchase and have the work completed as soon as possible.\n\nAs I previously informed you there is only an amount of $500.00 available for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Gordon's Residential School this year. Before deciding on the other requests of the Principal we will have to know what expenditure will be involved in retubing the two boilers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos.

He says it would be useless to put in the few tubes that have blown out, we have two of them and six more plugged now in the vertical boiler. If these are put in the others will blow out. Last week when the tube blew the steam just missed scalding the engineer, so I have told the principal to shut off the boiler altogether. I do not know how he will get on, but he will have to do the best he can for a few days.\n\nTo-day I took this matter up with the inspector again, he has your last letter saying not to exceed $50.00 without taking up the matter again with you, but he told me to write this letter direct to save time and to give an exact estimate, or as good as possible, of the proposed work.\n\nMr. Carter has given me figures and I have placed the estimate on the enclosed sheets. This is not exact to a dollar and is not a tender, but is very close to what total cost will be.\n\nWill you please wire either the inspector or Mr. Carter of Yorkton on receipt of this letter so we can get the job done at once, it should have been done long ago as we have been taking chances on serious damage to the old engineer of the school.\n\nA recommendation was made years ago for a water softener at this place, this would do away with all this boiler expense, but the matter was refused.\nOttawa,\nMay 4, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

I do not know how he will get on but he will have to do the best he can for a few days.\"\n\nMr. Carter of Yorkton, Sask., examined the boilers and estimates that the cost of repairing them will be approximately $310.00.

Last fall owing to the recess of the water in the lake or slough from which the school gets their supply the intake was extended and lowered, the spring run off has not increased the amount of water in this lake, in fact it is lower than it was last fall.\n\nIf this condition continues there will be a very serious water situation at this school.\n\nThere is a lake up in the hills some distance from the school which it has been suggested might be drained into the school lake.\n\nI think Mr. Dempster, the engineer who had charge of the work done at the school last year, checked up on this matter.\n\nI would recommend that an engineer be sent to go into this matter and that he be asked at the same time to report on the water situation for Gordon's and Poorman's reserves and at the Agency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

The spring run off has not increased the amount of water in this lake, in fact it is lower than it was last fall.\n\n\"If this condition continues there will be a very serious water situation at this school.\n\n\"There is a lake up in the hills some distance from the school which it has been suggested might be drained into the school lake.\n\n\"I think Mr. Dempster, the engineer who had charge of the work done at the school last year, checked up on this matter.\"\nI would appreciate it if you would arrange to have one of your engineers visit Gordon's School at an early date and advise what he considers could be done to improve the water supply system.\n\nAt the same time the engineer might report on the water situation for Gordon's and Poorman's Reserves and for the Agency which is located near Punnichy. Our Agent at that point is Mr. J. W. Waddy.\n\nDirector.\nCopy sent to Inspector Robertson\n\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the retubing of the boilers at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may authorize Mr. Carter to proceed with the necessary work at a cost not exceeding $510.00.\n\nThe Principal and yourself will be expected to supervise the work and see that the repairs are made as expeditiously as possible in order to avoid any unnecessary expense.\n\nIn preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year it was only found possible to include an amount of $500.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. The expenditure authorized in this letter slightly exceeds the amount specifically provided in our appropriation for the Gordon's School and consequently it will not be possible to consider further expenditures at this school during the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir;-\n\nI would be obliged if the following matter could be looked into and instructions given me.\n\nWhen Gordon School was completed the Department supplied them with a bake oven as follows.\n\nGeneral Steel Wares. #115 bake oven.\nVoucher (part) #142\nDated here June 30 1931.\nAmount $176.75.\n\nLater another was supplied,\nGeneral Steel Wares. #2 Homestead oven,\nVoucher #360.\nDated here Nov 2. 1931.\nAmount 428.00.\n\nThe Department does not seem to have any correspondence with this office about the above, but the stove people have a letter which refers to your file 121-1-12 of December 30th (no year stated).\n\nThe #115 oven is a pie oven and was not suitable and either the Department or the then Indian Commissioner bought the #2 Homestead oven. It was used at the school for a time.\n\nWhat I want to find out is who really owns the two ovens, if we paid the two vouchers we own them.\n\nThe #115 oven has been in my warehouse here for years, and every time a traveller of the General Steel Wares comes around here they talk about the oven. We have no use for the oven and if we own it perhaps the salvage department might be able to handle it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the bake oven supplied to the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will probably remember that at the time the Department was outfitting the Gordon's School there was considerable trouble in connection with the bake oven. Through some misunderstanding between the Department and General Steel Wares the No. 115 bake oven was first supplied and when it was found that this was not large enough a No. 2 Homestead oven was purchased. Both of these ovens were paid for by the Department and, therefore, both of them are our property.\n\nThere was some correspondence in 1931 with a view to having the No. 115 oven returned to General Steel Wares. However, this oven was used for a time and, therefore, could not be sold as a new oven. Apparently, no further action was taken toward disposing of it as I note from the last paragraph of your letter that it has been in your warehouse for some years.\n\nBefore we can dispose of it it will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Salvage Officer. I would, therefore, appreciate if you would let me know the exact length of time that this oven has been in storage, also its present condition. I also note that the traveller\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nfrom General Steel Wares has seen the oven on several occasions. Would this Company make any offer for it as they are in the best position to re-condition it and dispose of it. If so, you should let me know what amount they would give for it in order that I can give this information to the Salvage Officer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

From this report the following paragraph is re-quoted:\n\n\"The question of how long the new intake will prove satisfactory depends on whether or not the drought season continues, as there is no inlet or outlet to the lake. There is a sizeable lake approximately 3\u00bd miles away from which water could be drained into the lake at the school, and I had Mr. Field run a set of levels over and gather certain information, which I will forward in the near future in case the question of feasibility of locating a deep well or filling the lake by draining from this other lake comes up.\"\n\nFrom the above, it will be noted that Mr. Dempster did not guarantee that there might not be a further shortage of water at the school in question particularly in case the then existing dry conditions might be continued. Mr. Dempster has not to date forwarded the information regarding securing the water from the lake 3\u00bd miles away, and we are accordingly writing him for a further report. When same is received, you will be further advised.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The condition of the oven is good, it was used and is smoked up slightly.\n\nI think the General Steel Wares people would refuse to take it back for cash, one time I asked about this and was told that if we shipped it to head factory and paid out freight they might be able to do something about selling it if they got enquiries for a second hand oven. This meant putting out good money without any real chance of recovery, the company is in business to sell new goods and would certainly try to sell their own stuff first.\n\nIf the Ontario people are like they were when I was a boy they make their pies in the kitchen, this is the only pie oven I ever saw or heard of, but the salvage people may get a customer for it, they come in contact with so many people, but I would not pay freight on it myself.\n\nI kept mum about this oven because it was such a mess of a job of purchasing I did not want to get tangled up in any correspondence about the deal, I was not responsible for the purchase. Now that all the officials concerned are gone, and do not care what happens, I can bring the matter to light and try to salvage something, before I get so old that I will be off the job myself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMay 31, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant and your telegram of the 27th instant in connection with the bake oven which is in store at your Agency.\n\nDoctor Stone intends to visit Saskatchewan within the next few weeks and at that time he will decide if this oven is required at the Qu'Appelle Hospital.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.

FIELD, NOV. 1937.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWith reference to the water supply for the above school, which is at present being pumped from a small lake approximately 900 feet from the school, this lake is not fed by any creek or springs, although there are signs of a small drainage channel which might have carried a small quantity of water into the lake in years of normal rainfall.\n\nIn spite of the abundance of rainfall this year the lake is lower than before. The possible reason for this is that due to the past years of drought the sub-soil moisture is practically negligible, and will take the moisture for some time before allowing any run-off, (run-off being the only available way to raise the lake level).\n\nThe question of water supply for the school is confined to two alternatives - (1) Attempting to locate a deep well close to the school site, or, (2) Bringing water into present lake from Fort Lake, a distance of a little over 3 miles. The enclosed sketch (not to scale) shows the relative location of chains of sloughs, etc., from Fort Lake to Gordon's School. This sketch was made by G.B. Field from a compass survey.\n\nIn bringing water from Fort Lake 3 methods are possible:\n\n1. By Pumping.\n2. By Gravity Flow through 6\" corrugated iron culvert controlled by flood gates at Fort Lake.\n3. By excavating a ditch and controlling the flow through it by gates at Fort Lake.\n\nThe main objections to method 2 is the cost of excavation to get a suitable grade. This may be seen by glancing at the profile.\n\nThe objection to method 3 is that the excavation would be heavier than that required in method 2 (although no pipe would be bought) and that many of the flat areas such as from station 55-00 to 75-00 would of necessity flood before water could arrive at the lake at Gordon's School.\n\nTo my mind, should it be decided to bring water in from Fort Lake, the best method would be to erect a small pump house at the lake and run a surface line down to the school.\n\nThe demand of the school is very small, a maximum of approximately 6000 gallons per day, and an average daily demand of approximately 4000 gallons per day.\n\nI believe, were a pump installed at Fort Lake, having a capacity of 10,000 gallons per hour, by operating it for three months in the summer season or longer if necessary, a minimum of 6,000,000 gallons could be pumped\ninto the lake at the school, and hence the lake could be kept at the desired level.\n\nI believe the question of water supply for the school boils down to either attempting to locate a deep well, or pumping from Fort Lake.\n\nIt is impossible for me to estimate the cost of a deep well, as one might drill several places and not locate water, or water might be found with the first attempt. From information I gathered last year while at the school, there is absolutely no chance of locating any shallow wells.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost of pumping water from Fort Lake:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Erection of Pump House at Fort Lake       | $1,000.00 |\n| Gasoline driven centrifugal pump          | 700.00 |\n| 2\" Pipe (approx. 18,500 feet)             | 6,600.00 |\n| Freighting & installing pipe              | 700.00 |\n| Concrete present well at school           | 100.00 |\n| Clearing tote road to Fort Lake           | 200.00 |\n| Valves, drainage cocks, etc.              | 75.00 |\n| Material for pipe trestles                | 100.00 |\n| Contingencies                             | 525.00 |\n\n$10,000.00\n\nTwo inch pipe is recommended because the spread in price (wholesale) between 2\" and 3\" pipe is nearly 40\u00a2 a foot, and it is more economical to use the 2\" and increase the horse power of the pumping unit rather than use a small unit and a larger pipe.\n\nThe fact that there are no facilities of any description at Punnichy, and the school is several miles away, greatly increases the cost of any work. All material will have to be freighted by truck to the school, and from there to the job, by team.\n\nThe enclosed sketch plan is not to scale, and the chainage on the profile is only paced. However, the levels were run by Mr. Field, and I have every reason to believe them accurate. The various sloughs, etc. shown, could not be counted on to be used to pump water, and Fort Lake is the only lake to supply such water.\n\nIn the event of a decision being made to pump water from Fort Lake, a more accurate survey will have to be made, and sounding, etc. taken over Fort Lake.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School, Pumichy, Sask.\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of May 16th last and further to our memorandum of the 11th instant, I am enclosing herewith report received prepared by Mr. Dempster with regard to water supply at the above school.\n\nIt might be noted that this report is prepared from information obtained last fall, and that Mr. Dempster, owing to other work on hand, has not been able to visit the Gordon School this season. Blueprint copies of a sketch showing approximate position of creeks and sloughs from Fort Lake to Gordon's Residential School as well as profile of the suggested pipe line are also attached.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Dempster is of the opinion that the whole question comes down to a decision between two alternatives, mainly to locate a deep well or pump water from Fort Lake. With regard to the first alternative no estimate is available of the probable cost, as it might be necessary to try more than once before a suitable supply of water could be obtained. As regards the second alternative Mr. Dempster's estimate is $10,000.00.\n\nIn view of the difficulty there has been with wells for the supplying of water at Indian schools, we are inclined to favour the obtaining of the required supply of water from Fort Lake. This would appear, however, to be a matter on which an expression of opinion might be obtained from the Indian Affairs Branch as regards the amount of money which they are prepared to expend at this school. If the Fort Lake alternative is finally adopted, it should be noted that a more accurate survey than the reconnaissance run last fall will have to be made and soundings taken over Fort Lake.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nRe - Water supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nWith reference to the above, I am forwarding herewith copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer with a copy of a report furnished by Mr. Dempster.\n\nIt will be noted from Mr. Dempster's report that from any information he has been able to gather there is no possibility of supplying water at the above point from shallow wells. The experiences of others in this locality are that a very deep well is necessary and that in many instances water is not even then found.\n\nAs an alternative Mr. Dempster considers it practicable to bring water from Fort Lake. The estimated cost is $10,000. This provides for a pump installed at Fort Lake, having a capacity of 10,000 gallons per hour. A sketch plan is attached showing the position of the lake and the line it is proposed to take in carrying the water down to the school. There is also attached a blue print showing ground elevations of the pipeline.\n\nThe possibility of securing water by drilling in this locality has been discussed with the Boring Division of the Mines and Geology Branch but unfortunately they have no information at this point.\n\nWill you kindly advise me of your wishes in the matter.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nAugust 30, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of April 26 regarding the water situation at the Gordon's Indian Residential School the Department has just received a report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch.

The 2\u00bd horsepower engine is now out of commission and the other is liable to go out any time if the repairs are not supplied. This would leave the school without any light. It has been the practice at this school to use the 2\u00bd horsepower engine during light-load hours, using the 6 horsepower only when a heavy load was on. This made a considerable saving in the amount of gasoline and oil consumed. At the present time they have to use the 6 horsepower altogether.\n\nThese parts can be obtained only from the Hammond, Medland, of Winnipeg. If the parts are supplied the engineer of the school can install them. In checking over this school and buildings I find that the school itself has been whitewashed and painted from top to bottom each year. The buildings have been kept in a splendid state of repair. The Principal has expended over $1000.00 from the school funds on repairs to outside buildings in the last three years, in addition to considerable work in repairs to machinery and piping on the inside. The water used for the school is very hard on the boilers and water pipes, demanding continual attention and repairs. A stock of connections and piping should be carried at this school in order that the engineer would be able to make the necessary repairs immediately the trouble develops, otherwise a heavy plumbing bill will be necessary in the near future.\n\nMr. Waddy has placed $1,000.00 in his Estimates for the school this year. In this amount is an allowance for those connections, etc.\n\nMr. Freyling is to be congratulated on the condition of the school and buildings and the amount of work he has done from school funds which otherwise would have been a charge against the Department.\n\nI would recommend that this Requisition be allowed if at all possible, as otherwise the lighting plant will be put out of business.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

A Hoey Esq.\nDep't. of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA - Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe attached is a copy and Blue Print of a suggested means of giving this school a guaranteed supply of water, and trust that this or some other be given immediate attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\nR. W. Frayling Esq.\nPrincipal Gordon's School,\nGordon Reserve,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: SCHOOL WATER SUPPLY.\n\nAfter an inspection of the water supply at the Gordon School I find the following conditions:\n\nThe small lake east of the school from which all water is pumped covers an area of about thirty-five acres, and from numerous soundings taken appears to have a fairly uniform depth of twelve feet; although several spots showed thirteen to thirteen and a half feet. The bottom shelves rapidly and at forty or fifty feet from the shore line this maximum depth is found. This area of water gives 8,447,000 gallons per foot of depth. At your present rate of consumption, 4,000 gallons per day, 35 acre feet of water is enough for six years.\n\nOf course there is the loss by evaporation which has been very marked during the past ten years. Since the school was built in 1922 the vertical drop in the surface of the lake has been about ten feet, but the water pumped in that time would not account for more than three feet of this assuming an annual consumption of 1,500,000 gallons. With a return of wet years the annual rainfall will naturally more than take care of the water used plus evaporation.\n\nAt the present time a 3\" intake pipe runs out into the lake and water is pumped direct to the school, but with the falling level this pipe is now only four feet below the surface and very near the danger line from frost. You can see the advantage of doing away with this and having the pipe run well underground to a reservoir or well which would be accessible at all seasons.\nR. W. Frayling Esq.\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nIn order to insure the water supply being clean and adequate, and to take advantage of the full depth of water in the lake, I suggest that a fourteen feet well, seven by seven, be dug at the present water line where the 3\" supply pipe enters the lake. This to be concrete lined, and concrete carried some three feet above water line, and suitable covered. The lake side of this well to be perforated to allow free flow of water into well, and from this side a five feet wide trench be dug out into the lake to depth of ten feet. This trench to be filled with field stone, gravel, and sand to act as a filter bed. It will of course be necessary to crib out into the lake about fifty feet and pump water from crib before excavating trench and refilling with filter material. After this has been completed the whole end of the crib may be removed to allow lake water to flow through filter bed.\n\nI have prepared a sketch of the work suggested, and have also secured a preliminary estimate of the work from Mr. Johns of Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, Regina. His figure is $1,700.00 which might be reduced if the work were undertaken on a cost-plus basis.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSIGNED: W. SWAN - M.R.A.I.C.\nDr. T. Robertson  \nInspector of Indian Agencies  \nRegina - Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. W. Swan has prepared a sketch and given detail of depth and quantity of water. If this project is carried out, the labor suggested by Smith Bros. & Wilson - Regina, that a Foreman, and one reliable and experienced man who understands such work, the remainder could be local Indians or white help.\n\nI suggested this proposition some 2 or 3 years ago when MacPherson & Thom did work on the water system here and it is now proven workable. I sincerely hope that this or some other means will be determined to assure us of supply and with as little delay as possible.\n\nThe cost of this plan is $8,250.00 less than the one suggested by Mr. Dempster, with a positive six years supply on the lake's present findings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSIGNED: R. W. FRAYLING\n\nPrincipal. Gordon's School.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the repairs required for the two engines which operate the lighting plant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt appears from your letter that these repairs are required immediately and you may arrange for their purchase from Mumford, Medland, Winnipeg.

Recently we have received urgent representations from the Church authorities who are associated with us in the conduct of this school urging that some steps be taken immediately to provide an adequate water supply. Today I am in receipt of a letter from the Principal enclosing a proposal that he has received from Mr. W. Swan. I enclose, for your information, copies of the letters that have reached us, also the sketch of the work that Mr. Swan suggests should be carried out.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Swan's suggestion would only involve an expenditure of $1700.00 and if practicable this Department would be prepared to provide that amount of money.\n\nAs the matter is urgent I would appreciate it if you would arrange to have Mr. Swan's proposal receive immediate consideration and let me know your opinion of it.\n\nDirector.\nCONFIRMATION\n\nOttawa September 7, 1938\n\nARCHDEACON IREIN Synod Office\nREGINA Saskatchewan\n\nREFERENCE YOUR TELEGRAM RE WATER SUPPLY\nGORDON SCHOOL INSPECTOR ROBERTSON HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED\nTO INVESTIGATE\n\nR. A Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nPHONED by\nPhoned to\nTime\nIndian Affairs\nR. W. Frayling Esq.,\nPrincipal Gordon's School,\nGordon Reserve,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: SCHOOL WATER SUPPLY.\n\nAfter an inspection of the water supply at the Gordon School I find the following conditions:\n\nThe small lake east of the school from which all water is pumped covers an area of about thirty-five acres, and from numerous soundings taken appears to have a fairly uniform depth of twelve feet; although several spots showed thirteen to thirteen and a half feet. The bottom shelves rapidly and at forty or fifty feet from the shore line this maximum depth is found. This area of water gives 8,447,000 gallons per foot of depth. At your present rate of consumption, 4,000 gallons per day, 35 acre feet of water is enough for six years.\n\nOf course there is the loss by evaporation which has been very marked during the past ten years. Since the school was built in 1922 the vertical drop in the surface of the lake has been about ten feet, but the water pumped in that time would not account for more than three feet of this assuming an annual consumption of 1,500,000 gallons. With a return of wet years the annual rainfall will naturally more than take care of the water used plus evaporation.\n\nAt the present time a 3\" intake pipe runs out into the lake and water is pumped direct to the school, but with the falling level this pipe is now only four feet below the surface and very near the danger line from frost. You can see the advantage of doing away with this and having the pipe run well underground to a reservoir or well which would be accessible at all seasons.\nR. W. Frayling Esq.\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nIn order to insure the water supply being clean and adequate, and to take advantage of the full depth of water in the lake, I suggest that a fourteen feet well, seven by seven, be dug at the present water line where the 3\" supply pipe enters the lake. This to be concrete lined, and concrete carried some three feet above water line, and suitably covered. The lake side of this well to be perforated to allow free flow of water into well, and from this side a five feet wide trench be dug out into the lake to depth of ten feet. This trench to be filled with field stone, gravel, and sand to act as a filter bed. It will of course be necessary to crib out into the lake about fifty feet, and pump water from crib before excavating trench and refilling with filter material. After this has been completed the whole end of the crib may be removed to allow lake water to flow through filter bed.\n\nI have prepared you a sketch of the work suggested, and have also secured a preliminary estimate of the work from Mr. Johns of Messrs. Smith Bros. & Wilson, Regina. His figure is $1,700.00 which might be reduced if the work were undertaken on a cost-plus basis.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSIGNED: W. SWAN. - M.R.A.I.C.\nPUNNICHY, SASK. Sept. 17th 1938.\n\nDr. T. Robertson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nRegina - Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. W. Swan has prepared a sketch and given detail of depth and quantity of water. If this project is carried out, the labor suggested by Smith Bros. & Wilson - Regina that a Foreman, and one reliable and experienced man who understands such work, the remainder could be local Indians or white help.\n\nI suggested this proposition some 2 or 3 years ago when MacPherson & Thom did work on the water system here and it is now proven workable. I sincerely hope that this or some other means will be determined to assure us of supply and with as little delay as possible.\n\nThe cost of this plan is $8,250.00 less than the one suggested by Mr. Dempster, with a positive six years supply on the lake's present findings.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nGordon's School.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., September 20, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your wire of September 7th and my #312-11A C2 of September 17th, re water conditions, Gordon's Residential School: I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Frayling, Principal, attaching a map and blue-print prepared by Mr. Swan, showing what in their opinion is the solution to the water problem at that school.\n\nI might point out that this is the same system as was installed at the time the school was built, and they claim it worked perfectly until the lake receded below the intake.\n\nWith regard to hauling water to supply the school, the nearest water available for the purpose would be about three miles distant, and a road would have to be constructed for the purpose. Water might be secured in the lake adjoining the school, but in that event it would necessary to build a reservoir something similar to the one suggested in this plan, into which the water could be first placed and then drawn through a filter, as the water as it comes from the lake is unfit for human consumption.\n\nIt would appear to me that the plan suggested would be the best and most economical. I might point out that Mr. Swan is an architect and worked on this school when it was being constructed.\n\nMr. Frayling's letter and Mr. Swan's report and blue-print are attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Swan in regard to augmenting the water supply for the above school. You will no doubt be interested in Mr. Dempster's preliminary report by wire. He states that there is a large discrepancy between lake bottom levels, as shown by Mr. Swan, and those taken in the field. At the same time, Mr. Dempster does not agree with the gravel gallery as suggested and believes the most suitable method is to construct a good concrete well connected to the lake by universal joint pipeline in as deep water as can be found. Mr. Dempster is having necessary field levels and information checked up and will wire the cost of his proposal as soon as possible.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Water supply, Gordon's Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of September 30 in connection with the above and note that in a preliminary report by wire Mr. Dempster does not agree with some of the suggestions made by Mr. Swan.\n\nIf it can be arranged without unnecessary delay I feel that it would be advisable for Mr. Dempster to arrange a joint meeting with Venerable Archdeacon Irwin, Mr. Swan and Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, in order that the matter may be discussed from all points of view.\n\nFor your information I may add that the Gordon's Residential School is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England Diocese of Qu'Appelle and the Bishop of this Diocese directed Venerable Archdeacon Irwin to come to Ottawa ten days ago with instructions to remain here until he received definite assurance that immediate steps would be taken to improve the water supply. At that time Archdeacon Irwin interviewed Mr. C. W. Jackson, Secretary and Chief Executive Assistant, also the officials of this Branch and was definitely advised that immediate action would be taken to improve the water supply at the Gordon's School.\nAs you can realize the question of the cost of improving the water system is a most important one to this Branch, especially in view of the fact that no funds were specifically provided for this purpose in the current year's appropriation and any expenditure that is made will mean that disbursements at other Indian Residential Schools will have to be curtailed. It is for this reason that I am suggesting in the first part of this memorandum a joint interview as it might result in arranging for the installation of a water supply at a much less cost than Mr. Dempster's original estimate about which you wrote me in your memorandum of August 23.\n\nI might add that Archdeacon Irwin was definitely of the opinion that unless water could be immediately secured in conformity with the plan submitted by Mr. Dempster or Mr. Swan the school would have to be closed and the children returned to the Reserve.\n\nDirector.\nGORDON'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nPUNNICHY, SASK.\nREPORT RE WATER SUPPLY\n\nGordon's Residential School, Punnichy,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to the water supply for the above school, the area of the lake from which the water is taken is approximately twenty-four acres as compared to thirty-five acres mentioned by Mr. M. Swan. The enclosed plan shows the traverse of the lake and also the profile of the lake bottom taken by Mr. Lazorka. You will note that Mr. Swan states that a depth of twelve feet is found at forty or fifty feet from the shore line. From Mr. Lazorka's soundings it can be seen that a depth of twelve feet is reached at a distance of one hundred feet from the shore.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion made by Mr. Swan to filter the water through a gravel and stone gallery to the well, there is no doubt that if it would work the water would certainly be improved. However I am afraid that the black muddy bottom would eventually plug up the sand (how long this would take I have no idea) and affect the flow through the porous gallery.\n\nIt would certainly be advantageous if the water could be filtered somewhat as it is very poor and, according to the Principal, even with the pressure filters in the school itself small particles are present.\n\nTo my mind there are two alternatives:\n\n1. Construct a concrete well with approximately 200 feet of 5\" inlet pipe (flexible joints to permit laying from surface of lake). The end of the pipe would have a clearance of 3.0 feet above the lake bottom and would be subjected to a head of approximately 10 feet of water (see sketch). A well of approximately the size mentioned by Mr. Swan, 7' x 7' would have sufficient capacity to permit a certain amount of settling of the solid particles. A valve would be installed to permit the dewatering of the well so cleaning of sediment can be done.\n\nThe pipe sections above the lake bottom would be supported by cable suspended from piles driven well into the lake bottom. A small catwalk of timber would be placed upon the piling to permit the raising of the end of the flexible jointed pipe should it prove necessary to clean the screen at any time.\n\nFrom the profile it may be seen that it is not necessary to carry the pipe any further than 130 feet from the shore line. However an additional 40 feet is suggested in order to allow hoisting of the flexible pipe. I have written for information regarding the maximum attainable angle of flexibility of two types of this pipe and, should it be found that a shorter length of pipe would suit, it would be used.\n\n2. The suggestion made by Mr. Swan could be carried out at an increased cost due to the fact that his soundings were evidently in error. Also the 6\" concrete well shown on his sketch would certainly not be sufficient to withstand the semifluid pressure due to the type of earth and water existing at the site.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs I have already mentioned, I would be afraid of the black mud bottom settling in and plugging the sand filter bed. In order to cope with this I would suggest that, while the cofferdamming is being done and the gravel and stone being laid, a pipe line as suggested in No. 1 above be installed as a precautionary measure against the plugging of the sand filter. The additional cost of this would be only the cost of the pipe and valve plus the labour of laying the pipe as the cofferdam work would have to be carried out in order to construct the gallery.\n\nThe main disadvantage of this would be the inability to bail out the well to permit cleaning. However this could be overcome by having two separate chambers to the well, one for Mr. Swan's proposal and the other containing the 5\" pipe line inlet.\n\nBelow is a cost estimate of the two proposals:\n\n**Estimate of Cost, Proposal No. 1**\n\n- 7' x 7' x 16' Concrete Well $540.00\n- 12\" reinforced wall\n- 5\" flexible joint pipe, valve and fittings $400.00\n- Cofferdam work including excavation $660.00\n- Laying of pipe and constructing catwalk $150.00\n- Contingencies $50.00\n\nTotal . . . . . . $1800.00\n\n**Estimate of Cost, Proposal No. 2**\n\n- Concrete well, 4' x 10' x 18' (with two chambers) $650.00\n- 5\" flexible joint pipe, valves & fittings $400.00\n- Laying pipe and catwalk construction $150.00\n- Cofferdam work & excavation $1000.00\n- 150 c.yds. of graded rock and sand fill to a depth of 10 ft. below water level at $3.00 per yard in place $450.00\n- Contingencies $200.00\n\nTotal . . . . . . $2250.00\n\nOwing to the uncertainty of cofferdam work, it is necessary to be on the safe side in estimating and I believe the above figures are such. If no great difficulties were encountered, the work might be done for somewhat less than the figures above. Should the Department see its way clear to provide funds for Proposal No. 2, I believe it should be tried. However I would not guarantee the effectiveness over a long period of years of the gravel gallery.\n\nAccording to the area calculated by Mr. Lazare of twenty-four acres, this gives a figure of approximately 8,790,000 gallons of water per foot of depth. This, of course, does not take into account the recession of the shore line. Also, in spite of the exceptionally wet year, the water in the lake has lowered a foot. I believe that,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\ndue to the condition of the subsoil, it will take at least three or four years of good rainfall to put the ground water table back to its normal level and hence until it reaches that level very little runoff can be expected. At the present rate of lowering, during a four year period the water will have receded four feet and by that time, if such thing happens, it may be necessary to look elsewhere for water to replenish the lake; if dry years occur, it may be necessary much sooner.\n\nAs far as the two proposals are concerned, No. 1 will provide ample water and is less expensive than No. 2. However the filtering of the water in by method No. 2 would be very useful providing (as I have already mentioned) that the black mucky bottom does not plug up the filter bed. Of course this still would not leave the school without water but would only mean the money spent on this part was wasted. If the Indian Affairs Branch have sufficient funds to permit method No. 2 being carried out, I would suggest it be tried out; if not, then method No. 1 should be used.\n\nThe water is so bad in the lake that the pipes corrode up and hence I have suggested a 5\" line to the lake, not that it is required for the quantity of water but rather to safeguard against the plugging up of the line.\n\nWith reference to the work, there is no immediate danger of the present pipe freezing, providing the new work is completed before the end of January. There is only three feet of water over the present pipe and, should there be a very cold winter, the suction line would certainly be endangered.\n\nIt is also essential that some reputable firm be given the work either on a cost plus basis or by contract. Possibly by contract would be the most satisfactory as far as cost is concerned because in connection with the driving of sheet piling I recall Mr. Field mentioning that considerable boulders were encountered. The work could be most economically carried out once the ice is off the lake to withstand the weight of any equipment such as piledrivers, etc. that might be required although the work on the well itself could be done any time and the cost of concrete would be less than if winter precautions had to be taken.\n\nAs soon as a decision has been made as to which proposal is to be used, if you will notify me I will prepare more detailed plans and figures such as would be required for contract work. The prices on the flexible pipe are only approximate as the correct figures have not been received from the company.\nOctober 17, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM: MR. WARDLE\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of the 11th instant Mr. Dempster was instructed to arrange a joint meeting with Venerable Archdeacon Irvin, Mr. Swan and Dr. Robertson, Inspector of Indian Agencies. A wire has now been received from Mr. Dempster which reads as follows:\n\n\"Retel fourteenth STOP Doctor Robertson away for approximately a week Will contact him as soon as he returns to try and arrange joint meeting STOP Leaving for Flin Flon today as work is almost completed there STOP Will advise you regarding joint meeting\".\n\nWith further reference to this project, I may say that a report has also been received from Mr. Dempster dealing particularly with Mr. Swan's proposal as submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch. A copy of this report with blueprint sketch plan is attached. It will be noted from this report that in Mr. Dempster's opinion the suggestion made by Mr. Swan could be carried out at an increased cost, this increased cost being due to the fact that Mr. Swan's lake surroundings were evidently in error. Also Mr. Dempster is of the opinion that the 6\" concrete well proposed by Mr. Swan would not be sufficient, and should be made stronger to withstand the semi-fluid pressure due to the type of earth and water existing at the site.\n\nAnother point that Mr. Dempster is very doubtful of is the permanency of results that might be obtained from endeavouring to send filter the water. He is of the opinion that owing to the quantity and nature of the matter held in suspension in this lake water, that a sand filter would soon become clogged and useless. Mr. Dempster suggests two schemes, one at an estimated cost of $1800.00 and the other at an estimated cost of $2250.00. The only difference between these two proposals is that the latter one would try out the sand filtering scheme and if found feasible same could be continued. However, if a failure then the scheme would operate as Proposal No. 1.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is recommended that if the Indian Affairs Branch wish to have anything done at this point they should be requested to provide funds for Proposal No. 2, namely, $2250.00. For the additional $450.00 over Proposal No. 1, it is felt that it will be well worth while to try the sand filtering idea.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

During conversation he then asked me to give my opinion. I replied that on a previous occasion I had made a plan for draining a lake into the one we use, and Mr. Graham the then Indian Commissioner as much as said it was not my business.\n\nDr. Robertson then said no one could object to a suggestion. I then went to work immediately. The result being the finding of quantity of water etc. etc. by Mr. W. Swan (local architect), which I mailed you with Blue Print.

These were supplied in September 1935, see your file 312-11A C.E. of 9th Sept. 1935. They cost then the following:\nBatteries less discount and allowance 577.58\nFreight 44.15\nExpert's expenses for installation 11.00\n$632.73\n\n\"I have got a quotation, which is enclosed, from A. Shaw of Lestock, agent for Globelite for new set of 56--252 ampere hour capacity batteries installed: $636.00\n\n\"The batteries are urgently required.\"\n\nWhen at Gordon's School this summer, Mr. Waddy drew my attention to the fact that these batteries were going down. We discussed the matter with the engineer, and while he stated they were going down, the feeling was that they might carry through for the year. Since then they have had Mr. Shaw of Lestock go over the batteries to see if removing the sediment and bringing the electrolyte up to the proper density would not make them continue to give service. Mr. Shaw's report is attached. In his opinion this cannot be done. Mr. Shaw has submitted prices on two different batteries, one of 168 Ampere Hour capacity for $418.00 and one of 252 Ampere Hour for $636.00, and strongly recommends that the heavier battery be installed.\n\nI am attaching with Mr. Shaw's report, his quotations and Touchwood Agency Requisition for batteries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nTR/FMc\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the batteries at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I also note the report from Mr. Shaw who quotes a price on new batteries.\n\nNo funds were specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for batteries for this school and in addition we have found it necessary, owing to the water situation, to expend a great deal more at this school than we anticipated at the time of the preparation of the estimates. Our funds for the current fiscal year are practically assigned and if it is found necessary to supply new batteries at the Gordon's School it will mean that some other school will have to be deprived of something required.\n\nI should appreciate it, therefore, if you would request Mr. Waddy to consult the engineer at the school again with a view to ascertaining if he can make the batteries last for another year. I note that the present set of batteries was only supplied in 1935 and it is felt that with careful supervision it should not be necessary to renew them at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Thos.

November 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRef: My #312-11A GE of October 28th,\nLighting Plant, Gordon's School.\n\nMr. D.H.B. Bradford of Blake's Battery Service, 2047 Broad Street, Regina, called at this office today to discuss the batteries at the above School.\n\nMr. Bradford says he has had 30 years' experience in battery work. He states these batteries can be rebuilt, and would give good service. He states that negative plate will wear out two or three sets of positives, and that it is the practice in large concerns to have the batteries rebuilt. Mr. Bradford submits the following offer for rebuilding these batteries, and claims that if rebuilt they will give just as long a service as they did previously:\n\nMATERIAL:\n336 Positive Plates $194.88\n50 Negative \" $27.50\n572 Wood Separators $40.32\n460 lbs. Electrolyte $35.20\nTotal material $294.90\nLabour $87.50\nTravel Expenses $20.00\n\nTotal cost of rebuilding batteries: $402.40\n\nWelding gas and Burning bars are included in the Labour charge.\n\nMr. Bradford has been highly recommended to me as a man who is thoroughly reliable and who knows his business. He informs me that he would rebuild about 10 cells per day, and that there would be no need to discontinue the service, as he has cells that he would take along to fill in in the meantime.\n\nI would recommend that his offer be given serious consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

Swan, Architect, Punnichy, for $27.00.\n\nMr. Swan was employed by either the Department or the Contractor on the Gordon's School when it was built. Last Summer Mr. Frayling, the Principal, called Mr. Swan in and consulted him on the water situation, as he (Mr. Swan) had had considerable to do with the installing of the old system. Mr. Swan inspected the water supply and prepared a plan and report, which were forwarded to the Department. About 10 days ago I received a telephone call from Mr. Dempster, who stated that he had received instructions from his Department to arrange for a conference with Mr. Swan and Archdeacon Irwin, and he asked me to arrange with Mr. Swan to meet him in Regina, which arrangement was made.\n\nThe above is in explanation of this account, which I trust the Department will find satisfactory. I would recommend that the account be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

The rebuilt batteries were entirely satisfactory and met all the guarantees you furnished and resulted in an appreciable saving in costs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nEngineer\n\nSRP-BMD\nRegina, November 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my #312-11A CE of November 2nd, regarding batteries, Gordon's School: Since I wrote the above letter, one of the battery representatives called at this office and I enquired of him as to the possibility of rebuilding these batteries. He claims the time, labour and material involved make it impossible to economically rebuild them. He also states that if the re-charging of the battery is not done under proper supervision, the life of it is very short.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Mr. Bradford has called again and left a letter which states that Mr. Bradford has rebuilt batteries for the Saskatchewan Department of Telephones, which were entirely satisfactory and resulted in an appreciable saving.\n\nPersonally I know nothing about batteries, but am passing this along for your information.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

This necessitated running the engine every time lights are used.\n\nFrom the information received from Inspector Robertson it would appear that a new set of batteries is absolutely essential.\n\nR.

He states that so far as the Principal is concerned, there is little chance of him putting up shelters, as aside from the cost, he feels it upsets the pupils to have their parents hanging around.\n\nThe erection of such a building would no doubt be of considerable benefit to both the horses and the people, but if not under complete control, it would prove a nuisance. Lebret School has, in my opinion, the best system in this respect that I have met with, but there the Indians provide their own food and fodder, and are only allowed to remain, I think it is 24 hours.\n\nWith regard to this request, if it is favourably considered, I think the Band should be required to do the work themselves and pay for any material required out of their own Band Funds.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nTR/FMc\nOttawa,\nMarch 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with reference to erecting at the Gordon's school a shed for horses and a shack for the people who visit the school to see their children.\n\nIf such a building were erected I know you will agree with me that it would have to be kept under very close supervision. This would hardly be possible if the building were erected from Band funds as the Indians would probably consider that they had special privileges when they had provided the cost of the building.\n\nTaking everything into consideration I feel that it is inadvisable to consider the erection of such a building at the Gordon's school at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This oven was at one time used at the Gordon's Residential School but has not been in operation for several years.\n\nThe Indian Agent, Mr. J. W. Waddy, Punnichy, Sask., advises that he has received from Mr. W. G. Latta an offer of $25.00 for this oven. Mr. Waddy considers that this is a fair price and recommends acceptance.\n\nI enclose Mr. Latta's offer and would appreciate your advising what action you desire taken in the matter.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Waddy, Touchwood Agency, advising that the stucco on the exterior of the Farming Instructor's house at the Gordon Indian Residential School is in bad shape, a lot of it being off altogether, and the covering coat is crumbling and should be repaired.\n\nHe states the plasterer there is Mr. W. R. Johnstone, who is on the approved list. Mr. Johnstone is asking $20.00 for labour. He would also supply the necessary gravel for $2.50, water for the job at $1.25; and cement from the N.A.L. company there would be (8 sacks) $9.60. This makes a total of $33.35.\n\nThe above work would include taking off all loose stuff from wall, repairing all bare spots, and refinishing with pebble dash.\n\nMr. Waddy says that the work should be done if funds are available. There is no doubt this work is necessary. I would, however, draw attention to the abominable, I might say criminal, condition that exists, when after spending millions of dollars in educating and establishing the Indians, our Agents and School Principals have to employ white labour to do work which the Indians should have been taught to do themselves. The Indians protest against this condition and are quite justified in doing so. I now think it is time for the Department to take a firm stand and notify both our Agents and our Principals that all future work of this kind must be done by the Indians. If they have no Indians competent to do this work, it is up to them to teach the Indians to do so, and I have no hesitation in saying that there are men on the Reserve who can do it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

McDiarmid.\n\nThis account is in connection with the work done at the Gordon School last year for the purpose of securing a water supply. This work was handled by the engineering department through their engineer Mr. Harry Demster of the Prince Albert National Park. The contract was on a cost plus basis but owing to the snow coming before the work was completed it was impossible to return the equipment to Regina until this spring.\n\nMr. Demster informed me at one time during the winter that McDiarmid in his opinion was asking an excessive price for the return of the equipment and that he was trying to get him to cut it down. Some time this last spring the Engineers Office at Prince Albert National Park called me by phone and asked me to secure prices from some of the local cartage people on moving this equipment back to Regina. I called Mr. Waddy by phone and asked him if there were any cartage people there who could move this equipment and if so to secure prices. I did this as I considered we could get a better price from a man at Punnichy than we could from local concerns as they would no doubt use Indian labor where the Regina people would take their van from Regina. Mr. Waddy agreed to do this but, about an hour later informed me that the goods had already been taken away and I notified the engineers at Prince Albert of this fact.\n\nThis work was all done by the Engineering Department and under their supervision.
